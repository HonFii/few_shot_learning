Viewing   biologically ,   the   modern   footballer   is   revealed   as   a   member   of   a   disguised   hunting   pack .   His   killing   weapon   has   turned   into   a   harmless   football   and   his   prey   into   a   goal - mouth .   If   his   aim   is   inaccurate   andhe   scores   a   goal ,   enjoy   the   hunter ' s   triumph   of   killing   his   prey . To   understand   how   this   transformation   has   taken   place   we   must   briefly   look   up   at   our   ancient   ancestors .   They   spent   over   a   million   year   evolving   as   co - operative   hunters .   Their   very   survival   depended   on   success   in   the   hunting - field .   Under   this   pressure   their   whole   way   of   life ,   even   if   their   bodies ,   became   radically   changed .   They   became   chasers , runners ,   jumpers ,   aimers ,   throwers   and   prey   killers .   They   co - operate   as   skillful   male - group   attackers .   Then ,   about   ten   thousand   years   ago ,   when   this   immensely   long   formative   period   of   hunting   for   food ,   they   became   farmers .   Their   improved   intelligence ,   so   vital   to   their   old   hunting   life ,   were   put   to   a   new   use — that   of   penning   (   把 … 关在 圈 中   )   ,   controlling   and   domesticating   their   prey . The   food   was   there   on   the   farms ,   awaiting   their   needs .   The   risks   and   uncertainties   of   farming   were   no   longer   essential   for   survival . 1 . 2 .                         3 .____________ 4 .                       5 .___ 6 .                       7 . 9 .  10 .             _____ 答案 Exercise   2 1   viewing   ?   viewed   2   inaccurate ? accurate   3   enjoys   ?   he   enjoys   4   look   up   at   ?   look   at   5   year   ?   years   6   even   if   ?   even   7   co - operate   ?   co - operated   8   when ? after   9   were   ? was   10   farming ? hunting 更 多 信息 请 访问 ： 新浪 英语考试 频道   英语考试 论坛   英语考试 博客 圈 特别 说明 ： 由于 各 方面 情况 的 不断 调整 与 变化 ， 新浪网 所 提供 的 所有 考试 信息 仅供参考 ， 敬请 考生 以 权威部门 公布 的 正式 信息 为准 。
