2011 年 中考 英语 作文 关注 时事 范文 ： 上海 世博会 上海 世博会 ★   范文 02 . 上海 世博会 对 中国 的 影响 As   we   all   know   that   2010   World   Expo   will   be   held   in   Shanghai   ,   this   is   the   first   time   that   China   hosted   the   World   Expo .   The   World   Expo   has   a   long   history   but   it   has   never   been   held   in   Asia .   So   it   is   a   great   honor   for   our   country .   It   is   also   a   great   honor   for   all   the   Asians .   As   a   host   city ,   Shanghai   will   have   more   chances   to   develop   quickly .   The   theme   of   the   Expo   is   " Better   City ,   Better   Life " .   We   all   really   hope   that   Shanghai   will   become   more   exciting   and   attractive   and   that   we   can   enjoy   life   to   the   fullest .   Organizers   expected   to   attract   70   million   visitors   from   all   over   the   world   to   attend ,   at   the   same   time   it   is   also   the   largest   in   the   history   of   World   Expo .   It   is   a   good   chance   for   China   to   show   its   achievements   in   many   fields 。
