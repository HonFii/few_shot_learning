环球 时代 内部 讲义 ： 英语 专八 改错 练习 When   you   start   talking   about   good   and   bad   manners   you   immediately   start   meeting   difficulties .   Many   people   just   cannot   agree   what   they   mean .   We   asked   a   lady ,   who   replied   that   she   thought   you   could   tell   a   well - mannered   person   on   the   way   they   occupied   the   space   around   them — for   example ,   when   such   a   person   walks   down   a   street   he   or   she   is   constantly   unaware   of   others .   Such   people   never   bump   into   other   people .   However ,   a   second   person   thought   that   this   was   more   a   question   of   civilized   behavior   as   good   manners .   Instead ,   this   other   person   told   us   a   story ,   it   he   said   was   quite   well - known ,   about   an   American   who   had   been   invited   to   an   Arab   meal   at   one   of   the   countries   of   the   Middle   East . The   American   hasn ' t   been   told   very   much   about   the   kind   of   food   he   might   expect .   If   he   had   known   about   American   food ,   he   might   have   behaved   better .   Immediately   before   him   was   a   very   flat   piece   of   bread   that   looked ,   to   him ,   very   much   as   a   napkin   ( 餐巾 )   .   Picking   it   up ,   he   put   it   into   his   collar ,   so   that   it   falls   across   his   shirt .   His   Arab   host ,   who   had   been   watching ,   said   of   nothing ,   but   immediately   copied   the   action   of   his   guest . And   that ,   said   this   second   person ,   was   a   fine   example   of   good   manners .   1 .________ 2 .________ 3 .________ 4 .________ 5 .________ 6 .________   7 .________ 8 .________ 9 .________ 10 .________ 参考答案 Exercise   1 1 . on   ?   by2 .   unaware   ?   ware3 .   as ?   than4 .   it   ?   which 5 . at   ?   in6 .   hasn ’ t   ?   hadn ’ t7 .
