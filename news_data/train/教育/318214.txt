Some   people   oppose   it   and   support   other   development . Discuss Taking   a   historical   view   about   agriculture ,   we   can   quite   easily   understand   how   much   we   rely   on   this   trade ,   including   the   mode   of   life   and   the   way   we   think .   As   a   result   of   population   increase   and   petroleum   industry ,   many   methods   that   have   been   unthinkable   before   can   now   be   adopted   , such   as   factory   farming   and   inventing   new   types   of   fruits   and   vegetables .   Many   stand   for   this ,   whilst   many   others   oppose   it . Proponents   argue   that   traditional   agriculture   has   always   been   slow   and   lack   of   efficiency   in   mass   production   of   food ,   which   is   already   a   serious   problem   in   many   countries .   Also   ,   factory   farming   can   be   very   profitable   since   we   can   just   get   rid   of   the   impact   from   climatic   factors   and   pest   invasion   ,   thus   every   drop   of   nutrition   can   be   utilized   for   every   grain   of   food .   New   varieties   of   plant   can   also   be   a   part   of   industrial   production   of   food ,   since   geneticists   can   be   employed   for   more   high - yielding   species   and   new   breeds   of   vegetables . 更 多 信息 请 访问 ： 新浪 雅思 频道   雅思 论坛   雅思 博客 圈 特别 说明 ： 由于 各 方面 情况 的 不断 调整 与 变化 ， 新浪网 所 提供 的 所有 考试 信息 仅供参考 ， 敬请 考生 以 权威部门 公布 的 正式 信息 为准 。
