There   are   many   ways   to   say   thankyou ;   this   section   gives   you   the   most   common .   Sometimes   language   learnersare   confused   about   when   to   use   the   word   thank and   when   to   use   thanks .   It   may   helpto   understand   that   thank   you   is   shortfor   I   thank   you ,   which   uses   the   firstperson   singular   form   of   the   verb   to   thank . In   most   other   expressions ,   the   word   is   thanks , a   plural   noun .   There   are   lots   of   common   and   acceptable   responses   to   thanks ,   shown   in   the   next   section 。 Thanksa   million 。 Thanksa   bunch 。 Thanksa   lot 。 Thanksmuch   ( or   loads ) 。 Manythanks 。 Ican ’ t   thank   you   enough 。 A   related   expression   is   I   owe   you   one ,   which   is   an   informal   wayto   say   “ I   must   repay   your   kindness 。 ”   Here   are   some   examples : Thanks   for   all   your           help .   I   owe   you   one . I   owe   you   one   for   loaning           me   your   car 。 When   someone   says   Thank   you ,   the   standard   response   is   You ’ re   welcome .   You ’ re   most   welcome   is   a   more   formal   version .   Veryoften ,   however ,   people   use   other   responses   to   thank   you ,   from   the   very   formal   Thepleasure   was   all   mine !   To   the   slangy   Nosweat 。 The   expressions   that   follow   are   common   waysof   saying   You ’ re   welcome ,   though   eachhas   its   specific   implication ,   as   indicated : ( Itwas )   my   pleasure :   means   “ It   gave   me   pleasure   to   doit ” Anytime : means   “ Ask   me   for   help   anytime ” Sure : slangy ,   familiar Noproblem :   means   “ It   caused   me   no   problem ” Notat   all :   means   “ It ’ s   not   necessary   to   thank   me   atall ;   it   was   not   a   problem   for   me   at   all ” Nosweat :   slangy ;   means   “ I   didn ’ t   sweat   or   becomeoverworked   by   helping ” It ’ snothing :   means   “ It   was   like   doing   nothing :   it   waseasy ” Don ’ tworry   about   it :   means   “ Don ’ t   feel   uncomfortablebecause   you   asked   for   help ;   don ’ t   worry   about   repaying   me ” Don ’ tmention   it :   means   “ No   need   to   thank   me ;   no   need   toeven   mention   it 。 ” Forget ( about )   it :   slightly   harsh ;   means   “ I   don ’ t   want   tobe   thanked ” In   American   culture   where   self - sufficiencyis   highly   valued ,   saying   something   like   Itwas   no   trouble   may   save   face   or   possible   embarrassment   for   the   person   whoreceived   something   or   requested   help 。
