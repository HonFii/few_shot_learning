And   finishing   a   long   novel   seemed   almost   impossible .   I   developed   the   habit   of   reading   short   stories   that   can   both   entertain   me   and   give   me   strength .   And   Chicken   Soup   for   the   Soul   was   one   of   them . When I   finished   reading   it   approximately   2   years   ago . But   I   didn ’ t   rush   through   it . Instead ,   I   read   it   religiously , one   or   two   for   each   day . I   didn ’ t   want   to   waste   good   reading   material ,   so   I   savored   every   one   of   them . What In   it   were   many   stories   and   anecdotes   that   can   inspire   and   enlighten   you . Usually ,   every   story   has   a   positive   message . Frankly ,   I   learned   much   in   between   the   lines . Why The   reason   I   like   this   book   very   much   was   on   the   one   hand ,   it   reminds   me   of   many   wonderful   things   in   my   childhood   and   on   the   other   hand ,   it   gives   me   reason ,   wisdom   and   maturity . It   coincided   with   the   period   in   my   life   where   I   had   many   doubts ,   I   was   confused . This   book   indirectly   provided   me   many   answers   to   such   puzzles . It   taught   me   to   think . Thinking   is   such   a   noble   habit . Learning   only   provides   us   materials   of   knowledge ; it   is   thinking   that   makes   what   we   learn   ours . 更 多 信息 请 访问 ： 新浪 雅思 频道   雅思 论坛   雅思 博客 圈 特别 说明 ： 由于 各 方面 情况 的 不断 调整 与 变化 ， 新浪网 所 提供 的 所有 考试 信息 仅供参考 ， 敬请 考生 以 权威部门 公布 的 正式 信息 为准 。
