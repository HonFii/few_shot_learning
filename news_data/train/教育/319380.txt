专家 指点 ： 轻松 打造 PETS 作文 论说文 模板 作者 ： 北京 新东方学校 培训 项目 专家组 (   ) 表示 可有可无 的话 ， 字 不够 就 加上 。 [ a / b / c ] 表示 方括号 内 由 / 分开 的 几句话 选 一句 。 ( 一 )   对立 观点 式 ( 1 ) 给出 两个 对立 的 事物 或者 一个 事物 对立 的 两个 方面 ， 要求 考生 支持 一方 并 进行 说明 。   具体 表述 如下 ： TOPIC :   Some   people   like   A ;   others   like   B .   Which   one   do   you   prefer   - -   A   or   B ?   Give   specific   reasons   and   examples   to   illustrate   your   answer 。 ( 2 ) 给出 两个 对立 事物 或 一个 事物 对立 的 两个 方面 ， 要求 考生 说明 二者 为什么 不同 或 比较 它们 的 优缺点 ， 并 给出 理由 。   具体 表述 如下 ： TOPIC :   Some   people   believe   that   A   while   others   consider   B   more   appropriate .   Give   advantages   and   disadvantages   of   the   two   positions   and   explain   which   position   you   support 。 对立 观点 式 的 三种 模板 ： 1 . 人们 往往 看到 B 的 明显 优点 而 忽视 了 它 的 缺点 ， 同时 A 的 内在 优势 没有 被 重视 。 第一段 ： To   choose   A   or   to   choose   B   is   something   of   a   dilemma   to   the   public   ause   they   sometimes   are   confused   by   the   seemingly   good   qualities   of   B   while   neglect   the   genuinely   good   aspects   of   A 。 第二段 ： [ For   B ,   people   are   often   driven   to   believe   that   /   It   is   quite   easy   for   common   people   to   CHOOSE   B   because   of   the   obvious   reason   that ]   ____________.   ( As   a   proverb   says ,   " Everything   has   two   sides " 。 )   Although   B   does   have   its   seemingly   profound   advantages ,   in   the   meantime   [ there   lie   [ harmful   characteristics /   intrinsic   drawbacks ]   in   it   such   as   ____________   /   it   can   be   achieved   only   conditionally   because ____________ ]   .   Some   [ people / experts ]   [ maintain / warn ]   that ____________.   However ,   it   is   often   overlooked   [ by   the   public / most   people ] .   ( Therefore   we   have   no   complete   evidence   to   suggest   that   B   is   always   better   than   A 。 ) 第三段 ：   Unfortunately ,   the   innate   quality   of   A   is   often   underestimated 。 或 ： What   is   more ,   if   you   notice   the   invisible   benefits   of   CHOOSING   A ,   you   can   understand   A   more   deeply .   Here   I   would   explain   a   few   of   the   most   important   reasons   for   choosing   A .   第一点 原因 。 第二点 原因 。 第三点 原因 。 ( 列举 原因 的 句式 见 最后 的 " 通用 句型 " ) 第四段 ： Therefore   from   what   we   have   discussed ,   we   may   safely   come   to   the   conclusion   that   CHOOSING   AAA   is   a   rather   wise   decision 。 2 . 选 A 还是 选 B 的确 是 一个 热门话题 ， 我们 来 研究 一下 ， A 比 B 至少 有三大 优势 ： 1 ， 2 ， 3 。 第一段 ： There   is   no   denying   the   fact   that   ____________ ( whether   it   is   better   to   choose   A   or   B )   is   a   popular   topic   which   is   much   talked   about   [ not   only   by   ____________ ,   but   also   by   ____________ / by   people   across   the   world /   in   a   modern   society ] 。 或 ： There   is   no   denying   the   fact   that   ____________ ( whether   it   is   better   to   choose   A   or   B )   is   a   popular   topic   which   has   caused   heated   debate   over   a   long   period   of   time   ( because   it   affects   everybody   in   his   or   her   daily   lives ) 。 或 ： In   a   modern   society ,   people   are   always   faced   with   the   dilemma   of   whether   to   choose   A   or   B .   This   problem   is   a   much - debated   one   in   that   it   affects   everybody   in   his   or   her   daily   lives 。 或 ： ( 如果 是 针对 某一 事件 的 题目 ， 不是 什么 popular   topic ) If   ____________ ( it   is   announced   that   a   new   movie   theater   may   be   built   ____________ ) ，   I   will   not   be   surprised   to   see   ____________   ( whether   it   is   better   to   choose   A   or   B )   become   a   popular   topic   which   is   much   talked   about   not   only   by   ____________ ,   but   also   by   ____________.   Although   it   seems   that   [ sometimes   we   can   not   tell   which   one   outweigh   the   other   between   A   and   B   /   they   normally   coexist   peacefully ] ,   they   deserve   some   close   examination .   [ If   three   criteria   were   taken   into   account   in   comparing   these   two ,   I   would   prefer   A .   /   As   far   as   I   am   concerned ,   I   vote   for   the   latter ] .   There   are   no   less   than   three   advantages   in   A   as   rendered   below : 第二段   第一点 原因 。 第二点 原因 。 第三点 原因 。 第三段   In   conclusion ,   ( it   must   be   explained   that   these   three   reasons   sometimes   intertwine   to   form   an   organic   whole   and   thus   become   more   persuasive   than   any   one   of   them 。 )   Only   these   three   reasons   are   enough   to   make   a   person   draw   the   conclusion   that   ____________   ,   not   to   mention   there   are   more 。 3 . 选 A 还是 选 B 的确 是 一个 热门话题 ， 我们 来 研究 一下 ， 二者 各有 优势 ， 不过 我来 选 的话 ， A 的 优点 还是 比 B 多 。 第一段 前 两句 同 2 ， 第三句 While   both   the   two   [ methods / choices ]   may   have   their   advantages   and   disadvantages ,   they   can   be   applied   under   different   circumstances .   Later   on ,   I   will   explain   my   opinion   about   it 。 第二段 ： [ A   has   the   obvious   advantage   that   /   One   very   strong   argument   for   A   is   that ]   ____________.   But   there   lies   intrinsic   harmful   characteristic   in   this   method .   Some   [ people / experts ]   [ maintain / warn ]   that ____________   Furthermore ,   ____________.   Therefore   we   have   no   complete   evidence   to   suggest   that   A   is   always   better   than   B 。 第三段 ： On   the   other   hand ,   choosing   B   also   has   advantages   to   some   extent ,   For   example ,   ____________.   However ,   once   again ,   it   is   important   to   see   that   under   certain   circumstances   B   will ____________ ( disadvantage ) 或 ： Yet   there   are   some   people   who   cast   serious   doubts   on   B 或 ： Although   B   does   have   its   seemingly   profound   [ advantages /   reason ] , in   the   meantime [ there   lie   intrinsic   [ harmful   characteristics / drawbacks ]   in   it   such   as   ________________________   /   it   can   be   achieved   only   conditionally   because ____________ ] 。 第四段 ： ( 针对 我 个人 的 情况 又 可以 说出 一套 理由 ) But   if   all   these   factors   are   contemplated ,   [ as   far   as   I   am   concerned   /   according   to   my   knowledge ] ,   the   advantages   of   A   carry   more   weight   than   those   of   B   because   A   fits   [ me / us   students ]   better   in   two   ways :   In   the   first   place ,   ____________ ,   In   the   second   place / secondly , ____________ Therefore   from   what   we   have   discussed ,   we   may   safely   come   to   the   conclusion   that   choosing   A   is   a   rather   wise   decision 。 或 ： ( 我 个人 的 情况 说不出 什么 新 的 理由 ， 只好 说 我 觉得 A 优点 就是 比 B 多 ) It   seems   very   difficult   for   us   to   prefer   one   to   another   because   all   of   them   have   their   advantages   and   disadvantages   to   the   extent   that   it   is   hard   to   distinguish .   Yet   that   does   not   mean   that   they   are   all   the   same   to   me .   Which   one   I   prefer   depends   on   my   own   experience ,   life   style   and   [ emotional   concerns   /   educational   background / ____________ ] .   [ As   far   as   I   am   concerned   /   According   to   my   personality   and   fondness /   To   be   frank ] ,   I   would   like   to   choose   A ,   because   there   are   too   many   benefits   that   outnumber   its   disadvantages   not   to   choose   it .   B ,   on   the   other   hand ,   has   advantages   no   more   than   its   disadvantages 。 ( 二 ) 单一 观点 式 两种 形式 ： ( 1 ) 给出 一个 论点 ， 此 论点 不 包括 两种 事物 的 比较 ， 要求 考生 支持 或 反对 并 给出 理由 。 具体 表述 如下 ： TOPIC :   Do   you   ae   or   disagree   with   the   following   statement ?   AAA .   Use   specific   reasons   and   details   to   support   your   answer 。 ( 2 ) 给出 一个 论点 ， 主要 是 对 两个 事物 进行 比较 的 陈述 ， 要求 考生 支持 或 反对 并 给出 理由 。 具体 表述 如下 ： TOPIC :   A   is   superior   to   B .   Do   you   agree   or   disagree   with   this   statement ?   Use   specific   reasons   to   support   your   point   of   view 。 注 ： 在 模板 中用 A 、 B 表示 相 比较 的 两个 事物 ， 这种 形式 与 对立 观点 式 有着 很大 的 相似之处 ， 考生 可以 进行 适当 的 借鉴 。 ( 2 ) 可以 使用 对立 观点 式 的 模板 。 ( 1 ) 的 两种 模板 如下 ： 1 . disagree 这个 问题 的确 是 个 热门话题 ， 支持 的 人 的 理由 是 ____________ ， 但是 它 的 错误 在于 ____________ 。 第一段 ： There   is   no   denying   the   fact   that   ____________ ( if   one   should   ____________   / if   ____________   is   right )   is   a   hot   topic   which   is   much   talked   about   [ not   only   by   ____________ ,   but   also   by   ____________   / by   people   across   the   world /   in   a   modern   society ] 。 或 ： There   is   no   denying   the   fact   that   ____________ ( if   one   should   ____________   / if   ____________   is   right )   is   a   popular   topic   which   has   caused   heated   debate   over   a   long   period   of   time   ( ause   it   affects   everybody   in   his   or   her   daily   lives ) 。 或 ： There   is   no   denying   the   fact   that   ____________ ( if   one   should   ____________   / if   ____________   is   right )   is   a   basic   ( moral / philosophical )   problem   that   can   not   be   circumvented   by   anybody , (   because   the   opinion   on   this   problem   will   determine   one ’ s   attitude   toward   the   world   and   the   life ) 。 或 ： ( 如果 是 针对 某一 事件 的 题目 ， 不是 什么 popular   topic ) If   ____________ ( it   is   announced that   a   new   movie   theater   may   be   built   ____________ ) ，   I   will   not   be   surprised   to   see   ____________   ( whether   the   plan   should   be   supported   or   opposed )   become   a   popular   topic   which   is   much   talked   about   not   only   by   ____________ ,   but   also   by   ____________.   Before   rendering   my   opinion ,   I   think   it   is   important   to   take   a   glance   at   the   arguments   on   both   sides 。 第二段 ： People   who   support   AAA   usually   give   ( some ,   even   all   of )   the   following   reasons .   第一点   原因 。 第二点 原因 。 第三点 原因 。 第三段 ： At   the   first   glance ,   the   opinion   saying   yes   to   the   above   question   perhaps   sounds   reasonable   and   appealing .   Nevertheless ,   [ many   people   do   not   think   this   view   can   hold   water   /   we   can   find   that   it   presents   us   with   numerous   negative   effects   along   with   its   benefits . ] 或 ： Although   ____________ ( the   opinion   in   question )   does   have   its   seemingly   profound   [ advantages / reasons ] ,   in   the   meantime   [ there   lie   intrinsic   [ harmful   characteristics   / drawbacks / faults ]   in   [ it / this   method ]   such   as   ____________   /   it   can   be   achieved   only   conditionally   because ____________ ] 。 Some   [ people / experts ]   [ maintain / warn ]   that ____________.   Unfortunately ,   it   is   often   overlooked   by   [ the   public / most   people ] .   ( Therefore   we   have   no   complete   evidence   to   conclude   that   the   statement   is   right 。 )   What   is   more ,   ____________ 第四段 ： In   a   word ,   despite   the   fact   that   the   argument   I   disagree   does   hold   a   little   bit   of   water ,   I   think   that ____________
