This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.
This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.
I just bought this toy because it was the only one I could find in the store for a stroller.. And of course it won't fit on our Graco stroller.
I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless.
We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This doesn't fit on either one!!  It was a complete waste of money! Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying!
Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that's why I gave it 1 star. However...the thing REALLY stinks!! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought..."Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won't have to purchase any liners"...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn't stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don't think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!
......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star..... Please don't buy this one!
When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills. While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags, that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired. My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience. Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine. Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around.
My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it.  The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.  It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle won't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it.  Plus, I think it is unsanitary.  The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail, and then they drop through to the bag.  Well, messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area, and it was not easy to clean.  Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail.  (It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either!)  I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it, so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now, and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week.  I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.  I do not recommend this product.
I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of  lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet...
Was really, really excited to get these, then read what it is made out of, the very bottom layer is PVC. Now why would I want my newborn daughter to sleep on this and breathe it in? Not in a lifetime. Plus, when I opened the package, it smelled of plastic. I will do the laundry when she messes up the bed and deal with it rather risk exposure to PVC fumes.
The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven't used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.
My sister recommended this product to me, and I wanted to like it.  It is very waterproof!  But the waterproof barrier makes this not breathable.  My baby would sweat profusely.  We always keep our house at 68-70 and dressed him in a cotton sleeper.  If he was laying on his back, his chest would be cool, but his back would be hot and sticky.  Or if laying on his stomach, his front would be sweaty, but his back cool.  Basically, whatever was touching the mattress pad could not breath and it was uncomfortable no matter what temperature adjustment we made.I will say the design configuration is very practical and a great idea.  Changing a fitted mattress sheet is a giant pain in the butt.  This pad makes it easy to clean up the crib after an accident and speed is critical in the middle of the night.I purchased a felted 100% wool mattress pad instead and couldn't be happier.  It was slightly more expensive, but it was worth it.  Wool is a truly fabulous product: very breathable, helps regulate body temp, naturally water resistant, anti bacterial and NATURAL!!!!  No man-made plastics or vinyl that you have to worry about weird off-gassing chemicals.  My baby stays dry and comfortable.
I measured the crib before purchasing this, but it was not a hood fit for our standard Jenny Lind crib. Some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed, so they just hung thee. It did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard.
I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it.  I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat.  Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure.  This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment.  My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway.
I tried this out on my baby's standard size crib, and it fit horribly. The little loops that hold it down, don't seem safe at all!!! And they don't keep the sheet secure to the mattress. I don't know how they're allowed to sell these. They seem like a major safety hazard to me!!! Total waste of money!!!
My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).  Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can.
What a waste of money and more importantly my time!This thing does not work well at al!! I can't fit a larger cable through it.  PLUS if you have plugs that go sideways like our ROKU does. You can't use it. So i had to buy a power strip but the power strip is too thick and won't work. So this ended up in the garbage.
There are two pieces to the outlet cover: back part replaces the outlet cover (and needs to be screwed on) and the front cover, which is released from the back cover by squeezing the two plastic pieces on the sides. The plastic side pieces are part of the back part, made of stiff plastic and extremely difficult to squeeze. This outlet cover also did not fit one of my outlets (it would not stay flush to the wall).
Unfortunately you cannot tell from the picture, but this product is not well designed. It projects far out from the wall, and cannot accommodate any plugs larger than a two prong (meaning non grounded) table lamp cord. Anything like a power strip, laptop cord, etc, will not even be able to be plugged in because the casing blocks it. In addition, the slot to feed the cord through to exit the device is also very small and fits almost none of the electronics in my house. It also sits on top of the outlet cover, so there is no way to really secure it tightly and it can rotate a bit.
If you want to keep the plug in there forever, it is the best one. But the first time, you still need to open it to install. After you put it on the wall, it's really hard to remove. Another con is the cover is too small, that I cannot put anything other than a stand lamp in it.

Really? How could this possibly be useful? I saw somebody else post that the baby's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating. Really, I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier. The baby's whole hand fits through the giant gap. Plus the thing is huge. Like almost as big as a shoe box. And really ugly. I don't know what we'll replace it with since the others don't sound better, but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show. There's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room, so I might as well just leave the cords as is.
It's funny how many people have positively reviewed this. Yes, it's very convenient, easy to use, and fits well. What it doesn't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs! It's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening. In fact, I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover. If I can fit my hand in there, so can a child. And it doesn't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there. This product is, in a word, worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets, or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip. But please don't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks.
Seriously, I just got this, and this product is not worth a single penny. It is too bulky and gets in the way. Even when it is on its smallest setting! Not just that, but there is a large opening at the top for the cords to fit through, but the gap is so big, my kids can still unplug the cords and play with them.
This powerstrip cover is pointless.  Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked.
These are a great idea but didn't work for me.  Our cords are thick and long and wouldn't fit inside the box.
Many kids have been able to remove safety devices in less than 30 seconds.  It takes less than 5 minutes for a parent to leave the room to get something and return to find their child hanging from the cords...DEAD!!!  It is safer to spend the money and go CORDLESS!!!  But if you must keep your corded blinds, get the Fashion Wand (approved by PFWBS).  Go to Parents for Window Blind Safety (PFWBS) website and read all the testimonials of kids who died or were severely injured by blind cords.  Watch the videos they have of kids bypassing or breaking safety devices on cords in less than 30 seconds.  And then decide if you want to install a safety kit or remove the danger altogether.
Although the design of these is to wind the cord shorter, when a window is open and blinds are drawn the cord does get longer. I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck. Terrifying. Although these do pop open easily, they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw. From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these!
This product is useless. After installed, I could still open the oven door with my pinky finger. The directions were also unclear and the picture doesn't match the product.
My 15 month old daughter was able to pull this thing apart with little effort. I would not recommend it.
I do not reccomend this product at all! It did not stick well, and my 11 mo old daughter popped it off the first time she pulled on the oven door!
This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me.  The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.  I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?  Hello?  Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.  What about those holes?  It is cute that the manual says "do not drill through the door," hugh?  Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?  Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?  Who pays for that?  I know the answer to that one -> ME!  Soooo....product is going back.  Non-starter
This sounded good in theory, but didn't work at all.  They were correctly installed by my husband, but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open.  It was a waste of money for our cabinets.  It may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets, but it definitely didn't work through our solid wood cabinets.
On the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off.  If I was not in a well lit room and paying close attention, my 7 week old could have gotten seriously hurt.  To add salt to the wound,  I tried to return the item and I got two separate emails from the seller.  The first email asked me to describe the defect.  I responded to the email. After which, I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item; SERIOUSLY!  1. Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it?  2.  If I described the defect as a sliver of metal, the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item, as a sliver denotes a very small piece, so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like.  3.  If the seller needed a picture, this should have been requested in the first email, not in a second email.  I shop online because I have limited time.  I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $3 nail clip.  However, I am so irritated with the product and the seller's response that I decided to write this review.  In addition, my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed!
These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago.  I tried to trim my 3 month old son's nails, granted he is the fidgeting type.  Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger.  His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked.  Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage.  But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company.  They are VERY safe.  I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents.  I shudder to think of using nail clippers again, especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails.
The nipple on this thing is HUGE and pretty hard so I don't think it would work for most babies because it would gag them and they probably just wouldn't like it. I've tried this in my mouth, it isn't comfortable like regular pacifiers at all and it took so long to reach a temperature I took it out of my mouth before it was done, this was over 2 minutes so I don't even know if this thing is accurate at all.My girls were preemies and this was WAY too big for them. I've tried to use this thing many different times and my girls always spit it right out, even if I tried to hold it there they would push it out with their tongue, they HATE it. My girls are currently 14 months old and love their Binky pacifiers but I've tried to get them to use this to take their temps several times and they make a face & push it right out.My girls HATE & have always hated having their temperature taken under the arm pit but they do not mind it taken rectally, it IS very easy and the most accurate. I use an Exergen Temperal for when they are sleeping because it is accurate enough to let me know if they have a temp and if it is a high temp. If it shows they have a higher temp then I get them up and take their temp rectally to make sure I get the most accurate temperature. I recommend the Vicks Rectal Thermometer for that.I think companies make products like the pacifier thermometer because as new parents it sounds like a good idea but in reality, they just don't work and I'm sure your Dr will tell you the same thing.
I am sorry I bought this tub.  It is very uncomfortable for my daughter.  Used it since she was about 3 weeks old.  I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable.  Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain!  It's way too small.  She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it.  And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug -  it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes.
I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink.  I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds!  It doesn't hold much water, either.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away.  What a waste!
I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.
I hate this tub!!! It leaks everywhere. I do not recommend buying this item
Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open! I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want! Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child. And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly. Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day....got another brand....
I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it. I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean.
This was terrible. It leaked all over the place. Finally my husband put silicone all around it which helped. Save your money & buy the cheap $10 one that's one piece.
I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use.  My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue.  It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good, either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it.  I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead.  I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born.  It is very easy to put over my sink.  The green net comes with the tub is easy to use.
I registered for this and got it home and put it together. It didnt seem to fit together right. I took it back and bought a basic tub and a foam bear pad to lay her on. Much better. less $$ and easy to use.
It leaks every time I use it. It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk.
Enough said.
My son is now 11 months old and I have been using this tub since he was 5 weeks old.  In the beginning, we used the infant sling, but my baby would constantly slip down into the water.  We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping, but we still had to readjust him quite frequently.  When he learned to sit on his own, we tried using the bath seat feature.  He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring, thus painfully squishing his private parts.  We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him, but we managed.  Now he twists and turns and won't stay put in the tub.  I have thought about buying a better tub, but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub, I don't want to spend the money.  Please consider buying something different for your baby.  I will not be using this tub for my next child.
I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle "locking" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!
I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower.  I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub.  Wrong!!  First of all, the tub leaks.  You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide.  My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy.  The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
This tub was the worst! Talk about making your job harder than it already is! It leaks, the sling hardly stays in place, it takes up so much space, and you have to use it in the tub anyways. It is more trouble than it is worth.
DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS TUB. IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.MY BABY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS TUB, YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE FREE HAND TO WASH THE BABY . IT ALSO LEAKS FROM THE BOTTOM
We registered for this tub, before doing any research.  Big mistake.  As a newborn, I used the sling to bathe my son.  As he got bigger, I put the sling into the tub (2nd way of the 4-1 system).  Bath time became a pain.  My son kept sliding down, even with one hand on him at all times.  He didn't really seem to enjoy it either.  Finally, after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath.  LOVE IT!!!!!  From day one my son had a great time in his new (huge) tub.  He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub, with no slipping.  He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash.  We've had it over a month, I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub.
This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used. It is impossible to get folded and unfolded. When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling. My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water. She is now to big for the sling, but to small to sit up in the ring. I gave it a fair try, but I had to go out and buy another bath. It seems like a great concept, but it is really just a waste of [money].
I used this bath for the first 3 months and it was great when using the sling, but when my son got too big for the sling and was sitting up, we tried the sitting position. But my son would just slip down and would cry because it was uncomfortable for him. I would not recommend this bath tub. There are other tubs with slings that are much better.
this is the worst bath tub i've bought. i returned this item right away. it leaks. once i pulled it out to be longer but, no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together, it just wouldn't click. when i pressed it to lock the extension, i couldn't tell whether it locked or not, so then i put water to test the lock system. the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now, i bought the Euro bath. it does a good job.
Who is very chatty and outgoing. He's five months old now. It startles him and made him cry a few times. Decided it was a bit too 'manic' for him. Maybe when he's a bit older.
I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased the original Embryonics one instead of the one made by Munchkin. The sound difference is amazing. I've heard the Munchkin one play in person and it sounds like it is dying and about to run out of batteries. Seriously save yourself some money and buy an original one (even if it's used). I got mine on ebay.
The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat.
Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube
We have an elongated toilet and I don't know of anyway to hold this seat in place. My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back, the whole seat goes with her. So when she pees, it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess.
My daughter liked the seat she had (Primo Ducka) but really wanted a seat with handles for pooping. This little seat seemed to fit the bill and was cheap enough that I didn't mind buying another seat.Yes, it "fits" elongated toilets. But there is nothing to keep it from sliding around on the longer toilet seat underneath it - no clamps, no pegs, no rubber feet, nothing! Every time my daughter tried to sit down, the seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing her on the pee guard. If I start with the little seat as far back as possible, it's too far for her to get on without help (she's nearly 3!) and once on, her feet don't touch her fairly tall step stool. It needs to be at the front of the toilet seat but it won't stay there. So I have to be with her to hold it in place so she can climb on. Not a problem if you are starting out - you need to be with your child - but this is a problem if your child knows how to use the potty and wants to express her independence and "do it herself".Once she is sitting with the seat in the proper place, the biggest complaint starts. This thing collects pee. The little pee guard is pointless. From what I've seen pee guards are needed by some kids, not by others - regardless of sex. My daughter needs one - a decent one. This one just deflects her pee all over the seat, the floor, her pants, her shoes. In short, a drippy, nasty mess that has to be cleaned every time it is used with extra laundry. I shudder to think of the muck that is accumulating in the foam under the vinyl.She wanted one with handles. Fine. I've added two simple drawer pull knobs to our Primo Ducka potty seat. She's pleased. This piece of junk went in the trash.
Really, how hard can it be to design one of these things? This fails for two basic reasons:1) It slides backwards on the toilet seat making it unstable and hard for my daughters to sit down. This is an enormous design flaw.2) The pee guard is basically flush with the seat, so what is its purpose other than to decrease the actual potty-business real estate? It takes away room for daughters' pee to go down. And it's not high enough to save my baby boy from getting soaked when my daughter didn't clamp her knees shut tightly enough to prevent her pee from shooting cleanly over the guard and onto baby's head. He was not pleased. Neither was I.I also have a two mini-potties, the Fisher Price froggy and singing ducky. The pee guard on the froggy potty is great. I love this low-tech seat as it's easy to clean and hands down my twin daughters' favorite. The singing duck potty was more expensive, is much harder to clean, is annoyingly loud and wakes up the baby, and there are a lot more spills due to the lack of pee guard. Highly recommend the froggy potty if you are in the market.
Not good quality and didn't fit my toilet. I suppose its ok as a travel one if you need that.
A sticker on the packaging clearly stated that the potty material includes a known cancer causing agent. I sent it back to Amazon immediately. My daughter was very disappointed because she loves Dora!
I hate this gate and quality is typical of evenflo. If I had noticed it was evenflo, I wouuld not have wasted my time. It was a pain to install. Total PAIN. Then, when it's unlocked, it slides for adjustment. The thing is, there is no way to stop it so baby sticks his arm through slates as you open and then you have a broken or badly bruised arm. We put a screw into the wood so it would slide just a little to help prevent that. IF we had known about the second risk, we would have just taken it down then. THe next morning, it was kid tested. Yeah, all the kid has to do is push the bottom and it comes out of the bracket causing the gate bend foreward. So far, I have seen my kids push it more than a foot out of position. MAJOR STRANGLATION HAZARD. Not to mention broken bones. The wood is so flimsy it just twist every which way.As far as function goes, when you go to unlock it, sometimes it will not unhook out of the slot. I have had to pratically hang on it to get it open. Also, the gate now leans. When opened, it leans to where a ball would roll for the from to the end of the gate. Not sure how that came about. We have had this gate for a couple of months. My son has been able to push it out since he started crawling. My 2 yrold can almost squeeze out by pushing on it which has lead to her getting stuck when I made a bathroom break. Not a good gate at all. Evenflo just needs to stop. Every product I have had has been crap. I am afraid to buy their carseats. If they can't make a good simple baby gate, I wouldn't trust my child's life to their carseats. We plan to replace within the next couple of paychecks.
We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates. Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates. Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom. This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't.)
Update: 6-months later - the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use.  It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands.  I've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it.  So, if you buy it, try rubbing some wax, or something, on it to help in the beginning, because it was pretty dangerous at first.  And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you're opening it. That will happen with any slotted, sliding gate.  Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud, and it's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands.  And with it being difficult for her to do, she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying.  I'm always afraid she's going to wake the kids.  So, if you have your mom at your house a lot, get something easier.  It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you!-----I've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it.  What happens is when you unlatch it, you first have to slide the gate in, then swing it out.  There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together, and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract (look at the photo - you'll see what I mean).  The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do.  I'm sure with use it will loosen, or perhaps I can put some wax on there.  But when you're opening the gate in a rush, as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows, I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide, and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket.  The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby.  My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful. But busy parents like us don't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate.  When we've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows, the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate!! I dont' mean to beat a dead horse, but seriously, that's not good.  The pinch I got today was major painful - I've got a blood blister that's almost half an inch long!
As soon as I opened the box, I could tell by the VOC's that this playard was treated with chemicals.  I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants.  In addition, some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl...like the entire face of the sun is PVC.  Why would you let your child play, let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew.  I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard.  It's the same size but quite a bit more expensive. The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants.  Definitely worth it to pay the extra $, knowing my children won't be exposed to harmful chemicals.
Be very careful using this play pen. My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on. He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen. Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes. At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting. From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on.
I have wasted so much milk using this drop-ins system.  I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners, and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter.  Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk, and believe me, I've done that many times.  I've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole, I'll only waste a little bit.  But, come on, I'm sleep deprived, and stressed and sometimes I forget, and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter, and I shouldn't have to check like that for a product I've paid for.  No good.Out of a box of 100 liners, I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak.  That's quite a lot; we're not talking one or two here.  Unfortunately, I've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples, so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I cannot afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle.  I'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter.  I would NOT recommend.
I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up
I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong.  I'd read the directions again and try again.  Another, stinking, melted bottle!  And the milk would be scalding hot.  If it didn't melt the bottle, the milk would still be cold.  I also had a problem with my playtex ventaire bottles leaking from the bottom into the warmer.  Then I had the smell of burned formula in the kitchen.  Oh!  And it melted that bottle too!I'm going back to the old fashioned way.  I'm going to heat water in the microwave and let the bottle soak in it.  It is faster, less messy, and lots cheaper.  Don't waste your time and money.
I purchsed this product because of the cooling capabilities as it was perfect for night feedings instead of running downstairs to make a bottle in the middle of the night.  We loved it for the first month we had it.  BUT, after just about a month of use (warming 3 or 4 bottles per day) the warmer started over heating the bottles and sent milk pouring out of the top.  I use a variety of types of bottles and specifically the Dr. Browns and the First Years Breastflow bottles were overheated and thus overflowed in this warmer.  (The Advent bottles did not overflow but were so hot to the touch I couldn't take them out with my bare hands and thus was NOT going to put the bottle near my infant until it cooled down which tool 5 or more minutes.) We played with the amount of water we were using, thinking we were putting too much in (even though we were following the recommended water usage in the instructions).  That didn't help.  After having the product for less than 2 months we are returning it to the vendor where it was purchsed.  I would not recommend gettin this product.  First Years needs to go back to the drawing board on this one and come out with a product that actually works.
This thing stinks. The on off switch never worked so we always had to plug and unplug it. Plus you can easily over heat your bottles in this. We did like the cooler on the back for travel but overall this thing stinks
I bought this bottle warmer, because the previous model from the same company broke. When I got the new version of "The First Years Night and Day Warmer System", I was shocked on how short the electric cord was. I was also displeased with having to unplug it, in order, to turn it off. I am not happy with the new model. I would try a different brand, if you need a bottle warmer.
Do not buy for glass bottles. Says nothing about this on the website but on the box. Very dangerous because gets so hot
This product is a major piece of garbage. You will NEVER get your milk to the right temperature no matter how hard you try. It will either be cold or it will be scalding hot. Also it creates a smell that smells like burnt hair which is worrisome considering others who reviewed this product (at least 4 people) said that it catches on fire. We were using dr. browns 2 and 4 oz bottles and sometimes the 2 oz would be cold while the 4 oz would  be way too hot. We always ended up using the tap to correct the temperature and it took forever. We just bought the dr browns delux bottle warmer and its AMAZING! It remembers how long it takes to warm any particular amount and you dont have to fill it up with water every time the way you do with this. Remove from your registry, return, or throw away if you have bought this product and go with the dr browns instead.
I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump (Medela Pump in Style) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP! This single electric one just cannot get enough pressure/suction/whatever. plus even if it DID work, a single pump means double the pumping time. I know double electric pumps are expensive, but beg, borrow, get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant. Just don't bother trying this one.
This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces, don't get this.  In addition to being slow, it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months.  It's a waste of money all around!
The only good thing about this is the night light function.  The waves and water sound horrible and my son never liked listening to the music or the heartbeat sound.
I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive. I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out! It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it. I am returning it back to the store. My sister has the same table and her's is fine. Maybe I just picked up a bad one.
Had it not fallen apart after one wash, this would have been the perfect mattress pad.  It never even made it into the dryer.  What a waste of money.
When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby.
Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking. They are correct! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers, I think there must be a problem with production. Maybe some are leaky, some are not. Fact is, out of ten bottles, five of mine were leaky. I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex. They are half the cost and never leak
Don't waste your money!  Overpriced leaky bottles!
Wanted to use the Avent line, but baby just wouldn't take this nipple.  Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead.  Looks like a science lab...but baby switches easily from breast to bottle.
Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups.  They allow to much air to enter the baby's system.  Spend your money on a better bottle like Dr. Brown's or Platex.  I know several new mother's who bought in the ad hype about these bottles and ended up trashing them and buying something else.
I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles. I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage. Needless to say none worked. Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles. I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones. First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened.  There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby. The bottles are by far not cheap and there shouldn't be so many issues.  I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well...too bad they didn't tell me before I registered for them.  Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the .99 cent store you don't have all these issues.  When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well.  I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls.  In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating.  I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle.
I spent SO much money on these bottles while I was pregnant, because they were supposively the best bottles to use while breastfeeding. The bottles are expensive so I thought they must be good bottles. WRONG. Expensive does not always equal good. I tried using these bottles when my baby was two weeks old, and the feeding session ended in complete frustration on mine AND my baby's part. The nipple shape is horrible. Even the newborn nipples are WAAAAAY too long for a newborn's mouth ( and my baby has a BIG mouth. He was 9 lbs at birth) . Not to mention that these bottles let him suck SOOOO much air and caused him to spit up several times. I thought maybe my baby was just having problems with taking a bottle, so I went and bought the Playtex VentAire. Those bottles are a LOT cheaper and SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better. He took the bottle immediately and didn't get NEARLY the amount of air.  Don't waste your money on these bottles. They are NOT the "best" bottles to use while breastfeeding. SO if you are pregnant, don't make the same mistake that I did and buy a whole load of these bottles thinking that they are the best.
They leak like mad... and although you tell yourself you must be doing something wrong because no bottle should leak this much, it's not your fault. It's these idiotic bottles! I can't imagine how they passed any kind of testing when they were being made. Please don't buy them, it is a huge waste of money!
These bottles leak.  It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave.  They leak.  Terribly.  And Avent knows it.  They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent.  Of course the ones they replace it with also leak.  Buy Dr. Browns instead.
HI, I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY. I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME, I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS!!! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO "TALK ABOUT IT" I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING. THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY. THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN. I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED!!! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CANNOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET!!! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT, NOT, NOT, BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES!!!
Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand. BPA free brands include Born Free, Nurture Pure, MAM, Green to Grow, Baby Life and Adrini.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)
These bottles are very finicky and if you do not put them together just right they will leak... not drip... POUR out all over the floor, and if it is breast milk that is gushing out of the bottle you may just be crying too!I ended up with a full set of these bottles (without the ring) and one that required the ring (which I felt leaked less), I could never justify going out and buy all new bottles, so I dealt with these for 11 months. I have now weaned my son off of these and onto a sippy cup because I just could not deal any longer!What's the trick? Well, the nipple has these three little lines on it and inside the screw on part there are solid parts and slotted parts (sorry if this doesn't make sense). You have to line up the lines on the nipple with the solid parts on the bottle top. This requires two hands, so you will also need to find a place to put down your screaming baby while you concentrate and get it all lined up perfectly. Once you have them lined up, now screw on the top. You have to make sure it is nice and tight. Now, shake it and see.... it leaks! It is because when you screw the top onto the bottle the nipple shifts and turns as you screw it on tight, so all that time you spent lining up the holes with the slots is garbage. Take it off and try again. Finally you will get it right and only then can you give the bottle to your starving child.I cannot wait to throw them all in the trash.
I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible. Don't waste your money.  Dr. Brown's is the way to go!
Sent me 3 bottles one of which didn't have a lid in the box.  Crappy quality control.  Just buy them at the store for more money, at least you'll get all the parts with it.  5 stars for avent, -5 stars for seller.
I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts, every one of them leaks. I tried everything to stop the leaks, but nothing worked. Avent makes a great manual breast pump, but they need to put a better bottle on the market.
The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her. It isn't great for infants that are nursing...My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her. Not only was she gagging, but she just didn't like the nipple. I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it. I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since, and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle.
We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time.  We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings.  The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings.  So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants.  Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire.
My baby never wanted to take them, or when he did, he looked like he was going to choke (even with the newborn nipples!), and was doing a mess, with milk dripping everywhere. The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better.
When my daughter was born we stocked up on these bottles because we heard they were good and the price alone would make you think that. Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak. NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby's face. Not only do you have to clean up but your baby doesn't want to wait for a new bottle. After slowly running out of bottles that didn't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect! They don't leak and our baby has less gas. The liners prevent a lot of gas. If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price. You get 100 of them for maybe $5.00. We haven't had any problems with leaking at all.So I don't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time. But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer, warmer, & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that doesn't mean they are all bad. I just had to give a warning so you don't lose a lot of money like we did.
these dont require that extra ring to make it leak proof. i had the originals and they work great too but i like the big capacity but not big size of these. they will leak out of the nipple if it is upside down so if your baby feeds themselves, watch that they dont drop it and wedge it somewhere upside downupdated review***** i love avent NATURALLY bottles and trusted that is what i was getting when i looked at all 12 customer photos. well i broke these babies out to use em last night and they are reg avent bottles with the stupid ring on the inside that makes it not leak(something not needed in the other bottle)the plastic used is also completely different. it isnt the hard clear plastic that doesnt cloud or stain, it is the dull non see through plastic that feels pliable. and the oz numbering on these reg bottles is the kind that will scratch and rub off easily. so disappointed that i now have to return these :(
We got these bottles because they are supposed to be the closest thing to breast feeding, and they advertise a 'slow-flow' nipple.  Needless to say, the milk just ran down our baby's chin every time.  The slow-flow is not slow enough for a baby who is accustomed to breast feeding and having to work at gettimg milk out.  They are way too expensive and didn't work well for us.
Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem.
I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck.  I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow.  You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle.  So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste!  The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find!  Good Luck!
I bought this to use with my Avent bottles (which by the way LEAK) and I was very disappointed. My doctor told me to pump to stimulate my milk production which was coming in slowly. I could not get very much with this and needless to say it was not helping. Once I started using a Medela Electric pump, I got tons of milk! I was skeptical about the price, but it's totally worth it if you want to be able to use a pump on a regular basis.
The title says it all...the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got. You'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table. I've tried goo gone to no avail. If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off, which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers, I'd love to hear them. I can't believe how awful my table looks.
I don't understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables! I need to return this item
Good idea but this is very cheaply made... it is not sticky enough to stay on anything... my 6 month old baby would just yank it off immediately. I wish I never purchased this because you'd basically have to crazy glue to your furniture and there's no way I am doing that!
You know when you're child free and buy great furniture? You can't fathom the day when you'll have to apply foam to your beautiful wood table so your child doesn't go head first into the sharp corner?  Those days are now a distant memory and you bite the bullet and apply a foam guard.  Then you go to take it off because your child has spilled parmesan cheese and... what...the? The wood came off.  The WOOD came off.  I expected to have to use some Goo-Be-Gone to get off the adhesive but this actually destroyed the table.  Not like a dent that could be sanded.  I piece of wood literally splintered off.  So, while this product will protect your kid's noggin, don't put it on a piece of furniture you like.
When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child, however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it doesn't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to.  (I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table).Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes (must be completely flat to hold at all)
This is the worst thing ever. It sticks for one week and then its down. I put in on my coffe table and end tables and they are all damage because of the tape.Don't buy it
Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief!  Didn't even use it once!  Don't bother!!!
do not waste your moneyi got it and i tried with  2 strollers the same exact one but it would not work goodyou can not  move that much and its hard to make a turn......
These don't stick at all! My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up. The adhesive wouldn't restick either. What a waste. :(
it never worked, i cleaned the surface and followed direction...failed.tried with double sided tape... failed.tried with regular tape.... failed.i think the problem is that it's not smooth again the surface on top, so it creates a little gap and easily falls off.
could not even try it it didn't fit on our crib. looks like a good idea.
What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!
Bought two based on a lot of the good reviews, one for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms. The splash guard can hurt your son. Also the splash guard doesn't work to keep the pee from shooting out from under the seat. If you have a girl it might be for you, if you have a boy don't get this seat. Make sure you read the other reviews about boys and this potty seat. Also the seat is bulky and very annoying to get it to fit each time. This potty seat has discourage our son from wanting to use the potty. If anyone who has had a hard time potty training their kids this will make it so much harder!!
I didnt know you had to lift the seat up to use this.  there is a rubber thing inthe back that stops you from placing it on the seat itself, you need to lift up the seat and place it on the dirty part of the rim....all b/c of that stupid rubber thing in the back.  I evem tried cutting it off, but it still doesnt help.  this was a poor design.
Love the company but this trainer does not fit a round toilet and seat. (We have a Toto with a Bemis seat.) This is not entirely clear in the product description, so I hope this review helps others avoid the hassle of ordering and returning.
We have a standard size and shape toilet seat. Yet, this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner, causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat. Granted, I have little boys, so maybe this isn't so much of a problem with girls.We had MUCH better luck with the Mommy's Helper Cushie Tushie potty seat (the one with the ducks on it), which is, incidentally, much cheaper and easier to clean. The same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat.
I'm surprised by how well this is rated so I decided to add my two cents to the minority.The PROS:  Fits snugly on any seat. We have round and elongated and it fits both no problem. Also, easy to clean.  I also like the look of it; simple and clean. I put one in the guest bathroom and I can leave it there when I have people over.The CONS: By the time you get the seat cover up, the pants down, the seat on and plop you kid on the toilet he's already pee'd hisself.The slashguard - after watching my sons try to get up from it on there own I quickly realized they might end up eunuchs. Even with the stool and me standing there it is still dangerous; they have to be lifted.  When they try to maneuver around it, the seat becomes dislodged from putting there weight on one side. I was horrified to hear that some boys actually pulled their skin open and needed stitches. I was even more appalled by some reviewers saying that the parents should have been more vigilant. With all the worry and guilt inherant in parenting thats just a mean thing to say; and not trure.  The whole point of potty training is to get your child to go on their own. They can't learn if you are hovering every time.I bought the built in toilet seat instead. There are two seats in one so both children and adults can use it.
My daughter is on the thinner side and at 18 months struggles to get comfortable in this chair. She's not able to sit on it without falling in. There's no way that she could sit on this for any length of time because she's having to hold her weight so she doesn't fall in. In addition, the splash guard makes sitting on this super awkward. Another mother wrote about how her daughter needed stitches after cutting her genitals on the splash guard. I can totally see how this can happen. It's not safe for your child to independently seat themselves without some help.
So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty.  I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean.  But every time we put her on it, after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt.  What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep.  Then she doesn't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared.  She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her.  Also, every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it.  It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt.  I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success.
I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews. My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer! She'll sit on it, but it's so small. The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her. She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her. When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably.
Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk.  If not right on target, you're going to have a mess every time.  Think pee puddle under the chair... and now imagine the smell.  Totally gross, and getting rid of ASAP.Skip.
This was the second potty we bought for our son, who is almost 3.  In one word - horrible.  I had a lot of hope that, with all the excellent reviews, we'd find success with this one.  The basic issue is the splash guard, which really doesn't work at all.  Pee still goes everywhere.  I'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that's nearly impossible.  If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I've tried, I would have saved my money.
I started out my son with elimination communication (EC aka early start potty training, of which Amazon carries great books by 3 different offers on the subject) when he was 6 wks old.  We kept it up until he was 4 months old and then I stopped because my mother-in-law thought it was "weird" - I tried to start again when he was 6 months but he was already attached to his diapers.  I could really kick myself now that he's 2 and many many poop diapers later!  Anyhow we had the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty when we were doing EC and it worked great cuz we could manuver him and pee him sitting down.  The pee gaurd is in the opinion of more than just our family, TERRIBLE for toddlers!  After he bumped it sitting down I couldn't get him near the potty for weeks.  I am not usually into frills and over the top plastic toys but I love the fisher price potty we got him instead.  I didn't put batteries in it - too much for me.  I love it.  My son actually uses it.  It has a REMOVABLE splash gaurd.  Our boy pees standing up anyhow - just like Papa! It looks more like a grown up potty except it has a cartoon smiley face.  I thought the smiley face silly at first but since it makes my son like it more it kinda makes me happy now.  And the potty seat removes so you can put it on your toiletseat for easing toddlers nerves when moving onto to toilet training.  Not as simple-looking as the Baby Bjorn but a much better potty in many many ways.
I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn.  Unfortunately, I haven't even given birth yet and I already know they're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros: inexpensive.The cons: These diapers are horribly rough, even after a washing.  The fabric is fraying and even triple folded, these things do not hold liquid.  Since I'd already washed them I figured I could at least use them for dish towels, but they merely move the water around on whatever surface you're trying to dry, they don't absorb.Save your money and skip these...and buy a higher quality cloth diaper.
I'm not sure how other people can give these a good review, or maybe I don't know what they're supposed to be used for? Certainly not diapers!  My mother recommended that I get some flatfold cloth diapers just for cleaning up messes, using for burp pads, etc.  The ones she meant were the cushioned ones, however. These are the consistency of cheesecloth - I mean like, see-through! I'm returning immediately.
The can never be used as DIAPERS!  They are cheese cloth.  In fact they may have more holes than cheese cloth does.  There is no way that these diapers will hold anything that they are going to need to hold.  Don't waste your money.
I just received these as a gift and will be returning them. I had intended to use them as burp cloths, but they are way too thin and not absorbent at all! You can see right through them. Plus, the fabric is really scratchy. Not at all what I was expecting.
I just want to start of saying that I had purchased these with the intent of cloth diapering my baby.  I had used Gerber flatfolds and prefolds on my first two children back in 2000 and 2002.  They were amazingly awesome back in the day, so I'm wondering what on earth happened.These are very thin . . . I mean see through thin.  I couldn't even use them as a changing, shoulder or lap pad in a pinch. Any baby "mishap" would immediately seep through.  Not only that, they feel very rough - not something you'd want to rub on a newborn baby's skin to clean spit-up or drool.I feel bad for giving such a poor review because I'm normally a huge fan of Gerber products.  I just think that these are pointless and a waste of money.  You can find better flatfolds for nearly the same price as these.  As far as burp cloths, the Gerber prefold diapers work awesome for those.
Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby.  But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought "cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations."I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality.  After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my "diapering diapers" for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!
I was very disappointed in this product. It was highly recommended by the hospital, so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born. After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks, I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple. We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those, either. We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium. She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those. Now she's a pro! (Anyone need my Medela set????)
The bottle quality isn't great for the price.  Dr. Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style.  So you can pump and use, just as you would with these bottles. If you use regular bottles, the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in. Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles.  I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey, when I use up all of those, I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles.
i got these to put on my bed for my son's morning massage-cuz by now it's no secret what little boys do once those nappies come off! the first time i used it i seriously used the expression "let's see how good these really are"...only to be terribly disappointed: upon turning him over (yes he did let out a dose)i found i had really let my child lay in a puddle!! this o so absorbent pad really did nothing but allow for a greater area of redistribution. i even ventured to put my hand into it to see how much was absorbed n literally had stuff dripping from my fingers!!this was a waste of my money. i am back to using a regular sheet folded over.
Yes they leak, I mean POUR milk from under the sealing ring.  Don't waste your money.  If you are crazy enough to buy them SAVE YOUR RECEIPT!
We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar. The infant size tub was fine, and still works okay after 2 years. However, the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak. The first one we bought had a very slow leak; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak, so we bought another one, thinking we wouldn't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.Wrong!!The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub. At first it was so slow, it just meant we'd have to reinflate it once in a while; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it won't last through one bathing without going limp. After the second flop, I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement. They never responded to my friendly letter. When I finally called (took me a while to get around to it; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now!), they were totally unhelpful.The woman who answered at "Customer Service" kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns, and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer. Way to stand behind your products, dudes!Then when I called the retalier (Right Start) just now, they said that it's not their responsibility to handle a replacement, it's the manufacturer's-- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she's ask her boss and look into it more, just to see if there is anything they can do.I'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers, especially repeat customers such as myself. I mean, come on, how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy??However, since that is their attitude, you're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life (non-virtual) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy, such as Babies-R-Us or Target, so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement. That's what we'll be doing from here on out.So long, Kel-Gar. The tub was "just ducky" but your service was DOA!Update: No go on the replacment. Big surprise.Although not quite as cushy as this tub, I would highly recommend getting your baby or toddler the PRIMO EuroBath instead. We got it after having to give up on inflatables, and it is roomy, comfortable, and DURABLE, unlike Kel-Gar's products. 4.5 stars with 750 reviews on Amazon- you can't beat that!PRIMO EuroBath Pearl White
I was hoping this would be a good transition tub for my 6 month old who is growing out of the tub that fits in the sink.If you are in the same situation, I caution you with this purchase -1) It reeks like plastic and has for weeks.2) it is dangerously slippery. My son can sit up very securely, however he immediately slid. I even bought a tub mat insert to try, and he still slipped.3) It barely fits into our tub.
Too small.  It felt worthless for what I wanted.  I ended up buying a 12&#34; 7.5&#34; tall wedge with memory foam that is a lifesaver!
So tiny and hard as a rock.  Inexpensive, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Not even using. Makes me more uncomfortable.
I was terribly uncomfortable and needed some support for my baby belly, but this was not even close to the answer to my problem. I'll say it again because these are the only two words worthy of writing about this product:Terrible and pointless.
I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!
This item seems like a good idea, but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to "new parent baby marketing". Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it. She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved. I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around, bang it, or throw it. Also, it's a total pain to clean it. The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.Save your money on this one.
I bought this when my daughter was 6 months old to help her learn to chew. It is very flimsy and floppy when food is in it. She just played with it (flipping it around) thinking it was a toy. She is teething also so I thought it would definitely go in her mouth often, but she enjoyed throwing it around instead.
I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion.  I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me.  Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!
I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them.
If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others.
I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often.  What a waste!!  The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective.  You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent.  In additon to this, the cost is ridiculous.  The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof.  They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart. These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design. Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags.
Something like this is a great idea, but when I called to ask the fire dept. to inspect my car.  They said not to add any after-market things to car seats or seat belts. The firefighter said this could weaken the seat belt over time and it may break in a crash. They also said that the headrest for the infant seat was dangerous because it adds more room between baby and the seat, which may cause the baby to be injury seriously in an accident.I took both out of my car. The mighty tite is just collecting dust.  I have no plans of using it or giving it away.  If I can't find a use for it, I'll probably throw it away.  The headrest is in the bouncer or the swing. They are great for around-the-house everyday use.
Don't buy this. It's not safe, can cut your seatbelt, and kill your child.You need to get a good install without this dangerous product.
I bought this sheet because I believed everything should be &quot;form fitting&quot; if my son was to be in it - to prevent possible suffocation, choking....This sheet was so rough I could not lay my baby on it.  After washing 3-4 times with loads of fabric softener - no difference.I used it once and it's been in the closet ever since.I ended up putting a thin blanket in the packnplay and tucking it into the sides instead.  It was soft, and when my child was sleeping he didn't pull it out.If and when I use the pack and play as a playpen, I may pull the sheet out and try again.  For the basinett - don't bother.
While it looks like it would be a great color, it's poorly made (thread count must be super low) and when it comes out of the drier, it has "balls" collected over it which also makes the sheet not-so-soft.  Go for the white!  I have a couple of white pack 'n play sheets and they are holding up much better!!
Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet.  Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads.  I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels.  Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry.  Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry.
I had two of these sheets for my first child because that's all I could find at the time. Other reviewers are right on about the quality. VERY thin and not very soft either. You can see the pattern right through them.Now that we're expecting our second child any day and she'll be sleeping in the play yard for a long bit, I wanted to see what else was out there.I found the following brands at BRU, bought one of each and tried them on the bed. Here's what I found:Nojo: Terrycloth-like fabric. Soft but still a bit thin. They are elasticized though, which is easier to put on and stays on better. There were three colors available at the store (dark blue, light blue, white). Price $9.99Graco quilted sheet: Very plush, though the fabric is synthetic feeling (I didn't check, but I'd guess poly blend). Most comfortable of any that I tried. Will probably use it under a more natural feeling sheet. Elasticized and stayed on well. Was only available in a dark blue. Most expensive at $14.99Carter portable crib sheet: Knit fabric. On the thin side, but soft. Stayed on well, was elasticized and came in at least 4 colors (green, white, blue, yellow). Price $7.99Koala portable crib sheet: Listed thread count of 220 and it felt like a very decent quality. Elasticized, available in a variety of colors (pink, white, blue, green, etc) and one of the cheaper ones out there at $6.99Overall, I was VERY pleased with the options out there. Highly suggest NOT buying these, but going with an elasticized sheet. Both the Carters and Koala sheets are cheaper and are better quality.The Pack 'n Play fitted sheets will only be used as under sheets from now on!
These sheets are incredibly thin and cheap. The elastic isn't good, and the fabric is just not soft. We've bought several other brands, all of which were better than this stuff.
I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one. These really are terrible sheets. I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they're manufactured by the same company. Boy was I wrong. They don't fit the pad very well regardless if it's laying flat for the playpen or if it's set up for the bassinet. Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn't stay put very well at all. They are also cheaply made. Thin isn't even the word. It's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. I'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. The pad wipes down well and if i'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. Since she's always wrapped in a blanket she doesn't mind going w/o the sheet.
We couldn't get the sheet on right.  It kept lifting the corners of the floor mat.  They weren't soft like the others either.  We never used them... You can find ours at Goodwill.  Waste of money.
These sheets are not good at all.  I am a big fan of Graco products, but not these!  They are thin, and not soft at all.  I ended up making my own sheets...all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners, they don't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it.  Plus, a lot cheaper!
I bought these because they are washable and the box said they are 100% cotton.  However, while prepping them for first use, they just about RUINED my very expensive Rowenta iron. Why, you ask? Why would the cotton setting NOT work on a cotton breast pad? Because the brainiacs who made them decided to use some sort of nylon-based serger thread on the edging! I started to iron the first one, and my iron began sticking to the pad. I peeled it off the iron, and there, in a perfect circle, were little melted remnant marks from the thread. It is not even polyester thread, which tolerates a VERY high heat (i.e., cotton) setting from an iron.I am so incredibly disappointed. I really wanted to use these because they are cotton. So, off to the drawing board, I will just have to sew my own. And in case you are wondering why I would iron them, they come out of the wash very wrinkly (whether you air dry or put in the dryer; I washed them twice for prepping and did both drying methods). One of my girlfriends said she had tried them and they were very noticeable under her shirt because of the wrinkling, thus, my plan was to iron them smooth after each wash.If you don't mind wrinkles, or are planning on using a padded nursing bra, then I suppose these would work for you... But if you are like me, and prefer no padding in your bra, then I would give these a pass.
I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!
I have tried 4 other brands and these are the worst. I haven't had any problems with leakage (with this or any other brand) but after 3-4 washes the Medela pads are so wrinkled and have lost their shape that I can't wear them with anything without them showing through. I would not recommend these unless you were going to hand wash them - but who has time with a new babe! Especially, when the other brands are holding up just fine after the same number of washes.
My 13 month old immediately pulled off the covers and started playing with them.  She loved them and thought they were a cool new toy but they did not do the intended job.  They pull off very easily even though they were a perfect fit on the rail.
If you have an Oeuf Sparrow Crib, these rail protectors are too small. Not sure how they would work if they fitted!
My 11-month-old can easily remove these protectors, making them worse than useless--they're actually an additional hazard. Buy something else instead.
I bought this at babies r us. It did not fit my rail. It says it fits most standard rails but doesn't give any measurements. How are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it? What a pain.
I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product.  I bought these crib rail protectors and my twin boys figured out how to remove them within a few days and they are under 9 months old.  So not only did I waste my money purchasing these, but both of my cribs also have a bunch of teeth marks... exactly what I was trying to avoid.  What a waste!
This item is useless. It does not keep fingers out and it also doesn't fit larger plugs. I do not recommend it to anyone.
for where we needed this it didn't work do to the plug's we had in the outlets the cover wouldn't fit.
This is one of the worst products created for child safety. It didn't fit our standard power cord, the front section opened really easily (actually had a hard time getting it to stay closed) and once we opened the back section to plug things in, couldn't get the back section closed again. Also, the opening at the top is huge! Definitely big enough for my 9-month old to stick her fingers in, which is kind of the opposite of its purpose. I sent it back and moved around furniture to hide our power cords instead.
Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief!  Didn't even use it once!  Don't bother!!!  Just use a pillowcase & it works just as well...
these leak and don't colapse use the older rolled liners they do not leak.  and you can see them colapse like they should
I have wasted so much milk using these drop-ins.  I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners, and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter.  Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk, and believe me, I've done that many times.  I've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole, I'll only waste a little bit.  But, come on, I'm sleep deprived, and stressed and sometimes I forget, and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter, and I shouldn't have to check like that for a product I've paid for.  No good.Out of a box of 100 liners, I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak.  That's quite a lot; we're not talking one or two here.  Unfortunately, I've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples, so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I cannot afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle.  I'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter.  I would NOT recommend.
People...please don't get ripped off. I went to Walgreens and got a large 50 count of underlayment pads that fit perfectly on our changing table for 3.99  Please don't fall victim to the cute designs and baby marketing gimmicks. These work...but you can get the exact same thing at your pharmacy for much much less.
These are very small in size and "paper-towel-like", kinda feel like napkins that are made with recycled paper. We bought a pack and just couldn't use it because it is so small. I'd rather just use paper towel instead if I were to use these. For us we now use the babies R Us brand, they are much bigger and has a plastic feel to it, which is much more durable.
First, we read the directions and we follwed them.  But this never seemed to work the same way twice.  Sometimes at 4 min. the formula was too hot and sometimes at 6 min. it wasn't hot enough.  There was no rhyme or reason to it, we had it set the same way every time.  We used it for a month and then threw in the towel.
So we have used this bottle warmer for over 8 months now. I have to say, with all the sleep deprived parents using this item, often in the middle of the night, you would think that Avent would be wise enough to put an auto-shut-off feature on this little doohickey. But, no. I exclusively feed my baby breastmilk, and that stuff is like "liquid gold" (from what everyone has told me, and I'm inclined to agree), and I can't even tell you how often I have put a bottle in the warmer to warm it and then forgot it was in there for like 15 minutes. The milk gets boiling hot in that time, and then it's useless and I have to pour it out because it's not supposed to be heated to boiling. I know people are probably going to read this and wonder how one could forget that they put a bottle in the warmer, but now that our baby is sleeping through the night, it's more for when my husband is giving her a bath, I will get the bottle ready for him as he gives her a bottle after her bath and puts her to bed (his time with her during the week). So many times I have forgotten it was in there and burned the milk, but also - and this is the really dangerous part - the light will shut off for like 30 seconds at a time (what they call "blinking", if you can believe that), and so often it will look like it's turned off when there is no bottle in it, but it isn't, and it will just keep heating the water in there until it's all gone. We have found it on after a couple of hours away from it because we didn't notice the "blinking" light because it was off at the time, and there is no other indication that it's on from the front. The switch is on the back and it's not clearly marked "on/off" either. I can't imagine how it hasn't caught fire for other people or melted the plastic when the water is all gone. Thankfully, I have noticed it before the water was completely gone, but it was almost gone. How unsafe! Anyway, I still use it because I haven't found one with an auto-off feature, but will be looking for one. I have to set the timer on my microwave now whenever I put a bottle in because half of my brain cells disappeared when my baby was born apparently, and I'm way too distracted to remember it's on. BAD DESIGN!!!
Before using to warm actual food or milk for my son I tested it out.  In the recommended time it was hot enough to leave blisters on my wrist when I tested it!
This thing is very hard to figure out. One setting gets the bottle too hot too fast, try another setting for 15 min's and you still have cold milk! I tried to use it for 3 months... finally gave up. Save the money. Warm water in the microwave and stick the bottle in that... Sometimes we need to listen to our mom's and grandma's - they didnt have these and we turned out fine!
Save your money.  You can heat a bottle faster under hot running tap water or by heating a bowl of water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in it.  This bottle warmer is definitly not a necessary item.  It is expensive and it takes too long to heat a bottle.
I am primarily breastfeeding, but I thought this would be useful for sterilizing pump parts and the occasional bottles, etc..  I discovered Medela Microwave Steam Cleaning Bags instead, and this thing went in the closet.  I feel badly for the waste of money...but the bags are SO much easier!!!  And not space consuming.  Plus you can use them during travel, at the office, etc..  Much more cost efficient and useful!
I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!
I used this item 3 times, now its collecting dust.  Most books that I've read and my doctor agrees that it really isn't necessary to sterilize bottles.  They only need to be washed in very hot soapy water.  My son goes through tons of bottles a day and its not convenient to sterilize them in this item.  You can only fit 4 bottles in there at a time.  Save your money and wash you bottles well by yourself!
I bought this item to hang onto the side of our pack n play. It didn't work for what we wanted, and we sent it back. Thanks to amazon's awesome return policy. If your looking for something like this for your pack n play, I'd recommend something else. This doesn't fit over the edge of the pack n play.
This was a total piece of garbage.  Several things are wrong.1.  It doesnt fit every changing table.  When I attach it to mine, it tilts downward and is not level at all.  You need to have a bottom slat or base to support it under the top slat it will go onto.2.  The side compartments keep falling off because they dont attach they just fit over the edges.3.  The biggest complaint is that the wipe tray does not fit every wipe box or wipe warmer and we have the same brand name wipe warmer that made this product.4.  Consider that you will be taking away 5 inches of walk space around your changing table after you put this hunk of plastic onto it.If you have your changing table in a small area or corner of a room, this makes a difference.What a cheaply made piece of plastic.Pass this up and buy a wall shelf to go over the changing table instead.
Cheap material, I returned it.It is not sturdyenough to use ever day.I was even afraid tobrake before returning the stuff.
It's useless. The one I bought came broken into pieces and Amazon refunded me the full amount. Thanks to Amazon.This so inferior and cannot hold much. Nowadays I believe no one is using tiny soap bottles or cream bottles as it's cheaper to buy the big ones. This cannot hold any of those.
This was cracked in the back when we got it so we sent it back and got our money back.
After reading all the reveiw on this, I believed I HAD to have this tub. It is bulky and a pain to use. Our daughter never liked it. Buy the sponge - it is a couple of bucks and really all you need, in my opinion.We just sold it in our garage sale - I think we probably used it about 3-4 times before we gave up because of the hassle.
We registered for this site unseen based on the reviews.  It greeted us on the porch of our house when we arrived home with the baby.  At first, I thought a refridgerator had been delivered!  (Okay...slight exaggeration.)  But it was HUGE.(...)
Arrived caved in from shipping. If a plastic tub can't endure shipping, how can it handle a growing toddler? I had a nightmarish experience returning through Marketplace, horrible experience for a cheap overpriced tub. I ended up ordering the hoppop bath, which I love. The PRI tub certainly wasn't worth the $50 I spent. Go to Bed,Bath,& Beyond to see it in person and pay $24.99 if you really want it. I still prefer the hoppop that I purchased through Amazon.
This was the ONLY bathtub I purchased, based on all of the stellar reviews, and BOY was I disappointed!! My baby was only 6 pounds full-term, and this tub was HUGE!! Even with the so-called supports the tub has, she still slid all over the place, and I still had to lean over the side of the tub and hold her very carefully! She hated it and so did I, and to this day (18 months later!) she HATES the tub and we're still doing sink-side sponge baths!! If I had to do it again, I'd get one of the smaller tubs that has the sling-type support! IF YOUR BABY IS A PREEMIE OR IS JUST ON THE SMALLER SIDE, DO NOT BUY THIS TUB - IT IS JUST WAY TOO HUGE AND REALLY HAS NO SUPPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE MUNCHKIN DUCKY TUB FOR $15, AND I WAS ABLE TO GET HER TO CLIMB INTO THE TUB AND EVEN START PLAYING WITHIN THE FIRST 5-10 MINUTES OF HER LAYING EYES ON IT!! It's considerably smaller, has walls that go straight up (versus being slanted, like the Primo) all the way around, and I think it just makes her feel so much more secure and safe!! Should've gone with this from the beginning.....
I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all. I thought it was very difficult to use. (until you get used to it)  It didn't contain the smell well at all. The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to.  The lid also kept coming off of mine. I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better.
Buy the Diaper Champ instead. The Diaper Genie's only redeeming quality is the fact that it closes at the top. Otherwise, it's kind of a pain in the rear. I stick air freshners to it to compensate-I think that says it all.
I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.  Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.  Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.  I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie. infant, original and toddler.  Still didn't do the trick.  I even put air fresheners in and near it....  Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.  Still a hassle to remove the "diaper weenie" so now I just use a normal trash can.  Much less hassle and same results.
It's a neat idea...the problem is...the replacement bags cost too much and don't justify the convenience.  Honestly, my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in.  They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers.  At the end of the day, we toss them out into the garage...end of story.  If you really need this kind of doodad, there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag...that's much better than this deal.
