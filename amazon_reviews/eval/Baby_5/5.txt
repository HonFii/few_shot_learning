Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!
This book is such a life saver.  It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends, answer pediatrician questions, or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn.  I think it is one of those things that everyone should be required to have before they leave the hospital.  We went through all the pages of the newborn version, then moved to the infant version, and will finish up the second infant book (third total) right as our baby turns 1.

Helps me know exactly how my babies day has gone with my mother in law watching him while I go to work.  It also has a section for her to write notes and let me know anything she may need.  I couldn't be happier with this book.
I bought this a few times for my older son and have bought it again for my newborn. This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine. When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work. Excellent for dads to keep track as my husband can quickly forget what time he fed our son. LOL
My 3 month old son spend half of his days with my mother and half with a neighbor while I worked.  I had them track his activity (loosely) in this which allowed me to get an idea of how his schedule was developing and how much milk he was eating.  It was the best way to have some cohesion in his life while I was at work.
This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.
The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available. You can track naps, feedings, diaper changes, activities, and notes. They're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker, which tracks nights and days. It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones. Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now. Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day. It's a great way for me to know what happened. Plus, it's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends.
During your postpartum stay at the hospital the nurses will ask you to keep a log of your baby's feedings, urination and bowel movements. However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk. For a while I wasn't sure what was giving him horrible gas, so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy (we have a peanut allergy in the family). We even write notes about his first smile, who came to visit, ect to keep in his memory box.
I use this so that our babysitter (grandma) can keep track of what goes on during the day.  We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book.
Has columns for all the info I need at a glance when I get home from work. Nanny is able to fill it out easily....love it
Easy to use, simple! I got this when my baby was 2 months old and love it. It makes it easy to track things and write down developmental notes in an organized way. I know moms who create spreadsheets of their baby's nap times, etc. But I'm not one of those people! This book is practical and great!
We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!
This item was extremely helpful, especially with 3 adults sharing baby care responsibilities. My husband of mom didn't have to wake me up to ask when the baby had eaten or been changed. It helped me keep a written record to take to Dr appts so I had all the information they ask you for on hand already, and even helped me note and analyze baby's sleep patterns once he got a little older. Definitely a useful item to have.
I've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital.  We're on the third one now.  It's useful for when the doctor asks how often she's feeding and urinating, but even better for looking at and realizing, &#34;Oh, she hasn't slept in x number of hours.  She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.  I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern, then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day.  It helps a lot.
Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!
I've been using this since the day my baby was born (1 month ago) and it is a life saver!  It is a great way to track when I breastfeed, what breast he ate from, how long, etc.  Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers.  Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.  I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life!
I didn't think I would really use this and I was wrong.In the hospital they were constantly asking &#34;when was her last diaper?&#34;, &#34;when did she eat and for how long?&#34; - ummmm I was on pain killers for a c-section and a mass of hormones. I finally got this out and started keeping track using this.Yes, you could just use regular paper, but I liked the layout of the pages and it was just what we needed a we slowly lst our minds for the first 6 weeks.I an on giving this as a shower gift to the next first time mom :)
I have used this book since my son was born.  It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.  I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old.
I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.
I have used this tracker for all 3 of my children and swear by it! It is super easy to leave by the baby's changing table or crib and jot down things throughout the day (feedings, dirty diapers, nap times, etc). I also used it to jot down other important &#34;mile stone&#34; things that I would have quickly forgotten&#8230;like outings, temperature readings, visits from friends to meet him, calls to make, when we stopped swaddling him, etc. I was able to use it as a resource when (many months later!) I went back to formally fill out his baby album since I would have forgotten so many of those valuable little tidbits of information & memories.
We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the "Notes" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps "Dad" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!
GREAT journal. We use this everyday to communicate feeding, medicine and other needs when I don't have time to give my nanny the full rundown. LOVE it! I've bought two!
I have been using this baby tracker for three months and it has been very useful.  My little one had feeding issues and it was necessary to explain his habits and behavior to the pediatrician and several lactation consultants.  His feeding issues also contributed to sleep issues, which I was also able to track in the journal.  After weeks of sleep deprivation, the Dark Period, I could easily respond to the pediatrician's questions by referring to entries in the baby tracker.It's nice to look back at the Dark Period and see how far we've come.
Great way to keep track of important daily activities/tasks when you are trying to get used to your new baby's routine.I include this as a gift to all of my friends now when they are having a baby.
Love this book! Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms! Especially during those first few weeks/months when growth spurts are common and you can't remember anything because you haven't slept much!
I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day. It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work.
This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It's also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it's a great gift!
Please, please take this to the hospital with you- you'll thank me later. We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO &#34;out of it&#34; dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns. Can't recommend enough!
This has been my go to for my scheduling of my twins. They are four months old now and I have their care givers fill this in when they can. That way I have an idea of the schedule they are developing. I highly recommend this!
While I love the app on my phone (Baby ESP) for my husband and I-- it's not realistic for someone filling in to download the app. Our parents, who frequently watch our baby, have yet to embrace the app world.So, we use this on days when we have help. It keeps track of everything the doctor will ask you. (How many poop diapers, how many pee diapers, how often are you feeding, how often is he sleeping, what's his schedule like). We usually end up entering the data when we get home so our app can tabulate everything for us in easy to read charts.I kind of like this too because it helps us to review what was going on during the day while we weren't at home.
The Daycare workers were offended by the book at first but after explaining its usefulness they realized how handy it is becoming.
This is probably one of the greatest inventions. Before my baby was born, I purchased this and figured it's a nice-to-have item.I didn't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple, but easily organized log book. When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months. (I bought a second one after the 3 months one was done.)I used it to keep track of diaper changes and what kind (pee/poop), naps, and how long my baby nursed on each side. I also wrote notes for each day so I could see a history of reactions/milestones. It made it easier to figure out what gave my baby gas or why she slept better on certain days.Coupled with the Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Timer (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you! One of the most useful items yet.
This product is awesome. It was so helpful to keep track of feedings and diaper changes in those early, sleep-deprived days. Would definitely recommend and will likely purchase again for our next baby.
Perfect way to keep track of the day for a little one-- this journal allows for detailed tracking of milk intake, diapers, sleep, and activity. Highly recommended as a perfect way to keep track and organize information in one easy to travel with place!
This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months.  Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).  Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again.
I did a lot of researching on what baby journal to buy and settled on this one and I did not regret it even for a second. This book is perfect! You can keep track of anything your baby does, from eating and sleeping and diapering to all the other things they do like first smile and first laugh. I only wish that instead of being 3 months it would be longer, like 6 months or even 1 year. I would definitely recommend for the first months of your baby's life.
I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms.
My son's therapist brings this toy over and he just loves it.  He loves to move the ladder on the fire truck up and down.  This is one of his favorite toys and he doesn't play with a lot of baby and toddler toys (gets bored easy).
Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest.
These are such nice cars to teach little ones numbers and the stacking value.  Ours have been scooted across the floor, cat's tail, into walls, you name it and they've always come back for more.  It's just a nice change from the nesting blocks and it's fun to hear all the vehicle sounds that children make with these guys.  I'd buy them again for sure!
These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.
I bought this last month for my 6 month old son, and it continues to fascinate him.  It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!  He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too! Great value for money...
We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!
This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.
I was looking for something different than your typical stacking cups for my sons birthday.  His aunt got him these.  What a hit! My son can't quite stack them himself, but he knows how to nest them and sure does love knocking them down when I stack them.  They also have the function of just being play cars, which is nice.  I am amazed at how long my son will play with these!
For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.

I had a homemade quiet book when I was a kid and saw some on pinterest.  Since I don't know how to sew, I visited Etsy to see if I could buy one from that site.  I couldn't believe the prices!  I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.  Great book, and I love that all the pieces are attached!
I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it's an item that he can grow into and it's super cute!
my 3 and 4 year old love this book. we take it to church to entertain them and each week they are excited to get it out
I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.
I got this quiet book for my 11 month old - for his 1st birthday coming up. He hasn't been able to play with it yet, but I was very happy going through it. I think he will have years of fun with this book. It provides several activities, which will help him practice skills he will be learning. It's also got bright colors and fun shapes that he is sure to enjoy. Can't wait to give it to him! Thanks.
While I sort of wish I could change the batteries in these things instead of buying a new one when it dies (my little guy HAS to have it vibrate), this was a life saver for me when both my kids (one 4 years and one 6 months) were/are teething. And for my youngest, it's just about the only thing that works.
This was a favorite as soon as my son figured out that when he would bite it, it would vibrate. It either is really soothing or he just likes how it feels or something because hes 10mo old now and he still loves it...! Handle is great to put links around also to attach it to stroller or carseat!
My daughter likes this one. She especially loves the rattle at the end and the vibrating motion. I believe this is for babies that are a little more older. I gave this to her when she was 4 months since she keeps on sticking items in her mouth.
my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.
It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.
Great teething ring and toy.My 6 mth loves it, its so much fun.he loves the vibration, the little color wheel to the other end he loves to spin.something fun to bite on for his aching gum.I recommend it!
My son loved this toy form the time he was teething until well after the time he got his teeth in. I plan on buying this for my daughter who is now 3 months even though she is not teething yet, she loves putting things in her mouth.
The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He's already figured out how to activate the vibration.  It is soft, yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums.  I think baby gives it 5 stars!!!There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT.  So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us, they do not appear to be replaceable.
Great toy for teething! My daughter finds this very interesting especially when it gently vibrates and massages her gums. It didn't take her long to press down with her front teeth to activate the massaging action. She's enjoyed this just about everyday since we got it about 3 months ago. No issues with it! I sent one to a friend who just had her baby for when she starts teething.
I am so glad we invested in this product....at the time the baby was teething like a feind and this was a life saver!!!
A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don't really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!
This is a great teether.  It is very easy for the little one to stimulate the vibrating action, making it a huge hit!
The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.
My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)
This toy was our go-to when my daughter was teething.  It really soothed her and calmed her down.  When her two year molars started coming in we got it back out for her and she still loved it.  We will definitely be buying another one for our next baby!
Both my daughters loved this teether. It made them happier than any other product on the market, including a certain rubber giraffe.
Initially, my baby was not able to cause it to vibrate on his own because he just wasn't chomping down hard enough. But now, he can do it. Now, he's able to see the cause and effect of using this. I like that. Plus, I think it feels good on his gums.
My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.
I've bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.
If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.
Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.
We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.
I have two and the batteries haven't died which I find impressive. These are well made. A year later, my son still likes these and likes the green spinner on the end a lot.
We bought multiples of these, just so we'd have them.  It vibrates while our little 9-month-old bites on it!  He never took a pacifier, but this toy is the closest thing--sometimes when he's screaming, this toy is the only thing that'll calm him down.  So glad we found it.  Definitely worth the money.
Everyone should buy this!  Such a soothing gift.  My granddaughter liked to just explore with it as well,  Not necessarily just to sooth gums.
Our teething baby absolutely loved loved this product and would seek it out to sooth his sore gums.  Its lasted a year now with no issue or wear and tear.
A favorite in our house!
My daughter is 6 mo and loves these. No funky smell, bpa free. Just dont kneel in them! The star has rounded edges. So far so good.
This is a great toy for teething babies!  The colors catch their attention while the different shapes keep their hands and mouths amused.  The size is just right for them to actually hold on to it too.  I'd recommend it to any parent of a very young child- especially for the price!
My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.
I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes.
My son loves this.  He likes the &quot;kangaroo&quot; position best. He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way, and stopped immediately.  DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video, though.  At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags (returns?) without the book and video.  They are a must.  The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone aren't good for their developing bones.  Slings keep the baby in more natural positions.
I love these sheets because they are a thick and durable material. They fit on a standard pack-n-play too which is nice. Definitely worth the price.
I was a little nervous because so many people wrote that this adorable product did not fit Graco strollers well.  I am thrilled to report, however, that it fits the Graco Metrolite stroller perfectly and looks adorable!  Wonderful product!
you couldn't ask for a better diaper pail. one reason is, that you don't have to use certain bags inside the pail...can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over, you don't smell the dirty diapers. great product!
This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy.
Turned out to be a total stink bomb. Read my new review.  It absolutely reeks after 16 months.  Amazon will not let me alter the star rating or it would be only one starDo NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket (porous) to keep the stink in.  Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.  That smell can bowl you over.*3) Easy enough for visitors to use- too difficult for them to play with.  Many of the "grown-ups" in my world can't help but tinker with whatever new items are placed before them.  I'm thrilled they can't figure out how to open the DC.  As it emits a powerful odor when the lid is opened, I'm happy they can't figure it out.  I think this lid will confound any toddler, but it's really simple for parents once you get the concept down.I just wish it could empty its own "payload."  I'll definitely be first in line for the Diaper Champ robot.
Before my first child was born, I was all set to buy the Diaper Genie but then a friend told me about the Diaper Champ. She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags. So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags. My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. So far this has been a great product. The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly! But so far so good!!
I love the Diaper Champ!  I have no problems with odor at all.  And you don't have to buy or use special, expensive bags!  Any trash bag will work and it's great.  I like the odor shield bags and they work like a charm.  Easy to use one handed!!  Perfect for the nursery or any room in the house where baby is changed.
I love this product...  My sister in law has a baby 4 months older than my daughter, and she has a diaper genie.  She is stuck having to buy the special cartridges.  So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.  Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper. With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.  My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.  When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!!
Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.  So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It's very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!
It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags, more cost effective. It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well "hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable. I highly recommend it to anyone!
I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).  I love this diaper pail! My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!
In registering and purchasing products for my baby, I did a lot of research.  This included reading reviews, asking friends (lots) about products that did and didn't work for them, and actually trying to use some of the products.  I decided to go w/ the Diaper Champ after learning that the overwhelming majority of my friends absolutely hated that leading diaper pail the Diaper Genie and actually trying to use that awful contraption.  In fact in one circle of friends the Diaper Genie was re-gifted about four times b/c they were simply trying to get rid of it. I also did not like the idea of having to buy the special bags that the Diaper Genie requires.  The diaper champ uses regular kitchen bags. I have NEVER experienced an odor problem.  If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!  I usually change mine twice a week on garbage day.-You still have to clean the thing!! I usually spray the inside w/ Lysol when I change the bag and/ or wipe it w/ antibacterial wipes.  On occasion I wipe it w/ cleaner just as I would clean by bathroom.-For those complaining about toddler diaper odors.  Toddlers eat solids, their poop smell very adult like!  We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.
Works great! NO smells and holds lot of diapers. Uses standard kitchen bags! What a great product!
We've used this diaper pail for 16 months now and smell never escapes from it (except when we open it to change the bag). We use plastic trash bags from Target, we pay I think $4 for 100 bags. It's a deal and works great. I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.
i refused to buy the genie for the simple reason of i didnt want to be bothered with refills and i read that it clogged.  so i decided on this one and glad i did.  it is most excellent at keeping the foulest of stenches out.  and i love that i dont have to buy those EXPENSIVE refills.  just use the bags you have in your kitchen!  easy to replace when full and it just works!!!
I love these pails so much that we have two of them doing diaper duty!! It's odorless, effortless, and holds many diapers!  I also like the fact that you do not have to buy special bags for it and can use ordinary trash bags. A great invention!!
I bought this pail before my son was born. First we bought the Safety 1st Odor-less pail, but it was broken, and the store was out of stock when we returned it. I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.I love that it is so easy to use. My husband didn't even want a diaper pail because he didn't expect them to hold in any odors at all. Now that we have this one, he loves it. It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper. No twisting till your wrist breaks. At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well. I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags. My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers. The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail. All in all it's been a great buy.
I have three children.  For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky. I would not recommend buying that one.  My second child I didn't get any.  Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.  I have to say that I am very happy with it so far. I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it. I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.  It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.  I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.
I love the Diaper Champ...you don't have the need for expensive refills and there is very little odor.  The main odor is revealed when it is time to change the bag.  You almost want to change the bag outside!  I find that if I keep a small air freshener in the bottom, it does help...(like one for a car).  So easy to use, definitely recommend!!!
This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!
I highly recommend this product for several reasons:1) You do not have to buy bag refills.  You can use regular trash bags which cuts down on additional spending.  The trash bag is also very easy to take out and to put in.2) Traps in stinky diaper odor.  We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.  You just put the diaper into the slot and turn the handle, the plunger pushes the diaper into the bag.
My husband and I decided to get this one over the Diaper Genie because like most people, we didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.  We went to Costco and bought a big thing of garbage bags to use that seems to be lasting us FOREVER. Our daugher is now 4 months old, and we never had a problem with this. No odor or anything.  Extremely easy to use, no assembly required.
At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.  (We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.  We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!
We've been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we've have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.
My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
We didn't want to spend a fortune on a diaper pail and refills, so we opted for the Diaper Champ. We absolutely love it. We have used it for three months now and have had no problems with smells of any kind. Best of all, you can use any kind of bag, including reused plastic grocery bags!
I had checked into all of the pails before I had my little girl.  I heard great things about all of them, but wanted what would be most cost effective for us.  When we decided on the diaper champ, we won!1.  No refills to every buy.  you can use a standard trash bag and you don't have to spend the extra money for those refills.2.  I empty mine once a week on trash day and it is full.  However, there is never a smell eminating from my champ.3.  No stinky smells in my home.  Even though my daughter is only 2 months old, she has some of THE stinkiest diapers I have ever smelt!  But, there has never been any leakage of smell and it does not stink when I open it to change it.4.  I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.  Since those stinky diapers camp out in there for a week, it needs to be freshened up every now and then.Verdict:Get the champ....it will save you tons in the long run!!!
This is one of the things I can't live without. There are no bad smells until you open it. Using regular garbage bags is a huge money saver and there is plenty of room for tons of diapers! Plus it can also be used as a trash can!
you can use any ol' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!
I absolutely love this diaper champ. I was first drawn to it because no special bags were needed. It is so easy to use - one handed diaper disposable with the quick flip handle and so easy to empty. This item is a MUST HAVE!!!
The diaper champ is such a great product.  I keep it in my baby's bedroom in a corner and it has never produced any foul odors.  I love that I can use regular trash bags with it.  I only have to empty the bag once every 2 weeks (since most of the diaper changes happen downstairs).  But, even going that long, it does not smell.  I would never use one that required refills, what is the sense in that when this one works perfectly?!
I have used this for 11 months and I love it. What we did was after the baby started having odor in his #2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree (100 for $1) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags. So easy! Never an odor problem. And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it, so no special bags to buy.I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead. I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it!
the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink. of course you have to clean the whole thing out from time to time (which should be expected considering the toxic waste it stores!), but i never had any issues with smell, unless it was so full it had to be emptied anyway. what sold me on this diaper pail vs. the others, is that this one takes ANY plastic bag you want to put in it, meaning grocery bags, trash bags... nothing fancy. as a new mom (or new parent) you have enough things to worry about and spend your money on; last thing you need is to head to the store for diaper pail bags. no complaints from me on this diaper pail.
I agree it's better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It's very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.
I used to live in an apartment basement with NO WINDOWS and this 'stroke of genius' diaper champ did not smell at all! I ended up not even having to wash out the inside until 4mnths later! Sounds gross I know but that's how awesome it really is! AND it's super easy to use and you don't have to buy bag refills. Need I say more?
The Champ is the ultimate in Diaper disposal.  We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted (2 sets of refills every month).  The Diaper Champ uses regular trash bags (we like the scented 13 gallon bags by Ruffies) and is absolutely a no-brainer to operate!  Simply drop the diaper in the cubby on top and flip the handle!  The diaper falls into the belly of the champ and that's it!  Drop and flip!  No twisting, shoving or cutting like the Genie.  And this is perfect for babies that grow into inquisitive toddlers - the Champ is much bigger than the Genie so it can't be easily hauled around by an adventurous baby and it's easy to keep her out of the messy contents as well (unlike regular diaper pails or trash cans)!Another reason I prefer the Champ is the fact that there are no "blades" involved.  I just didn't like the idea of a diaper disposal with blades in my nursery.  The thought that someday she might get into the pail and possibly be cut on the sharp blades used for separating the bags - was frightening!  This is not a worry when it comes to the champ.  Just simple, clean, odor resistant, in-expensive to maintain/operate and safe!I'd recommend the Champ to anyone - buy it, you won't be sorry!
This is a wonderful product.  One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.  Right now, it's only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it.
We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital.  When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ.  We LOVE it!!!  The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell. . .impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce.  He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it.  In addition, it's very easy to use.  Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag.  Couldn't be simpler.  We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ.
This is a great pail.  It originally appealed to me because of the cost benefit of using any old plastic bag.  We buy the generic tall kitchen bags.  We soon found that another benefit is that you only have to change the bag every 6 or 7 days!  Additionally, it really has a one-handed operation.
It holds odors pretty well. Its great to be able to use any kind of trash bag you want with it. I do admit, older children's diapers are a bit too stinky in the diaper champ, but I never said this product was a miracle worker. I'm really happy with it and would recommend it to all of my friends and family.
We like that this product uses regular trash bags while still containing a lot of diapers.  It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day.  Highly recommend this.
Diaper Champ works great! You can use your regular garbarge bags with it. No need to buy re-fills.
Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!) - won't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.
I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch! It's so easy to use. I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months. Once she started eating more "real" foods, her diapers became much smellier. She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ. We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!
I purchased this diaper pail after struggling for several months with the Diaper Genie.  The Diaper Champ was hands down the best diaper pail I used while my child was in diapers (I used three: Diaper Genie, Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and the Diaper Champ).  I didn't have to spend loads of money on the special Diaper Genie bags anymore, it had far superior odor control as compared to the Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and it's really easy to use - drop a diaper in, flip the handle over, done!  I actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the Diaper Genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage-like casing.  I passed this diaper pail on to a friend once I was finished with it, and will happily purchase it for other friends in the future.
It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.
Easy to use, easy to clean, cheaper to use, not bad-looking either. Any plastic shopping bag will work in this diaper pail. The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it. But it will certainly be an even greater challenge for your child to open!
Stay away from the other brands that require special refill bags.  What a waste of money!  Even the "new and improved" Diaper Genie can't compare to the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills. I can't imagine why anyone would want to constantly buy expensive refills for a diaper pail, when a simple trash bag is all you need.As for the "smell" issue. Let's face it - diapers stink. And regardless of brand, ANY DIAPER PAIL WILL NEED TO BE EMPTIED ON A REGULAR BASIS. I really think some people don't realize this.  When I first had my son, I bought a diaper champ to keep at my mom's house.  When my mom used to change him, she'd dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ, but didn't change the pail.  After about a week she complained because it started to stink.  I had to explain to her that it wasn't a "magic pail", it was still just a covered trash bin.  (honestly, how did she raise 2 kids?...)  Now, mom's back on track and loving her Diaper Champ.As far as the odor issue goes, I have seen no difference in odor control between the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel, but neither are odor proof.
OK - my husband used to leave restaraunts when a couple with a baby in a diaper came in, but he doesn't even mind emptying the Diaper Champ at all.  (I know that's mostly because he's responsibile for those diapers now, but it's still a great product!)  We have NEVER noticed a diaper odor anywhere, not even while replacing the bag.Every time one of my husband's friends' wives gets pregnant, my husband buys the guy the Diaper Champ, AND THEY ALL LOVE IT!We have much less diaper odor than my firends with same-age babies have with Diaper Genie.  Also, they say that when you change bags in Diaper Genie, the stench is unbearable.  There isn't a bag-changing smell with Diaper Champ, because the diapers do get some air when the top is flipped to add a diaper.  Aerobic decomposition smells better than anaerobic decomposition, and whatever is going on in there, you smell it when you change bags.We do empty it twice a week (it gets full that often, anyway).It did get stuck a couple of times when it was WAY TOO FULL.  Letting it get too full and leaving it too long may contribute to odor issues, too.Not having to buy special bags saves us lots of time, hassle, and money.I do have one friend who "retired" hers to the back porch because of odor.  Her daughter was nearly two years old by then, and the contents of her diapers are a lot different from the contents of an infant's diapers.
I was recommended this by a fellow mom before we had our daughter and purchased it from Baby's R Us.  It's fabulous!  We've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it!  We save $$ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great.  We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can (because they don't smell) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL!!  A few times I'd forget to change it (I change it, my husband takes it out to the trash) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days, it does begin to smell, but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days.  So I just change it once a week and it's the best, no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!!  :-D  I'd recommend this to anyone!
This product was silly to me until my husband insisted me to put on up on my baby registry. I thought it would be silly to just throw away dirty diapers in there where I could just throw it in the trash can to save money. Then again, it was very useful since I have it next to the changing table. One, its holds seal tight of no smell in the baby bedroom. Two, no mess. Three, its very easy to use (all you need is to roll the handle back to dump the diaper and there it goes with a section for your next diaper). Well, my husband and I are very happy to get this in the mail.EDITED: 1/9/06At first I said it was great. But now I'm saying it stinks. It smells after about 3 months if you dont clean the champ itself. Such a hastle right? I think so, so I am going to recomment this item from great diaper champ to NOT SO GREAT DIAPER CHAMP. It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS! if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room. I still think old fashion trash can with a lid do much better cause one you know its full, you will throw the trash away. Im giving this a 1 start out of 5 stars.
To put it simply, this is a necessary item for every home with a baby..-no refill bags (tip--can store extra empty bags inside in the bottom)-easy to empty & clean-no odors-not big & bulky
This diaper pail is excellent. No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months.  I am very pleased with it.  I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder.  They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside.  Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out. I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).  Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.  Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly.
This is another great baby purchase.  When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a "gadgety" baby thing that we didn't need.  He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in.  I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors.  Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well.  Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.  Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!
We are 1st time parents &amp; I read all the reviews on diaper-disposal products.  Now our baby is 1 month old &amp; I've never smelled a poopy diaper (and we formula feed) in our nursery which is in our master bedroom.  We are both clean-addicts &amp; love this product. (NO EXPENSIVE REFILLS NEEDED!!!) We empty it twice per week &amp; have NO ODOR problems!Update at 7mos(July04): We managed to get BabiesRUs to let us exchange the DiaperChamp for a DiaperGenie and we were equally dissapointed with it too.  DiaperChamp was great until about 3 mos. &amp; then just smelled all the time.  Diaper Genie was no better - even with toddler-strength refills.  I have found it so much easier to use cheap ziplocks and throw diapers in regular trash that goes out each night anyway (both Diaper keepers required emptying every day &amp; would still smell).  I even tried wiping with Lysol or Clorox wipes daily &amp; those things are just a waste of time, effort and money.  Cheap ziplocks are easy to take with you - will work at home or for travel - and will cost about the same as a refill cartridge MINUS the $30-some bucks for the canister.  Dissapointing - wish it worked!
Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.  It works easily with one hand, which is important.  Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.  While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
Someone told me not to get the Diaper Genie, but invest my money in the Champ.  What sold me on it is that the Champ uses ordinary garbage bags, nothing proprietary.  As my baby gets older and the poops get stinkier, we do have some odor problems, but we tend to cram the diaper bags as full as possible.  If we changed it every couple of days, there would probably not be an issue.  When we smell something, we change the bag; problem solved.  My only *real* problem with it is that, now that my son is walking, he likes to put things into the hole and turn the handle to watch them disappear.  I keep waiting for the day when he throws away something important and I don't catch it!
My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!
ABSOLUTELY NO ODORS!!  I have a beagle who completely ignores the diaper champ, will eat out of every other garbage can in the house, but ignores the champ.  a bit of a struggle as diapers get bigger, but totally worth the money!!! also, a bit of a pain to clean...either outside with the hose or in the tub.  No refills and odor free..can't beat that!!
This one is the best and a must have! Don't waste your time or money on the other ones.  The Diaper Genie is way too complicated.  It's a trash can so it should be simple.  I shouldn't have to read directions on how to use it!  This one is great because it is so easy to use, I never smell any odor, and it uses normal trash bags!  Why spend money on special trash bags?  I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $2.00.  They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes.
My girlfriend recommended the diaper champ over the diaper genie so I put it on my registry.  It certainly seems to contain the odors.  It's great that it uses regular garbage bags - no expensive refill bags to purchase.  The only small problem I've noticed is that it stops working before the pail is full because it stacks the diapers through a narrow hole.  Also, when it's time to change the bag, wear a nose plug.
Love this product - no smell - easy to change the bags - I don't have any complaints.
I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.  It works great.  I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).  I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.  It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.  The reviews were definitely right.
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!
Works well as diaper pail, but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.  No mess, no smell. Very easy to replace garbage bags, you do not have to touch anything.Got it as a gift, and was very skeptical about it at first. (It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).  That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.  Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day.
I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills. Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of? I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula. I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"The Champ works great. We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags. We've never experienced odor from the pail. It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion. I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...Highly recommended!!! Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
The Diaper Champ has been wonderful in our home!! It locks away the smell so wonderfully that we purchased a second one for downstairs. I originally chose this one, because it doesn't use costly refills. The lid is quite heavy, so you do have to be careful of your fingers when changing the bags, but that's the only concern I've had with it. When you do open it to change the bags, you may want to do so outside. You'll quickly see just how well it locks the odors in.
I admit when I was an expecting father one of my concerns was diaper changing, mostly because of the odors (anyone with me on this one?) As much as the odors won't go away during changing time, they do -as a matter of fact- dissapear once you throw the dirty diaper in the Diaper Champ. Put it in the top hole, roll the top with the handle, in the diaper goes and bye-bye to all odor!As if this were not already great, there's a big plus to this product, when you compare it to its biggest competitor, the Diaper Genie by Playtex. Although this one costs $5 the first time around, it won't require special bags as the Genie does, which cost $15 per set... this one takes your standard Glad bags you can get in Costco, BJs, Sam's or your local supermarket, so rejoice! (for diaper odors are over when the diaper goes in); and don't spend too much money to accomplish such a mundane task: make sure you get your Diaper Champ!
I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!
My son is four months and this product is perfect.  No smells at all!  Holds a decent amount of diapers, my husband empties it once a week.  No down side, all pluses here!  Especially no special bags to buy.  And when your child is out of diapers, you can use it as a regular trash can to put food or pet waste in.
I like the fact that you don't have to purchase brand-name insert for this product, but can use any garbage bag.  I have to say, though, that after my daughter started solids, the odor control has not been great unless the bag is changed frequently.
You cannot imagine how much money you'll save and it doesn't smell AT ALL!!! You can use any kitchen size garbage bags without a problem and use it for A WEEK without having to change the bag. IT'S WONDERFULL!!!
I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it. I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts! (no offense)My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant. His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ.Usually we change the bag about once a week, every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week. I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me. They've got to be doing something wrong.Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned...if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do, and you get poop on the pail, it does need to be wiped off. A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe, every week or two doesn't hurt either.
I LOVE this product. My sister (mother of 2) recommended this to me and I am so grateful. It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better! This is a must have for any new parent!
It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.  At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!  It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.  I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.  The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
This is one of the items that I absolutely love, something I'd rather not live without. The only time I've ever noticed a smell is when you leave the poopy diapers in the pail too long.Love it!
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  MY HUSBAND AND I CHOSE TO USE CLOTH DIAPERS ON OUR SON AND THIS WORKS GREAT FOR HOLDING THEM UNTIL THEY GET WASHED.  WE NEVER NOTICE A SMELL COMING FROM IT.  WE ALSO LOVE THAT IT USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS RATHER THAN NEEDING SPECIAL BAGS.  IT HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT FOR US AND WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS CLOTH DIAPERING THEIR BABY.
We registered for the diaper champ mostly based on the reviews and the fact that no special bags were needed. I am very impressed with how easy it is to change the bag and I have not had any problems with smells. We use the odor guard trash bags but I doubt it has much effect (it doesn't in the kitchen anyway). The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective. Would definitely recommend
The Diaper Champ is a life saver.  We have had no problems with odor at all as some other reviewers have complained of.  We empty it out about 2 times per week and only when we open the lid to take the trash bag out do we smell anything.  Once it's sealed shut, no stench whatsoever.  No complaints about the Diaper Champ, especially since it is so easy on the pocket-book compared to the rest of the diaper pails out there.
The Diaper Champ came easy to assemble- only took 2 minutes to put together!  The design is simple, yet brilliant, and the odors are sealed inside the Diaper Champ until the bag needs to be changed.  Our baby's room never smells!  We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.  We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ. The price is very affordable as well.
We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.  We hated that thing!  The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!  The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.  And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.  We decided we had to have something so we started researching.  The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!  We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.  There is also no trick to it.  No spinning it or anyhting!  Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!  We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!  It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!  I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.  It was such a pain to use.  We all hated it.  The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.  And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.  It takes regular trash bags.  I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.  And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!  If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
This is a great diaper pail.  There is no odor and it is very easy to use.  (You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.)  Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).  And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
At first me and my husband didnt know if we really wanted to get diaper pails for our twins. We thought since the babies were going to be at his parents house while we were at work. A garbage can would do just as well. We did reg for the diaper champ to keep at the grandparents house. We ended up getting 1 for their home and 2 for our home. We are SO HAPPY we did. They are so easy to use. You dont have to push the dirty diaper down with your hand you just lay it in the champ and turn the handle over. At 6 months old yes the diapers are starting to get bigger but you just fold them with the velco of the diapers and its so easy. Ive had no problems of getting them stuck. With the diaper champ you can use any kind of bags which is great!!! There really is no oder with the diaper champ. We take the dirty diaper out every 4-5 days depends on how many we go through in a weeks time :), but even when their is a "dirty" diaper there is no smell in the room. Sometimes if we have a very "messy diaper" we just take it directly to the garage. All around we have  had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama. We wash it out once a month or sooner with bleach and water just help get rid of some germs. We also spray it with cleaner weekly to help with those nasty germs! All around its a great product. It really is hands free, which means less mess, and their is no costly replacement bags that you have to mess around with!
We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!  Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.  Only problem...it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.  The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
This is the most convenient on the market considering you don't need specific refills!!! I strongly recommend it.
Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all. This one is really great. I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did. I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted. Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!! We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month. The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome! We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great. We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!! We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems. Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
We just couldn't bring ourselves to buy a pail that required us to purchase extra refills.  This pail is great.  I do put really dirty diapers into a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail, to reduce the chance of nasty seepage and rub-off onto the chamber as the diaper is moved into the bottom.  It is not difficult to open, and the fact that it has a good clasp offers a sense of security for when our little girl starts pulling herself up on things, which will be soon (she's 8 months old).  We change the bag a couple of times a week, and the nursery smells fine.
I would definitely recommend choosing the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie, since you can use regular kitchen trash bags instead of expensive Genie refills. Definitely reduces the odor (just be prepared for the awful smell when you open the top to change the bag!!!) and is easy to clean. Love it!!!
The champ is great because you don't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!  Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!
My husband and I love this product. Several friends of ours recommended it, and I'm so happy that we purchased it. It's large enough to hold many diapers, and it really does keep our nursery odor-free.  I really like that we don't need to purchase expensive bags to use with it. We just use regular kitchen garbage bags. My sister had the Diaper Genie, which is tough to use and too small.  This product is much better.
This diaper pail is a wonderful investment. While other diaper pails require the use of thier own bags this pail uses any bag...including old shopping bags. This save alot of money. When you are a first time mom and on a tight budget every little bit helps. I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.
We also wanted the diaper champ instead of the Genie because...who wants to buy special bags??  It is a life saver to just throw in a kitchen garbage bag.  We ended up receiving ours as a hand-me-down, and I was worried that it would smell.  Surprisingly enough - it only starts to smell when it's time to change the bag. And sure enough, the lid would start "sticking" right about that time, which told me that the bag was full and it was time to change it (instead of struggling to stuff another couple diapers in).  Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.  Just keep some Lysol wipes by the changing table, and wipe it down if you get anything anywhere. Piece of cake.
Love it, love it, love it!  I love that you can use regular plastic bags and don't need to buy refills for it.  Once in a great while it will stink a bit but only when I used too big of a bag and have a LOT of diapers in there.  Wipes up nice and clean with antibacterial wipes.  My daughter is starting potty training and I'm still using it.  Great buy!
The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper.  (Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink.
I thought the idea of keeping dirty diapers in the house was just gross, so I decided to make 20 trips a day to the trash.  Boy, was I misguided in my thinking,because this diaper champ is a Godsend!  You really do not smell a thing! I heard the diaper genie was a huge mess, so I did not even attempt to buy it.  Get this and limit those trips out to the trash!
This product is wonderful!  It is very easy to use, refill, and move around.  My only complaint is that it could be a little bigger to hold a bit more.  It keeps the smell OUT completely!  The fact that I can use a regular trash bag is a definite plus to a mommy with a small budget!I highly recommend this product!
I love this product!  With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.  Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.  No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
I thought about getting the diaper genie at first but then did some research. This is the best for your money! Not only was it less expensive than most other diaper pails, it also works the best. The only time smell escapes from it is then you open it to take out the bag. I really love how you don't have to buy bags for it, and that it takes perfectly good trash bags. That will save you a bundle of money alone! It works really great for us and we wouldn't use anything else. I wish it would hold more diapers but I really can't complain. Don't buy anything else!
This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!!!! The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags...ANY Garbage bags will fit. The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend...This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers....FANTASTIC!
We've used this Diaper Champ for the past 8 months and it's worked great. No problems or odors at all. The best part is you use regular kitchen trash bags, no expensive specialty bags to buy.
The Diaper Champ is excellent.  I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby's closet.  No special bags are needed ... what a savings!  Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!  Great value for an excellent product.
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED! You use any type of bag you want, and I love this idea. The refills for all the others are so spendy and they don't hold that many diapers. I'd rather buy cheap 13 gallon garbage bags from wal-mart or use one of the gazillion plastic grocery bags we already have in a cupboard at home. It also keeps the smell away perfectly fine-until you open it of course to take the bag out to the garbage can! It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well. I think it's great and I highly recommend it to every family that loves to save money.
Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers. We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable. It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers. It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun. She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail.
We have purchased this diaper pail four years ago [I was so disgusted with Diaper Genie we had at the time (not just wasting the money on the refills, but also the smell and having to push & twist was more than I wanted to deal with)].Diaper Champ was so much easier to operate! When my daughter turned one, she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed!We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly. [We've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we're now using them with daughter #2, replacing them once a week]. We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001! It's virtually indestructible, easy to wash and operate, doesn't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it, and it DOES NOT SMELL!I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
I chose to register for the Diaper Champ for convenience.  You can use a plain ole garbage bag instead of purchasing something separate.  What busy mom has time to run out to get special bags?  In 5 months I've had one instance of a terrible smell and it was just a really bad diaper - we all know those.  :)  It's very easy to clean and so easy to use.
We purchased the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special bags.  We have now used it for a year and it has been great!  We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we don't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that.  We change the bag almost daily, as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier.  When it gets hard to turn, it is time to change the bag!The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up, we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone.
PRO'S1. Doesn't take up too much space2. Very easy to use.3. Very easy to empty.4. Can use regular trash bags (saves money!)CON'S1. There is a slight smell when my son delivers a REALLY stinky muddy diaper. (other than that there is no smell. I just throw the "bombers" in the trash outside.FYI1. Don't let it get too full, otherwise it is hard to pull the trash bags out to empty. And once it is open (stinky!!!) you don't want to waste any time getting the full bag out of the house.UPDATE: Our son is now 9.5 months old and it just stinks. No matter if there is a diaper in there or not. We have cleaned it, sprayed it, bleached it, put dryer sheets in it, well you name it and we have tried it. THE THING STINKS!!! We have since tried other bags and such but if you walk in my sons room you smell the diaper champ. It is going out I am sad to say. But we did get several smell free months out of it. Also just a note. My son started eating solid food and went to formula when it started stinking real bad!
I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.
No special bags to buy... change at least twice per week (especially in the summer) and you are good to go. Remember this thing contains poop, so if it is not changed often, it will smell.
I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags. Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.' In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!! I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week. For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!! Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two. SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful. Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
I love this! I was hesitant to buy too since the "sheet" is expensive and hardly a "sheet" at all. But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof. If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet. You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats. We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it. This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!
I have been using these sheets for 6 months.  I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets, and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping, I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet.  They are machine washable and dryer safe, which I LOVE, considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week.  Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle, so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks.  It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet.  I leave baby's cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size: Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer, but it is not a problem at all.  They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material:  The top side is a breathable, soft cotton layer.  The bottom side has a soft, waterproof plastic feel.
My mom said to get enough crib sheets because it was something you had to change constantly.... I now have a drawer full of crib sheets that have never been used!  This is the best thing ever!  we put one on, and have the other one for an emergency.  It is soft, the cotton is excellent quality and the work of crib changing at 3 in the morning it just went from 10 minutes to 1 minute! nothing can bit 9 minutes of extra sleep in the middle of the night
