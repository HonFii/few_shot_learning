I wanted to love this, but it was pretty expensive for only a few months worth of calendar pages.  I ended up buying a regular weekly planner - 55% OFF! - The Planner - that is 8 1/2 x 11 and has all seven days on the right page and the left page has room to write a To Do List and Goals.  I found this to be more helpful because I could mark each day's eating and sleeping blocks, then also see them side by side - I could see her patterns more easily with a weekly view.  This planner was cute, just not what I wanted.
I like this log, but think it would work better with clearer AM & PM sections. Each page is 12 hours so you really need two pages a day if your baby feeds or wets a lot in the early morning hours between midnight and 7am. We're cramming those in to the 2 blank spaces above 7am right now.
My wife and I have a six month old baby boy and around the 4-month mark my wife decided that she would return to work instead of being a stay-at-home mom. We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones. The legibility in the Baby Tracker is a huge improvement over our standard notebook entries that really ended up becoming small paragraphs. In a few short moments you can summarize all of the data in the columns in the totals section and determine key information - how much did baby eat, did baby have a bowel movement, how much sleep did they get, etc.There are, however, some frustrating limitations with this journal. First the entire layout is about half a notebook sheet divided down the middle (portrait layout). This constrains entries to very small spaces on each column and row. For much of the information that is okay - feedings can be summarized in ounces; diaper changes by a &#34;#1 or #2&#34; and so on. However, once your baby becomes more active and you'd like to know more than &#34;tummy time&#34; under the play-time column things start to get very tight on the page.Another problem is that this tracker only covers 12 hours out of a baby's day. That's fine if the intention is only to track hours while a baby is with child care providers. However, we really wanted to track our little boy's entire day which often starts much earlier than 6am. Using this journal that would require the use of a second page.--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(+) Good layout that is easy to read and instantly gather information about your baby's day in a matter of moments(+) High quality paper(+) Consistent quality between the pages--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(-) Expensive and gets you at most 6-months, less if you use more than one page for tracking your babies entire day(-) The cover is thick but not a hardback and bends easily in a diaper bag(-) The pages should really be bigger. I understand portability is a concern but the current size is entirely too small--------------------CONCLUSION:I ended up making my own format of this journal in a spreadsheet that includes a 24-hour day and more space for comments along with a few other changes and had the pages bound cheaply at a local shop. This is an adequate journal but expensive for what you get and limitations because of page size.
I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).
I think this is an adorable book. The pieces are all attached and each page has a cute activity. Several things though--1. If you sew you can make one that is more directed to your child. And if you sew you will realize this is very over priced.2. Some of the activities are too hard for the age group that would be playing with this book.
Bought for 1yr old son bc his molars were coming in - it's cute, colorful but my son didn't seem to like it.
I thought my daughter would LOVE this product, but not the case..it is made well..But you have to bite down REALLY hard to make the vibration work :( She does however like the toy at the bottom of it!
I have a 6.5mo old who loves when we tap on toys when he has them in his mouth, yes sounds weird.  Husband is a drummer and got him obsessed with the tapping even when he is drinking out of his bottle my baby will try to tap the bottle with his hands to feel the vibration.  He has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face/mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he's a happy baby.  I also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when I brush my teeth.  He loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn't choke, you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking.This teether will be better if it had an on/ off button, my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on.  I was trying to find a teether with vibrations he can use by himself.
My baby hated this thing so I cannot comment on it's effectiveness. Bit it seemed like a cool idea. Passed it on.
My friend recommended this teether because her daughter loves it.  However, my daughter loves throwing it on the floor.  Hopefully, it will work better for you.
My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he's just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn't very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price.
I really wanted to love this sling.  I had seen several mothers use these before, and the nurse in our childbirth class raved about it.  I was so excited when I received it as a gift.I started using this with my son when he was just a week old. I put him in the cradle position, but I was so afraid he was going to sufficate on the fabric around him, I had to keep my hand in the sling next to his face.As he got older, it did get easier to use.  It was good to use while in the grocery store.  However, it pulled hard on my shoulder.Now, he's 7 months old, and he's crawling and pulling himself up, and he doesn't like to be restrained at all.  I've tried the kangaroo position, but I'm so scared he's going to fall out the bottom because he is quite a wiggle worm.  The last time I used this, the shoulder strap got so close to my neck that it started to interfere with my circulation.I'm glad I had this for the grocery store, but I think with my next child, I'm going to have to rethink what kind of carrier I use.
I bought this because of all the wonderful things I heard about slings.  I even practiced with my cat before to see if I could put it on and if it was comfortable.  I must admit this is so much more comfortable than the front packs or back packs.  It doesn't cut across the back like the front packs can.  However, my daughter will not go in this.  I had tried from day one to carry her in this.  She screams.  My child hardly ever cries and when I say she screams, I mean turns red and screams.  As soon as I take her out she is fine.  Now that she is older I can carry her like a front pack, but quite honestly, the front pack is just easier.  I wanted to use the sling because I nurse and I should have been able to nurse her while we were out.  She just will not lay in it.  My friend has this and loves it.  Her baby cooperates.  She has carried him in it since she brought him home from the hospital.  She can nurse him while walking.  When my daughter gets older I plan on using it to carry her on my hip.  I watched the video and you can use it to help with back support while you carry your child on your hip.  I hope I can use it like that, but for the next baby, I am not going to use it.  I will stick with the traditional front pack.  These slings are just not very easy on larger women who are a rather endowed.
I purchased a total of 4 of these, thinking I needed to change the bedding constantly due to spit up.The instructions said to hang dry only so I thought I needed more to get through the week.  It turns out I can just toss it in the dryer and put it right back on the mattress.Had I known I didn't need to hang dry, I wouldn't have purchased any extra and just went with the 2 they gave me when I purchased the cosleeper.The material is average, nothing special.  It holds up well to lots of washes and uses.
The shipping was quick. The colors are pretty but the sheets themselves are not soft. That was disappointing to my daughter who I bought the sheets for and of course to me. They are not inexpensive so I expected more. I purchased five sheets to go with the co-sleeper I bought her for their first baby. We have not assembled the co-sleeper yet but when I received it the box was all torn and dented. Looking at it the contents looks okay, but we will see when the my son in law puts it together.
Baby loved this but the only problem is the straps that tie it to the stroller are not big enough for some trays. Due to this my first one came un-sewed and I had to buy another one and the same thing happened again.
I truly believe this is the best diaper pail on the market...  It's simple to use, can take any garbage bag, and does a fantastic job of containing odors.  BUT, my complaint is -- why couldn't they make it bigger?I've heard it's the biggest one you can buy, but I find it frustrating that my regular kitchen-sized garbage bags are only 2/3 full when the Diaper Champ requires us to remove the bag.  It's wasteful!  (I know the simple solution is to buy smaller bags, but I feel the product should accomodate the most common household garbage bag -- the "tall kitchen bags" -- and do it efficiently.  The whole point of getting the Diaper Champ was so that we wouldn't have to buy separate bags for it!)
This is easy to use, but it does not disguise the smell that great!  I did like that you can use any kind of bag with it.
I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks).  But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.  The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).  The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.  It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.  This is not one handed operation as the box states.  After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.  And you do not even need to ask.  Yes, it was made in China.
This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.  However, I never use it.  It's so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.  We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash.
After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed.  I'm not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero's or my daughter has super smelly diapers.  Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the "Champ" is in the back corner of the room.  I guess I'm just grateful that the whole house doesn't smell as bad as her room.
You can't put poopie diapers in this pail, it doesn't hold the smell back at all.  I use it for the wet diapers and it's fine.  I use the scented bags for the poopie diapers and throw them away in my regular garabage that gets taken out every day.  Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.  The big blue round part on the side broke off for some reason and it wouldn't go back on.  I ended up using masking tape to hold it on.  It serves it's purpose, but I'm not thrilled with it.
I love the fact that you don't need a specific bag, and a cheap garbage bag is enough. But it doesn't keep smells in at all. I didn't realize I was buying a large one either, so even though it's far from full you have to take the gab out. But it's just the nature of garbage.
I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.  For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.  The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
It does contain most of the odors but not all.  It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures.  It will save you money on refills so that's a plus.
I was quite pleased with this for the first 6 months. Now as my son's diet is changing, the odor of his bowl movements can no longer be contained. We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain. There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes). The problem is if the diaper bag gets too full it makes it really hard to pull out the diapers.Pros:- cheaper than alternatives- worked great the first 6 months- was able to use normal garbage bagsCons:- smells after 6 months- bad tapered design makes it hard to remove diapers
I've been over to friends' houses and fought with their diaper genies. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ instead, because you can use regular trash bags with it (much less expensive than the Genie refills).I had no complaints, until it got really warm in my daughter's room and then the smell appeared.  I've tried Lysol and the dryer sheet at the bottom of the can and various other tricks to mask the odor emanating from the Champ without luck.  Baby is breast-fed too.  I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.  Ick.I'm wondering if fighting with the Genie and buying refills is a better option for us, as we don't have air-conditioning and it will get warm in the room this summer!I will say this though, other reviewers have complained that the bag is not completely full when the Champ seems to need a change, but I find this convenient, as I don't have to drag out an extremely heavy bag.
I'm not sure about this one.  In concept, it's a fabulous idea.  I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
We got this for our newborn, and within the first two weeks of use, the liner (that I assume is supposed to keep odor in) fell out because it got caught on one of the stickies on the diaper. This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well. It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though. It just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this. My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off! AH!  So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on.  It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out.  He usually only teethes on 1 side too!
I bought this based on good reviews in the Baby Bargains book, so I had high expectations. It does make it somewhat easier to change sheets in the middle of the night, but you still have to unsnap it from about 10 places on the crib to do so; I've also found the snaps a little difficult to engage. If you're not using crib bumpers, the look of all the elastic pieces on the crib slats isn't too attractive. I'm glad to have one of these, but it isn't the miracle sheet I hoped for.
The baby isn't here yet.  But we've bought a couple of these.  I'm a tad hesitant because they don't fit very well on our convertable crib.  They do give instuctions, saying to just use a slate next to the thickers corner one(for convertable cribs), but I find it fits very awkwardly.  However taking the whole crib apart(with the bumper being a huge deal, also to get on, considering the thick corner posts), it makes me want to cry to think I'd have to do this very often.  So, we'll give these a shot.  I may end up doing the zip on sheet set, which would work with any crib, and seems like a dream.  I've also heard great things about those.  I just didn't want to invest in that, if I could get away with these.  Will let you all know, if these turn out to be a disaster.
This item was great in the middle of the night when little one had an accident. You just unsnap and you have a clean surface ready to go. HOWEVER...I really hated that after i washed this item only a few times, the surface became very rough to the point that i quit using it all together. It's a pain to change the sheet each time now, but don't want my baby sleeping on a rough sheet.
The cons?Every time I have to deal with this sheet, I swear that I hate it with every fiber of my being. The first time I tried to put in on the mattress, I was fussing and swearing at it and was sweating my butt off trying to get it hooked on. It is not intuitive at all to snap on:1) The snap bands aren't placed equidistant so you just have to guess at where they should go.2) In order to snap the opposite side you have to lean over and INTO the crib (or you have to pull it away from the wall)...3) All while trying to stick your fingers through the slats to pull the bands through and snap them.4) Once I had the bands hooked where it seemed they should...I got to the opposite end and there was NO WAY the bands were hooking--it was a few inches too short! GRRRRRRR!At that point, sweaty and frustrated, I gave up and threw the damn thing at my husband and told him to do it. Since then, I've had to do it myself, and I still hate it although I am getting better.The pros?It is nicely waterproof. When the boy spits up or his diaper leaks or he sweats a lot, it does not make it through to the mattress. But that said, it's not like there's a lot of liquid to worry about.We haven't had any issue with the snaps not staying snapped or the baby getting underneath the sheet.Overall?We are still using this, although I am not quite sure why. There has to be another solution that doesn't cause me mental anguish trying to put it on (although, honestly, sheets of any kind are a PITA). So I give it three stars, but with a warning that it's a pain to put on.
We registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet because a cousin and a few friends raved about it - they said to get two so that one could be on the crib and one could be in the wash.  I received it at my baby shower, but we have found only limited value in this crib sheet for our 11 month old daughter.  I am glad we only have one of these!The Ultimate Crib Sheet that we have is the style with elastic straps on each corner, one fully-removable elastic strap in the center of the short end, and two straps on each long end.  We have a Pali Wendy 4-in-1 Convertible Crib and the corner posts are quite thick, to the point where the elastic straps are not long enough to easily go around the corners.  Instead on one end of the crib we have to resort to wrapping the straps around the crib slats adjacent to the corner posts and that means there's slightly less than full coverage of the sheet underneath.  Since our daughter is a "perimeter" sleeper who likes to be up against the edges of her crib, that is a problem.The majority of parents we know have purchased convertible cribs which have thick corner posts when configured as a crib or toddler bed. It would be easy for Summer Infant to make this sheet more adaptable to current crib styles by making the length of the corner straps longer or using multiple snap sockets to make the strap length adjustable.  This sheet fits better on a standard/traditional crib with thinner diameter corner posts.I also question the real value of this for older babies who move around in their cribs.  We have the crib bumper on now despite not having used it between 1-8 months of age because she is a real mover and likes to stay on the perimeter of her crib to sleep - she was sticking limbs out between crib slats and woke up crying as a result.  On the handful of occasions where she's thrown up in her crib (always when she's come down with an upper respiratory bug), she's inevitably hosed the bumper as well.  In those cases we have to just strip the whole crib anyways so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is of little real utility for us.I could see this being a big time saver for parents with traditional cribs or those with babies/toddlers who often have various "accidents" in their cribs and need to frequently change a crib sheet on the fly.  However we have found that a waterproof pad under a normal crib sheet works just fine for our baby.
I use this on top of my crib sheet when my crib sheet is dirty and I don't have a replacement.  So in that sense it's helpful.  My daughter doesn't pee through her diaper so I haven't used it for liquid leaks.  It can probably hold a lot of pee, but the real question is why does your kid need this kind of protection? (unless you put them to sleep without a diaper on!)  I find all the snaps to be a pain in the butt.  If I could do over I wouldn't buy this VERY EXPENSIVE crib sheet.  I'd just get multiple regular crib sheets.
I absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet. After receiving one as a gift I immediately tried putting it in the crib. To my disappointment, the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib. For those of you that have Italian made cribs (I have a Baby Italia), this sheet may not work for you either. This should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too. Needless to say, if you have an Italian made crib, keep the packaging and the receipt. You may find that you'll have to try another brand.
Our crib does not have slats at the head and foot, so we can only use 8 of the snap straps ... after only two washings, the sheet is curling up at the ends and will not lay flat.  I am nervous that it could be dangerous once my baby is moving around more in the crib; she is only 3 months, so she stays put right now.  I will probably stop using this once she can roll over.
It works well enough, but it takes so long to get all 10 of those snaps around the crib rails, ya might as well just change the regular sheet.
My daughter is 5 months old and has never leaked at night so it hasn't been necessary. So not sure if I would spend the money again knowing this. However, we use this when we let her air dry, and it definitely does work.
I was able to find the original sheet at a local store, but paid more for it than on Amazon.  I thought I would receive the same sheet - but instead received the new design.  I don't like the new design nearly as much as the original.  It bunches up and doesn't snap at the ends like the original.  Not sure why they went to a poorer design but I wouldn't buy another one unless they added the end snaps.
It does what it is intended to do, protect mattress from wetness. But it makes you sweaty when you sleep on it.
I like the idea of this product but it wasn't as much of a help as I thought it would be.  It is not comfortable so you have to put it under the sheet which means a lot of changing or bedding during the middle of the night if there is an accident.
I bought this at a discounted price and that is the only reason I am not returning it. It fits across our mattress just fine and we are able to tuck it in. The annoying part is that the top of the pad won't stay put. It continually rolls up and then my son is sleep with a big crease across his chest and tummy....which is not very comfortable. I wish I had waited and purchased the Brolly sheet instead of buying this one...even with the cheap price.
Yes, my spring broke as well... but looking on the brighter side: when my son is old enough to walk he won't be able to accidently press the spring button to release the pail cover... it's kind of an unexpected safety feature! And yes, you can still open it with one hand... your fingers are not glued to one another. Really, diapers will stink no matter what pail you use.... The covered pail is cheap and doesn't require buying refill bags (especially since we use cloth diapers).
I've been using this pail for 2 months with my breastfed baby. It contains all of the odor from his moderatly stinky diapers. It doesn't work exactly like it's supposed to, the blue dome is supposed to push the diaper into the pail but the diaper usually gets stuck and I have to push it through but that's no big deal. When I'm changing the garbage bag the lid won't stay open and it falls hitting my hands, it's really annoying.
These are fine for standard, thin power cords.  We have had one in place that the kids have never dislodged despite two years of trying.  But they will not close over the heavy, thick cords like those for microwaves, computers, or power bars.  We finally ended up attaching ours to the wall with duct tape to cover those cords.I am giving this three stars because it does work fairly well for thin cords, and because I have yet to see anything better out there.  My advice?  Invest in duct tape.
Great to keep kids away from plugs, but it prevents me from using the plugs as well. If you have something that is plugged in permanently, it may work great but don't use this for an outlet you need to access regularly.
This thing is so hard to get off that neither you nor your children will ever get to your outlets again.  This is not a product you should buy if you want to use your outlets once in a while.  It took me 15 minutes to pry it open.
What a pain to to remove the cover and does not fit some plug types.  Only the smallest plugs will work like lamp plugs not not thick cords like computer plugs.  Xbox, ps4, etc are out of of the question. You can replace computer cables with thinner, lower grade cables to get around this.
This power strip cover is meant to be a baby-safe product, but even though I do like it and it leaves enough space for even thick cords and wide plugs, my daughter can stick her hand right down in there.  That fact pretty much defeats the purpose of even having the cover.  But it does at least make the whole thing look less appealing to her, so she doesn't bother it too much.  But the slot really should be narrower.
Doesn't fit the strip we have our computer/tv plugs in. Its too small. We intended it to use there, but are using it in our bedroom instead.
Product is HUGE covering.  The product was very bulky, I can't imagine using it as it takes up so much room.  The vendor was not a problem.
This cover was enormous and I have an extra long power strip so it didn't completely cover it.  I just ended up getting a power strip with a longer cord and moving it behind a bookcase.
It's a pain to get on and off and the opening for the cords is pretty wide so that my kids can still get their fingers in there to where the outlets are. This is really more like a &#34;slow them down&#34; as opposed to preventing them from getting in.
This fits over various charger cords though it is bigger than I expected. I think the slot is a little bigger than it needs to be as I can get my fingers in there. The biggest plug I have in there right now is a usb phone/tablet charger. I haven't tried anything with the heavy blocky plugs.
its a great product especially if you have mobile kids, babies or toddlers. keep in mind its kind of bulky i didnt think of that when ii purchased this but still a good buy for what i needed it for!
The instructions to put the item together are small and hard to understand. It's been sitting on my kitchen counter for about a month, and god knows when I will get to it. Buy this item only if you have the patience to deal with many small parts and instructions that are hard to understand.
When they work, they are awesome. When they don't work, it really stinks. There was no rhyme or reason to it. We attached them in several locations and half the time the product worked perfectly and I am very satisfied but for no clear reason in some cases they would not work (or would only work on one of two cabinet doors on the same item!) So kind of unreliable.
This was a product that I used when I worked in child care and I always liked the fact that it is &#34;invisible&#34; and is not an obvious eye-sore on your cabinets. But when I tried to install on my sink cabinet, one side worked like a charm and the other side just won't work. I can find no discernible reason for this and it is very frustrating. The two parts line up fine, but they won't latch. And the two cabinet sides were installed what seems like identically to me, but apparently not. In my opinion, it shouldn't be this difficult to make accurate measurements to ensure that the product will work. It might just be my cabinets, but they are not anything crazy or out of the ordinary. I am frustrated that I will have to drill more holes into my cabinet and there is no guarantee that it will work!
I have used these clippers just once, they did a good job. I dont love them( not really comfortable to use) but they get the job done.
I bought this pair of clippers because of the rave reviews on Amazon.com.  However, I'm disappointed with them.  I have a hard time grasping them and keeping them in place in my hand.  By the time they're in a firm, steady grip, my baby has wiggled away, and I have to start over.
Safety 1st makes several nail clippers for babies, including model 49523 (Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Steady Grip Nail Clippers); model 49539 (Safety 1st Complete Nail Care Set) which includes what seems to be clippers similar to model 49523 but with a holder at the back for emery boards; and model 10435 (this one). All three of these nail trimmers are in the "Hospital's Choice" series.Overall, I prefer the 49523/49539 model (see Customer Images) because it is more comfortable to hold for the following reasons.  First, instead of a small white plastic bulb, the 49523/49539 has a larger white-and-orange or white-and-blue handle that allows you to hold the clippers like a "gun" with your index finger under the blades and your thumb on the lever.  Second, the orange or blue part of the 49523/49539 handle is soft and less slippery than the white plastic of this model.  Third, the lever has the same soft orange or blue non-skid rubbery material at the end, thus providing a cushion for your thumb.In terms of cutting nails, the very good performance of this model and the 49523/49539 are the same. (They both leave the nail edges a little sharp, so some filing is necessary.) So I recommend purchasing the 49523/49539 instead.
i bought this pacifier when my son was 3 months old, wiggly and had his first temp. i was having a hard time getting frequent readings with the under-arm thermometer and i decided to give this a shot. it's a great concept. when my son was sick i replaced his regular pacifier with this one, and simply pressed the button when i (nervous first time mom that i am) needed reassurance. it helped sooth my nerves.it wasn't, however, very accurate. when he first put it in his mouth, i would get different readings back-to-back. i found it worked better if the baby used it as a pacifier for awhile before i took his temp, i would get more consistant readings during naptime, and i double checked it with the under-arm when i needed an accurate temp.unfortunately my dog decided it made a good chew toy, so i'm on here today to buy another one. i think i am going to try another brand to see if i can find one with better accuracyhope i helped!**update**i ended up getting the temporal scanner instead, and have found it very accurate and time efficient. a much better solution for the money http://www.amazon.com/Exergen-Temporal-Scanner-Infrared-Thermometer/dp/B0015TIZGQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1299867344&sr;=8-2
I chose this tub because it folds up. However, since we use it every night, I haven't folded it up since Week 1. I do like the tub but find it cumbersome to use. It does leak through one of the fold-up hinge/gaps if there's too much water in the tub. Also, Baby is now nearly 8 weeks old, and already, her feet spill over the end of the seat area. She's very nearly too big for it and measured 22" at her 6-wk checkup. I can't see her fitting in the tub much longer. Her feet do get stuck in the gaps between the seat and the side of the tub. More importantly, for some reason, there are hard plastic corners along either side of the pad where her head is. She's knocked her head on them several times, and any other time, we spend the whole bath on guard, hoping she doesn't knock it. I'm also bothered when draining the tub. The plug has a little rim around it that sits up. I'm sure this helps prevent leaks, but it also prevents all water from adequately draining out. I have to turn the tub completely upside-down to ensure that all water has drained. The more I think about it, the more I think I'd like to try a different tub. I'd recommend this tub only to those who are seriously crunched for space or who travel often and need a fold-up tub.
I had ordered a different tub for my shower but never received it.  I had my baby so I picked up this tub last week.  However I could not figure out how to use the sling alone for my 1 week old infant.  It appears that you have to hold her head up while in the sling which leaves you with only 1 hand to bathe her with.  But anyone with an infant knows that they kick and squirm and I found it very hard to use.  I tried to snap it into the tub for the 2nd stage (thinking better support) and I could not get it to fit!Much easier to sponge bathe a new baby on a contoured changing pad.  I'm thinking of returning and going for the EuroTub.
I like the fact that it's a convertible tub, and I seem to have escaped any kind of leaking problem, but the sling is a pain in the rear.  Baby gets playful, kicks his legs, and Mom spends half the time repositioning him on the sling (which operates more like a slide), so that he won't slip all the way into the water. I regret not getting the kind which sling stretches across and keeps baby buoyant. Oh well.
Well, I loved it when we first had our daughter. She never cried during her baths. LOVED IT!Then she began to grow & by 5 months of age, she still couldn't sit up, but the tub was way too small. I wish it was somewhat larger.
it will NOT make a regular octagon, even if you have 8 panelsthe problem is, it  only opens to certain angles, and 135 degrees is not one of themit only does 90, 120, and 150(but 120 degrees is good for a hexagon, just don;t think if you have to have any old number of panels, you can make any polygon you want, you can;t.. additionally the SQUARE, which you can make with the 90 degree angles, are not very strong and not recommended by the instructions, especially if you are thinking, i can have use 8 panels to make a square, it will be very flimsy in the middle of the straight junction.. they specifically say DO NOT do that, have 2 sides joined at a 0 degree angle.. basically a hexagon is about all it really works for.. though a 4 sided square works, it isn;t weak, it is just tiny..)so you can HAVE an 8-sided fencebut the angles will have to be half 120 and half 150 degreeswhich is more of a square, just with bent sidesnot a real regular stop-sign type octagon!@#$plus it;s a little flimsyand (no matter what the shape is) there is no way to have an easy open/close gate, you have to either step over it or take a side apart every time [very hard]when i bought it, the store guy said ''oh what kind of dogs do you have..?''hmALSOwhen your kids get to about 18 months or so, they can either move the sides, by walking while pushing on a side, which changes the angle  you had it set to, or just lifting it and crawling undergood for babiestoddlers, not so mucheither fix it to the floor somehow, or accept that they will escapedogs might do that tooespecially just dig under or root it up with their nose and go underwle
Initially, I thought this was a great toy. My 5 month old didn't seem to love it, but would sort of press the buttons and screw around with it. Unfortunately, at 6 months, she can now sit up, but has little control over her body. Today, she flailed herself towards the cube and banged her eye socket against one of the corners. She has no injury to her actual eye, but she has a bruise below her eye now, and has been crying all night.I am done with hard plastic. I think I am switching to all soft toys and cubes until she is 1.
We got our twin boys this Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas, when they were 6 months old.  We liked everything about it...except that it was TOO LOUD!  I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud.  Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one).  I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud.  But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it.  It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice.  Which is why it has been put away since Christmas.  Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it.  If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month.
My daughter played with this a lot for a few weeks. Now at 15 months, she periodically touches it when passing by.
my daughter likes it okay especially if I play it for her, but it is too loud. I guess it is educational ....
My twin babies, now 9 months, liked this one right away.  I was surprised the music sound quality was better than any of all the other toys and mobiles and everything we have for them that plays music.  And the Mozart pieces using different instruments makes the cube not tiring at all as I would have expected.The cube is a bit heavy, but they roll it around without difficulty at all.  They can't throw it and it has rounded edges, so it's safe for them.  It lights up and eventually we'll all associate those different colors with the different musical scores.I think for the price it is worth it without a doubt.  Probably the price has come down and this used to be much more expensive because I notice in the earlier reviews mention about the high price.  I am surprised there aren't more toys for children at this age, so the really good ones like this one do not involve much thinking before buying on my part.Forget replacing the battery as it's not simple.
The itself is well built and is exactly what you read about above.  I was hoping that it would engage my boy a little more but the buttons are a little hard to press for a 1 year old and so he lost interest very rapidly.He seemed to be interested when I pressed the buttons for him but beyond that, not worth the money in my opinion. At least not for a small baby.
I bought this product as I was looking for some alternative toys for my 7.5 mo son, so he cld play/hear music when he wakes up in the morning in crib, instead of trying to stand up all the times.I love the product after reading reviews, love the rounded corner, love the design that baby has to play all by HIMSELF!  My boy totally enjoyed it for the first couple days and could sat and played for 20 to 30 min, it totally amazed me.  Until one day I found him, after playing the cube for 15 min, covering his ears and trying to escape.  I turned the cube off and he's happy again, then I realized the cube could TOO loud/noisy for infant.Different from most of other musical toys that have volume options, this one does NOT and its volume was definitely on the higher side, which might not be too good for infant, especially when it was designed for &#34;all ages&#34; - 0 month +.Anyhow, I'm still using it to buy myself a little bit time in the morning, but I don't let him to play for more than 5 min, that would be my temporary solution for now.
There are really mixed reviews for this product, and I think this is for two reasons: 1) the fact that different people are looking to this product with very different ideas of what they think their kids will get out of it and 2) the fact that the product quality really did go downhill when Munchkin took over from Embryonics.  Let me try to help you sort out both points.Before I do, I should mention that I originally got the Munchkin version, didn't like it, and ended up replacing it with the original Embryonics version, which I like much better.  My 19-month-old seemed to enjoy both versions.Before you get this product, ask yourself, "What value do I think it will have for my child?"  Here are a few possibilities:1) You just want some kind of musical toy with which the child can interact to change the song that's playing.  If this is your thought, you will probably be happy with either version of this toy.  (Then again, if that's ALL you want, you'd probably be just as happy with theBaby Einstein Take Along Tunestoy, which my son enjoys, and which is both cheaper and more portable.)2) You want a musical toy that's a bit more interactive, where the child can change the sound of the song that's on.  In this case, you'd also probably be happy with either version of this toy.  My 19-month-old son loves to press the buttons to turn on and off different instruments, change the song playing, and just listen to the music and dance and clap to it.  He does seem to enjoy this more than the Baby Einstein player mentioned above, perhaps because he can change things up in a greater variety of ways.3) You hope that your child will start to recognize the sound of different instruments from this toy.  If you have any thought like this in your head, banish the thought of getting this toy - you will likely be disappointed with either version of it. You will certainly be disappointed on this count if you get the Munchkin version.  On the better, original Embryonics version of this toy, the piano and harp sound reasonably true to their real sound and the flute is recognizable on the higher notes, at least.  The french horn, however, is barely recognizable as a brass instrument, and doesn't have any of the beauty and timbre of sound that a real French horn does.  And the violin - forget it!  It doesn't even sound like a string instrument, and I doubt a child hearing the violin part on this cube and then hearing a real violin would hear any similarity.  On the newer Munchkin version, only the piano sounds like the same family of instrument - kind of like a harpsichord, as one musically-trained reviewer has noted.  The rest of the instruments sound like synthesized crap.  (I suspect that none of this will matter to you in the least if you just want a musical toy your child can interact with in some way, and despite this shortcoming, I think most toddlers would enjoy either version of the toy just because it is plays music and does so in an interactive way. Nonetheless, in this day of tiny, inexpensive high-quality music players, I don't get why they couldn't make this to sound more like real instruments, and to have better sound quality overall.)4) You would like to enjoy this toy with your child, or at least not be driven crazy by it while he is playing with it. As you can tell from what I've said already, I definitely agree with other reviewers that the newer Munchkin version of this toy has much inferior sound quality than its predecessor.  Not only are the Munchkin instrument sounds largely unrecognizable, but the music overall sounds tinny, with the result that it is really grating to listen to it for any length of time.  And if your kid likes this toy as much as ours does, you will be listening to it a LOT. I think that for this reason alone, it is probably worthwhile to check the listings until you can find the older Embryonics version of the music cube.  Even if you aren't especially musically inclined.  Then again, if your kid already has lots of toys that sing and make noise (mine doesn't), you may have developed the ability to tune out any kind of tinny synthesizer-produced ruckus, in which case you might as well save yourself the trouble of hunting down an Embryonics cube and just get the Munchkin version.Also, it is worth noting that the newer Munchkin version is marginally better-looking, in case that matters to anyone reading this review.  On the Embryonics version, all the sides are a somewhat drab yellow, with only the edges and centers of the cube offering any variety in color, whereas the Munchkin version is more colorful - this is the version pictured in all the product photos.
I love the music on this but my little guy does not seem to interested in this. He has had it since he was 6 months and has only shown a passing interest in it.
I love this toy for babies. They have so much fun rolling it and hitting the big buttons to make beautiful music. I love the bouncy ball style corners to keep baby from injuring himself. I love the classical music that does not sound like your typical synthetic baby music. However, I not only have a baby, but two toddlers. This is a heavy toy. It hurts (a lot) when thrown by toddlers. (It does stand up to the beating, so that is a plus.) It also seems to attract use as a step stool since it is a cube & has resulted in quite a few falls. Take this toy away when they are toddlers! And if you have both a baby and a toddler, don't let either play with this toy! It just doesn't make for a very good combination.
sound is good, the way the music evolves with diff instruments if you push them is nice, but is waaayy toooo heavy for baby to carry and to push!!
Cute product. Bought it based upon favorable reviews. It's ok. My 9 months old daughter doesn't seem to like it much at all, but the product is really well made and plays cute music. Maybe she'll grow into it?
I got it for my 1 year old son.  He likes to push the buttons and listen to the music.  It's sturdy.  He's thrown it a few times already, and it bounced off the hardwood and still works fine.My only qualm with it is that it sounds like the batteries are dying.  Some of the music just isn't the greatest sounding.  Now, he doesn't care, but as a parent who gets to listen to this for seemingly hours when it's his toy of interest, it becomes grating.  I changed out the batteries and it sounded the same.  :-/Given that I know this, I also know that he loves playing with it, and that outweighs my feelings.  I'd get it again in a heartbeat if we ever lost this!
I had high hopes for this item based on other reviews, but it was a huge letdown.  It plays one tune with different instruments, and it is too loud for a baby.  With a music background, I really want to expose my son to beautiful, classical music.  This is not the item to do that with.  I will keep looking for other musical toys with more variety and sophistication.Update:  This is still my least favorite toy, mainly due to the volume.  I wish I could turn it down.  Thanks to a helpful comment, I did manage to play all the tunes and felt fairly silly not reading the directions beforehand.  I sill stick with my original rating, though.  There are just so many better toys out there.
I like the squishiness of the seat, but after my son has been sitting there a while (10 min.), the rigid plastic base still cuts a ridge into his legs (the seat squishes all the way down).  I think once he gets more efficient at using the seat this will improve.  The urine guard at the front is also a separate piece just tucked in between the seat and the base, so when my son climbs on, he sometimes knocks it out of place (doesn't guard well then).  I do like that it's a bendable rubber type material so it has some give when he scooches his behind over it.  My dad had to fashion a filler block out of styrofoam attached with packing tape to the back of the seat because our toilet is oval so this potty seat slides back when my son sits down.  The description said it works with round and oval seats.  This is true - it does fit - but slides to the back of the toilet opening so my son's feet don't reach the stool and he gets scared.  With the seat braced to the front it's fine.  Great, colorful graphics!
We haven't officially started potty training yet, just slowly introducing it. My son loved the seat... until I put him on it. He walked around the house with it when we first got it, but as soon as I put it on the toilet and tried to sit him down on it, it was over. He hates it now. I have 2 complaints: 1.) I like that the cushion is removable, but it's a little TOO removable- they need to put velcro on the bottom or something (which I plan on doing if my son ever uses it), and 2.) I don't know if all our toilet seats are weird shaped or it's a design flaw, but I think there's way too much movement of the seat when it's on the toilet. Part of the problem with my son may be that he's scared of the potty seat's wiggle when it's on the toilet. Nonetheless, I ended up buying a Fisher Price potty seat that goes on the floor as well.
The toilet set is nice.  Other reviewers had complained that it did not fit on their toilet seats but I have three different toilets and it works on all three.  It is a nice design and my son love that Thomas, Percy, & James are all on his potty seat.  The one problem is that it does not have a splash guard.  The packaging says it was supposed to have a splash guard and handle to hang on the toilet handle.  It did not come with either of these and when I contacted the seller she claimed they were not supposed to come with the seat.  According to the packaging and description they were!  My son was attached as soon as it saw it so I couldn't return it.  Check when you buy one of these.  If you have a boy you may not want to buy this unless it has the splash guard.
This potty seat fits the toilet fine, and seems comfortable to sit on. I think that the splash guard makes it a bit of a tight squeeze for my son to sit on the potty--we need to put him on carefully so as not to pinch anything. MIght be better suited for girls. We have a baby bjorn brand one for our downstairs toilet and it does not have the same issue.
My son is almost 2.5 years old, and has been potty training for about a month.  We have two potty seats---one for upstairs, one for downstairs.  This one is decent--we have no problems with it fitting on our elongated toilet.However, be prepared to clean up pee if you use this with a boy!  He has to sit just right in order to aim down and not get pee on the seat--I don't think the pee guard is high enough for use with boys.  Also--if he 'aims' just right, pee gets under the seat, causing a mess on the regular toilet seat.  I have to clean both seats every time I take this one off for adult use.  It's easier for him to use it when he isn't wearing anything below the waist--he's better able to get his legs spread further apart for better support and aim.I think this would be better for girls--but someone has to get it right for boys!
These potty seats sit securely on the toilet.  They are soft and padded for little tushies.  My only gripe with them are the crevices underneath where crude stuff collects.  Hard as I try, the grime is still there.  I just can't get in there the clean them.  Were it not for this problem, this is a terrific seat and my kids both loved them.
We got two of these for relatively cheap. In concept, it's great. We have one at our house and it fits all of the toilets (we have 2 toto toilets, one Kohler and one other brand (not sure which) and it fits fine). My in laws have one at their house that we leave there and their toilets are round seats (Kohler and American Standard). We've never had any fit problems.The problem is the design. Pee trickles between the plastic and the cushion and pools there. Even if you clean it regularly, it smells NASTY. If you forget to clean it, next time you pick it up, the nasty pee drips everywhere.I am in the process of ordering a different one so that I can get rid of this one. Gross.
Purchased this at Walmart for $12.  I was under the impression that it fit more securely such as clipped on at the handles.  It just rests in the hole of the toilet seat and slides around a bit.  When lifting my daughter off of the seat, her legs stick to it, it goes up with her and then falls back onto the toilet.  She isn't scared too much by that since it is lightweight, but I would think that to be terrifying for a 23 month old just starting to use a big, scary toilet.It seems comfortable enough and my daughter was willing to sit on it for about 5 minutes straight on the first try.  Since she loves Dora so much, she really liked this potty seat, however, I can see that being a problem:  I may find the potty seat in random places throughout the house since she'll want to play with it!  Something I hadn't thought of!Being as lightweight as it is, it's easy for myself or even my daughter (once she learns how) to put it on the toilet very easily.I really do not want a separate potty seat to have to clean so was looking for something like this.Overall, serves its purpose for the low price I paid for it.In hindsight, I would have just payed double this price for the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer (29.99 with free shipping here on amazon.com!) that adjusts to fit ALL toilet seats snugly.  The reviews were raving on that one!Good luck fellow potty trainers!
I think there was so much written about this that my head probably over rated it and now I'm discontent. My kids doesn't even look at it unless I'm on all fours like a dog and carrying it in my mouth. But, really, I don't think he's looking at the worm at all but thinking, &#34;Mommy has gone bow wow wow crazy.&#34; It's soft and not even cute. Just, it is. That's it. No magic, just what you see people. If what you see on the screen isn't making you scream and yell, it'll probably get the same reaction. You want more, prepare to crawl and bark.
The Walk-Through Stair Gate is one of the less expensive gates I found when searching for a stair gate. I have been satisfied with the results, but it isn't the greatest quality. Installation was quite simple, and once the gate locks in it is quite secure. However, the unlatching mechanism for the gate can be tricky at times. My whole family has had problems opening the gate at one point or the other. Sometimes when it unlatches, it can pinch your fingers, and you have to get both the top and bottom of the gate in the correct angle, or else it won't open. The same problem arises when closing. You have to make sure the two openings are aligned, or else the gate won't lock properly. I find myself double checking constantly to make sure the top and bottom have both "clicked" into their respective spot because it doesn't always on first try. We purchased the First Years Hands Free gate for a different room (not a stairway) and it works GREAT. So simple, easy to install, and very secure. I have found that the metal gates work much better than the wood ones, not only from experience at my house, but at other friends as well. It is worth the money to invest in a better quality gate if you can afford it.
I got this set for my 4 year old and he loves it. The dinosaurs are colorful and there are a lot of them to arrange on the little background. I am happy with the number and look of the dionos, trees and volcanoes. However I give it only 3 stars because the background is small and very flimsy, and the set really smells bad. Every time we open the box there is a very strong unpleasant plastic smell coming from inside the box. Not sure if it's the box it's-self or the contents.  I thought I would air it out a bit so I left the lid off over night, but when I entered the room in the morning the whole room smelled terrible from it. I really don't like the idea of my kid inhaling the fumes of some unknown plastic chemicals each time he opens the set so it now stays open and stored in the garage.  We play with them outside and they work fine for that.
The tub of dinosaurs and trees are pretty cool and abundant.  For some reason i thought the floor lay out jungle would be something more than cheap plastic similar to a disposable childs bib.
This walker is great for tall babies like my son and the toys are enough to keep him busy.  The only issue I have with it is that the legs don't have a very strong system for holding the walker up on it's different levels.  It is made like an exersaucer rather than having "x" bars to go up and down, and one of the back legs won't stay in position.  While it could be an isolated issue, the plastic seems more flimsy than it should be.  Also, only the front wheels swivel which I didn't think was a big deal, but it does seem to hinder my son from going in any direction he wants at a given time.
The Tot Wheels Activity Center is a good walker for the money.  The price we found to be very comparable to other walkers.  We really didn't notice any pros or cons to this particular walker over others.The main problem that we've run into with both of our daughters is the fact that that they really enjoyed the toys for about 1 month at the maximum.  After that they got bored and soon started fussing to get out and roll around on the floor.Our first daughter used the walker part of it for almost a week before again getting tired of it as the fact is, something along these lines is just too tough for a little one to control by themselves.  If you can imagine pushing a shopping cart that wants to go it's own way that's the way it is with the walker.  It's too big and bulky for them to easily steer not to mention the fact that little ones often don't realize what steering is.  The only know walk forward and crawl away when they can't move forward anymore.  With that said, understand that you'll have to walk with them to help them steer.Overall I remain convinced that a walker is good for kids to have so they have something other than their parent to hold onto to learn to walk but be prepared to help them walk in it because of the above mentioned bulkiness of the walker and the fact that I've never come across any walker from any company that's been easy enough for a little one to steer and push at the same time.5 stars for the idea and the toys but I had to take 1 star away for the difficulty to steer and another star for the limited time that my daughters used it.
I recieved a similar model to this walker, one without the electronic tray, for my daughter.  My only complaint is the rear wheels are difficult to roll.  Unlike the front wheels, the rear wheels are fixed and therefore can only roll straight forward or backward, not side to side.  This sometimes made for difficult maneuvering for my daughter. Overall, it is not a bad walker and I do plan on using it for my next baby due in January only because I do not want to purchase another one.  I would not recommend it though.  There are better walkers out there.
I have this playpen for about a month now but is still never used by my 6 month old baby. He cries whenever I put him in. I like it because it is huge and cute. What I do not like is that it lacks cushion. It is hard, not soft that I'm afraid when my baby rolls over, e would hurt himself. I am waiting for my baby to grow up a little more, may be he'll like it when he is already able to stand. I hope he would.
We had to return this item because it was so big when opened.  There simply isn't enough space in an NYC apartment to fit such a large pack and play.Otherwise, it is a nice play yard with appealing colors that our daughter seemed to like.
So babies love colorful things, no big surprise that she will love this play yard. But I've noticed that she does get a bit overstimulated with all the pictures on the bottom and her toys actually get lost on the mat because they blend in with it.Pros: it's easy to put together and take apart, it's relatively light, it's colorful, has built in toys, and is stable.Cons: the base of the play yard slopes inward, makes it hard for my baby to crawl and flip over and all her toys roll right into the center. I sort of fixed that by putting something under the center leg. The other negatives are that it's too colorful on the bottom and has too many pictures so the toys blend in. Also, it's not PVC, phthalate free. I emailed the company and asked them about chemical fire retardants. I don't know if anyone cares, but the foam mattress IS treated with chemicals - chlorinated tris. It was banned in baby clothes by the FDA, and is banned in Europe because it's cancerous. Since the cover of it is porous and is not waterproof, I feel like the chemical can easily get in my daughter's lungs, especially since she loves to suck on fabric. So I sent the yard back. I'll be buying a Joovy, they don't use chemical fire retardants. That was actually the biggest drawback for me.
Overall I adore this playpen. It is bright, well made and sturdy but the reason I gave it 3 stars is that it has a terrible slope toward the center. Our baby tries to roll over and always rolls back into the center where it is low.  One time she rolled to the center placing her head lower than her feet.  This scared me so I feel we can only use it when we are sitting right beside the playpen watching her. January 2013.  We are still using this playpen and it has held up well.  Our daughter who is 16 months now still loves this and it has no damage after a full year of daily use.
I actually called up Graco to ask if the hard surface on the bottom was safe for a toddler to bump his head against as he's trying to walk & move around.  They seemed to think it was perfectly fine, but I don't feel good about leaving him unattended.  They should either have a more cushioned mat that comes with the pack & play or at least sell one that's optional.
I registered for this pack n play solely on the wonderful amazon reviews that I read. I wanted something larger for my baby to play in, and the Graco TotBloc definitely delivers.  That being said, this pack n play stinks as a napping or travel crib.  It's large, bulky, the foam bottom is thin and not very comfy for baby to sleep on, and there is no mattress option for a pack n play this size!  I took this on a trip last weekend and put the baby in there with a blanket on the bottom so she wasn't uncomfortable. Every time she rolled around, it would make the rattle toy attached to the walls of the pack n play move. It actually woke her up, and it was a long night. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wanting this to double as a napping crib.If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with the Joovy like I originally planned.
Let me start by saying that this is very colorful and attractive to baby.  The base is also attractive with lots of colors for baby to 'discover'.There is a play thing on each side - crinkly butterfly, mirror, squeezy sound making ladybug, and rattly bee.  It's large - about 38in square so you'll need some room to place it.  The flipside is that baby has plenty of room to play.  You can store baby's toys in there and still they space to play.It has mesh sides for airflow and so that parents can see in and babies can see out.  It's relatively quick to fold away for travel due to a button on each top arm which 'folds' that side.  A very neat idea.  However, that's where the good stuff ends because there are two major flaws with this product.Why do manufactuers insist on producing fabric based items for a baby that cannot be WASHED ???  Why oh why do they not make the fabric removable - do they not know that kids make a MESS ???  Duh !!!  How is one supposed to remove spit-up and drool (and possibly worse!)?It's perhaps the most important thing in any piece of baby equipment; be it a chair, car seat, pushchair, crib, or playpen.  THE FABRIC SHOULD BE REMOVABLE FOR WASHING.The second issue is that the base pad is only about 3/4 in thick.  That in itself is not so much of an issue as the fact that when it's placed inside the playpen, it 'dips' in the middle - by about 1/2in.  The centre strut /leg that holds the pad sems to be lower than the other legs  causing a dip in the middle (and yes it's on a flat surface).  Although baby hasn't yet 'rolled' into the center, it's not very comforting knowing that the center is not flat.  Perhaps the pad should have been thicker - better yet the center leg should have been the same size as the others.For what we paid, I don't think it's worth the money - especially considering that the pad can't be cleaned without using chmical cleaners (which we don't intend to use around baby).
I rated this 3 stars because while it has many good parts, I was highly disappointed to "realize" when my baby was 4 months old that this set does *not* include any medium flow nipples. We used the slow flow for several months, so those were useful, but the Fast flow were way too fast and we needed something in-between.  Low & behold I walk down the aisle in Target looking for an entirely new bottle system and I see medium nipples that work perfectly for my daughter.  For trying to offer a variety of nipple options, Playtex missed the mark in omitting the medium flow nipple.
I've used these bottles since my sons were born.-I love the fact that they are extremely easy to clean and the liners are very convenient. (but are getting expensive.) I would use these bottles up until you need to make 8oz of formula. *If you use powder formula - the drop-in liners DO NOT hold 8oz of water and the formula you add to it!! I had a mess of formula everywhere!!!
Let me start by saying this is a great concept. I purchased these bottles before my son, who is now 10 weeks old, was born. I planned to breastfeed exclusively. I planned to pump into these bottles. I even took a reviewers advice and got extra large bottles and short liners (which I wouldn't advise to anyone). I liked the idea of not needing to wash a million bottles. I didn't have a dishwasher at the time. (We now do... and maybe I would have stuck with these had that not been the case). I also have a psychotic cat that continually custom selected baby items from the dish drying rack. Drove me nuts.Nothing went to plan. I ended up supplementing my breast milk with formula after one month. My son eats a ton and these bottles don't really do well with formula.POWDERED FORMULAPowdered formula (which I can't stand) doesn't mix well in this bottle. Also, despite the wonderful design for keeping air out... you have to shake powdered formula. Thus, there's air in there and your baby will be gassy.LIQUID (RTF) FORMULAFormula is expensive. Pushing the air out of the bag is a GREAT concept. But when the bag exploded on me twice... I was upset. And reading reviews, I have to say I thought people were just pushing to quickly and clearly that would never happen to me. But it did. Twice. And with a screaming baby... it's really better to have bottles that are ready to go. (Even if prepared, you need to push air out of the bottle... and that takes time).BREASTMILKI don't pump enough to fill these bottles. Pumping takes a lot of time. So.. After I pump my four ounces, I don't want it to explode. And I don't want it to go bad from having so much exposure to air... And if I'm pumping, I'm not feeding my child right away. He eats all the time. Thus, I stopped "expressing" because it seemed to be a waste of time. Why pump into a bottle just to feed it to him right away? (I'm empty after I finish pumping). Now... in the first few weeks, my son killed my nipples. So, pumping into the bottle came in handy. The pump was much kinder. I didn't care if he destroyed silicone. (He didn't... but I'm just sayin'!).I had no problem with the lids on these bottles. I actually prefer these caps to the "newer" ones I found at Babies R Us (for a much higher price). The plastic is sturdy. I liked the silicone nipples because I could boil them (and now I can put them in the dishwasher). This brand is kind of wonderful because they make a variety of bottles and the nipples can be used with different bottles.I didn't hate the bottle enough to say you shouldn't try it. But I didn't like it enough to continue using it. You do not need "extra" exterior bottles. The set comes with enough. The comparison would be like buying a bunch of vaccuums for your vaccuum bags. Since you don't need to wash the exterior anyway... what you have is plenty.
I bought these as burp cloths for my two boys.As burp cloths they are great - nothing fancy, just good at absorbing the spit up.  The fancy burp cloths are usually too flimsy (won't lay flat on your shoulder) and too thin to be helpful.  These stay in place without having to touch/fix it.I have tried them for cloth diapering but it seems they don't hold very well and leak more than the other diaper inserts I've used. I usually don't cloth diaper so I can't say too much on this - this is just from the few times I have used it.
Don't buy these if your looking for a pre-fold that will hold all of your childs waste in,and if you have a heavy wetter don't weven think about it without a doublerDiaper Doubler - Absorbency Booster - 2 Piece Set(these are nice) they are no wear near as absorbent as chinese prefolds, these make great claning clothgs and burp rags though. that's about all they are good for please spend the extra money on diaper service quality prefolds it will be worth it in the end.
A dedicated steam warmer is definitely better than any other option such as a pan of water on the stove (takes too long) or the microwave (danger of uneven heating;  robs contents of nutrients).We have ours in a second-story nursery and have been pleased with it.  The only problem is that the results can be unpredictable - sometimes one capful of water will do the trick just fine, sometimes the bottle feels hot but the milk inside still cold, and sometimes it just goes to town and overheats the contents.  Nonetheless, I figure any heating process will be unpredictable, so I can't fault this model.The unit comes with adapters to hold any standard 4- or 9-oz. bottle;  we've used Avent with no problems.
The design is convenient, except for the water holding tubes which can be annoying to clip to the sides.  Otherwise, having a cooler right there is nice.  Note that it keeps the bottle COOL, and NOT COLD.  You can order replacement/extra ice pack on Tomy website - we keep 2 extras in the freezer as we constantly were forgetting to refreeze the one we had in preparation for a new night (they were $2 each).  Heating is a bit inconsistent and seems to be slower than the quick pro model by the first years.  Overall, good purchase and the price is great on amazon (you'll pay $30 at BRU)
I've never used the bottle cooler part, so I can't comment on that.  I think if you kept this unit in your bedroom or the babies room where you'd want to store some bottles in the cooler instead of having to go to the refridgerator to get them, it would serve a good purpose.  But I always go out to the kitchen to use this, so it's easier to just grab a bottle from the fridge.The little test-tube-looking water containers that you fill up and then pour into the unit to steam the bottles are a bit of a pain.  The little caps that go on them are difficult to snap on and off with one hand when you have a screaming, hungry baby in the other arm! And it's hard to fill them up to the accurate measurement line under the faucet....basically, you constantly have to pour a little water out--Oh, wait, that was too much---fill it back up under the faucet--Oh, wait, that was too much...you see where I'm going with this. So, the water test-tube things aren't very user friendly.The other thing is that the little basket and the container itself that the bottle goes into gets grungy pretty quickly.  It leaves a brownish film on the basket and inside the hole where the basket goes into, so you have to clean it out frequently.  And I've definately found that the amount of water they say to put in the steamer according to the size and temp. of the bottle isn't quite right.  You really have to play with the amount of water it takes to appropriately warm the bottle up.  Scrap the instructions!!  Thankfully, my baby isn't very temperature-sensitive when it comes to taking her bottle.On the positive side, I think using this thing is probably easier than running the bottle under warm tap water or putting it in a pan of boiling water because it does heat the bottle up rather quickly.
This was nice to have when I was pumping. I'd wake up in the middle of the night and heat up my daughter's bottle. Now that I'm formula feeding, it's not necessary.
It does the job, but does it make the loudest noise doing it.  My husband said it sounded like I was milking a cow.  I would have opted using a double breast pump, but it was much more pricier.  After two months I found that it was harder to express breast milk using the same suction as before.  I don't know why.  The pump was fine and working the same, even at the highest level, my breast would not fully be expressed.  I had to just ditch this item in the end.
This pump is decent but wasn't enough for me. I am home with the baby so I didn't think I needed one of the larger double pumps since I am not working. However, I needed to pump to improve my supply in the begining and also while I was healing from a cracked nipple and the single pump just didn't cut it. I ended up purchasing the Medela Pump-in-Style and it works much better. Now I use the double pump to fill an evening bottle for my husband to feed to the baby. It would take twice as long with the single pump. I REALLY hate pumping so it is worth everything to get it done in half the time! I think this pump is only worth it if you will rarely need to pump or to use for just a few minutes before feeding the baby to relieve engorgement.
My sister used this pump for 3 months (daily) and passed it down to me which I was able to use for 3 months (daily) and then it died on me. I used it much more than the occasional use that it's meant for (which I didn't know this at the time). I used it about 5-6 times a day for the first month and then 3 times a day for the following 2 months before it died. It's horribly loud which can drive you nuts so I put a blanket over to drown out the noise. My husband was actually glad when it died because then we could buy another one that's less noisy even if it meant we had to spend $200 on a new one. I guess we got good use out of it considering how much it was improperly used but if you are looking to use a pump more than once per day I would definitely get the Medela Swing model...it's GREAT and is much quieter. After listening to a baby crying all the time, listening to this pump was the last thing I wanted to do so if you value silence...steer clear!
Overall this appears to be a decent gate set - it easily configured to fit the area we needed to cordon off from our wee one. However I do have a few issues with the gate that are keeping me from being completely satisfied.The biggest issue, to me, is the door release. Basically, you squeeze up on the handle and then pull the door up. It actually takes a little  effort and the gate itself doesn't feel that it's truly sturdy enough for this abuse. Plus, did I mention it takes a lot of effort? It's not as well designed as several of the other gates we've used.The second point is just how narrow this gate is. I am not a large person and while I do fit through the opening I do worry that some of my larger friends may have a harder time of it. This width of a coach class airline seat, maybe a tad less, and you have idea on the width of the opening.Their are some good points. The gate is easy to configure. When you have it set up, it feels like it's locked into place (unlike a few other large area gates I've used). It does feel very secure. Additionally, it won't be hard to take the gate off it's wall moorings should I need to temporarily remove the gate. This is a great feature.Overall this is an ok gate. It may be the best gate for versatile areas where traditional gates don't fit. However if you can avoid this gate and go for something else - you might be better off looking around.
I have this gate set up in two different parts of my house... one part as-is, and one part with two extensions. The gate that that has no extensions is very durable, and easy to open, however there is a bar that goes across the bottom of the "door", and myself and my guests are always bumping bare toes on it...ouch!In the other part of my house, I have this gate with two extensions. It's such a LONG gate, that there is no stability... the whole thing kind of sways, and my toddler finally was able to pull it out of the wall. There aren't many gates out there that will let you cover such a wide room, though, and for that it was nice while it lasted.
This is a great crib so you wonder why I rated it 3 stars? Well I would love this crib for infants and short toddlers but If you go by the age on the box you can be fooled they say this crib is for ages 0-3 I would not put a 3 year old in this crib with the wheels on it!!!!! My 2 year old almost fell out of it ( Don't worry I knew my 2year old could get out of it if he tried so I left the wheels off and Daddy was right there and caught him) Truthfully if you have a 2 year old get him a blow up bed with ridges around it for traveling. Otherwise this is a great pruduct for children under 2years whose shoulder are at or below the railing. It is quite easy to put together and very sturdy with the wheels off but I never put them on so I wouldn't know how they are with them on. But my son slept great in it. It was a perfect temporary crib for our week vacation and I only used it for him to go to sleep in when I was laying on the bed right next to it.
In the middle of a summer heatwave my husband and I were faced with either disassembling our 7 month old's huge crib and moving it into our air conditioned bedroom for a more comfortable sleep, or getting a portable crib which can also be used later in the year when Baby #2 is due.  We purchased this and are delighted.  It assembled in under 10 minutes, which is unusual since most baby items take several people and loads of patience to figure out complicated directions.  This crib is light weight yet sturdy, nicely compliments any room, and is comfortable for our daughter for either sleep or play. It handles easily and can roll between doorways with no problem.  We gave it only three stars because I felt the metal bars were spaced too far apart and are not baby-friendly since the standard portable crib bedding doesn't come up high enough to protect little heads from getting bumped.  Our child already hit her head twice and the bedding did nothing to cushion the blow.  All in all it's a fine item and priced well.  We'll get better use out of it when the second baby comes since we don't have lots of space to fit another full size crib.
I bought this for my son. I thought it was a good product for a fair price. He has been using it for the past 8 months with no problems. But just yesterday I saw a sticker on the side of the strap that said the table had a 20 lb weight limit! I was surprised. My son almost weighs that and I don't want to buy another table now. Next time I will buy a more substantial one for more money that can be used longer.
I purchased these covers because there doesn't seem to be anything else to fit the contoured changing pad.  Even after just one washing, the cover already shrunk.  I washed in cold water and dried on low since I had read the reviews saying they would shrink.  It didn't help, they still shrunk.  They still work though, but the corners of the changing pad are crumched down.  I don't see the problem with the straps either.  Mine are attached to the bottom of the pad, so there is no need for any slits for them.  Overall, these covers serve their purpose, and that's about all.  I would definitely suggest covering your changing pag with SOMETHING so that all the yuck doesn't get down into all the little crevices of the pad.  You might prefer covering the pad with a receiving blanket, so you can easily toss it in the washer with no worries when it becomes soiled.
We haven't had any shrinkage problems, but the terry material isn't soft at all.  Even when it's machine-dried, it's stiff and rough as if it were line-dried.The pad's safety straps stick out easily enough from under the edges of the cover, but since they are from the same manufacturer it really was poorly designed.
First of all why is this product listed under toys?Now to the point. I bought this hoping that it would help replicate a pillow top mattress as my son has been co-sleeping with me and he has become accustomed to my mattress and I want to try to transfer him to his own bed. Sadly this isn't as plump as what it looks or as much as what other reviewers try to make it out to be. I even tried it out by placing my son's mattress on the floor and lying on it myself, his mattress still feels hard as a rock! Plus his mattress is a simmons beauty rest foam mattress with square corners, so it's slightly bigger than the average mattress and this pad still fits loosely on it, but I will add that a well fitted sheet seems to help fix this problem a little. So far it has held up in the wash, but mind you I wash it on cold and dry it on extra low. My son is just over 4 months old and I don't have any worries about SIDS because of this product. To give you an idea of the thickness of this pad it is just over the width of my pinky finger so about 1-2cm.
I'm trying to get the toxic smell out of this mattress pad. I've washed it 4 times so far and now I'm airing it outside. It is the plastic liner that smells toxic. The pad itself is quite a lot thinner than I expected based on the reviews. It might make a difference in wetness protection but I don't imagine it could make much of a difference in comfort.
At 2 months of age, my doctor said to start supplementing my breastmilk with formula at each feeding. She would not take the avent bottle. We switched to Playtex and have had no problems.The nipples are sooo long and even the "slow flow" alow for much more formula thru than the playtex.Now, the only use our Avent bottles get is to store the formula made for the day in the fridge. Maybe as she gets older, she will like the avent style nipple....
My son has reflux so we have an ongoing battle with spit up in our house. When I stopped breast feeding I tried a couple different types of bottles and eventually ended up sticking with Dr. Brown's because they helped the most with his gas and spit up. After 3 months of washing all of the parts that Dr. Brown's bottles have, I decided to try Avent. I like the bottles, they are made of a good quality material and they are wide, which made it really easy for me to mix formula in them. My son didn't have a problem latching on or anything, and his gas didn't get any worse, but his spit up became out of control!!!! He began spitting up twice as much as he did on the Dr. Brown's bottles. I was forced to switch back to Dr. Brown's because I just couldn't handle changing his clothes and mine 5 times a day. So they just didn't work for my baby. However, I never had a problem with them leaking...they are pretty good bottles!
We have tried every bottle out there and like these the best for our newborn. There are a few drawbacks. The nipple flow is fast for a newborn. The bottles also leak which is annoying. Usually if you just unscrew and screw top back on, it stops leaking. The bottles are easy to clean.
In 2000 when my first son was born, I bought the Avent bottles to go with my Isis breast pump (which I LOVE) because everyone raved about how they were the best.  The first time my son tried the bottle with a newborn nipple he couldn't get anything to come out.  After trying for awhile, I finally called Avent and they told me to move up to a different size nipple.  These bottles worked out relatively well after that dilemma.  With me second son I assumed I would use the bottles again and tried the newborn nipple with the opposite result.  The flow was way too fast for him and he would choke and spit out half the milk every time I would try to feed him. I finally gave up on Avent bottles and went with the much cheaper and economical Evenflo Classic bottles (on the recommendation of the lactation consultant.)
I decided to use these because I wanted the Avent Breast Pump and would use these with it.  Well, my newborn had a hard time latching onto the nipples and when he did they were way too fast with the flow.  He would choke and gasp almost everytime.  I now use the Playtex Ventaire bottles and he doesn't have as much of a problem.  Every baby is different, though, but if you have a baby that tends to want to eat quickly, these won't work so well.
I've only tried the 9oz bottles and they leak for me alot. It's really annoying since I spent so much money thinking that they were quality. They also make alot of noise when my son eats. And he doesn't like the nipple, it's too thick for him to get a good suction. One thing that is good is these bottles don't give him gas which I've tried cheap bottles and he gets gassy with them. After trying alot of bottles the only brand I have absolutely no problem with is the Dr.Brown bottles. They are just the best. But they have extra parts to clean which is a pain.
We recieved these bottles as a gift for our son (now 16 months)and expected greatness from Avent. When I opened the first package I was amazed at how stiff the nipples were that are included with these bottles. Stiffness is hardly a correct simulation of the breast. The bottles are also very wide and hard for little hands to grip when they begin to hold their own bottles. I also saw no indication that my son got any less air from using the Avent system. I MUCH prefer the softer, easier to hold, less air producing Playtex Nursers which is what we ended up switching him to.
Everyone I know has registered for Avent bottles and generally found success.  The shape is handy and comfortable, the pieces easily fit together, and the bottle travels well.  The main problem across the board though is the fact that the bottles leak.  I knew from the beginning not to tighten them too hard, but even so, we have had problems.  It just goes to show there is not perfect bottle or stroller for that matter out there!
I bought a bunch of these bottles because many people have recommended them to me.  My son HATES them.. the nipples are too hard for him and it takes him forever to get anything from them..  He wears himself out sucking on them.  I finally switched to the gerber comfort hold bottles which he loves.  They are similar but have softer nipples.  My son is no longer cranky from not getting enough formula. I know alot of people love them, but my son doesnt.  I never had a problem with leaks however as some people said.
These bottles are just okay.  I registered for them because of all the good things that I heard about them.  First of all, they do leak.  Making sure they are completely dry does help but does not prevent the problem entirely.  Second of all, they are expensive.  I have heard just as many good things about other brands of bottles that are a lot less expensive.  For my next baby I will not be using these.
I like the nipple flow on these bottles for my newborn, as well as the small bottle size, but I found that the nipple only vented air back into the bottle properly about 50% of the time.  The rest of the time, my baby would nurse until the pressure was too great, de-latch, and air would flood into the bottle through the nursing hole.
I have to agree with reviewers, the nipple of the Avent bottles is great. It's obvious watching my baby that he latches on similar to the way he does on the breast.The problem is that the bottles leak like crazy. My little guy ends up wearing as much milk as he drinks. I've tried all of the suggestions, but have had no success in making the bottle leak proof. I've had to go out and buy different bottles with nipples I don't like as much just so that I don't have the mess.
I really like this pump.  Works great sort of a pain to clean but easier than having to clean tubing on an electric.  The bottles however are junk.  After one use they leaked from under the plastic disk.  EVERY bottle I have leaks.  In order to stop it is a pain.  I pull up on the nipple and roll it around clockwise to make sure it's in there right, then I use a rubber gripper and tighten the crap out of it so it won't leak.  What a PAIN!  I sold my lot on ebay and replaced them w/ the Playtex vent air.  I did save one bottle so I could pump into it though.
I read all the reviews on this pump but still wasn't convinced about buying this pump. I originally purchased a Gerber pump and it worked until it cracked. I asked a lactation consultant what kind of pump she'd recommend and she recommended Avent and Medela. I needed a pump in my price range so I chose the Avent.I like how the suction mimics a baby's latch but milk gets stuck everywhere and it leaks all over the place. The pump also makes an annoying squeaking noise and sometimes I lose suction. I'd recommend this pump over Gerber though. I will give it credit though, it's a lot easier to take apart and clean.
It can be difficult to get started with this pump. Once you achieve letdown it's great but it can take 10-15 minutes to get there. DON'T freeze milk in these bottles - use a bag - they didn't seal properly and the milk went bad.
My friend gave me her pump when she was finished with it, I just boiled all the parts, and then threw them in the dishwasher.  Anyway, the pump is fine for a bottle, I only use it once in the day, but during the pumping time it will lose it's suction or you have to get it on just right before it will really get the milk quantity you want.  It took me about 4 times (4 days) to figure out  how the pump suction needs to be for myself.The other complaint I have with the pump is the parts that screw together to make the pump complete come unscrewed throughout the pump time.  (the bottle, and the other screwed on piece to the pump.)  This is really anoying while you're trying to pump.Overall it's ok, but I think I can find another one.
Mine just didn't work with this pump.  It wasn't operator error - it worked, it just didn't work well, and it didn't work equally well on both breasts (one is larger).  I had to go with an electric, and even then I still would have been better off with a variable shield.
Protects heads from sharp corners well enough. Little fingers are eventually able to figure out that it's fun to pull off though. Just needs to be re-taped.
worked great for a few weeks but living in a hot humid climate the seals eventually loosened up. very easy to use and install
I just installed these a couple of days ago, so I will downgrade my review if I have any problems in the future. Mine came with a 3M tape, and the installation seems very sticky. They are certainly installed firmly enough that my toddler daughter will not be able to pull them off, and that was the whole point. The only reasons I knocked off a couple stars are:1. The installation tape comes in pre-cut strips, so you have to use several of them. It would have been better if they sent a roll of the double sided tape instead. If the tape was in one roll, that would also make installation of the foam strip easier because you could put one piece of tape on the foam, and just pull the backing away from the two ends to get it aligned properly before pulling off the rest of the backing and securing the middle of the strip to the table.2. The foam strip develops something of a shape memory from being rolled up in the package, and by the time you get to the center of the roll, you really have to fight against that curved shaped to install the tape and get the strip installed on the table in a straight manner. It would have been better if it came in strips (perhaps two 6-foot strips or four 3-foot strips), but I do realize this would have also increased the shipping cost.3. There were no directions included. I am sure there must have been some things that would have made installation easier, but they included no directions other than simple pictures showing to put the tape on the foam and stick the foam on the table.
Only reason why this is 3 star is its not good for protecting corner walls. My son peeled it off immediately and the wall plaster came off and he was trying to eat it.So I. My attemp to baby proof the corners I created more problems.I had to fix the plaster from peeling off and prevent him from eatting it. But I think this is the only solution out there to protect corners.
I ordered 2 packages in order to cover the appropriate circumference of 1 coffee table and the front edges of two end tables. When the package arrived the length of edging was 7'6", not 12' as advertised. That means I was completely short and could not complete my project. Aside from the lack of length, the product works well and seems secure. I would have ordered more had I known about the length. It's quite a disparity between 7' and 12', so purchase appropriately.
These provide protection for our daughter on the coffee table.  My only complaint is that the corners don't stay on and that's where we need it the most!
It works but I expected it to be a different color, a bit more white, rather than beige. thank you
The guard came heavily distorted from probably sitting in the box for way too long. The fragment of about 20 inches in length had to be cut off due to severe distortion. I used the guard to cover the fireplace brick edges and it worked out fine since I didn't need the whole length. I would have given it one star and returned it if I used to to cover a table.
These are very basic.  They're terry cloth but they really don't look as nice as I had hoped.  I don't see this lasting a long time.  For the money, I'd reccommend the Wendy Bellisomo brand of cover - they're a better material than these are.
I like the idea of this however they do not stay connected very well. If they stayed connected it would be perfect. I have twins and have 4 strollers but sometimes travelling it is nice to travel a little lighter and use umbrella strollers.
These are easy to put on and take off.  They work well to connect two umbrella strollers.  The rubber inserts do fall out easily, so I can tell these may not last long.  They only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers.  I use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and I connect in 4 places instead of 3 for a sturdier connection.
This is a great booster and is effective for it's job--but there are a few things that could make it an even better seat.  I can't use this booster in my home because it is made out of a rubber substance that my kids LOVE to pull apart!! My young toddler likes to bite and take chunks out of the booster seat.  If you have an aggressive chewer in the house, you may want to think about this--this material is highly attractive to chewers!  Also, the seat does not come equipped with straps.  I had to switch to another booster with straps due to some safety issues associated with this also.
The Cooshie Booster is a good booster seat for toddlers when used in the right conditions.  However, my wife and I are yet to experience the miraculous calming effects at the dinner table that so many other reviews have mentioned.The Booster is made from one solid piece soft foam material.  The material is very lightweight and cleans up very easily.  The one-piece construction also aids in clean-up - no cracks to trap food or let spills get through to your furniture.  Plus, the material grips on wooden chairs;  it's never budged when our active two-year-old is using it.  This ease of use, both at the table and when getting washed in the sink, are its major selling points.On the other hand, the one-piece construction makes the bulky Booster less than ideal for use away from home.  Forget about using it at restaurants because it's not different enough from what they'll provide.  We only take ours out when we're going to Grandma and Grandpa's house for a few days;  otherwise, it's more trouble than it's worth.  Sure, it's lightweight, but the supplied carrying case is roughly the size of a bowling ball bag.  Plus, the bag is very cheap and unattractive;  basically they're selling you the packaging as a carrying case.Lastly, we haven't seen the Booster effect any great improvement in our son's attention span at the table - when he wants to get down, he wants to get down, period.  I don't believe that any booster seat could make such a difference in toddler behavior, so I don't hold it against this one;  I'm just surprised how many others have reported these results.  If anything, our son is frustrated by the Booster because its size prevents him from climbing into his chair unassisted.  Because he's in the toddler independence phase, he'd often rather climb into another chair by himself rather than be lifted into the Booster.So, the Booster does a great job of providing a simple-to-use and easy-to-maintain solution at home, but if you take your little one out frequently, a more portable options would suit you better.PROS*  Stable, soft foam stays in place without marking chairs*  Very easy to clean with one-piece constructionCONS*  Bulky on the go*  Will frustrate toddlers who like to climb into their own chair
These are nice jumbo corners that didn't make our table look too hideous, but at some point your baby's going to learn to pull them off!  This didn't happen for us for a while and I really think any other brands would have the same problem, so this one's the best in the market.  My daughter fell and hit her face on the corner guard and her mouth still bled, though the damage would have been much worse without the corner guard.  It's definitely better to have these than nothing at all.
just to point out first, the guards are NOT white! they came in a light brown. they cover the corner very well seeing how big they are, but once again the sticky tape sucks. I have yet to find a good double sticky tape.
Use these on areas where the Jumbo size is just too big.  I found the tape supplied a pain to use.  It;s not 3M just some generic stuff that is inferior.  Taking the backing off one it's stuck to the pad takes a bit of effort.  They seem to have stick OK but 3M tape would be better.
I ordered these for our coffee table corners. The are rounded corners, but not so round they can't knock a little noggin. From the information I read about this product it said to order the jumbo/wider (rather than standard size) guards. Unfortunately I guess what I really need is something not just for wide corners but rounded as well. We have a lot of items to baby-proof, these seem very soft and durable, I am sure I will find corners that can use them. But they won't work for the coffee table and that is the area I am the most concerned with at the moment.
I considered this when it was full price, 50 bucks.  When I saw it for 25, I just had to get it.  I took it back the next day because the latches that keep the buttons away from Baby broke and the buttons wouldn't work.This second try has been better.  I found it for 12.50 and decided that it would make a gift for someone else if it didn't work for me (man, I can be cruel :)  This time, it seems to work pretty well.  All the buttons work.I did have a little trouble with the light because when the light is on, the button is pressed in.  I have fingernails, so the button can be a bit tricky until you get the hang of it.I am glad I decided to try this product again, but I wouldn't have paid the 50 bucks for it.  If you can't find it on sale, get a regular CD player: they plug in and are cheaper.
I bought this for our son when he was born 3 years ago.  I loved it at first.  For his first 6 months of life he slept in a bassinet and this conveniently attached to it and then came the crib issues where he would stand up and try to get it off the side which inadvertently made the cd skip, fall off the track and post the "E" sign. When he moved to a big boy bed we placed it on the dresser.  I, unlike other users, had no trouble with the volume.  In fact, I found myself turning it down on numerous occasions as I could here it in other rooms and it seemed like it was blaring.  The cd compartment is a little hard to get into and yes it is a little noisy but who in their right mind is going to change a cd while their baby is already sleeping.  It shouldn't take longer than the 20 songs or so on a regular lullaby cd to get your baby to sleep.  Therefore I never had an issue with the noise of opening the cd compartment.  The battery compartment on the other hand is a joke.  I now have another baby and just a couple days ago was once again trying to open the battery compartment.  I had to put all my strength into it and when it finally decided to open, the whole cd player flew out of my hand, hit the wall, the front compartment broke off and well needless to say wouldn't play another cd after that.  It's ridiculous to have such an item for only 3 years and then have to garbage it because it's so poorly made.  On the other hand though, I was thankful to have it many times as it did lull my kids into dreaminess and listening to it on the baby monitor-it had the same effect on me.  So I guess it serves it's purpose just inconveniently.  I debated buying another one in hopes "First Years" would have fixed these issues but honestly I'd rather find another product who can make things right the first time.
We have been using this seat for about 6 months with our toddler boy.  I love how it attaches to the seat easily and securely.  Once it's on, it doesn't budge, but it removes easily.  However, if our son sits down to pee, he gets pee all over the place.  Even with him holding his private part down with his finger.  The cheap "bob the builder" toilet seat does a better job of keeping the pee in the toilet while he is sitting.  I wish they would make the seat more compatible with boys.
Before buying this seat, we used a generic seat from a local department store that was padded and pretty flat, with a slight "pee shield" in front. It was pretty bulky and messy, so we looked elsewhere. The Bjorn Toilet Trainer is definitely more contoured to little peoples' bodies, which is great, but we still found it to be pretty messy.It fits our toilet great- it doesn't slip at all. Sometimes, though, it will stick to my son's skin after he's been sitting on it for several minutes, so it pops up as he stands. I can't really blame the Bjorn, though, as it seems to be just the fact that it is made out of plastic.I like that it is so slim, so it doesn't add much height to the existing toilet. It's easier for my son to sit down and stand up (with the help of a stool.) It's also very simplistic, so it is easy to clean.Speaking of cleaning, though, I have to clean it after every single use. I guess I was hoping for a basic seat that would act exactly like a normal toilet seat- the child sits down, the pee goes in the toilet, and you flush it away. Unfortunately, whenever my son urinates, even when keeping his parts pointed down, the pee gets everywhere! Maybe it is our particular toilet or something, but the splashing created from sitting so close to the edge of the toilet makes quite a mess. The urine gets on the toilet seat, between the bjorn and the seat, and on the bjorn itself- up under the edges.Honestly, I'm not really sure how the device could be improved to prevent this issue. I'd say- spend less money for a basic seat that you still have to clean up, but at least you'd have saved money! If you buy this seat (at least, for a boy), keep some wipes handy to keep your toilet seat clean for others to use!
Yes I am trying the impossible of early potty training with my 13 month old.  This seems well built but just in case anyone was wondering, a little too big for a 75%ile 1 year old
This seat has such great reviews, I didn't think I could go wrong with it. We've had it for over 2 years now, and I'm getting fed up with cleaning up the mess. At first the splash guard wasn't tall enough, and everything ended up on the floor and on my son's clothes. Now, that he knows to tuck it inside and keep his legs closed, the mess is on the regular toilet seat. I have to clean the toilet seat every time I lift the BabyBjorn potty seat. Also, it would have been nice not having to remove the seat every time, and just flip it instead.Anyway, an overpriced item in my opinion. And I can't believe it has such great reviews. Maybe I'll change my mind about it once my daughter is old enough to start using it. But for now, not very impressed.
I'm sure this is a good toilet seat. My daughter refused (still refuses) to use this b/c the elevated curve of the seat for some reason scares her off. It looks like it's made well and I hate to give a 3 star review due to my daughter's quirky view on it. However, I'm not sure if other toddlers new to using a toilet would have similar stresses since this is all new to them. Maybe this would work better for older children?
After 3 weeks of use maybe 1-2x/day, the rubber handle is separating from the rest of the potty.  I just began hanging it from a hook, so maybe that had something to do with it.  This isn't a problem that I read in any of the reviews I perused, and the instructions on the box say to hang it on a hook.  I am returning it and hoping for better luck with the replacement.Other than that, my daughter loves this.  She's 18 mo old, 21 lbs, and fit it quite well.  We only managed to catch her doing her business using it once though.  The product fit very well on my elongated toilet seat and was easy to adjust.
I ordered this for use while visiting my parents. It is okay for something like that, but I would not use it for much else.I have a very active 2 year old who does not always want to take time to sit on the potty. She can easily scoot accross the floor while seated on it.It might be good if you have a very early potty trainer or one on the (very) smaller side. My daughter is about 35 inches tall and her knees come to her chest while seated on this.
I bought this potty after reading the reviews and trying to decide on the little or big potty.  I didn't think the small one would be a problem, since  my 18-month old son is on the small side.  However, after receiving it, I would only recommend this potty to those who are doing EC or for travel. My son seems to like it, but he looks huge on it and it will not last for long.  It also slides all over the tile floor like someone mentioned.  I really wish I would have bought the Bjorn big potty.
I own two of these potties.  We're practicing elimination communication and these potties are the perfect size for infants!  I love that there aren't any extra bells and whistles to get in the way of easy clean up.We have one in blue and one in yellow.  My only complaint is that the yellow one came with huge black scuff marks and scratches all over it.  Even with extensive scrubbing, I can't get all the black off.  Obviously, this doesn't affect useability, but I feel robbed paying full-price for something that looks like it's been thrown under a bus.  I'm sure Amazon would have accepted it as a return, but what new parent has the time for that?  Big disappointment!  Especially since the yellow color was sooooo cute!  Way cuter than the blue - which, in comparison, seems a bit dull.
I understand that boys need a splash guard, but there's little chance that this bright-pink potty will be purchased for a boy.  And at least our little girl finds the splash guard uncomfortable, because she has to straddle it.  She has difficulty sitting down with her legs apart and often pulls the bucket out and turns it around to sit more comfortably.  I wish that baby bjorn made an insert for girls, but they don't.  Other than that (or if your girl doesn't mind this issue), it's a great potty.  It's the right size, the right distance off the ground for a two-year-old, and the back is high enough to be supportive.
This was the third potty I purchased in an effort to find the right one for my daughter.  While reasonably inexpensive and cute, the design did not work well for us.  Perhaps this feature was designed with boys in mind, but that plastic lip in the front made it difficult for my daughter to sit down comfortably.  And, she complained that the potty hurt her butt.  Instead, I would recommend the Summer Infant Step-by-Step Trainer. It worked brilliantly for us.
I think what makes this potty work well for my twins is the high arms.  They like to sit on it and started the day it arrived.  Also, it arrived in one day.  But they fought over the right to sit on it and I was made to buy a second one.  I have them in white and blue.There is something about this potty that makes a little one understand its purpose.  I couldn't believe how comfortable they are for them sitting on it, due to the arms and back and overall design.  I think the price was favorable and feel great about the purchase of these two potty chairs.They're right now in the early stages of learning.  We'll be using these for awhile I expect.
It's cute but why don't these little potties have a latch that prevents a toddler from lifting and flinging the potty bowl around? Whoa! We have a very active one who just wants to pick up everything and walk it around the house. Then again, I haven't seen a potty chair yet that has a way to lock down the bowl.
My little two year old daughter is...well...LITTLE.  I bought this potty based on the excellent reviews here and for the most part, it delivered.1. It was relatively inexpensive.2. No bells and whistles to distract.3. Easy to clean.But, being that my kiddo is a shrimp AND a girl, the molded splash guard thing kept poking her in a highly uncomfortable way when she'd try to sit on this thing and it got to the point where when she'd see this potty she'd scream.  As a test, we got the pink girly version of the Summer 3 stage potty trainer and the screaming stopped.I'd recommend taking a look at this thing at a local store before buying.  It's a pretty good product, it just didn't work for us.
We bought this because my youngest daughter won't train on a potty seat on the toilet, so we thought this might help her transition from diapers.  It's just plastic.  I had hoped there'd be a way to put a plastic liner in the hole part so we could just take the liner off instead of having to clean the plastic bowl, but unless we want her to sit on the liner, that's not an option.  Oh well, it's a big overpriced piece of plastic.
love the high back and easily accessible to dump and clean. the front is skinny enough for him to sit with his feet positioned nicely. what i dont like is my little one keeps saying his bum hurts and doesnt like to sit on it. when he sits for more than a few seconds and gets up, he has a red mark where the plastic touches his bum. he opts for the real toliet, even though it is awkward for himto sit.
We also own a Prince Lionheart pottyPOD and a potty seat for the big toilet when we're out and about. My 2 year old son strongly prefers the pottyPOD, which he finds much more comfortable. He will not use this one for #2, and mostly only uses it when he knows he needs to get to the potty quickly and this is the one nearby. He says it is not as comfortable, and he has a tendency to sort of scrunch over when sitting on it. However, I prefer it as there is much less mess--he's never had anything not be totally contained by the potty. It is easy to clean and appropriately sized. I think if this was the only potty we had, he would be ok with it (though I suspect training might have taken longer, as he won't happily sit on this one for long stretches). Also, he usually needs help getting on it. He's just shy of 3' tall and weighs about 28lbs. He doesn't think he can just sit down on this one because of the splash guard (which is what prevents the mess) and waits to be helped. With the PottyPOD he just sits right down and then scoots to the best position.It does live up to most of the claims -- it doesn't move around, even when he is not sitting calmly; it is easy to clean; the high back is nice (though again, my son seems to scrunch forward when on this potty, which I think has to do with the high back); the design is essentially innocuous and not out of place in an adult bathroom (ours is in the main floor powder room, the only bathroom a guests use, so this is important).
Our toddler still doesn't use it much, but the few times he has gone to sit on it, the white top with the weird hump on it trips him up and hits him in the wrong place. Horrible design flaw. However, we put the white bin beneath the blue chair, and it is a flat surface.
It seems like a great product, but if you have a tall child or you potty-train really early, I don't think it's that great. My son grew out of it LONG before he was potty-trained. Too short in my opinion.
This is a very nice potty seat. We've had it since my son was 6 months old, and he's been sitting on it on and off since then. It's a good size, seems comfortable enough for him, is simple, and is easy to dump out and clean. He's now 21 months and potty training, and the seat is great for him when he comes running over saying "go potty, go potty" and can easily sit and pee.Why only 3 stars? Because theSummer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Whiteis essentially the same potty but MUCH cheaper. We have one BabyBjorn and 2 Summer Infants, and they're all great. I actually slightly prefer the cheaper Summer Infant.
It's ok. It's well made, and doesn't slide on the floor. It's just not working out for my little one. It's a hard plastic seat, and my toddler doesn't care for it. My toddler is tall for her age, and has long legs. She's never been very comfortable on it.
Overall this is a nice little training potty.  Simple design, high back for comfort and easy to clean.  My son seems to like it just fine but I wish it had a taller splash guard.  My son is 20months old, 3+ ft tall and weighs a little over 30lbs.  He fits on this potty just fine but he ALWAYS tinkles over the splash guard so I have to aim his weewee down for him.  I would not let my son use this by himself at this point (we've only just started potty training) because odds are I will end up with tinkle all over the floor.
Our almost 3 yr old boy prefers the toilet with the babybjorn seat this fits onto toilet seat. He prefers flushing and using the big boy toilet.We will take this in the car for emergencies
It's your durable, pink average potty chair. I wish I had bought one that was also a stepstool. Our bathroom is small, so now I have to store both.
I just received my son's potty chair two days ago and he absolutely loves it.  He sat it in it like a chair for an entire day the first day but when he took a pee in the potty chair, it went all over the floor instead of into the bowl.  The downfall of this chair is that, the front piece that's suppose to block the pee from spilling out, is not high enough.  My son is a 2 year old and he's rather tall for his age but height has nothing to do with the front piece.  It's just not made high enough to block the pee from spilling out.  However, it is easy to clean because the bowl just pulls out easily.
My daughter is still only 18 months old, so perhaps I should wait a few more months before writing this review. However, I wish I'd bought a potty seat (BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Black) instead of a standalone potty for the following reasons:1. My daughter is terrified of this seat. I'm not sure why, but it is the only thing I've ever tried to sit her on that makes her cry and which she refuses to sit on. She hates it, and I'm not sure why.2. She definitely knows what it is. She comes into the bathroom to me and points at it and says, "Potty." every time we go in the bathroom. However, she stays clear of it. I think the hollow seat and restrictive sides may be traumatizing to her. She is much more interested in my potty.3. Now that I know all of this, I also see the benefits of a potty seat from a clean up perspective. If she'd prefer to use the adult potty, I won't have to clean up poops by hand like I would with this one.All in all, I thought this would be preferable to her than a potty seat, and I was totally wrong. I think I'll re-sell my unused potty, and buy a potty seat which will be easier for me in the first place!
because while i liked how it looked my son didnt want to use it. i ended up with an elmo potty that flushes. he doesnt seem so interested in that one either. but the bjorn borg is very expensive for what you get. it is at least very sturdy.
These bottles are great!  I love pumping and storing milk in them.  However, the nipples and all of the other pieces are not needed if you're using other bottles (which I think most people would be).  I hear they're great slow flow nipples however I'd be happy with just the bottles in this set.
I did not buy this, but I have the Medela Pump In Style.  Thanks to those who mentioned that the Evenflo nipples would fit the bottles, but it's the Evenflo Classic nipples that fit, not the Evenflo Elite nipples.  Now I just need to find caps that would fit without having to buy this whole set.
If all you want is something to pump into and/or store breastmilk in, this won't let you down - but you can get many more bottles for your money going with the 4oz evenflo or gerber bottles, both of which come in BPA free versions.  (The colored plastic evenflo are BPA free, not the clear plastic ones)  Both brands will screw onto Medela pump hardware and are light enough to do hands-free pumping.
First, these really do protect bedding against leaks and spills. Get the bed sized ones as an under layer (which adds cushioning from the plasticky mattresses that are made today), layer on the pretty sheets, then use a smaller pad under the diaper area. This protects the sheets but the very bottom pad protects your mattress in case a true accident occurs. I must admit that after washing, these pads did pill but this did not deteriorate their effectiveness. I'd go to Target for the softer, thinner, prettier, and just as effective smaller size. It's the difference between wearing a hospital pad versus a brand name pad. Both work just as well but one is more confortable on the go.
I have 2 packs in different sizes. On the package it's advertized as a burp cloth. I've used it over a pillow on my lap, but it's too stiff to use over your shoulder. It's good at trapping moisture and keeping the surface beneath from getting wet or damp. It stayed strong after several washes. I used to lay my daughter on it to protect her mattress or sheets, but I find that it doesn"t breathe well enough and when she had baby acne it made the break-outs much worse.
it's not waterproof. lets pee through on the matress or whatever it's laying upon. i don't like it that much
These pads are very absorbent and certainly serve the purpose, but they don't look very good after you wash them.  For the price I suppose you can't expect much, but the Carter's lap pads wash much better.  If you are going to get some, use them under things and buy the white ones.  The colors seem to show the pilling more.  I use them under the bassinett sheet now.  I used to use them on top of the changing pad, but my baby is only 2 months old and they already look quite old.
While I agree these cups don't leak, they are difficult to get clean. The underside of the lid has crevasses around the mouth bit that are deep and narrow and almost impossible to get really clean.  I have been using ours for awhile and regularly sterilizing in boiling water, but the residue build up in the lid has gotten to the point where I have to toss them and buy new sippy cups. Too bad, as they are great in the no-leak department. I will be buying a kleen kanteen sippy--no leaks, stainless steel and easy to clean.
This inflatable tub was perfect! A good size, no frills, and a suction cup that worked well for mounting it to the shower wall when we were finished using it. It worked great, until we started noticing slow leaks. We'd super glue one, only to find another a few weeks later. Time to buy a new tub.*Update - all the other tubs have the same negative reviews about splitting seams over time. Since this tub worked so well for us until it split and we love the suction cup, we just bought another one. Ah well.
I couldn't find anywhere--not on amazon nor on the product or its packaging--what this tub is made of, but I suspect it might be made of PVC. It has a strong new-shower-curtain/new-pool-toy smell when you first open it, and I let it air out for a few days before using it. The smell is gone now, but I would have loved it if this tub were made of a less smelly (and probably more eco-friendly) material.Also, the tub doesn't fit directly under the faucet--half the water goes in the inflatable tub, and half of it goes between the inflatable tub and the side of the bathtub. I fill a large plastic bowl with water and dump it into the tub to fill the tub.Other than these issues, the tub is ok. The size is good and it does the job.
We really liked the size of this tub.  Our 1 yr old has room in it and can use it for some time.  It saves water.  I wanted to push the tub toward the back of the larger house tub so that our son was not tempted to pull up on the faucets.  I was going to use the shower hose to fill it.  However, when I tried to drain the tub, the drain on the bottom of the tub would suction to the bottom of the house tub and it wouldn't drain.  I'd have to hold the drain hole off the floor of the tub.  It is too heavy to pick up with water in it.  It will drain if you push the tub to the very front of the bathtub where the drain hole is over at least part of the bathtub drain.  So the tub works, but you can only put it in one place in the front.  I wish they had a little piece under the drain hold that held it off the floor of the bathtub.  Other than that, it is inexpensive and keeps our son contained and safe.
