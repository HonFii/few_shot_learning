My baby liked the massaging action but it took time for him to realize how to do it. When he finally did, the battery gave out nearly the same day. The battery would work in short spurts after a rest but I wouldn't waste my money on it again.
I thought this would be great for my teething baby, but the vibration freaks him out.  He wants nothing to do with it.  =(  It might be a wonderful product for other babies, though!  It appears to be well-made.
Our 6 month old can't bite on this thing hard enough to make it vibrate on his own, so we have to squeeze it and help him hold it in his mouth (it's also heavy).  He seems to enjoy the way it feels, but it's actually so hard to squeeze that even our hands get tired after a minute or so.  Maybe better for older teethers?
I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, "safety tested" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear "BPA free" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.
Don't waste your money, my son would rather suck on his fingers than to use this messaging corn teether.  The massager really has to be squeezed in order to work. :(
This would have been an ok teething necklace if it weren't for the Star bead. As another reviewer pointed out, if your child chews on the pointy edge of the star it can be very painful. I have thrown this necklace out after having to pull off the road last week when my child screamed suddenly in the back of the car and was then crying hysterically.
I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.  Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.  Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!  Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper.
This product isn't that bad... however it is not smell proof.  I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant.
We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!
After reading the glowing reviews here and receiving a positive one from a friend, we decided to replace a broken Diaper Genie (lid broke off) with the Champ.  What a disappointment!  Here are the big two complaints:1.  It's unsanitary.  Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess.  Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work!  And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2.  The smell.  It's probably not as bad with an infant, but let me tell you, opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience!  Yikes, what a smell after just a couple days.  We used the odor prevention garbage bags, but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid.  Since nothing seals off the individual diapers, it's just a sea of messy diapers in there.  Yuck.On the plus side, it's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags, not the expensive ones the Genie requires.  And it's certainly easy to use.  But I'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year, we'll be going back to the Diaper Genie.  It's not perfect, but it's much cleaner and there's less odor involved (the reason to get one of these products in the first place).  And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model, so we'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time.
at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off.one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet. if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band. baby could choke on it if you ask me. i liked the product for its ease of use.. but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off.. i stopped using it.
The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old (2002-2004 isn). Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft. Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product. I wouldn't sleep on this so will not use it for my son's crib. As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says...but I'll never know since I'm returning it.
The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this.
Seemed like a good idea, but I didn't care for it. I returned it because it wasn't soft. Actual crib sheets are much nicer to look at too.
I thought I would love this to help do quick crib changes for when a child is sick, or has an accident/leak... however it is really annoying for me to weave the elastic around the crib slats to fasten the buttons-- really doesnt save time, and since our mattress cover is waterproof I dont really need another waterproof layer.
My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months, so this product was wonderful.  However, by the time that he was 6 months old, all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs.  The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones (maybe a different brand) for future children, but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these.
This is supposed to save time instead of changing out the sheet, but I found it took just as long to change this as it does to change the actual sheet.  You have to reach all around the crib to do (or undo) all the snaps, which is aggravating and somewhat difficult depending on the placement of your crib.  Compared to just lifting up the mattress and quickly pulling off the sheet and putting a new one on, I think this might actually take longer.
Yes, scratchy!  I was quite surprised by the rough texture of the top layer of the sheet.  It feels like very cheap, low thread count material, not nearly as soft as most bedsheets.  When my daugher used this sheet, she had a skin rash and started getting a bold spot on the back of her head.  It's possible, of course, that these were unrelated to the sheet.  However, both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer, normal bed sheet.Also, I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product, especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot.  There is no way to tuck the sides under, as with a regular sheet, so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate.  Keep in mind, too, that undoing the snaps is very easy--so easy, a baby could do it!  The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous.  Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these?My daughter is now six months, and rolls around her crib.  I won't be regularly using this sheet anymore.  But, there is an upside.  This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use.  Snap, snap--that's it.  There is no lifting the mattress.  And it is waterproof underneath (unlike a certain zipper sheet, I could name), so in an emergency you don't have to worry about the mattress.  Recently, my daughter had a stomach virus, diarrhea everywhere.  To make matters worse, I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress.  This sheet was perfect.
I've had 2 of the ultimate crib sheets and been using them for 7 months now and I do not like them. I don't hate them, but I don't like them and will never purchase them again. The idea is wonderful, but parts of the product are too cheaply made. Within the first washing, some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet (with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing). That was disappointing. Thankfully, it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function. However, it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it isn't very soft or cozy for baby. It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area, but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use...it failed miserably. I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often. I wish I had been better informed, I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead. The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms. Go for a different crib pad that will protect and add some softness/coziness to the crib. This sheet also does not retain warmth well - even after throwing in the dryer and then putting on crib, it cools quickly and remains cool which may be nice in the summer but not during a winter in South Dakota...One more additional note, it does take a very long time for these sheets to dry - an extra dry cycle in the dryer. Not handy or helpful.
This product was pitched to me as a "must have" by all my mommy friends. It has been good for us in terms of middle of the night accidents (so we don't have to put a whole new crib sheet on), but there is one major issue with it. The straps don't line up properly with our crib rails, so it can never be totally attached to the crib. There are always loose straps hanging off or awkward folds in it when we try to strap it down. We tried over and over again to get it right, but to no avail. We do not believe this is an issue with our crib as it is a brand new, high quality one. We finally gave up the idea of strapping the Ultimate Crib Sheet down and now just put it under the regular crib sheet. This is ok, but then when we do have a late night accident and have to pull off the top sheet we always worry about the Ultimate Sheet not being strapped down properly. It's a good idea, but needs to be redesigned to fit current crib railings. I wouldn't purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend.
If your child moves around in the bed and you don't have this positioned exactly where they are they will miss.  And it doesn't secure to the bed that well.  I would look for something bigger and something that fits the entire bed, not just a small section.  I'll probably trash it and get a better one, I don't want to risk ruining my bed if my 3 year old misses the pad.!00% would not recommend it.
This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money. It doesn't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change. I don't even try any more to 'twist' the bag, I just take the lid off. It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older. If this is all you can afford, it's not that bad.
Excuse me,...but this product is so far from being odorless.  At first, it was (maybe a little less than a month), odorless then after that,...there was nothing to get rid of the scent.  I even bought some odor discs but they didn't work either.  The only convenient thing about this is that you can put whatever garbage bag you want in it and even then, the bag can hold many diapers.
I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs.
The slots for the cords on the bottom of the cover are too small.  I wanted to be able to thread the powerstrip's cord up into that--but this is meant for thin wires like a lamp or something-- not a thick wire.  Also, it wouldn't cover the box of the cell phone charger, either.  This is for very basic wires and plugs.
I bought this thinking it was a great idea but you can't use it with any plugs that have a larger than standard plugs. I feel everything of my children's has an oversize plug that goes in the wall. Have yet found anything to use it for.
These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them.  My mom and I each held a side and pulled, but nothing.  I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart.  Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off, I had to leave the latches pushed in, defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off.  Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture.  It's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in.  I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up.
I attempted to pop this thing open for about 20 minutes then gave up. It took both my husband and I 10 minutes to finally pry it open. Yes, it's childproof, but also adultproof too which is not convenient at all. It also doesn't fit all outlets. I ended up getting the Safety 1st covers because they don't have the sides that have to go into the wall, instead they protrude out.
The only other cover I could find wouldn't fit my power strip so I ordered this one. It seems sturdy and does fit fine, but the opening is way too big. My 8 month old could definatly fit at least a few fingers all the way in and touch the plug in no problem because I could. I decided to keep it and put clear packing tape around the opening.
I returned this product due to the several reasons:-  It is too bulky- I ended up pinching my finger while installing it ( do not want my child to do it since he will be trying to figure out how to open it)
I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old. It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside, hard to keep things plugged in, and too big to hide out of the babies view (not to mention that it's bulky and a bit ugly). For the babies, it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands. They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it. Yes, the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip, but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end, I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary. It was just too annoying to keep using the cover.
I bought this power strip cover to protect my toddler from the power strip we have under a chest in our living room. The design is sturdy and fits our power strip perfectly, it is also easy to put  together. But it has two big minuses:1. Its height. The wires can bend but this is about 1 inch higher than the plugs, so if you want this to go under a piece of furniture you may want to consider whether it fits under or not. It barely fits under our chest.2. THE REAL ISSUE: The width of the slot through which the cables come out. MY TODDLER's HAND AND A PORTION OF HIS ARM fit through the slot perfectly, so he can reach the outlets AND the switch of the power cord. What is the point of this item? We just hope, at this point, that it will be a further discouragement--and since the piece is all but wedged under the chest, we will get to him before he can pull the thing close enough to stick his little hand in. Hopefully we'll find something better soon.You can presumably use it by covering every unused outlet in the cord with outlet covers. Although the toddler will be able to reach in, he will probably not have the strength or dexterity to pull out the outlet covers while his hand movements are limited by this shell. This, of course, would not stop him/her from turning the switch off--in our case, this means resetting the clock and being without a phone for however long it takes us to notice the deed, among other bothers.In summary: buy it only if you mean to attach it to the wall. And if you are planning to do the wall, keep in mind that this is pretty big--like attaching a 1L bottle of soda to your wall, only it is a solid, ugly off-white contraption with wires spewing off it.
This fits a very specific style of power strip. Fully straight, single row.
To bulky, not what I expected or needed. Needless to say I gave it to a family member that could use it in a different area. Would not buy again.
This item won't attach to a regular stove because the adhesive won't stick to the sides.  Also, it comes unlocked too easily if you can manage to get it to stick to the oven.
this thermometer is pretty consistent, but the nipple is too large for young babies. after my 2 month old gagged on this twice he started refusing his other pacifiers!
My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers. I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things... this was one of them. No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his (her) pacifier that he (she) loves and always uses. Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately, its too heavy. Especially if the baby is not feeling well. Don't buy this. Get a real thermometer.
I never wanted a tub because I was not impressed with anything I found but my sister got me this as a shower gift. I just don't think baby is comfortable in it. His leg was all scrunched up, his head fell to one side (unpadded, by the way), and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it's a small round thing. Anyway, before I had the baby, I bought my husband a bath head cushion (the kind you blow up) from Target which he never used (too girly I guess). Turns out it is the perfect cushion (it has suction cups) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths. It has grooves so baby's head doesn't flop everywhere. I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body. The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back. He just lies on the soft terry cloth. It's perfect.
This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done.  However:-it does not hold a lot of water, so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is:-it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap, wash cloth, or toys
If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you... except that you'll only use it for 3 months  because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space.  As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that.  And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at.  Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)
I got this as a shower gift. The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub. She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again. I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption. I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here. I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone. Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year.....
I bought this tub without doing any research on it. I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby. Well, I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning. Also, I have yet to get it to shrink, so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time. The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller, but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick. However, that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends, so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back. Also, it just doesn't seem to hold water. I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out. All in all, I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks, I am getting another one.
We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old. I have not had any problems with the tub leaking. But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times. I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies. The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body. It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help. It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies.
I've used this tub since my baby was born 6 months ago. There are far more things I dislike about it than like.I liked the sling. I used it alone in the kitchen sink.I disliked the sling in the tub. I felt it did not fasten securely to the tub and there wasn't enough cushioning for his head and bottom. My son now sits up on his own but I feel he can slip too easily in this tub.
70% of the time, the tub doesn't leak. The 30% that it does leak, however, is a fiasco. Here's how it happens: Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are "clicked" into place (and yes, we did read the instructions) we fill the tub. Once we finish bathing her, we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain. It is at this point that by moving the tub, the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub, it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks....all over the hardwood floors. And let me tell you, it isn't easy to remedy this while holding a wet, squirmy baby. Mothers (and fathers) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess. My husband, an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal. Look at it! Meanwhile, we're shopping for a different type of tub. We cuss too much using this one.
I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks. This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week. I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water. So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks. Really, who wants a tub that leaks???? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub....so we are in an awkward transition phase. a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with. I wouldn't buy this tub.
this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up.  couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily -  i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it.  also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this.  preferred the euortub by far!
I was never fond of this even with the first use.  The baby sling never stayed in place and i was constantly adjusting the sling and baby.  When i moved to the bath ring it's plastic edges are sharp and usually scratched him while he moved around.  It doesn't colapse or open easily leaving a large tub.  The only time i was happy with it was once he was old enough to sit in the full tub which is when this isn't needed.
I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great, BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock.  I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby doesn't have far to slide down.  Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we don't need the hammock.
This tub is okay, but not the best there is.  Our son is 3 months old and fairly long, 25 inches.  He can't sit on is own yet, so has to lay on the sling.  He loves to kick and splash and doesn't have the room he needs.  He also slips down the sling frequently.  There's got to be something better...
I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy...  My 1yo & 3yo love it.  BUT it has an issue with batteries!  When it arrived (with included batteries in a "try me" box), the batteries were dead.  It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week.  When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful!  Perhaps we got a defective one.  I don't know.  I hope this isn't happening to others.
This thing as so loud and piercing. My son doesn't really care for it. It's heavy for a baby to hold and doesn't really do much.
This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it.
We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new "upgraded" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The "music" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again.
I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children.  I never saw any of them properly engage with it.  They'd pull it out, bang it a couple of times (starting up 2 different sounds) and then get bored and crawl away.  It was the one toy I knew I'd never buy for my children.
The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months, but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same.  How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments?  I guess they don't have actual instruments in China.
My children (an infant and a preschooler) like this toy--but it is WAY too loud. I wish there was a way to turn the volume down. I'd return this if I purchased it at a store, but it's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon. So sad.
So, first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them (but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes. To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once, which I find annoying. Overall my LO doesn't seem too interested in it just yet.
I love that there is an off switch, and it would be very difficult for a baby to turn it on.  My baby received this as a Christmas gift, and she likes it quite a bit, hence the second star.  But why, oh why, didn't they put a volume switch on this thing though?!My older children like to turn this on to play with their little sister, and it is ok for the first few minutes, but it is so darned LOUD, I'm practically loosing my mind.  I have to take it away, so what is the point of having a toy that gets forgotten about in a cupboard somewhere?As for good points, there are lots of colors obviously, and baby can choose just one instrument or the whole orchestra sha-bang.  The individual instruments don't REALLY sound authentic, but it was a nice try. The musical arrangement was a nice choice, too.  But please MUNCHKIN, for the sanity of future parents receiving this as a gift, put a volume control on it!!!If you are looking for a great gift for a parent, seriously considerPlayskool Busy Poppin' Pals (Colors May Vary), it's lasted through 3 kids, six years, and still going strong.  It's nice and quiet, too.
This music cube is a great idea, but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible. The violin doesn't sound at all like a violin. Overall it's very tinny and hard to listen to.
Borning toy and my son was over it the minute he opened it up. Music is nice but the buttons are hard to press for a child so be ready to sit there doing it for them. Given the age that a kid outgrows this, you won't have much use for this very long.
I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones!  If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty "unproductively" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable.  The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside.  While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic.  Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting.  Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.  I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it wouldn't fall into the toilet with a toddler's wiggling around.  You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot.
this is a good toilet ring, but ONLY if you have the smallest, round toilet seats.  the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit, but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps.  my home has a mix of elongated/round seats, and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls.  we use that for our elongated seats, and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway.  otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train.
We had a seat SORT OF like this when my son was training - and lost it.  Not sure if it was the same manufacturer or not.  It had no handles then, and the pee guard stood up high and was removable.  We never used the pee guard, it made it harder to get on the seat and it just wasn't needed - we just taught my son to point it down.Now I am training twin girls and thinking Elmo might get one of them on the potty more (one shows way more interest than the other - it's the reluctant one I want to bribe)  We have little potties with inserts that come off but most parents know the power of Elmo - I'm willing to try anything at this point, within reason.  (ie the all-out free standing elmo potty is too much, LOL, and I want to take advantage of the fact that both are willing to use the big potty with an insert)The reviews about the pee guard on this were so puzzling I had to see it in person before buying it - and it looks TERRIBLE.  It's a very low pee guard.  Basically too low to serve any purpose for a boy, but it's there, and it's high enough that boy or girl I can see them peeing on it and making more of a mess than if it wasn't there.  (One of my girls likes to look down and kind of shift her stuff forward as she pees - not normally a problem, but with this in the way, it would be)  And it does not come off.  I actually stood there in the store contemplating if we could cut it out somehow, maybe with a dremmel, but you shouldn't have to make modifications to a potty ring.  It's one of the worst designs I can imagine.  It's like I can kind of see what they were thinking but they should have thought harder.  So I decided to skip this.  Even if we were to have marginal success with it, I am pregnant with another boy now, and I refuse to buy something I know he won't be able to use.I am really kicking myself for not replacing my son's potty ring when we lost it, but he was doing well enough without it and I never saw it becoming a hard to find item.  No handles made it easier to travel with.  We kept it in our diaper bag.  Now I am in the market for a used potty ring!
My nearly 2 year old son wants to use the potty, but has trouble with the splash guard/cup on this model.  He loves Elmo and wants to carry this seat around but will not use it.  We also bought the Primo Ducka.  He will sit on that seat all day if you let him.  This might be a good choice for parents of girls.
2 stars for bad marketing & items missing. We received as a gift, so our annoyance is probably moderated. This review is for product misrepresentation.-- Only received 1 out of 2 volcanoes.-- Image provided with the expressive boy in red shirt is completely misleading. There is no "play mat," but rather a thin piece of rectangular plastic that is more like an over-size disposable place-mat. Only large enough for half the pieces. The scene is completely different from that image. The real image has none of the detail.-- "Rocks" are completely useless three-sided thin pieces of grey sides, thus no bottoms and sometimes missing a side altogether. Only received 10 out of 12, but not really missing them.Half the dinosaurs are very small (1-2 inches) and the other half are more medium range (3-6 inches). Some people commented of the usefulness of the names printed on the undersides, but we have encountered 2 other brands that provide the same labeling, so that appears to be a given with a variety pack.The use of the big names "Animal Planet" and "Toy R Us" should be a tip-off. Over-priced small dinosaurs, 6 trees, and a small plastic bin.
We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed.
I got these as a gift at my baby shower, so I haven't had a chance to use them until now. Since I'm breastfeeding, I don't use them on a regular basis, just for outings. You can't pump into these, which is a bit of a hassle, but it's not too bad. My problem with the bottle is that the bags don't stay in. The ring doesn't hold the bag in, so when I went to feed the baby, he ended up soaked. Needless to say, bottle feeding that day was a disaster. If the bag would stay in, I'd say I really liked these. Unfortunately, I haven't had one bag stay in yet...
With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles, I was very excited about this bottle. Yet, both me and my baby hated it. First off, the bottle itself is huge, which makes it uncomfortable in many ways. Second, even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk. In any case, we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir. I would not recommend it.
I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all
These burp clothes are extremely thin.  They are so gauzy that you can see through them, so they won't even work for a game of "peek-a-boo"!  These were not thick enough for me to use as a burp cloth, let alone the "premium" diaper it is touted to be.  These would not work in our house even as a dish cloth, let alone absorbing any type of baby mess!The only reason I didn't give only a single star is because Gerber was very nice about giving me a refund on these - they guarantee all their products.  I just don't think they described accurately what you are getting.  They are definitely not the diaper service quality, however, if you don't have 3 different levels of diapers to choose from at your local store, how would you even know that there were different grades of diapers when it says "premium" on the package?  They need to be more descriptive in their product packaging.  For burp cloths, I prefered the Kooshie baby brand which are very absorbant, very soft and durable as well.
I think this product was a waste of money our daughter will not wait for bottle to heat  up in this and its just easier and faster to make a fresh bottle.
Ehh, I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles. The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle. The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam. What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold. I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins. :)But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back (remember to freeze the ice pack)-Overall, save your money and use the traditional method.
I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better "mouse trap".To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...(picture provided by Amazon is not the current model.  refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers)
I really did not like this.  We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water, and we found this worked faster and better.  We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night.  Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water, and to use a cooler for the bottles (our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night)
the measuring of the water is not comfortable it take more time to actually put the water at its correct measure than just boiling water in micro and using that to warm the milk
I loved this product from the moment I got it. It works wonders with drop ins, And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely.... Sometimes that is. We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities.
The idea behind this design is well intentioned but I find the design aggravating. Subconsciously I always go for the handle to move this thing, but the handle is connected to the removable bottle storage piece. There's no other way to pick this thing up unless you grab it by the warmer cup. It may seem trivial but I like to keep this thing out of the way (it's an eye sore) and I would have rather just the bottle warmer with no bottle storage chamber.Plus, the heating is inconsistent. No matter whether you put extra water or not, the bottles still don't get warm like they should. When we first got it (4 months ago) the milk would actually be too hot. That hasn't happened in a while.
I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:TRY THIS ONE IF...- You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...- You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one).
I bought this pump before leaving the hospital and it was a waste of money. It hurt like heck and did not express enough milk to relieve my engorgement. The motor cycles very slowly so when it's tugging on me all I can think is ouch...ouch...ouch... I ended up buying a used Pump-in-Style online and love it. I can pump both sides at once in less than 10 minutes and have a good-sized bottle to show for it.
The advertising for this gate made it seem like the right purchase for me, but I was wrong!  First, the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful.  If you're a little too forceful, it can easily break.  And if it breaks, you're out of luck with installing this gate.  Second, the mounting pieces for the wall are fixed position, at the top of every fence panel.  The wall mounts are not the same as shown in the Amazon picture, which is in the middle of the panel!  This became a problem for me because I have a window ledge that is lower than the wall mount location.  Third, this Kidco gate is clearly terribly overpriced.  Most people will have to buy extension gate panels to make this work and boy does the cost add up.  If you have an irregular shaped area or room that needs a gate, I'd recommend that you look into the North States 3 in 1 Super Yard Gate.  I bought this North States Gate with a total of 6 panels (12 feet) and it did not have any of the problems I just described.  It was expensive, but cost less than the Kidco.  Overall, it is sturdier and better made too.  The North States Gate can be placed at various angles too just like the Kidco.  North States Gate needs to amp up their advertising though because it isn't quite clear that it can do the same as the Kidco Gate at a better price too.
Good while it worked! My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings. I only had it for three weeks when it stop working. I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again. It didn't play music and light would not turn off. I am really disappointed. Buyer beware!
I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.
I was hoping for more of a pad feel to make my baby's mattress softer but this is more like a waterproof cover with some quilting as an afterthought. Didn't make the matress any softer.
This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket. There was nothing &#34;UltraSoft&#34; or &#34;UltraThick&#34; about this mattress pad, if you could call it that. It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking.
These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak. I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak. Well less tightening did not help. Don't waste money. I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it's much better.
I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had.  I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed.  I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts.  I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts.  Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?
Don't bother buying these if you want your baby to take in less air.  Go with the Dr. Brown's.  My kids actually ingested more air b/c of the nipple shape - they just couldn't get their mouths around the large base.Reasons I give 2 stars:-well-made-easy to clean
My son is breast fed, but we have given him an occasional bottle. He refused these. I got them because of all the great things I heard about them. I thought it would be easier for him to switch back and forth. No chance. He hates them. He hate the Playtex disposables too. He now takes Gerber bottles, traditional and New Traditions.
I am extremely tired of having to clean up messes after feeding our twin sons with the Avent bottles.  Especially if we are out for a big event and the boys are dressed nicely.  The bottles worked great for the first six months and then.....THEY ALL LEAKED.  It was not a small leak rather, a pouring leak that soaked their shirts.  I hate these bottles and plan to switch!!!
when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples. well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window. my daughter had  very bad gas. when i switched bottles the gas stopped. Plus the bottles are  expensive......you  have to keep buying new  nipples there are sooo many different sizes. a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more.
These bottles were terrible for us.  They leaked no matter how many times I tried and followed the directions.  They also did not keep my daughter from being gassy.  As soon as we changed her bottles to the Dr. Browns she slept through the night with no wake ups.  I was not a big fan of these bottles and neither was my daughter.
My daughter liked the nipple but got to much air. I tried these and the Dr. Brown but ended up going back to Playtex Nursers(I used these with all my other kids) I wouldnt recommend these.
These bottles just didn't work for my baby. We tried and tried for 3 and 1/2 months to get my baby to take these bottles but it just didn't work. My baby is mostly breastfed, and is only given a bottle occasionally, so I didn't give up on these bottles right away, just thinking that he wasn't used to the bottles and that's why he was having a tough time.  My mom babysat and she has raised nine kids, all who were bottlefed, so she is an expert. She said to me that the baby just really can't use this nipple. He chews on it and couldn't suck properly, the nipple seemed to hard for him. He couldn't latch on right and all the milk would spill out the sides of his mouth. Well, I take anything she says seriously! After investing alot of time and money in Avent, I decided to scrap them and start over. I went out and found a nipple that was closest to his pacifier that he loves. I found Gerber Nuk nipples, got four of them for about $4 and bought Especially for Baby bottles for a whopping $2.99 (you get 3) and my baby LOVES them!!!! THe bottles are cute (the gerber bottles would be fine, too, but they weren't cute enough!) He takes the nipple right away and finally the bottles are emptied in no time. What a relief. I am sure Avent is good for some babies, but not mine, even after months of "training". My advice is to try different bottles before settling on one kind. One more note, I read the other reviews that talk about leaking, I didn't have this problem at all. The only leaking was from my son's mouth when he couldn't latch on properly. But my cousin used Avent and they leaked terribly for her and she switched to Dr Browns. I would have tried Dr Browns but it looks like their bottles have the same nipples as Avent, too hard and not good for my baby. Expensive isn't always better!
When breastfeeding, these are highly recomended. The problem with a breastfeeding mom is, they do not fit standard US breast pumps. So basicly you have to pump into one bottle, then transfer into this one (this causes a problem for those of us who don't produce quite enough milk --- every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial). Then you are faced with the leaking problem. The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking. Well, sometimes that works and sometimes it dosen't. Again, I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was. Sometimes these bottles will taunt you. I would test the bottle before giving it to baby... then after I was convinced it wouldn't leak... baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded! And there you are, wasted milk, and a hungry baby who is drenched, and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed!!! The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire, which only leak once in a blue moon, if you dont put it together right.
I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them. I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line. After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him..... I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands
I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got.  However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day!! Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous. If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping.  On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours.
I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea..!!! I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie! I was in pain for days after I gave birth,irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern. I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke! I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you.. I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding... NOooooo! already, I would think... yes and with only 4 oz to show. Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump... NO.. I NOW know better.... electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300. and change its worth your sanity, sleep, time, energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby. My milk supply in time grew (not soon enough) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship. We started off badly
I love the Advent line & highly recommend their bottles & microwave sterilizer, but this breast pump is awful! The prong that connects to the handle, which creates the vacuum to pull the milk out, consistently becomes unlatched breaking the vacuum so you have to fix it and start all over. The only reason it got a two stars rating was because the pump handle does fit extremely well on the bottles and everything fits in the bag nicely.
If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon, then this is a great pump for you.  I found it to be an incredible nusance, so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump.  Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers!  Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise).  With our next child, I will definitely be buying electric!
The instructions that came with this are terrible. The diagrams are really tiny and have no labels. The written instructions for Step 1 say "see the diagram" and do not elaborate, making the instructions worthless. The 3M sticky tape is REALLY sticky. Do not expect to get it off your furniture or to reuse these edge guards - the tape will cling to your furniture and to the guards, destroying both.In the end I was unable to install my guards properly - they attached to the furniture crookedly and then I couldn't un-stick them in order to make it right. The guards are nice, thick foam, but that doesn't matter if the installation goes miserably.You can see my photos of the final results I got in the Customer Image Gallery.
We put this on our coffee table six months ago, all but one of the corners have fallen off repeatedly. The long strips dont really protect my child much. She will still bump into the table at times and it doesnt offer much cushion. It is not really thick enough or wide enough. Corners are a joke. The tape provided is not sticky enough. Just keeps coming off.
This product does not adhere well.  I have tried it on wood, metal, and painted surfaces.  What's more, other "safety" products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well. Also, when I tried to remove the cushion, the tape removed my furniture paint.  Overall, I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps.
I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.
After only a few uses and washes, this pad cover started to tear.  It was ripping in the corners, and no matter how gentle I was, the hole got bigger.The color choice is out standing. . .however I just wish that it had held up a bit better for us.
Great colors, and I like Simmons' contoured changing pad, which this is supposed to fit, but keep in mind that washing will significantly shrink the covers &amp; the terry fabric doesn't hold up well. After just a couple of months, ours are already coming apart.
They don't seem to stick very well.  Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table.
This item is not top quality.  I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will.  First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib.  Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same.  You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's.
I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.
While I think it's a great fit for the toilet, my daughter won't sit on it for more than a couple minutes, having to adjust every few seconds because she says it &#34;isn't comfy&#34;.  After the great reviews and was actually recommended to me by my sister, it just doesn't work for our daughter.  I'm going to have to buy a cheap padded one I guess.  Stinks that I can't return this thing. Pretty expensive.
Works well, but you basically need to also buy the steps that go with it or your kid cannot get on the potty by themselves.. which is the point.  To be honest we have the mini potty by baby bjorn and it is simpler and the kids can do it all on their own... so this might be good for someone to use in a second bathroom where they do not want to have a little potty sitting around. You can easily hide it behind the toilet...
Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me.  My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it.  The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his "equipment" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too).
I bought it based on so many great reviews. I wonder if I am the only one who was not able to attach it to the existing toilette seat. The description says "adjusts easily and sits firmly in place"...well, it does not. It slides right out of the existing seat. SO I basically keep in there not attached at all and have to sit my child and remove him from there, otherwise the seat falls out.
I ordered this potty because after weeks of research, this was the only potty I could find that's BPA free. When it came my daughter was excited to try it. Unfotunately she pinched her finger on the pull out center. She also voiced that her bottom hurt because it was too hard. She's only 25 lbs and is a small girl but there isn't enough seat so it's uncomfortable. She now refuses to sit on it. It's going back.
This is a basic potty with the pot that can be removed for easy cleaning so it's easy to wash and clean but my poor kid stands up from sitting on this for mere minutes and has deep red marks on her legs and bottom, it's uncomfortable!  I'm going to order one with a cushy seat!
looks cute but not functional for us.the depth of the plastic bowl is not deep.If the shit is coming out long and hard, it might push back up to the baby
My son is 50th percentile for weight and height, so pretty average sized for a 2 year old.  As lots of reviewers have mentioned, the height of this potty is great, the handholds on the side are a help, the splash guard is built in so there are no pinching problems there, and the back WOULD be nice except...There is about an inch of space between the edge of the bowl and the back of the seat, so that when my son sits on it, the bowl shifts ever so slightly and his bum gets pinched in the back.  The reviews have been so positive on the no-pinching thing that I was stunned by this.  Even when he does not get pinched, he also ends up with seams cut into his little bum and back of legs, and as a result will not remain seated on this seat at all.  Therefore I cannot comment whether the pee goes into the bowl, because we never get that far.As far as disinfecting, I thought it would be really easy--just pull the bowl out, dump it out, wipe, disinfect with clorox on occasion...BUT several times poop has gotten under that back edge of the bowl, necessitating a cleaning of the rest of the seat as well, which is just a pain.Finally, the bowl is way too light and often sticks to my son's legs and he stands up.I cannot say, however, if there is anything better out there--we haven't found the "perfect" potty yet, but if this is the best of the portable potties, I guess we're going to have to go with the seat insert for our toilet, because this has turned out to be virtually worthless to us.
I bought this for potty training my 2-year old daughter but she wouldn't use it.  However, all kids are different in their potty training likes/dislikes, so I'm only saying it didn't work for us.  She preferred using the seats that go on top of your normal toilet seat or the type of potty chairs that had a lid to close.  She liked the idea of closing the potty lid.
I'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair. If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy. The splash guard is way too short, my son just pees right over the top of it. I do like the separate potty and it's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply doesn't hold in the pee stream. Ugh. I'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair. MESSY.
I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I was pretty disappointed over all.  My daughter is tall for her age but not particularly chunky or chubby.  In any case, every time she stood up from this potty chair she also brought a red mark from the circular opening on her bum. I thought it was a little narrow for her.  Sometimes when she stood up, the white part actually came up with her. I personally did not think this was a great potty chair.  I think this might be because I have a girl and not a boy, since there seems to be issue with other potty's splash guards.  In my case, my daughter did not find this seat comfortable and did not take to it at all.  I later bought her that Fisher Price one with the face and that sings. It's a little lower, but wider and the seat cannot come up with her. She loves the songs, though it's lower and it is actually wider, so even though she is tall, no problems. Again, don't have a boy so can't speak to the splash guard issue, but really this potty is nothing out of this world for me.  It's collecting dust in my hallway closet right now.
I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3" & 30 pounds. (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes. It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said "oh mommy my legs!" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience. He is now afraid of it.I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now. I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children.
Whether you are using these diapers for diapering or for burp cloths, I suggest you look at the version with the padded absorbent center. This version is too thin to serve as either a burp cloth or for diapering. However, the same brand, with the absorbent center pad, is much better.
These are just too thin to be used as diapers.  They are also a strange shape which makes them difficult to fold to be used as diapers.  I don't use them.  They are just sitting in a drawer.  I think I will try to use them as burp cloths as they are useless to me right now.
These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely.  My baby hates them for feeding, however.  I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles.  I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast.  Um, no.  Take one look at them and it's pretty clear.  My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth.  She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples, however.  Much, much better!
I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right?  Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding.  Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now).  I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage.  I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those
Don't bother with these.  They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary.  It is much easier to buy storage bags.  If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic.They also flow too fast for newborns.
This is a nice, big tub, but the bottom never held air. Decided to keep it anyway, but then after a day it developed a slow leak which made the whole thing pointless. Returned it.
I bought this wedge as my stomach started getting bigger to find some comfort sleeping at night. The wedge is very stiff, even after working it for a little while. The angle of it isn't right..it should be thicker at it's current thinnest part, because basically, my belly just pushes into it, and it falls on the floor, eventually. It was a waste of money, and a rolled up blanket or pillow does the job way better, and they are way more comfortable!
I tried to use this while pregnant but for me it was too thick and firm.  However it did make a great tool for propping up our newborn's mattress because he needs to sleep elevated due to reflux.
This wedge is very small, it will work well for supporting a pregnant belly but is not for sleeping on.  I was disappointed that it was so small and firm.
We use this headrest for their bouncy seats only. I don't use it in their car seats because the smaller part of the head rest only fit their heads for a few weeks and the bigger part is to big for them now.
I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower.  I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest.  Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat.  Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury.  The product may be a fine one, but I found an &quot;extra&quot; one to be unnecessary.
I am not rating this very highly because my daughter's head still flopped around quite a lot when I used it because babies' car seats have them sitting almost upright even as newborns.  This didn't help her head from going side to side or even forward.  Also, my car seat came with one.
Some swear by this, but my child hated it. He is sensitive to food textures, so he didn't take to the bag at all.
It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams. I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean.
The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy.
I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag.
I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them.  If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up.  Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean.  Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better.
I was not impressed with these storage bags.  I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure.  This brand is harder to close, more time consuming and wasteful (due to spilling)
I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump.  I really didn't like using them with the twist ties.  That didn't make sense to me at all.  I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better.  They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles.
I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.  The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly.
These bags leave a lot to be desired.  They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them.  They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer.  The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on.  And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside.  All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet.
After using both these bags and the Gerber bags, I prefer the zipper-style closure of the Gerber bags.  I've never had a problem with those leaking or ruining my milk.  They are also much cheaper as you can generally find them at discount stores (Target, etc.).
I bought one just to try to keep the pad a little bit more comfortable, but it is so thin.  At nine dollars I thought it would be better.
We have the Saratoga P&amp;P and I've been very disappointed with the sheet we bought.  It's been so bad that we haven't used it yet.  The material is very rough and the sheet doesn't fit well when the mattress is in the bassinet position.
These reusable nursing bra pads are bulky and show through shirts.  I was very disappointed after using them the first time.  Haven't used them since and have purchased others to try.
I've tried four different products. I'm working to test each product I can get a sample of. I believe most products fit one or more specific needs. I hope my research helps you make the best choice for your needs.So far, each brand's strengths were as follows:>Kushies (3star)absorbed moisture immediately so they were the best inner doublers,>La Leche League (3star)appearance was best for use in B/C nursing bras,>Medela (2star) was easy to find in stores and absorption improved with time,>NuAngel (4star)was very affordable. "White/patterns" absorb a bit faster than "natural" so I like to put "natural" as an outer doubler and "white/patterns" as inner doubler during heavy let-downs.If you only drip a few drops during let-down any one of these brands would be fine. Read further if moderate to heavy let-downs are common.All products were machine washable, free samples, and pre-washed in hot or warm water and cold rinse at least once before use unless otherwise noted. No fabric softeners were applied as they can cause repelling. All samples were used at least a month before final opinions were noted.Categories: dry shirt test, rate of absoption, appearance, leakage, light use, heavy night use, doubler.

Can soak a Lansinoh disposable (most absorptive disposable I'd encoutered) in a single feeding and leak. Equivalent to about two & a half washable pads stacked to catch the flow. Heavy flow requires very absorptive inner doublers and low(er) absorption outer doublers so they have time to soak it all up without affecting your shirt. Hopefully a washable pad out there can improve on these statistics. I just haven't met it yet. I'm still hopeful that the other 2/3 of these brands can provide a more efficient answer.

You can see these through your bra...even a think padded bra.  And they don't lay flat so they aren't very comfortable.Try the  LLLI Washable Nursing Pads.  I have tried every washable brand and these are the best!
These are bulky under your bras and if you have heavy letdown you will leak right through. They are also difficult to wash, getting balled up and don't dry well.
very comfortable and stay put pretty well. however the slightest leak and they seem to soak through easily not recommended for those who leak a lot
These are a little to big for me (even thought I have big-uns).  They tend to get wrinkles in them and you can see them through a shirt, an under shirt, and a bra all at once.  Not my favorite.  They are, however very absorbant.
I was hoping to find a more eco way of dealing with leakage than using disposables. These work in terms of absorption for me (I should qualify that to mean I leak but generally during feedings or at night and not profusely, but enough to soak 50% of the surface of my bra at a time).Unfortunately, they are so thick they show through my more tailored clothes (flowy, patterned tops seem to remedy much of this problem). The stitching is rough and itchy. Once the pad is washed it's very ripply and won't sit flat (which is the biggest annoyance for me). They're great if you plan on being a slovenly hermit at home, but I wouldn't want to wear them in public.
I used this stool during my baby's first month. It did make breastfeeding a little more comfortable. But after the first month, it became more of a hindrance. You don't need it if you are using a nursing pillow,  like &quot;Boppy&quot;. Pricey. Better to borrow one from a friend.
I liked this product because it's a good rubbery material to chew on, but it only fit on the sides of our crib as the front bar is much wider. I had actually gotten these & put them on when my daughter was in the crib, but after being on a few months, they almost looked kind of liquidy underneath and when I went to remove them, they removed some of the wood varnish as well, so I left them on to look better. My daughter actually never did bite on the crib railings but my son does (3yrs later) and prefers chewing on the front bar best, of course. At least the side bars they fit on will not be used when it's converted to a full size bed, but there will still be those teeth marks on the bed footer. Oh well, it's kind of cute. I plan to use one of those wood color markers to cover the teeth marks if it really bothers me.
I like the idea but in reality didn't work for us.  We would have had to order 3 sets to cover the 4 sides of his crib which gets pricey. The length (from top to bottom) is not enough for his crib either - his rails are more like 2 or 3 inches.  So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood. And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too (11 months).  I'm going to order some cloth ones that can be safely tied on-not interested in a DIY project when it comes to ties and cribs.
This thing is bulky and me no likeThough they snap and the locks are tightBut it's huge but I guess that's okBut won't be ordering more, it's not worth it to payOk so this technically does the job but it's stinking huge and the locks work too well in that it's a pain to open up to get more things plugged in so I guess it's best to use it for power that you won't need to touch for a while
I wouldn't call this much of a safety product. The plastic is very flimsy and the locking tabs aren't that hard to open. I would expect a better quality product from something marketed as a "safety" item. It's fine as a deterrent, but nothing I would waste money on again.
This is challenging to get open and closed for the adult in the equation. There are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch. But they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open. Now you would think that that's the point of the power strip cover, right? Except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my 9 month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket. It does come w a couple outlet plugs for the extra slots in your power strip, I was just hoping this would work a wee bit better. If all you really need is to prevent your child from unplugging things from your power strip, than this will work for you.
The opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters.  If the cover were taller, it wouldn't be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside, but it's not.  It's just too short, even for the smallest of the Apple adapters.  So I had to return this anyway, but if I'd kept it, I would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that I never need to add/remove plugs on -- the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain...and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller.
I have a basic single row power strip, and i couldn't shut the smaller side door or it would depress the power switch... therefore making this completely useless to me.The snap buttons are hard to open and close, so it would be good to keep little fingers out, but i just couldnt use it for my power strip.The stip i have is SIMILAR to this one,&lt;...>but not exactly the same. Mine is dark color and newer looking with spots labeled "adapter" so you can plug in large plugs and not lose any outlet space.
This is supposed to keep your kids safe.  My 18mth old figured out how to open this in a matter of days.
This is a very useless item.  It doesn't protect children from sticking their fingers inside the cover.  This is easily done even by myself through the top where the cords are supposed to come out.  A child can easily unplug anything inside the cover and get their fingers inside, which completely defeats it's purpose.
I'd move along if I were you.  While this does the trick there are better products out there.  This is not the saftey strip you've been looking for.
This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it.  The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric.  The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel.  I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though.  Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad.  You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one.  I never used covers with DD and never had a problem.
I don't get the purpose of these since the air goes right back in during the feeding(got the special Playtex nipples and bottles). Also, the store brand ones do the same thing for half the price. Walmart ones are not as soft, but do the same thing still
I measured 8 ounces in a measuring cup, then poured it in the liner, and it was a little below the 8 ounces mark on the liner. I tried it again with a different measuring cup and received the same result. You can not put the liner in the bottle first to fill it up, because the measurements on the bottle do not match up with the measurements on the liners, My husband always has a hard time filling up the liners because it is hard to hold it and add water since they expand. Also, the numbers on the liner are very hard to read.
This is my 3rd baby.  We used playtex bottles with liners for our first 2 kids and loved them!  I guess Playtex decided to change their bottle sometime between our last baby and this baby.  The liners no longer match up and it's hard to see the numbers.  We decided to scrap it all and go with another brand completely, unfortunately.
My baby is an Advent baby. I love all the Advent products, but was a little disappointed with this one. The bottle warmer, is maybe too good of a warmer, as it tends to overheat the milk even before the recommended time limit. The timings really should be precise.
I didnt really care for this. I couldnt tell when the bottle was ready and the light would go on and off and not warm the bottle or else get it to hot. Might be user error but I didnt care for it.
I used this for a short time. It was more of a pain for us.I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there. A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add).I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it.Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much. It still has many flaws.Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on. There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't. Oh well.
The description states that this is compatible with all the Prince Lionheart Wipe warmers, but if you notice the pictures they have posted only show it with a generic wipes box or just holding the diapers.  This is because the wipe warmers are considerably larger and do not actually fit flush in them.  There are two small groves in the Prince Lionheart Wipe warmer that allows it to be forced onto it, but the wipe warmer hangs over the edge.The main reason I purchased this diaper depot to hang on the side was to hold the wipe warmer and diapers and save space on the changing table, but I don't think this one is going work.  The wipe warmer looks like it would just take a bump to send it tumbling and not very secure on the diaper depot.  If you are just using plain wipes without the warmer, it would probably be alright.  I primarily bought it to go along with the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer, so I'm left pretty disappointed.&#34;Compatible&#34; and actually fitting seems to be two different things....
Although I gave the diaper depot a low rating I do have to say I like that it hooks on the side of my changing table. But the reason I gave it a low rating is for two reasons:1. No diaper warmer will fit on it... not even the Prince Lionheart brand2. There is a slit on the bottom so you can easily gain access to diapers... this seems great but the diapers stick together and you end up pulling out 3 or more diapers at a time. Not worth it.
This diaper stacker is a joke.  The diapers come out 3 at a time, the shelf for the wipes container will buckle if you have a full container, and the plastic is very flimsy.  I brought this because of the great reviews this product got. After just one day of using this I decided to pack it up and return it.  I don't believe this product is ment to withstand the test of time.
I didn't car for this organizer. It looks cheap and also like it might crack easily. There are nicer options out there, but they are more expensive.
Be aware this product does NOT fit all Prince Lionheart brand wipe warmer containers. I have the premium PL wipe warmer and it does NOT fit! If you plan to use it to hold normal plastic container of wipes, then you're fine.
I was so excited to get this because of the great reviews. After trying it out and on the changing table, I quickly realized that there was no way I was going to keep it. The first thing I noticed was that newborn diapers do not fit in the holder. It is made to hold full size bigger diapers. Then I realized that since I am left-handed, I wanted this to be on the left side of the changing table. Well that doesn't work, because the dispenser opening to get the diapers would then be in the back! So I tried it on the other side to see if that could work. In doing so, I realized that the plastic had left 2 scratch marks on the pretty cherry wood of my changing table!! The plastic is sharp and scratched my changing table on both sides as I was trying to figure out how to make it work. I considered using a cloth or something soft to protect the wood from the plastic, but quickly decided it's not worth it -- not only will it not work with newborn diapers, but it is also not left-handed friendly, and really does not give much storage space. Returning it right away. I would have given it 1 star but &#34;hate&#34; is too strong of a word. I simply do not like it :)
After purchasing the depot, I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top). I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.
My 9 month old son loves bath time with the Fisher Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub.  It's got anti-slip for infants and same goes for the toddler position.  Only thing I did not like about the tub was that it's too shallow and my son is big for 9 month.  (I'm guessing the depth has something to do with safety).My brother who just has his daughter said his Primo tub was too big so he wanted to switch.Pros..it's bigConsit's too big and waste a lot of water.  over twice as much water as the FP whale tub.  Which I would not mind if it was bit deeper so my son can get a better submersion but it's not any deeper than the FP whale tub.Main problem is that Flooring is too slippery so my son was startled everytime his bum slipped against the floor.  He loves bath time with his Fisher Price Whale tub since he was an infant. Always smiles and never wanting to get but yesterday for the first time, I saw him startled and whining to get out of the tub.  Never once saw my son slip on the Whale tub.  In fact he would rotate and splash around while taking a bath without a problem.  With Primo tub he stopped dead on his track, scared that he would slip.I supposed you can put a towel to offset the slipping problem but I think I'd rather look for another tub.
I really wanted to love this bath, but I don't.It is just too big even in my rather big bathroom.My baby wasn't really into this tub either.I'm still keeping it in case if we have another baby.If you are having a first baby, I would recommend using Infant Bath Seat from primo.It is easy to use, clean and store. My baby liked it better.
This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again.
This bath tub is humongous. It needs its own bath room.  Too big to put it on top of a kitchen sink.  Since the only place I found for it near water source is inside our bath tub, which places it practically at ground level, my back is killing me.Unless your are planning to remodel your bathroom to fit this monster, go for something else.  Definitely not for a 700 Sqr Foot apartment in the city.
My husband registered for, and we recieved this bath when our daughter was born. From day one, I absolutely hated it. My daughter was born 7lbs 15oz and 20" long - She constantly was sliding around in this thing, or when she would kick and splash her legs would go around the "post" that was supposed to separate her legs and it would hit her privates hard. She just could not relax enough to enjoy her bath, and she LOVES to be in warm water.Even with a sponge support she cried every second she was in the water. A towel, sponge support, anything at all that might help A) make her not slip around so much and B)make it not so hard. Once we switched to a softer material tub by Summer Infant (I might also add that the tub is MUCH smaller!) my daughter loves bath time again. She will kick and splash, play with toys, etc.I would not recommend this bath tub. It's a good idea, but the material is just too dang hard and it's not comfortable for little babies.
I bought this tub because it received really good reviews - but it is gigantic and really takes up half of my bathroom.Also, because of it's size you don't transport it and end up keeping it in the bathtub anyway!I found it's just easier for my daughter to take a bath with me!
Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it!  After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with.  Also the refills are expensive and it doesn't hold enough diapers IMO. It doesn't lock out odors either.  It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD.  I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier.  What can I say?The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly.  No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked.  The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru.
I would rather throw the diapers on our kitchen trash can. It's a lot faster and easier than trying to mess with the Genie. I would recommend trying a different brand.
The Diaper Genie does the job of keeping odors away, but otherwise it is a real pain!  If you shove the diaper down and accidentally miss the clips you have to reach down and pull up the messy diaper and wipes!  Ick.  Particularly icky at 2 am.And contrary to what one poster says, a monkey definitely couldn't operate this thing.  The refill directions are lousy.  It took us over a half hour to figure out how to install the refill, and we're all college-educated professionals (and my dad, a retired mechanical engineer, couldn't even figure it out!).  It's hard to get the refill in, even when you do figure out the part that's ommitted from the instructions.  When you're busy with a newborn, the last thing you have the time or energy to deal with is a challenge like this!And why does the obvious dial at the top cut the liner instead of sealing off the liner for the next use?  Yes, you realize that's what it does after reading the directions.  But we have to tell anyone helping care for the baby not to turn the noticeable dial because it doesn't do what you think it will.If you do decide to purchase this product, don't turn the liner multiple times after use as the directions suggest.  The only reason they say to do this is so you'll run out of the liner faster and have to buy their refills.  One or two turns is sufficient once you get the diaper lined up in the Genie properly.I wish I had taken a better look at competing products.  I realize now there's a real reason other companies decided to come up with other models.  The Diaper Genie has some major flaws.
Why does everyone think you need this thing? Of course, we thought so.  We have used it five or six times.  We ruined two packs of refills just trying to figure out how to use it.  Once we got the hang of it, we realized it's pretty useless.  It does work to keep odor out I suppose, but so does a plastic bag.Just put your diaper in a plastic bag!
We ended up giving this away. The stickers it comes with is a joke. We went with another brand (just one long piece) and it worked out much better since our brick fireplace is rounded. If you do go with this one, make sure to get the removable caulk as the stickers don't work AT ALL.
My son was able to pull this off right away.  I'm constantly retaping it to the fireplace.  When it does stay on, it's great.  Have prevented a few bruises/cuts.
I have two of these changing pad covers and used them both for a year with my first child. They are mediocre. I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use. I stitched them back up, but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places. I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap...one is not present. Finally, I used it with the changing pad by "Especially for Baby" and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time.For a few more dollars, I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids' chamois pad covers. They are extrememly soft (you'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff!), have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly.
These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings.  In addition, the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides.  Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers, but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top.  This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often.
Not too happy with this monitor.  We thought about replacing it early on but it was ok enough to just deal with the static.  My husband became the master of turning it down just enough to tolerate the sounds but hear the baby when he cried.  We used it for 7 months, every day during naps and night, and today the power adapter quit working so the only way to use it is with the 9v battery which lasts all of 3 hours before crapping out.  So, in summary: it will work but it's not a very good product and doesn't seem to have quality components to make it last.  Would probably be a better idea to just to buy a more expensive one out of the gate since you'll be spending that amount of money anyway once you buy something to replace this one when it dies.
It works well enough and I love that it has an outlet plug so that I don't have to run it on batteries but the sound quality is terrible, lots of static! I honestly dont recommend this item, buy something nicer, it'll be worth it for your sanity and peace of mind.
You get what you pay for... For $17 you should not expect a lot. It does its job, but with quite some statics in the background. It's working OK for me, but I regret not spending some more for a better quality monitor.
This Monitor gets BAD interference! Very buzzy with static! I would not recommend it. I gave it 2 stars because it's super affordable ... but you don't want to buy it unless you really don't mind the interference and constant buzz.
I owned one of these 5 years ago and it worked reasonably well, so got another one this time around (previous one was given to my SIL).  I don't know what they've changed, but this one is bad enough I'm going to break down and order something else.  We've had trouble finding an outlet we can use that doesn't have other major interference (like if the alarm clock or toaster is on the same circuit).  Plus, for some reason we're picking up another kid and their family that is no where around us (no babies within 2 houses in any direction).  I can't imagine what they've heard us say based on what we've heard!  Going to replace it with the V-tech which is less than twice as much...wish I'd put the money into that to begin with.
I had to return this item because it didn't work right from the start.  It made very loud static and if someone talked or cried, it would only change the sound of the static slightly.  I really wanted it to work too- it had all the features that I needed and I loved the price.  I didn't try a second one since I really needed a monitor and didn't have the time to mess around with something that might not work.
I bought these glass bottles after reading all the articles about bispenol A.  My daughter was used to the Dr. Brown's bottles and could not get used to this classic bottle.  She got so much air when she sucked on the bottle, we could not use it.
It pilled up with the wash and dry{tumble low}! AND it shrunk just the tinest bit so to annoy you because it fits but not quite and you broke your nail trying to get it to touch the bottom of the mattress! Grrrrrr.....
For what these nipples cost they were a total disappointment! They are no different from ordinary nipples that cost 50% less and my LO still hated them! Also after using these nipples my LO would tend to be extra rough and pulled at my boobies
