What can I say about Jazzmanic other than the fact that is is some of the best jazz I have ever heard? Funk, fusion, maintream, every jazz genre is represented in this CD. Each song not only presents a musical composition but tells a story. Two of my favorites are "Lady E's Gone" and "Lady E Returns." It is the dream of every woman alive to have a man care about her the way Chris obviously cares about Lady E and that caring is reflected in the two compositions. "Parallasax" is like date night. It begins with all of the preparations, flittering around, getting ready, small talk. Then it goes into a slow and sexy rendition of flirtation and the mating dance. Goodbye and let's do it again. "Confidential Attitude" lives up to its title, starting out  wonderfully upbeat with some really nice flute work. A bit of a struggle, holding fast, and then right back to upbeat and enlightening. The only song I am not particularly fond of is "Watch Ya Back" but that is becasue I am not particularly fond of the rap genre. It is a bit of Lagniappe for those who are. I could go on and on about the rest of the CD but I think the reader will get the picture.If you don't buy any other jazz album in this year buy this one. It has everthing you need.
Last night, I was invited to attend a local musician jam in Nashville called Tom Hurst's Loud Jazz Jam at Douglas Corner. Now granted...I live in Music City USA. We have some of the best session players and professional musicians in the world. So the amount of talent at the improv jam was amazing. Watching different players get up and just have fun with the music was great. I was thoroughly enjoying myself.But THEN...this guy, Chris West, and his band step onto the stage to warm up...and then proceeded to blow me away with their musical skill. The songs were well crafted and the audience (of professional musicians that are hard to impress) were clapping and yelling the whole set. Even during the songs, as each player took their solos, you heard this crowd of discerning musicians yell and clap after each solo. For those outside of the NashVegas music scene, this doesn't happen often.When I got home around 12pm, I immediately went to Amazon and purchased Chris' newest album, The Surprise Trilogy 1, and this one. I've been listening to it since and I'm still blown away. If you love this genre, do your ears a favor and purchase Chris West's albums. Support talented musicians and we won't have to be subjected to the mediocre pile of notes most in the industry call music these days.
like his other works, the level of production is amazing.  many layers of sound.  tantalizing remixes of already sensual tracks.
Rare when I can enjoy every song on an album. It is because of Vertigo Deluxe that i have been introduced to such a beautiful genre of music. I first heard Notice Me back in 2007 and have been hooked on this artist. There is never a day I don't play one of these pieces. My absolute favorites are So Beautiful and Take Me Away. It's been a very long time since a new release. Hope Vertigo Deluxe does another epic album soon.
I first heard this group on Dave's Lounge, and have really enjoyed their music. These tunes are great to just sit back and meditate on.
I was looking for the song Coming Home Baby and this version was one that came up in the search. I liked this version the best, so I played all the other samples from this album and then bought them all. I would have preferred to get a CD but it's not available except at a really high price. I hadn't heard of Bob DeVos previously, although I've been a fan of this style of jazz (guitar, organ, drums, occasional pecussion) for decades. It sounds like it could have been recorded in the '60s, but the release year is 2003. If you like Wes Montgomery, Pat Martino, Charles Earland, Jack McDuff, and Groove Holmes, you'll like this album.  Albums similar to this that I own include El Hombre by Pat Martino, The Wes Montgomery Trio (now called Dynamic New Sound), and Project G5, A Tribute to Wes Montgomery. Also check out Live! and Crash by Jack McDuff, and Living Black! by Charles Earland. Enjoy!
I can't believe no one else has ever reviewed this album.  I stumbled across Bjorn Lynne while listening to a Pandora station.  His music kept popping up on this Pandora channel... and I liked every song, giving them all a thumbs up.  Oddly, none of the songs on this album, Beneath Another Sky, have I heard on Pandora.  I went to Bjorn Lynne's website and purchased this album based on the reviews on his website.  I got lucky... maybe you will, too.I really love this album, but I can see (I really mean &#34;hear&#34;) why others might not be as impressed.  This album is all electronic music, except the guitar.  How do I know that?  Well, youtube has a bunch of his songs plus an INTERVIEW with him.  He makes all his music now on a computer, except for the guitar... he plays the instrument himself and lays down tracks.  All the songs on this album, at least for me, have beauty in them.  They have mood, emotion, feeling,....  And if you don't like a piece of music within a song... just be patient, the music will change... he is a master of changing the mood, emotion, feeling.  I'm really doing a poor job of reviewing this album.  Sorry about that.  It's really hard to describe.  All total.. nearly 80 minutes of music, the last two songs are remixes of two others on the album, but the album would not be complete without these remixes.Atmospheric would characterized a lot of the sound on this album.  It's not ambient, though.  If you like long intros to songs, you'll find them on this album.  Sometimes the intros are nearly 3 minutes long before the the melody/beat of the music starts, and I like that.  Pink Floyd was great at doing this, and so is Bjorn Lynne.A few comments about some of the songs....  Over Distant Shores opens the album, and has a great bass line, but that's just one of several great aspects of this opener.  Starfield is beautiful, and Astronavigator is a lot of fun if you put yourself in a spaceship at the speed of light hurtling through a globular cluster of stars and navigating between them.  Sun Temple is beautiful... there's a sacred sound that comes out of that songs.  Savannah is one of the two songs that has the remix version.  Both versions are wonderful....  Man originated on the Savannah... that's what I conjure up in my head when listening.  Aurora Polaris?  Get ready for a ride!!  Dreams of Glory is a beauty too... wonderful melody.  And Ang Kahora I think is the most unique sounding song and might take a bit to appreciate, but I love listening to it.  The title track washes over me.  And Secret World has such great nuance sounds and moods right from the beginning.I've not heard nor found another artist making music like this.  If you read this and know of other artists making music like this, leave a comment... please!  Amazon will notify me of your comment.  Know that I will read it.I have four of his albums, but this is by far my favorite.  Colony and Crystal Horizon are somewhat similar, and they each have great songs on them.  But Beneath Another Sky... well it's one of my albums that, when I put it on, I'm listening from start to finish.  It's a special time when I put this album on.  I hope you have a nice stereo system to listen to this.  This album deserves to be heard on a good sounding system.  I'm still discovering new sounds that Bjorn Lynne makes months... yes months... after getting this album.I'd encourage you to go to his website.  He comments on most of his albums... which are concept albums most of them.  And I've always liked concept albums.  There are other reviews of this and all his other albums on his website.If any of you played video games in the 90s (maybe late 80s too), you might have heard his music.  He was first a composer of music for video games.  Best wishes and fun listening!!
great,great, great album. i own all volumes and this may have to be my favorite. i personally love girlz didnt give me none, and been here for years.
I love when I run into music that I have not come accross before. My wife had Tract 8-Babylon of the Orient when she got her MP3 player and loved it. I checked out the rest of the album and decided to get it with no regrets.
This cd is such a winner from beginning to end. Every piece is masterful and richly rhythmic in a very enticing way...very sexy!!!  You must give it a try!
I've owned this album for many years, and I never tire of it. It's very instrumental and quite thoughtful.  If you're looking for something with an electric groove to chill by, you can't go wrong with this.
With a variety of rhythms that demand you get up and dance and multi-instrumental masterpieces, this is nothing short of a great album! Amazing diversity from one artist, yet the pieces fit together beautifully. Seldom are all the cuts on one album truly good, but here there are no fillers or weak compositions. I have only rarely heard Adham Shaikh played on internet radio, but his music always stands out. Finally bought Fusion and am thrilled with it. I believe this unifying fusion (presumably the source of the album name) of electronica, dance, world beat and more would appeal to those with interests in a number of different genres.
I have nothing bad to say about this album my favorite tunes are Disposition and Things We Do. I listen to this cd when ever I need to shut out the crazy world for  while it fits nicely with slow Coltrane or Miles loves songs.
For years I asked my mother to look for these songs from Nigeria for me because it's nostalgic for me; brings back fun memories of growing back in Africa. But she keeps telling me she can't find them. Little did I know it was right in my "back yard" of Amazon.com. I am so excited, I simply cannot contain myself. Hoorah Amazon!!!! Please bring back more songs like these.
Looking back over the years, I can only think of a few times I have had such an immediate and strong positive reaction to an album - Mule Variations by Tom Waits, Maxinquaye by Tricky, Untrue by Burial, dubnobassiwthmyheadman by Underworld, Mezzanine by Massive Attack, The Milk-Eyed Mender by Joanna Newsom.  I certainly wasn't expecting it from this weird little album of retro-futuristic electro-jazz that I bought on a whim, but something about it drew me in at first listen.  Imagine a Soul Coughing-inspired album of remixes of music from the animated cartoons of the 1930's, only with a brooding trip-hop twist, and you'll get some idea of what Mr. Griddles offers - but the best way, of course, to know what you're in for is to listen to the samples on this site.  The cumulative effect of listening to this album is more hypnotic and immersive than the short samples can convey, though.  This is weird, non-mainstream stuff, but fans of trip-hop and retro chillout might want to give it a listen.  See if it takes hold of you the way it did me.
I can definitely tell when listening to this album that it may not be for everyone -- but I fell in love with all the songs in this album. The mixes keep me interested and on my feet, I just never get bored listening to it. Now I listen to the album whenever I'm working on something while listening to it and it just helps me keep focus on the task at hand.
This is very good music to relax or fall asleep to. The album is definitely the best one this band made.

Laura Kanani is one of the most talented singer song-writers that unfortunately has yet to be discovered. Her songs are clever heart wrenching confessions of the soul. Her voice is amazing and her range is unparalleled. The only downfall is that there is only four songs available! Listen, love, buy you won't regret it!
I bought this album mostly for the song "Mothra". Happy to hear that the rest of the songs are also very good. Would recommend.
This is a great album. Any album by Pokett will be a good one. It is slow and calm but great deep music.
Let me start by stating I'm bias. I was lucky enough to hit 21 years old in 1990, just in time to experience a heyday in the Boston Music scene. I was lucky enough to catch Think Tree live once, It was a great double bill with the Heritix.Think Tree was and still is a very unique band. They never used backing tracks. Every sample you hear was played live. Their Album "Like The Idea" was readily available but songs such as "Hire a Bird" and "The Lovers" were only available on a very limited released Eight/Thirteen. Most of us only heard them on WFNX. For those of us that grew up in Boston in the early 90's, this MP3 Release is a treat.The Bands of 1990's Boston, you may know one or two:Tribe, Think Tree, The Heritix, Slap Shot, Chucklehead, Buffalo Tom, Letters to Cleo, Cobalt 60, Big Catholic Guilt, The Neighborhoods, Mighty Mighty Bostones, Mary Lou Lord, Mr Floods Party, Powerman5000I'm sure I left a couple of you out, sorry about that.
Well, if you've listened to "Beyond, Beyond" you already know what a good few of these songs already sound like.However, the songs unique to this album are very good. This release is a lot more Drum N Bass heavy than most of his other material, but it's good stuff. This is coming from a guy who can't take to much DNB to.I L-O-V-E LOVE the song, "My Angel." The jingle moving up and down to the drum n bass beat is just so relaxing to hear and it's honestly the main reason I sought out the cd so hard.The song, "The Sweetest Sounds" is also a good one to me. It's another song that takes that mellowed out Drum n Bas road so present on this album.The self-titled song, "Beyond" is also excellent to. I love how chill that piano comes on in the song and how the rest of the beat works around it.
It's been very difficult to find this classic album. Paul Robb, formerly (and again) of Information Society, did (in my opinion) his best work under the name Think Tank.
The music on this CD stands the test of time.  It was excellent in 1996 and just as good today.  I especially like Mr. Robb's redux of A Knife and a Fork; a track initially recorded under the Think Tank moniker before appearing on the Information Society album &#34;Hack&#34;.
I started listening to Deadmau5 recently, so most of what I knew from him were songs like Ghosts N Stuff (good one, btw, esp with the dude from Pendulum singing).  I had already purchased his other albums, all but the DJ ones and the remixes and such, so when I stumbled upon this one while farting around on the inet, I immediately had to download it.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I figured it'd be good, I'm happy with the other music he's put out, but I didn't know how different it would sound from his other stuff. Beats are different, song content is different, there's more variance from song to song that you don't get so much with his other albums.  The only song I'm not at all interested in listening to ever again in life is Careless.  Ugh.  I've removed it from my computer and iTunes permanently. All the other songs make up for it, though, which is why I'm still giving this 5 stars.
I love this cd. It is my favorite Deadmau5 album. It isn't like most of his albums in that there is a variation of beats. A couple of the tracks remind me of The Crystal Method because of the sounds and beats. I can't get enough of this sh*t
Listening to old Deadmau5's sound, I kind of wish he would go back to this sound periodically as it sounds SO different to his current House sound. It would be cool, but artists tend to keep moving forward, not looking at the past (which is probably a good thing). Anyways, this is a great album by Deadmau5, and you will not be dissappointed.
One of the few albums in my collection that is electronic and transcends clever beats and knob twiddling.  Usually IDM, breaks and other interesting electronic music focus or get lost in one aspect of music...rhythm.  This album bridges the gap with excellent melodies and beats.  Can't wait to hear more.
If you are somebody who likes listening to any music genres other than Trance and just needs a good start in listening to Trance, "Darkside (Thomas Peyton Mix)" by Nugen is the one for you.This music definitely introduced me to the Trance/dance World. After trying out some other good trance music, I found some considerable good trance/dance deejays such as Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyk, Darude, DJ Dean, Lucy Carr, DJ Sammy, More (Around the World), Komakino (Outface), Orbital, Prodigy, Armin Van Buuren, Mauro Picotto, Tiesto, Ferry Corsten, Special D, and other low profile deejays associated with high profile deejays mentioned above.However, nothing can be compared to this "Darkside (Thomas Peyton Mix)" by Nugen.  I find myself often wondering about Nugen because he got some potentials in himself, though he only produced a few songs.I rated it five out of five. :)
I am very excited that I purchased this album! Every song on it is great. I love love love it!
The sound and the mood this album can put you into is pretty awesome. The track 'The Starwheel' sounds great!
I'm relatively new to the dark ambient genre, having only explored it for a year or so.  When I began my search, I was hoping to find music that was transporting without being overwhelming; something that would free my imagination without impressing upon it too much; something that would stir my intellect as well as my ears.  So much music bullies its way into your consciousness, clinging there with a demanding desperation that borders on alarming.  I was hoping for something different: to be inspired without being confined.In Kammarheit's album The Starwheel, I've found exactly what I'm looking for.  Up until now, my delving into dark ambient turned up music that was well-formed but too abstract or repetitive for me, or brilliant but filled in a lot of the mental blanks for me.  This is not a knock on these other projects in the slightest, as each achieve exactly what they are designed to do.  My search was for something more personal, something that spoke to me directly, and The Starwheel is that album.It's difficult to pinpoint exactly why this music has such an effect on me.  Something like raison d'etre creates something external for me - certainly moving, no doubt, and raison ranks amongst my favorite recording artists - but The Starwheel goes beyond this.  I view it as the aural equivalent of a painting, or a poem.  Kammarheit is the brainchild of Swedish musician Par Bostrom, and he has concocted what I think is the perfect example of form, mood, flow, and space.  The atmosphere it creates gives voice to half-formed ideas that already existed in my head.  The music has the right amount of darkness for me, mixed with what I consider the perfect amount of wonder.  It doesn't drag, or become ponderous and indulgent as so much dark ambient does.  The Starwheel is neither too long nor too short.  It contains subtle mood changes, delicate melodic shifts, and scattered details that combine to create a majestic singular tapestry, elevating it above everything else I've heard in the genre.I imagine many different things while listening to The Starwheel.  The same track conjures different images during separate listens - probably a reflection of my mood.  I see an abandoned child's park in the rain.  A quiet nocturnal street.  A woman reading by candlelight.  The sea at sunrise.  A forest touched by snow.  Sometimes, I imagine nothing at all, and just let it wash through me.  At times, it's an active listening experience; at others, background ambient perfection.  It defines and re-defines itself in my head, always to profound effect, in a non-invasive, almost gentle manner.You may not have the same experience with this album.  I realize my reaction is completely subjective.  However, I do hope you give this music a try, because you never know what you might discover.  I certainly didn't, up until the moment The Starwheel began to turn.
Totally agree with previous review. Just the right thing in this genre for my taste. I can feel the deep, dark Swedish ethos!
The soundtrack to the movie Confessions of a Burning Man is one of the most amazing collections of music that relates to Burning Man I have ever listened to.  If you are reading this review you must be a Burner or a Virgin looking for music that connects you to the experience of being at Burning Man.  For me, every song on this soundtrack bleeds Burning Man.  Maybe it's because I was there in 2001 when this film was shot.  Maybe it's because this music fits so well with the movie, Confessions of a Burning Man. Maybe it's because this soundtrack sounds just like being out on the playa feels....I don't know.  What I do know is that the soundtrack to Confessions of a Burning Man has stuck with me every since its release some 8+ years ago.If you are a Burner, I would give it a listen.  If you are thinking about going to Burning Man for the first time I would watch the movie and listen to this soundtrack.  But, if this is your first time going to Burning Man; just know, that no matter how much you prepare, you will not be ready for what's in store for you out on the Playa.  I hope to see you out there.
Got this thinking I was purchasing remixes of the original version, which would include the one we all know and love.  Instead, got an "unplugged" version (actually versions, since there are a few here) of the song.  Very cool and a lot different than you'd expect.  The big surprise to me is that this lady can actually sing!!  She is a very talented vocalist and it really shows here.  For that, I think it's a 5-star project.Would love to hear some other new stuff from this group!If you like the song from the 80s and want something a little different, but similar, you will like this.
I remember back in the 80s when this song came out, I went and purchased the CD immediately. It has such a simple but effective hook of a bass line. Combine that with Valarie's vocals, it easy to see why it was a hit 20 something years ago. They are using it in TV commercials now (what better endorsement). Seriously, this is a fine effort on all the tracks. Valerie Day's vocals are superb and finding this inspired me to buy some of her other, later stuff. Money well spent.
This is a relaxing, mellow album, that I was led to, strangely enough, via a website for Geico that featured the lead track Homecoming Weekend in a Small Town.The album doesn't get heavy play on my iTunes but I return to it enough.  I have learned that it is was a solo project, and debut, by John Wu who seems to have given up on music, which is a shame.
Totally bangin' tracks, the both of them. They're both really hard and have great melodies. Definitely worth the money.H4RDSTYLE4LYF
There are amazing sequences of very funky scratching and scratch drumming. Its a great album to have on hand to study advanced scratching.
This is a awesome song, even if you're not a "tapper', this one will make you get up & move...lol
You must buy this, now.It contains the greatest of the greatest by Cygnus X, including the originals and best remixes of two of my favorite tracks, "The Orange Theme" and "Superstring".Not to mention that at $17 for a two-cd set worth of tracks on a 256K No-DRM download, it's well worth it, and blows the pants off anything iTMS can offer.
Soothing, sexy, this album is great for just chillin with a cup of tea or even for your workout.  Would love to see what she does next!  You're Too Pretty is definitely my favorite!  I highly recommend getting this album.
I heard the first track Segue on the radiothreesixty podcast and thought I would check out the album at amazon. The mix of jazzy influcenes coupled with Ms. Johnston ethereal vocal stylings create a beautiful, relaxed sound.
di johnston's voice is so sexy and the music is really soothing and chill. great for a romantic date or for just throwing on your ipod and walking around the city. sugar daddy is my favorite song on here!
This is a good classic trance type music. This reminds me of when trance first came out here in Chicago with d.j. Markski,  and by golly it moves the heart rythem and soul. his is good music for the nostalgic moment, working out or whatever the occasion mite be. Good work.
This is the trance album for anyone seeking a soundtrack to fuel an intense session of deep thought / introspection / hard work. Contains some very classic trance tracks woven together into a non-stop mix... I wish I could find more albums like this on the market.
Straight Detriot club music this music will got you hype in a minute.... I love bang this in the car with my system.
If I could say anything about William Fields' new album 'timbre' (available on Gears of Sand recordings), it would be, "Gentleness". I exchanged my o2 for a copy of timbre- the experiences of both could not be more diverse. Whereas 'o2' is more akin to being plugged directly into a RGB output and watching your frontal cortex malfunction & cross-wire synapses to the aural sector of your brain, the closest analogy I can think of to 'timbre' is of being gently immersed in a bar of sweet-smelling soap, and trying to avoid the bubbles.There's a lot of bubbles on the album, alot of 15k activity above the general hum and whistle in the 500hz-1k territory, gently interspersed with some glitch-inspired background static and chatter- don't get me wrong though- this is not a 'glitch' album. Because whereas the forerunner thought of 'glitch' is to say "guess what's coming up? Bet you can't guess! BANG!!! - bet you didn't expect that, huh???", the ambient smother of 'timbre' appears to be more along the lines of "It's okay, you're in a safe, if heterogenous and artificial place, there's nothing to be worried about, nothing to be ashamed of, here, have some more bubbles".I'll be upfront about this - I am no ambient fan - and even less of 'glitch ambient', an arena which wildly bores me. But timbre is something slightly different, something slightly off-kilter, more 'personal' than most generated music, and while I doubt I would've warmed to it so very quickly if I were not already a fan of Mr Fields' work, it remains that this is a very good album, very well-thought-out. The artificiality (of which we'll talk more of later) never quite eclipses the overall melodic 'feel' of the album, the random elements of the songs never sound unplanned (ie. the use of FSU devices - if present - feels restrained and part of the song), and while I personally would've dropped back the 15k activity a little, the album is well-mixed and mastered well. The cover art is also very nice, although the arial-esque fontography detracts from it, somehow. Given the overall personalised feeling of the album, I feel that handwriting would've matched the subject matter, more closely.Overall, it stands up well - not perhaps in the league of bigger players such as "Bola", but nearing their field, certainly. Indeed, the only criticism I can find in my listening to this album, is similar to what I have said of Bola's most recent album, Gnayse- that being, the artificiality of the soundscape leaving a pleasant, but somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere, to the extent I feel a real need to get outside and immerse myself in nature and natural elements afterwards. Could this be alleviated by incorporating more natural non-generative background sounds and instrumentation?? More than likely- and given his recently announced desire for piano (see his blog), it could be assumed that these small issues may be absent in Bill's future recordings. I think my favourite track is 'floatingpoint', with a low bass accompanied by statical pops and waving synths. Having said that, the whole album is fairly consistent, and a high point in William's output to date.Salut&eacute; Bill- congrats on a very interesting album-
Essenza has released a truly soothing and inspiring EP.Merging elegant vocals with fluid electronics they create a sound that I find myself listening to when I need to wind down from a long busy day. Perfect to mellow out to on those long train rides or drive home from a long days work.Jane's vocals are downright ethereal. Erin's bassline are smooth and fluid.Ryan's guitars add some amazing texture.Jim's electronics(forgive my biased nature having worked with him)are beautifully delicate and add the icing on the cake.If you like this EP be sure to check out their "Like a Dream" Remix on Stephanie Dosen's latest relese.
I got these 2 CDS years ago - before I practiced yoga.  Now I use them in my daily practice and I also play them in the morning when getting my sons ready for school.  It has mellowed out our morning mayhem and I feel like it is the perfect way to start a balanced day.  This is a long CD... and very earthy, I adore it.
Yet another amazing ambient journey created and composed by Richard Bone. So far I managed to collect about 25 of his albums and this one is one of his best.This is a thematic and immersive work that is best experienced by listening to the whole album in sequence. All the tracks have a dreamy and in some cases a "warm" feel to them (e.g. The Seduction Of Dr Pasteur).If you like thematic works like this - you'd definitely like a lot of, if not all his ambient albums. Two later releases of Richards have a similar thematic structure and are well worth tracking down :  Ghosts Of Hanton Village and Sudden Departure
I recently discovered this amazing artist and have since bought ALL of his works, at least the ones I can find. This piece is very good and I can vision microbes floating around very serenely ;)
This album is really good.  Each song is different, but the overall styles are housey-minimal techno and breakcore-styled drum 'n' bass.  It takes more than one listen to get used to it, but there is a "deep quality" to this album that's very surprising and only reveals itself upon close study. Play at FULL volume, with a SUBWOOFER!
Omodaka and Far East keep putting out these crazy little sampler platters, and I keep loving them.  They have a particular blend of chiptune synths and traditional Japanese vocals that, puzzlingly, manages to remain fresh for every new single.  The music videos are a fantastic representation of this unusual mash-up face of their work. (Flying, 3-d-rendered sex toys move through the streets of samurai-era Tokyo's geisha town.  A side-scrolling horse-race-betting adventure.  A stop-motion census that will have you thinking of Bach next time you're at the DMV.)
Yosawya-san is an honorific used to address your bookie. When you are at the races, it is important to have a good bookie. Still don't get it? Look of the promotional video on YouTube.Thus comes the title tune of this wonderful album that is a unique a fusion of chip tunes and traditional Japanese melodies and singing styles. I am not sure where to begin to say anything really meaningful in terms of descriptives. Simply, you have to hear it.It is very odd. It is is very awesome. It is one of those must have (8-)bits of eclectic ephemera.And I have annoyed many a friend who has immediately asked "can I get a copy of that" upon hearing it with the fact that it is a cheap EP available in MP3 format, so support the little guys and go buy a copy.So, do that thing. And then you can tell me whether the cover art is a pompadour or something entirely other.
Fantastic, but don't buy MP3s only, because you won't get the 144-page full-color, hardcover book . . .  get it from Amazon.com, with the book... ! ! !
I actually owned this CD twice! I purchased it brand new back in the day because I had much faith in the Silent label and liked the packaging plus I was expecting something along the lines of Psychic TV since Alaura had spent so many years in that legendary band. I was disappointed in how slow this CD was and quickly sold my copy. Only years later as my ears grew more mature with listening to music, that I picked up this CD again only to listen to it in a very different way. It's very soothing and nice and represents everything opposite Psychic TV crazy techno/house music (which I tend to like as well!). This CD is great for meditation or listening to while drifting off to sleep. There is something quite magical about this release and only wish Alaura had followed up with this release. Well, there's still time, right?
I discovered the music of Tomas Dvorak through the excellent Machinarium soundtrack. When I went looking for more things by him, I was happy to find this album. Like the Machinarium soundtrack, Pocustone has a nice blend of melodic ambience, varied instruments and electronic sounds, and occasional subtle vocals. This album also includes downtempo beats and in one case (Below), more prominent vocals.This makes for good background music, but it's also worth paying attention to.
I first heard "com"  on a "chillout" cable-radio station, and while it was quite pretty, it didn't prepare me for what I would encounter on this album. First of all, each track is in itself, unique - it is much more than your run of the mill chillout album.Phi_log and Labccr are my two favorite tracks. Labccr gives me chills every time I hear it - it takes you on a journey. The clarinet is placed perfectly every time. Never too loud or overpowering, just the right balanced levels to make my ears feel tickled just right. You can blast this on really good speakers and it sounds even better.This album has elements of jazz, some beautiful classical instruments, and amazing beats, lush atmospherics, and just brilliant melodies. It will never sound dated, and it won't remind you of anyone else or any other piece of music you have.I've had this recording now for about 10 years and I still don't get tired of it.
It's easy to second guess yourself.  &#34;Well, I don't know, I just like this album&#34;......&#34;probably a meaningless quirk&#34;.....I mean I do know I like some minimal and ambient music for sure.....Charlemagne Palestine, Eno, Fripp, Steve Reich.......but this strange Haven's album....why do I like this particularl one....and what's the name of the group?.....is it Havens, Encomiast (look it up).....Encomiast.  Whenever any selection on this album randomly plays on my system, through the other noises of the house I'm immediately thinking &#34;wait!  what is this?&#34;  And I hear good construction, meaningful composition, before my mind even hears that it's ambient minimal music.  Understand you have to have an open mind to this type of musical sound.  But the more I hear this album the more I know that this music is well structured with intrinsic compositional statement and therefore emotional output.  Finally looked up Encomiast and see the member names of Ross Hagen and Clint Listing and I see they've done a number of projects.  I was afraid I'd find nothing more than this one album here that I review.  But no, if something smells good, tastes good, sounds good....it was good and these guys seem to be on a palpable creative roll with no shortage of work.  Not sure if this is mostly Ross, or Clint or collaboration.  I just know that, well, that I think Encomiast are excellent sound constructionists......
Saw these guys for the first time at Eugene Celebration in 2009 and at a Reggae festival in 2011 and been bumpin it ever since!  This is something you must purchase! Roll n light it;)
Not much anyone can say about 'Another Fine Day, Life Before Land'! With reviews you can only give up to 5 stars. What do you do with something like this incredible release. Tom Green aka Another Fine Day has create a masterpiece. Every review you can get your hands on can't say much more than what I am. It's simply near perfection. Good luck finding it besides downloading it on mp3. Musical bliss...
"After hearing samples and now hearing it as a whole, no wonder why it stands so highly as one of the best albums ever made. While neglected and highly underrated by the majority of the music public, this 12-track compilation will not only zone you out after a hard day's work but leave you to question the paths and travels, given the Native American-inspired spoken word parts, of the mind in a state of where you need to go out and see the forbidden wilderness. A theme is prevalent but all the songs on here are very strong, melodic, funky, and rhythmic. Like the many albums I often chose, those elements are often necessary for more to enjoy a great tune or two (e.g. Melody AM, The Campfire Headphase, Demon Days, Twoism EP).BEST SONGS: (Almost all of them, no need for explanation given the vibe and rhythm follows you altogether. All the songs, except Track 1 don't clip off) Unsweetable Soul. Two Nights Ago. In a Place. Moonlight in Your Hair. Num Haisto. My Heart is Traveling.
I am not a fan of long songs&#8230;its why its strange that the 8 minute song on tho disc is my fave. Killer Six is like the baby of New Order and The Cure. Lots of that Cure crybaby guitar. Fields of Lucid Trees is a bit trippier with flourishes of Postal Service breaks. . Album finished with a mellow electronic number with Information Society 80's bits. Good Ep. DOWNLOAD.
So yeah. 81:03 by Antarctica is tied for first on my list of favorite recordings. Ova Looven filled the void left by Antarctica's break-up (Eric Richter's projects did not). 58:34 was no less than great, and Gravity Has Expired was an evolution, an extension of the best ideas on 58:34. I check the Artikal records website periodically but there hasn't been an update in way too long. Which is disappointing. There's two unreleased tracks floating around on YouTube, but I've been itching to listen to a full-length. I own digital copies of this record, but I got a record player for Christmas, so my first instinct was to own a physical copy. Why? It's really, really good. And because the cover art replaced Rousseau's Carnival Evening as my favorite art of all time.Chris Donohue: you are a pretty special person. Please make music. And then release it. My friend and I started a band primarily and shamelessly influenced by your work in Antarctica and Ova Looven. We got a crazy write-up calling us number one band to watch in Philly. Yeah, they called us an &#34;undead version of New Order,&#34; which is exactly how I would have described Antarctica if I thought of it first. We were offered a tour with Inner Party System as they were blowing up (we obviously turned that down), and we opened for Foals for our fifth and last show before breaking up. Point being: if imitating you could lead to such quick success, I can only imagine what you could do should you keep doing it.Writing reviews in second person is weird.
Want to feel like Abby from NCIS when you work? And who doesn't? This does the job--keeps me going, focused, AND feeling like a rockstar. And the music is so good that this album repeated 4 times before I realized it.
I live in Arizona and the clubs don't play this kind of music so I hype myself up in the car on the way to the club. Get this party starter
It's a nice early album made by a group so diverse in it'd musical talent!  They are very personable and dedicated to their fans.  I love the cut &#34;Mr. Shakes&#34;.
A departure from their previous two albums, but a welcomed evolution in their sound. I was at first taken aback by the first track on the album, I was expecting psy-trance but was surprised to hear tech-house, morphing into breaks, and continuing to change over the 14 minute span. This album is solid, with tracks that groove, and will keep you listening to the very end. Nuclear Ramjet has definitely matured into a tour de force of electronic music, taking influences from all genres, yet able to maintain their signature sound. This album is a must-have for Nuclear Ramjet fans, and any electronic music lover -- a great addition to the collection.
Beautiful music!  Calming and sensual.  It is one of our favorites!  I will look for more albums like this one.
It's incredible how Brazil has so many incredible and original artists.  I am quite suspicious for being Brazilian, but in this case this is so much true.  It's really worth it.  Karina's voice and accent is so nice, relaxing and delicate like a flower.
"Lost Oasis" is the second album from Psyche co-founder Stephen Huss. Containing 70 minutes of inspirational soundscaping. Like Tangerine Dream, sometimes smooth, sometimes freaky.This intergalactic trip contains among many highlights; "Intensity", "Pleasure Model", and "Conjure" with guest vocals from brother Darrin.
I'm a long-time Idaho fan and I have to say, I love this album. It's not as traditionally idaho-ish as most of their other stuff, more experimental and synth-influenced, but no worse for the wear. The album has a considerable range artistically, and unlike the other reviewer I totally dig the polka track. (It's not entirely a polka song, but you'll hear the tuba for sure.) I find TLG to be very listenable. It's got plenty of depth and texture to keep you stimulated if you focus on listening- if you don't, it's mellow and smooth enough to not distract you. I make an occasional 8 hour road trip from San Diego to Tucson and I listen to this album every time. Highly recommended for long desolate treks across open desert, breakup soundtracks, and indie movies (some day, it'll be the soundtrack to my own indie movie.) Buy it. Nuf said.
This is absolutely one of the great contemporary under-appreciated jazz groups in the US today.  I was lucky to see them in NYC a few years back but I really have the feeling they stick around their hometown of New Orleans.  They have never put out a bad record as far as I know and they always sound fresh!
Usually I wouldn't expect an EP of remixes to be worth the time, but this is a big exception.  I loved "Mainstay" to begin with, and each variation was totally original.  The quality of the remixes really surprised me.  Check it out; choose a favorite version- pedal mix might be mine.
I stumbled upon Gypsy Pacific entirely by chance on a visit to Maui, and they became an instant favorite of mine. Inspired by the work of Django Reinhardt, guitarist Tom Conway assembled the group which included the terrific fiddle player Willy Wainwright and bassist Marcus Johnson. (The band later--after this album--added guitarist Phil Benoit, brother of David and, with wife Angela, "Benoit Jazz Works".) Although they have since broken up, their recorded work remains.These pieces by Tom Conway stand up remarkably well to traditional gypsy jazz works, and have the advantage of being new rather than retreads. These are works I've returned to for years. If you enjoy the genre you should enjoy this album.Gypsy Pacific also recorded an album of gypsy jazz classics* and an album of Hawaiian pieces**.*Hot Gypsy Nights**Wela
I love this group. I listened to their other CD for so long that I had to buy this one. It's very good if you enjoy music that's captivating when you first hear it, and that expands its layers and texture the more you listen to it. I highly recommend. Good luck to the band on continued success!
Excellent CD, titles are the only thing 'explicit'.  Electronica, trip hop, trance genre type of music. Heard this on Pandora which is why I got it.
For SPL system testing and tuning this is the gold standard. MP3 only option really as the disc is not made anymore.
I love this album.  It not only has bass test tracks, but also has some real "Trance" sounding techno, using mostly the lower frequencies for the beats and tones in the songs.  :)
IM AN INSTALLER I WAS LOOKING FOR AN OLD SCHOOL TEST CD TO ACTUALLY WOULD GIVE ME SOME SERIOUS OLD SCHOOL QUAD YOU KNOW THAT REAL BOTTOM BASS TO SET BASS X-OVER WITH LETS JUST SAY I BLEW A COUPLE OF FUSES TO MUCH AND JUST ENOUGH DEFINATELY NOT FOR THE WEAK HEED THE WARNING IN TEST SECTION YEESSSS
Destruction, purgation, metamorphosis.  These are the central themes of many industrial albums, especially those that fall into the broadly-conceived "power" or "rhythmic" noise genre.  "Beyond Repair" is no exception.  This album set the standard for noise for the past several years, being the greatest of its type since Converter's "Blast Furnace."  But Prometheus Burning brought different elements to the table that set it apart from earlier permutations -- the vocals, sometimes shrieking, sometimes growling, sometimes moaning; the emphasis on dance-oriented structures; and, of course, the female element.  While there are several female artists in this vein, such as Hecate, there have been few who have so thoroughly integrated a vocal element into their music, or so well.  While Ms. Telladictorian's vocals are certainly an acquired taste, it is indisputable that they are a perfect complement to the thrashing, nightmarish vat that is filled to the brim with downsampled voices, inhuman bellowing, and pulsating, self-destructing percussion.  While some tracks are straightforward dancefloor killers wrapped in broken glass and misfiring automata -- "Some Things Are Meant To Stay Broken" and "Significantly Altered" come to mind -- others are convulsing, spasmsodic bursts, like "Squelch" and "Deanimate."  And further still are the amorphous noisescapes like "The Needle's Eye" and "Deconstructing Scar Tissue."If you're a connoisseur of this sort of music, then chances are you already own it.  However, if you're the type who likes darker club music but hates the effeminate, pathetically over-the-top forced "edginess" of girly-men eurotrash like Combichrist (or the self-righteous pop debacle that is most electro music these days), and might be willing to listen to an album that is only roughly club-compatible in fits and starts, then this is one of the best starting points possible.
Didn't hear about this album until it appeared on Pandora and I immediately was hooked. Erase the Pain and Over Water are personal favorites, but the others are great. There's a good mix of calmer ambient grooves and more upbeat dance-floor style mixes. Also, album cover has penguins so what's there not to love?
In an industry populated by derivatives of genre leaders, this album provide a fresh return to Trance music without losing coherency and familiarity.
I've never taken the time to write a review on Amazon, but the extraordinary nature of this album was so expansive I had to comment. I discovered this group while listening to Pandora.com on my electronica/techno radio station and was immediately sucked in by the track "Over Water." The track boasted catchy bass lines, slick pacing and unconventional arrangements. Each track is designed to be a unique journey, whether utilizing soft piano to complement heavy synth arrangements or an electric guitar to elevate dance-grooves to unheard of heights. I could go on, but this album is a testament to how music can touch your soul, and encourage the most introverted individuals to bust a move. Highly recommended.
Great hidden GEM.Everyone is used to the new Remixes with Bally Sagoo etc.  This is the original. The way Khan Sahib did his real music. A must have.
Walter Murphy has Outdone himself here, not only is it a pleasure to listen to from the beginning to the end but it's an album I could listen to over and over.  I bought this LP years ago because of the interesting cover and am glad I did. Since this is so impossible to find on a CD I ended up burning my own from the vinyl. Whoever wrote up the song titles here for Amazon made an error, song #2 is called Phantom Of Your Dreams NOT Phantom Of The Opera (which is the album title)...... one more thing...... Gene Pistilli delivers fantastic lead vocal work on this song (almost reminds me of Leon Russell).  Try this music, You'll Love It.....
I first heard this music on vinyl sometime around 1979-80; I had bought the album on impulse and never regretted it.  Elements of these songs stayed in my sub-conscious for a very long time and I repeatedly looked for the music over the intervening years to replace a scratchy album (and I no longer had a turntable).  Now that I have heard it again it seems as if the passage of the years has done nothing to diminish the strength of the tunes.  Wildly different from the Lloyd Webber approach this music is definitely in a class of its own and rightly so.  I am very pleased to have re-discovered Mr Murphy's awesone talent.  It almost makes me want to open up and listen to his update on the classics.
I lover every song and have this on repeat you can listen to this anywhere and its fitting  when i wake up and before bed im playing Pivotal Movement
a definite must to groove to....you should listen to a sample of this funky jam cd...buy the album today ...trust me
Emi Evans has an incredible voice. I found her works through the game NieR and have since proceeded to purchase all of her albums.In this album specifically, Momentary is a perfect song. Stretch and Mirage are close seconds.Buy the whole album, you won't regret it.
seeing that there are so many talented Australian Industrial bands, I hoped this CD from New Zealand would be good. I was blown away by how amazing some of the songs were. its a shame that this band won't release their two earlier albums in north America because they are extremely talented!
Your idea of beautiful music will change after you hear this album.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  I like a lot of different genres of music and I would have to say this could be my favorite band of all time.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album and feel your heart be captured. .
Not much to add to the previous reviews, other than that I just can't get enough of this stuff. The more I play it the better it gets. It's really excellent stuff. If you hold the idea that some music is just good music, intrinsically, irrespective of genre, then you'll love this.
At first blush, Plastic Little might seem to occupy a very, very small niche: hip-hop freaks who love "Star Wars" and The Smiths in equal measure, and couldn't be offended if someone took their momma and [CENSORED]. But really, everyone should give "She's Mature" a shot. The album is packed with energy, skilled lyricism, and, perhaps most importantly, colorful, varied production that reinvents itself on every track. Humor is also key to Plastic Little's style: While many rappers try to throw funny asides in their albums, usually in the form of painfully unfunny skits, Plastic Little could make it as professional comedians. They deftly spoof Dead Prez-style overserious black nationalism on "Creative Differences" and R. Kelly-style sex ballads on "4$ Love Song." Meanwhile, the highlights take a more straightforward route to silliness: "Steven and Billy" and "The Jumpoff" are brilliant, exuberant hip-hop anthems. Granted, sometimes the hedonism can verge into unsettling misogyny, as on "Now I Hollar" -- but for the most part, it's an absolute blast to spend an hour with the smartest, craziest hip-hop album since "Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde."
Great Remixes!!!  Even better than the original songs, in my opinion.  I am not into Goth music buy Jennifer Parkin really is a wonderful song writer and singer!!!!!
It's wonderful painting music.
This music is new and innovative.  The artist, Matheos, manages to blend beats and sounds that creates must-move-in-my-seat melodies.  From clubbin' to chillin', I thouroughly receive a musical experience that is unforgettable.  I love it, and I highly recommend it!  Thank you, Matheos, for taking me to Greece on an entirely different journey than I expected!
This is a great mix of world beats, electro, loungechill, and Greek elements...The Bionic Goddess, Thoulepseto, and Feta are very strong tracks with whimsical lyrics, and Athena is a great cross-over track for Hip-Hop fans wanting something new. Greek mythology is present in Hephaestus, with ancient percussion mixed in a modern approach has a great vibe for the bars, cars, and clubs.
Cave of Brahma is an amalgam of styles ranging from singer/songwriter to hiphop to reggae to indian kirtan. Everyone gets pulled in by the album's first track, "bore the righteous"  which was written in one take and recorded in one take. And that's just the beginning. Beautiful heavy moods are interspersed with lighter moments. but this is just the beginning... the music just gets better and better with each album. Arjun and Guardians second album,Hotel Arjunis also internationally inspired and explores some deep moods. Arjun himself has gone on to become a western master of indian bhajan and kirtan, and his bhajan anandi series are amazing!
This is a great soundtrack. Digital Droo is going to be huge once he is discovered by the general public.
I heard this track randomly and had to have it!!! Once I found it, I was immediately hooked and I played it for an entire weekend!
Buy this track!  If you like a cutting edge progressive dance sound, look no further!
I have followed Meggotron since the 80's and lost my tapes...yes...tapes from a flood and this digital will bring it back.
Album well composed and very relaxing. I enjoy almost every track on this album which is rare. Looking forward to see what else comes out.
Puts me in a trance. Brainwaves set for creativity. Really like'n it. Especially Rapture at Sea. THE definition of trance music. Recommend.
I downloaded the songs in this album after reviewing them in amazon, I must say I wasn't sure if I'd like all the songs but after listening to them these are some of my fav new tracks to listen to while I work / etc.  Thumbs up from me.
This album is full of great tracks that make it easy to chill out and relax. Rapture at Sea is possibly my new favorite relaxation track.
Most people have found him through Myspace, others from odds and ends of websites online, but one thing is for certain: DoF's music is both comforting and inspirational to all who listen. With this album DoF explores an artistic blend of music through instrumentals and electronic forms in order to create a calm, soothing,and relaxing feeling of bliss. Preview songs such as 'The Color of My World Nine' and 'Inefficient Nothing' to truly enjoy the beauty of his work. I highly recommend this and any of his other albums.
First of all, if you found your way here, congratulations! I have made quite a few efforts to make it known that there are apparently two editions of this album with completely different track listings - this being the one that I initially heard, fortunately, as it is also much more elusive. I suspect that without knowing enough to look for it, I would not have had the wherewithal to ever find it. The first clue is that the cover art is upside down from one edition to the other. It is also obvious that this track listing reads more like an import to English-reading/speaking folk like myself. Anyway...just some info that I wish someone had provided me. I hope at least one person reads this, and even finds it useful.As for the album itself, I immediately was enthusiastic about what I heard. Not to say that it's easily accessible and won't stand up to repeated plays, but rather, that it caught my attention in a rare way. After being only partly through one track, Flokt (Shiver), I could tell that I liked it. Perhaps more importantly, I could tell that I was probably going to like it even more as I became more fully immersed in all its barrage of aural cacophonies.What stands out in my mind is the feeling of wonderment as I was continually surprised more frequently than I could even get over. The music just tumbles all over itself in clusters, constantly evolving without stopping to notice. Before hearing this, I don't think I'd ever heard quite this much variety of sounds in such concentration. The stuff is all over the place. At the same time though, the relationships created therein do have a sense of effectiveness. So it's not at all just for the sake of making the zaniest sound effects. Actually, it almost is akin to how instruments establish a rapport in orchestral pieces, passing music around, back and forth, finishing/answering each other, etc. perhaps more abstractly, though. In a more subjective regard, it makes me think of the instrumental bridge in "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch" and how extreme it is in its occupancy of the individual space that the song exists in. That came as such a shock, it really warranted some suspension of disbelief. I could hardly place it relative to the rest. In that sense, Compulsion also reminds me of the myriad sounds that Beck sometimes employs; or perhaps even that of Self on Gismodgery.Some unlikely comparisons, maybe. Still, these are connections I have made.P.S. I have yet to hear the other edition. I'm curious about how they compare, too.
this is a great album!  with a solid blend of dark drum and bass and hindi style and sounds this is one of the best albums i have heard in years.  up there with Talvin Singh's OK. great use of bansuri and other traditional indian instruments coupled with fat beats and heavy bass.  all without getting overly repetitive or boring (as D&B can get sometimes). what a pleasure!
This is one of the best drum'n'bass mixes out there.  Old school style.  You should definitely check it out if you like old school drum'n'bass circa 1997.
The album "Kuba Inside Out" is one of the best chillout albums I've heard.  Every track sounds soothing and refreshing.  My favorite track is, "The Most Gorgeous Sunset".  If you are into downtempo electro, dub, or chillout. I recommend this album to you.  Every song on it sounds good, and it has a sci-fi, electro smooth refreshing feel that will let your mind wonder.Great to listen to, when chilling with your lover, or if you are busy working on a project on the computer. I would give this album 11 out of 10 stars for the creativity, style, and quality.
So many wonderful tracks on this album, very nice background music for lounge/party and also while coding. psy-chill, and sometimes with violin and acoustic guitar and other real instruments.
The first track "I Was Only Kidding" takes you into an atmosphere of sonic exploration that doesn't relent until the last note of "Lullaby."  Endlessly listenable.
I have one album & plan on more from this fantastic group!!!  This music is timeless, & everyone likes to party with tunes like these!!!  Smart, Cool, & Suave tunes that really blast out happy tunes!!!  like New Orleans used to be___
Ok so my first introduction was hearing a sample on the Bacardi Rum commercial. This introduced me to the wonderful world of electroswing. The three songs on this EP are a great price and a wonderful way to see if you will like this style. As for me Parov Stelar is one I will be following for a while.
For everyone who likes this song you can buy the album and the album of one of her other projects on myspace.  The band is called Slingshot Dakota, they are one of the best bands I've come across is along time.  Search them on myspace and you can buy the album that this track is off of and others from the band.
This is a very good song for all the people who have seen the YouTube video, and for all the people who like straight classical type music, with only a piano. Very good and this is one of my favorite songs to listen to.A must buy
Beautiful pace in this song, this song instantly relaxes me when I listen to it...the melody is simply beautiful.
It's great.I've been trying to buy this track, do the right thing, support an artist.Except that I'm not in the US and apparently my money isn't good enough for Amazon and "Digital Content Providers" complaining about sales going down.Hey, guess what are my options now?Apart from that, that track reminds me of another artist, Yann Tiersen, with similar melodies and mood.A light piece with sorrowful undertones, very nicely played and very inspiring.
This is the real deal: straight up Detroit techno from masters of the scene. In a genre dominated by 12" singles, it's refreshing to have a full album of tracks that one can simply sit down and listen to. I know techno is a dance genre, but when it's done correctly, it's definitely worth listening to on its own outside of the club.Many of the familiar Underground Resistance crew make an appearance here. Mad Mike Banks, DJ Rolando, and the UR collab at the end are particularly strong. If you like your techno unadorned and pure, this is for you.
I discovered Blue Tribe on iTunes by chance when I was looking for another album. Blue Tribe is like early Enigma and Deep Forest but way better. Deep Buddha is great for relaxation, meditation and even belly dancing. Deep Buddha remixed is also amazing. If you check out some of their other albums, they have tracks from other cultures like Egyptian and Native American.This is a must have for anyone who likes the New Age / World genres, as well as any blossoming Shaman, Light Worker, or Bodhisattva.Enjoy.
The Rogue Element produces the sound I've been looking for again since Crystal Method's "Vegas!" I'm thrilled I've come across this artist!
This whole album is great. I've owned it on CD for years. However, I have one point of contention, Amazon. Why the heck do you have it labeled "Easy Side Militia"?East Side Militia
This album's got that fire you can only find deep in the heart of Jamaica!!!
I just discovered RiverTribe and this is really great music.  I was looking for "digeridoo" music, and this music by Rivertribe is really wonderful with a great combination of sounds.
I remember this song from when I was in high school... it is STILL the jam and a party staple in certain spots.  But I had the hardest time finding it until now... and with so much on the internet, I was beginning to wonder if I had dreamed the song! Now I see I was just looking in the wrong places for it. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU, Amazon!!  This is how techno began, back when I liked it!
This is the album I've been looking for. It is PERFECT to leave on while entertaining or just lounging around. The track are not bland or repetative, and after a few listens, I found myself subconciously humming along with a few! I'm not good at describing music like the other fancy music critics, but I can say that I really enjoy this album!***UPDATE:I've had this album now for quite a while, and it has made its way right up to the top of my playlist. Each song is fun, unique, and just plain perfect for lounging to. I've played it now at quite a few dinner parties and I always have guests asking about the songs playing. I love it so much I've even made ringtones and alarm wake-up MP3s from the songs for my cell phone! I hope they release more albums just like this one!
No, I'm not kidding about the title. Everything on here sounds like it came straight out some anime dream from heaven. I'd give this album ten stars if I thought I could get away with it. Buy it by it buy it buy it you won't be sorry.
I have had a fragment copy of a track so mellow and relaxing as to be the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard.  I never knew how I ended up with it or who it was by or what it was called.  Now I know it is Between Thoughts by Deepak Ram.  This makes my year to finally find it and hear the whole track and actually buy the album.  Do yourself a favour and listen to the track sample.  You won't regret it, guarenteed.
I love this album! The sounds is mellow, but dynamic. It makes for good active listening or background music, I use it at work a lot when I want to listen to something instrumental.
I enjoy every minute of every song in this album. As an Iranian, I like to support good artists like Ebi; so I purchased this album. You may find illegal copies, as I found myself; but I purchased it. Good job Ebi!
I first discovered this artist's music over youtube and instantly fell in love. I searched quite a bit to find more and was thankful to find it on Amazon. Great variety of melodic tracks with really tight breaks. Love it!
This duo is EVERYWHERE! You hear them in background tracks for movies, TV, you name it! They have done music for TV shows like &#34;Sex and the City&#34;, &#34;American Idol&#34;, &#34;Touched By An Angel&#34;, and worked with Paul Van Dyk, Peter Gabriel, Nelly Furtado and numerous others.
If i could put my thoughts into music this is what you would hear.I would love to sit with these guys and mess around in their studio. This is one of Invisible Records greatest ventures since Pigface itself IMO. If you like electronic manipulation in any way, shape or form, De-Frag is a must.
In Flagranti is a gritty mix of sex and disco; choice samples off of dirty vinyl records and funky dance beats with an excellent array of vocalists. It's anachronistic in the best way possible. Half of the tunes sound like they were plucked right from the 70s, lost for four decades on the basement floor of some tiny record shop, and then rediscovered.Interestingly, the "band" consists of a producer and a graphic designer. Following the Roxy Music model, the cover art and the general design image of In Flagranti is integral to the music and the artistic statement as a whole. In fact, the singles that will eventually make up the albums start out with the covers. Once the cover is designed, then the producer takes over crafting music inspired by the retro porn images. It is for this reason that owning In Flagranti music in digital form is totally unacceptable. You are literally missing half of the artistic work.The music is strange; it is at once compelling and somewhat rudimentary. The production is primitive, but I believe this is by design. The songwriting doesn't adhere to the conventions of dance music in all cases - there are occasional shifts in tempo without warning, in the middle of songs, strange beat shifts, and abrupt transitions. The CD plays like an old mixtape, but with some glitches and some erroneous transitions.The one thing this music is, is fun. The music is colorful and vibrant, sexy and salacious, up-beat and down-and-dirty. It's also not for those that are easily offended. There isn't a great deal of profanity or anything, but the general themes (as if you couldn't tell from the name of the band) are fairly adult in nature. It's a lot more subtle than, say, Lords of Acid, but it's definitely there.In Flagranti doesn't really sound like anyone else out there. If you're an adventurous listener and you love unique dance music, check this out.
I absolutely love music with samples.. This compilation does a great job of satisfying that (now if only I can find THX - Sedation, or Konzept doing The Last Night (Nuclear Winter remix)...).. That's how I found it, originally-- searching for Konzept..This compilation harkens back to my early high school years, listening to MARSFM 103.1 here in Los Angeles.. This is the perfect soundtrack for them..Don't hesitate-- this is a great compilation.
If you like sophisticated jazzy melodies and harmonies, sensual music for dancing with a partner or alone with a drink in your hand at the end of the work day, try this one out.
An inspired mixer sends V into a swirl of echo chambers and midnight synthesizers and acid beats. Whole discos are put to her torch. Dance floors become hot coals for lost souls. And glittering globes spin with fire.A Little Bit of Pain, yeah right.  "It's real all right ... it's damn real."
Although this album is in Portuguese, and i don't understand anything (google translate has been my friend), i feel the music, the stories behind the lyrics and the overall essence of Anselmo Ralph! I can't get enough! Keep the good music coming! I'll be awaiting your English, US debut! GOOD LUCK!
If you like dub - this is the pinnacle. Really cool, not repetitive energetic and yet achieves an unobtrusive ambient mood. Why are you reading this when you could be listening to Aberglabe...
Great collection of techno/pop that is uniquely  Japanese; upbeat and eclectic. Beats you weren't expecting and deceivingly simple melodies that take over and spiderweb through the songs until they crack.
Marc,Your CD "Rhodes Ahead" is the definitive synthesizer blue print for us synthesizer wanna be's. From Chris Jasper of the Isley Bro.'s, Larry Dunn Of Earth, Wind & Fire, Kashif(B.T. Express), Stevie Wonder, Marc Cary, Roy Ayers, Erykah Badu,& Outkast, y'all put the sythesizer back on the map. I'm right behind ya'll...SG_7...A'ight then, In a minute...
I love the traditional Christmas songs as much as everyone else.  I also love innovative ways people take things &#34;of old&#34; and put a new twist on them.  This album has a funky-ness that makes these renditions fun.  I think this is fun anytime, and I think it's perfect for a Christmas gathering as background music.
This may not be to every person's taste, but I found it to be upbeat and a delightful alternative to the usual inundation of jingly bells and crooning voices that come with traditional Christmas music and, for me, gets old fast. These manage to hold on to a Christmas feel while feeling updated. They are perfect for putting on while running errands, doing chores or driving around. I really enjoy this album.
Much in the tradition of Sly Wicked and Slick or vintage dub masterpieces by King Tubby, this Sly & Robbie effort recorded live and acoustic at Bob Marley's Tuff Gong studios demonstrates that the Riddim Twins have lost none of their dubwise abilities to play live in the studio. The spontaneous feel of the sessions is nicely enhanced by mixing wizard Godwin Logie who choses to chisel the sound lightly rather than go all out on the dub effects. A true gem featuring Mikey Chung on guitar, Ansel Collins and Robbie Lyn on organ and keyboards, Sticky on percussion and Dean Fraser and Stepper on sax, perfect. Sly Dunbar is enjoying himself, looing for new patterns on several tracks while Robbie Shakespeare illustrates why he's the greatest bass player on this planet. SUPERB
I know, blasphemy! Sure,Verve Remixeddid it first, but "Rewound & Reworked" ultimately does it better! First off, this compilation selects more obscure, less obvious jazz tracks like Louis Armstrong's "I Want A Big Butter And Egg Man," "Wack Wack" by Young-Holt Unlimited and "Song for My Father" by Horace Silver. I'm willing to bet you've never heard any of these!Secondly, the female artists really shine on Volume 1 of R&R; series: every single track by the women is remarkable. The Rhythm Slaves bang up Carmen McRae's "All the Things You Are," equaling anything on Verve Vol 1. and even surpassing the best remix of the 3 Verve sequels, "Baby, Did You Hear?" off Vol. 3. Other stand outs include a heavy-horned "Old Devil Moon" by Lena Horne and a deep-dub "Shoo Shoo Baby" by Dinah Washington; compare it to the Andrew Sisters' swing version from 15 years earlier (Shoo Shoo Baby) and it will blow your mind!Thirdly, this CD keeps its steam from cut 1 through cut 15. On every Verve Remixed volume songs start out quite spiky and funky, then peter out through repetition and laziness until you'd swear that 2 or 3 of the tracks aren't even "remixes" -- but the originals simply remastered for clearer sound. "Rewound & Reworked" EVOLVES, each song trying to best the one before it, until you have a percolating party that  never simmers down!If you like anything you heard on the Verve Remixed series, you owe yourself this delightful download and its rousing, male-oriented companion, "Rewound & Reworked - Jazz Remixes Vol. 2" (best tracks: "If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight" by an almost androgynous-sounding Louis Armstrong (!), Dizzy Gillespie's staccato "On The Sunny Side Of The Street" and the swinging "A Go Go" by Perez Prado).
This classic album from the Sacramento band Mind Club, has held up the test of time.  Its groovy base lines, melodic guitars, inspiring key just lul me into a sense of pure awesome.  Highly recommend Soul Sex Worship.
This is typical 'classic' Lemon Jelly, but possibly the pinnacle of their 'chocolate box' happy pop. If you listen to this song and you don't smile, there's something wrong with you. This song is what the 5 star rating was invented for.
Very good mix of old and new.  I didn't discover this music until right after Christmas.  No worries, I'll be ready for next year.
I really love Christmastime, and although I love the classic songs, I really enjoy hearing them done in a different way.
This remix of some of the best christmas songs we all know and love is so versatile. I listen to it all December long! It's perfect to listen to at my desk at work, in the car sitting in holiday traffic, at home baking or having drinks with friends. I recognized a few tracks this past year playing in some stores in the mall. My favorite track is #6, Winter Wonderland. The Brazilian beats transports me to a warm sunny beach, making it a whole lot easier to deal with the stresses that the holidays can bring.
This was one of my earlier Amazon downloads.  I heard the Bing Crosby Happy Holidays Beef Wellington Remix on Pandora (when it was still cool to listen to Pandora) and found this song.  I purchased the whole album and could not be happier as I have found many other Christmas songs remixed.
A switch up from all the regular music.  Reminds me of when I walk into VS and I always wonder where did they get this cool song from??
This is a very refreshing and hip new take on classic Christmas songs. I first heard the Happy Holiday (The Beef Wellington Mix)  during this past Black Friday weekend in Target. Of course I didn't know what the name of it was so I perservered on Amazon's awesome website and lucked up! Happy Holidaaays!
This CD is a refreshing twist on Christmas classics-it really made our holiday! If you're looking for a change we highly recommend this CD
I love the movie & I LOVE the soundtrack. I have it on blast a lot while I'm out & about.
This is such a moving piece of music by Nyman.  I fell in love with The Piano when it came out years ago and wore out a cassette tape listening to it!  I just had to replace the tape with 1 CD and now a second - absolutely WONDERFUL!
I've been searching for this for over 4 years. I had the cd back in 95 but sold it so I could buy some vinyl. What a mistake that was, these tracks have haunted me for s years as I struggled to remember the cds name. All I knew was the cover art, black with a white butterfly. I'm very happy to have this back in my life!
One of the premier Funk groups of the 70s & 80s.  Along with Parliament, Bootsy Collins, War, Confunk Shun, Rufus & Chaka Kahn, EWF, Prince, James Brown, Sly & The Family Stone, etc.
If this was one of Machito's last records it should go down as one of his best. The arrangements were far beyond it's time. He (Machito) not Eddie Palmeri discovered Lalo Rodriquez and this was his debut as a vocalist. His range is not or even been matched since. If you don't own this recording shame on you it is truly a masterpiece by the Maestro and founding father of Afro-Cuban music.
It was so hard for me to find this band. Great electronic music with some variety to it. Real edgy and fun.
My guess is that most lifelong Iggyphiles are completely unaware of this mashup between Mr. Osterberg and Ms. Peaches. First impression: my jaw literally dropped. &#34;Kick It&#34; is a minor masterpiece and should be an essential part of any Iggy fan's library. Over and out.
Talent.  That's one way to describe it...or the feeling you get when you listen to a really good singer/songwriter sing that song that's closest to their heart.  Greg grows the bamboo, makes flutes out of the bamboo he grows, and then makes albums like this with the flutes as the star performers.  Simply unbelievable.
One of my favorite albums to listen to for background creative music. I LOVE it while painting, working around the house or taking a bath. The lyrical flute music takes you to another place...
Great music from the legendary Three Degrees.  Val, Helen and Viki did a great job with the vocals and they look late80's cool.  They were and are all beautiful women.  Viki Wallace still records did a great track just this year.  Val and Helen still pleasing audiences with their beautiful and mature vocals today.  Great buy for any 3D fan.
These are excellent Classical Indian Bhajans. My favorite is Varde Veena. It will take you to a meditative mood.
Although I am not Persian I must confess that after listening to him for yearsI would not doubt that after "all the data" were in from all the other countriesof the world, his voice would be the one consistently appearing at the top. NowI am serious collector of music, and having savored the best tenors and baritones fromevery corner of the earth, it is his voice that wins each time. If I had notheard and loved at least 80 great singers from the globe, I would not dare make thisclaim since I would be simply "emoting". Ebi is quite simply Iran's greatestmusical treasure, a voice that appears in this world only from time to time.His voice will not send your cat running out of the room the way so called"operatic geniuses' do. No it is pure magic through and through, magnificent in itsthorough naturalness and engaging poignancy. One thinks of the great Cantors likeZion Ben Miller or Moishe Kousevitsky or the likes of Italy's Gigli or Scotland'sAlasdaire Gillies or India's Manna Dey and their ability to give their songsan indefinable but unmistakable something ELSE.
I GREW UP LISTENING TO HOUSE MUSIC!! IT'S FUN, U CAN EXERCISE, JOG, RUN, DANCE TO THE BEAT, ITS WAY BETTER THAN ALL THAT HIP HOP RAP, IT'S OK BUT IT'S NOTHING COMPARE TO HOUSE!  I'M OLD SCHOOL, I STRONGLY FEEL THAT MUSIC AIN'T THE SAME WHEN I WAS GROWING UP! I AM A MUSIC LOVER BABY! R&B, HOUSE,  A LITTLE JAZZ, GOSPEL, RAP, ETC. THAT'S IS MY STRONG OPINION!!
CyberAge, Cybertracks, and The Virtual Audio Project are all compilations from different artists that try to create great mix of Soundscape, Ambient, and Electronic music. My favorite track on this album is Cold Fusion by Eclispe 8.
Yeah, very much this is an Awesome single by an Awesome band. Lemon Jelly delivers again in a thrashy, dance, (downtempo you can actually mosh to lol), or if that's not your thing, the old skool vibe on &#34;Baby Battle Scratch&#34; brings great nostalgia to the ears of any old school(Kurtis Blow, Sugarhill Gang, or Grandmaster Flash)hip hop heads. Hey!
I would recommend this CD to anyone that loves music. The music, lyrics and quality are so beautifully done it is worth the listen.
Vibrasphere delivers a rich and complex tapestry of music from house to chillout with this release.  It's a great album for dance, workout, or just kicking back and relaxing.  Check out the spacey intro track "Soul Wire," as well as the excellent transitional bassline on "Manzanilla."Try their other albums, "Archipelago" and "Exploring the Tributaries," both available as MP3 downloads here at Amazon.com.You should know that at the time of this review, Amazon lists two Vibrasphere albums titled "Lime Structure."  This one (currently $6.99) is the correct version; the track contents on the other are mislabeled and in the wrong order.
Lime Structure is an album that compels you to listen closer as the tracks unspool and hang on the air in the room as though ready for the loom's magic. There are adequate ambient sensibilities here to create a considerably lush listening experience, while the unbridled rhythmic energy proves to be as kinetic as the pulse of a dancer, unselfconscious. You just might look at the world in new ways. Somebody might see something new in you.
Great sounds n fantastic arrangements by all, The tracks just speak on their own n take you in to a new vibe. One you listen to for hours on end. Thanks Guys,Chuck Barrett
Digital, but is so worth the cost to a museam of consciousness, love itIts more than a alblum its a esy to live
Outstanding Artist!!. Tried to purchase Feelin' Me and it takes me to another artist (Jesse Saunders) . What good is amazon. Trying it somewhere else
Great music! Too much of the trance music today is interrupted by bridges and &#34;pauses&#34; in the music, IMHO. This music is great for getting into the &#34;groove&#34; of it.
Armando Maral , is famous worldwide for his recordings and works with the most important names of the Brazilian music as Ivan Lins, Djavan, Joo Bosco, and also Paul Simon, Pat Metheny among others. In this work Maral explores the Samba, Bossa and Jazz together with the magic rhythms of his percussion. Not to be Missed !!!
Exellence in every way. Sit down, pump up the volume and just enjoy, this is awesome work. Some of my all time favourites
This album initially felt unfamiliar to me, but over the years it has grown to be one of my favorite albums of my entire collection, together with his previous masterpiece Daydreamer (only available on iTunes for some strange reason). 'Any Minute Now' and 'Fire Engine Girl' have an emotional strength similar to the best works of Mike Oldfield and Vangelis, and the somewhat oddball "Ein Ein Funf' is an absolute delight that I never will get tired of hearing. Unbelievable quality in one single album. I'd recommend it over and over and over.If you like this you should also giveOmnioma try, it's his latest release, and I just can't get enough of it!
Martin Lindhe a.k.a. "Bassic" has created a unique electronic atmosphere with defining bass beats that transcends current electronic rock. Definitly try this one!
Kani is a world class track, but its one of those older tracks that didnt get a lot of play time. For those diehards like me who know the track its pretty special. Big thumbs up for this track!!
I stumbled upon Vibrasphere through networking with other trance DJs (they know someone I know, blah, blah)After checking out Exploring the Tributaries I ended up buying two other albums by Vibrasphere, including this one.If you're into Solar Fields, Timo Maas, Enigma, Hybrid you'll really enjoy this.It's a great blending of progressive, breaks and ambient styles.
This is my favorite Wizzy Noise album.  I have all the others (i think) and this one has my 3 favorite tracks by them:  Paradise lost and Demented Drum parts 1 and 2.  Heavy, driving, techy psytrance that always gets the dancefloor moving.
Keep It Comin' Love took me right back to riding the Himilaya at the Fair.  This is a fun collection of KC and the Sunshine Bands tunes that keeps me smiling and dancing through any tedious chore.  Got 'My Boogie Shoes' on and ready to 'Shake Your Booty'!
This is a great collection of fun music. Always makes me &#34;shake my booty!&#34; Great to put yourself in a great mood.
I bought this for my dad and I to play in the car as part of a cd. I downloaded it from Amazon and it is great!!! My father listens to the songs every time we are in the car and we both sing a long!!!  A lot of fun to listen to and great sound quality... This is a good version to own.
I downloaded this album because my 3-year-old grandson was totally enthralled the first time he heard &#34;Shake Your Booty&#34;, and kept asking for it.  Now we listen to it at night and have a dance party with all of our grandchildren!
For those who are unfamiliar with either this duo or Goa/psytrance in general, I find it difficult to find a better starting point than this one. Even the mellower movements in this album have the kind of driving energy you would expect from more dance-oriented trance. It certainly holds up to repeated listening, and it will open your mind to new worlds of sound. This is the most emphatic 5 star rating I have ever given. Pure, unadulterated genius.
Absolutely loved the entire digital cd and how fast and east it was to order. A great music choice to relax to.
I was looking for an album that had the heart pounding beat of the Matrix and I found it in this album. There are sounds and feelings in this album I have never heard before...the music moves you. Listen to Space Love and Another One and you will be hooked. I am not sorry I purchased this CD.
I love Dubtribe and this album is my favorite.  It's all chill groove with smooth funk sounds that come together perfectly.
I discovered MFG through the work of John 00 Fleming.  This is a fantastic album that is certainly not for those who want happy kiddie mainstream trance.  Psy trance is far darker and more complex than the stuff you probably hear at most raves.  If you are not familiar with psy trance, I recommend checking out John 00 Fleming's "Euphoria" albums.  If you already love psy trance, this album and MFG's first release, "The Message", would be great additions to your music library.  If you have to pick between one or the other, I'd go with this one.Note that this album is a collection of individual songs.  It is not mixed like most DJ albums you are probably used to.
definitely recommend this album. Amorphous is my fav song ;-) there are many goa albums out there like guitars on mushroom, but this one is up there with them. if you don't know what goa aka psy trance is, try it out with this album ;-)
This is by far the best psytrance album i own. Have nothing but praise for it. I recommend this over Fast Forward to Rewind and To The Limit (which are both excellent).
I love this song. When I hear it, it makes me smile! And, it's one of the reasons I enjoy watching the movie B*A*P*S to hear it at the end.
This album kicks so much tail, I can't believe it's been sitting here for almost four years without a review. For shame!So here's Dev/Null in a nutshell...Grindcore filtered through a Sega Genesis and heavily laced with breakbeats, beatboxing (yeah I said it), turntables and Casio goodness. It's like a product of the late 80s that's been remixed by aliens from the future.A definite must for fans of Nero's Day at Disneyland, Drumcorps, Sickboy, and pretty much everything else on the Cock Rock Disco label.If you're not sure about making the investment in Lazer Thrash, go to the Cock Rock website and get Dev/Null's jungle megamix and the Necrobestial Sadobreaks EP. They are both free and will blow your mind! Then piece it back together and head over here for this little underappreciated gem of mad overheated BPM nastiness.Bon appetit!
