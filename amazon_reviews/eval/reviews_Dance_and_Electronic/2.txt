Wow! - I hate to admit it, but I purchased this "full length" album on vinyl shortly after it came out because... I loved the artwork! - I had no idea what the music was going to be like, but I got it for a good price and thought if nothing else I'd hang it on the wall for artwork! - Being a part-time DJ there was an establishment that I played on a regular basis that during a certain time of the night these people were up for just about anything... So one night, I slipped on what I considered the best track of the album (Lithium by Alex Cima) and they went nuts! They loved it... I have been searching for a re-release of this album (all nine tracks) on CD for awhile now and thought I hit the jackpot until I noticed that, in my opnion, they have cut all of the "better" tracks from it and released it as an EP... I guess I'll keep my vinyl!!
all the tracks have a random sampling rate1 track had no more than 50 kbs
I was deeply disappointed with this version of the soundtrack. I have the original soundtrack on tape, but I wanted to put it on my ipod so I bought this digital CD. I have to give it a sharp boo. Many of the songs are played completely different. However, the worst thing in my opinion is that the songs on this CD do not have nearly as much dimension and emotion as the original CD. I would say buy the original from someone and load it to your MP3 player manually. Note: if you are looking for something more conventional the newer version might be for you. If you want the music that you listened to over 15 years ago you will probably be disappointed with the new version.
I cannot play this in my stereo CD player or car.  I was trying to replace a CD we lost in a fire, and i am disappointed.  :-/
I thought these were actual mixes of songs, not just bits and pieces.Oh well, my bad. I guess I need to read the description more closely.
This is an electro fashion record. You'll love it the first 2 times through and then it will get boring. It's just not interesting enough to the ear to listen to repeatedly. Also, the political views on it are just unsophisticated and underdeveloped. They are headed in the right direction, but demonstrate only a sophomoric understanding of more complex issues such as the oil crisis.
While this review has nothing to do with the song, I can't believe Amazon is **selling** a 128 kb/s song....I can buy 384 kb/s or even .wavs (unconpressed) elsewhere for the same price. 128 bitrate reminds me of MP3.com freebies from the early 2000's.  If I downloaded for free you get what you pay for.  When I pay for it I do expect better quality.Disappointed.
Bought this based on glowing reviews here on Amazon.  Hmmm...I don't get it.  The whole CD is just annoying noise.  I LOVE nice cello music, but this cannot be called "cello music".  I guess its all the discordant notes that bothers my head and just becomes irritating.  Honestly, one play of the CD left me with a headache.  I was expecting something very different.  Not my cup of tea, altho maybe its yours(??) I'm going back to my Liquid Mind CDs for something peaceful and soothing.
i bought this on recommendation to help me desensitize my dog to the sounds of a thunder storm. it didnt even phase the dog even at the highest volume. when a real storm came thru he was his usual scarey cat that he is. i am very disappointed.
I like the radio version better than this. I wish I can return this & get the one that sound better. I just about hear or understand the words of the song.
Beautiful orchestrations but the gravely voice does not compliment the music. Perhaps needs some auto-tune?? I had great hopes but was nothing like I had expected.
I really like the instrumental &#34;Clubbed to death&#34; songs by Rob Dougan,  however when I purchase it , I thought I was buying the single.  What happen I bought the whole CD.
I bought this, not for the Hi-Lo's, but for Billy May. Well, Billy's band charts are the only saving grace. Unless you're a fan of over-written, overly complicated vocal arrangements that totally bury the original songs, this isn't an entertaining album it all. In fact, it's damned annoying! I doubt if I'll ever listen to the whole thing.
I listened to one track on pandora, it was the best track. i guess its not bad and this guy probably makes more money selling music than I do but the rest of the album just doesn't have the same vibe as the one song i liked
i was surprized when i bought this cd, this is the first negative review I've ever had to write about a nine inch nails cd.i have loved all of nine inch nails' instrumentals so i figured it would be awsome.unfortunetly it wasnt, ghosts is a creative work, but for all intensive purposes, its useless.i expected a long, flowing, beautiful collection of insturmentals, what ghosts is is 36 compleatly different tracks that flow as smoothly as motor boat on a gravel road.what the other reviewers said is correct, individualy most of these tracks are unique and enjoyable, but trying to memorize what each different ghost track sounds like and listen to them seporatly is almost not worth the trouble.right now i just listen to the upbeat tracks while playing videogames, im not sure what to do with the rest of the songs though.I have high hopes for the next ghosts album, i just hope it will flow a little better.better luck next time trent
Remember when an NIN meant you were getting an album with standards. Remember when Trent Reznor use to create great music. Well those days are long gone. I guess Trent things that being artist is forcing his fans to listen to bits and pieces of songs that were left on the editing floor. My god! I can't believe that the same man that created The Fragile, The Downward Spiral, and Pretty Hate Machine would a)consider this album up to his standards b)release such an abomination c)think that people would want to hear this mind disturbing "music" d)charge people to listen to it. Yes I know that the cost of this album isn't much, but as an artist to charge even a penny for this means that Trent Reznor has become something that I never thought he would do: sellout
Ghosts is a wide array of music, emphasis on music, as there are no vocals on this CD.  It is great for background music but I rarely see myself using Trent and the band for elevator music. Only a couple of the songs are really memorable.  While this is the most recent NIN disc available in stores, many assume it has some of the recent songs heard on the radio and internet on it, such as, Disipline, Echoplex and The Four of Us are Dying.  These songs are all from NIN's newest album, The Slip.  Unlike Ghosts I-IV, that album is loaded with full vocal tracks and the sort of dark, gritty songs that helped Reznor and NIN make their name.  The confusion is generated because The Slip, while brand new, is only released via free download at the NIN Official Site.
Highly indulgent release of ambient industrial instrumentals prove that not everyone should be completely free from label restraints. Reznor completely plays into the fanbase with this one, rarely constructing a track out of 36 that rises above mere NIN production exercise.
I know a lot of people are going to like this. They are hardcore fans. I think this CD is by far too redundant at times and at other times lacks coherency. The songs mostly sound alike. When they do change it is abrupt. It is hard to distinguish one Ghost from the others sometimes. I really wanted to like this because I am a pretty big fan of NIN, but this deserves a pass if you are new to NIN. One thing I do look forward to is DJs getting their hands on this and remixing them. I think with some tinkering the songs could come alive. As is, the songs are listenable, but not something that is going to keep my attention.
Kind of disappointing. Most of this release sounds like things Trent would normally have put between songs as spacers. It just doesn't go anywhere. If you need things for your sample library it's a great download otherwise I would skip it as a "fanboy only" release.
I appreciate what Trent tried to do by avoiding the record labels, but this is lacking. It is essentially a collection of noise and single riffs. Not much in the way of actual songs. Half of the tracks are little more than noise that don't lead anywhere. Might be good for background music. The next album "The Slip" is much better.
I am a huge NIN fan, and fan of Trent Reznor in general.  I've been enamored with Year Zero since its release.  Ghosts, however... is in a word... BORRRINNNG.  Hard to believe Trent is even capable of creating something so lifeless, so expressionless.  What exactly was the point of releasing this?  Just to prove a point?  I believe so.
Anyone who is into producing music knows how little effort this took.  Since The Downward Spiral, NIN has gotten worse & worse.  "Gee, I'll muck around in the studio for 5 minutes and call it a song!"  A few of the tracks with actual drum programming are decent, but not many.
To give a sense of perspective for the purposes of this review, I have spent many years as a Nine Inch Nails fan and I've attended several of their concerts. I consider "The Fragile" to be the prime-ultimate Nine Inch Nails work and, in fact, one of the great albums of modern music history. Considering all of this, I was surprised by what I heard upon first listening to this new offering."Ghosts I-IV" should definitely be filed under the title of ambient music. I, like several others, immediately heard similarities between this album and the Aphex Twin ambient albums. To put it bluntly, "Ghosts" is a stark departure from previous Nine Inch Nails work. It has little of the climactic crescendo's which are a Trent Reznor trademark. Nor does this album contain the kind of deep, enthralling soundscapes that can be found in songs such as "Leaving Hope" from the Still album. The growing clamor of the song "Just Like You Imagined" off of "The Fragile" (as made famous by the '300' trailers) is non-existent. Also, the stunning beauty of "La Mer" (also from "The Fragile") is absent as well. The music on "Ghosts" doesn't leave the listener with the same haunting feeling that can be experienced when listening to most of Trent's other work.Part of the reason for these flaws is due to Trent's choice of instrumentation. This has been a growing trend over the course of the past few albums. He has been using more electronic, keyboard-based music of late - the increasing use of which can be heard on "With Teeth" and "Year Zero". In my mind, the synthesized sounds which he has been using are different from those that can  be heard on his early albums. The sound is too refined... too perfect. Part of the charm of "The Fragile" was the raw, unapologetic, and even imperfect sounds created using a whole host of classical instruments such as Violins, Cellos, Pianos, etc. The sounds created on "Ghosts" sound altogether inhuman. It sounds as if Trent created this album on the road where he had different filters for his portable keyboard.The songs on this album are as ambiguous as the individual titles suggest. They are wholy unremarkable and lacking of any real narrative or compelling aural concepts. When an interesting musical theme seems to emerge, it is prematurely ended much of the time.One reviewer pointed out that it sounds like the "guys" have taken this album in a new and exciting direction. I completely disagree based upon the fact that it hardly sounds as if any "guys" had much of a hand in making this album. Instead, it sounds like the product of a possessed, depressed Casio keyboard.To be fair, this album may go over well with fans of ambient music. I read an interview with Trent a few months ago where he mentioned that if he felt that his writing no longer fit into the Nine Inch Nails mold, he would abandon the name and create something new. With an album like this, he seems to be drifting ever further in that direction.
The bass in some of the songs is so heavy it is distorted as the needle jumps and wobbles trying to express the sound. I don't think the recording's mix was adjusted for a vinyl printing. The vinyl itself is very thin and not great quality-wise. I don't find myself listening to this record very much despite the fact that the collection of music on it is some of my favorite.
I have been loyal to Trent Reznor and his NIN projects, but this is by far a big dissapointment.  Thank goodness it was reasonably priced. I just don't find this groundbreaking at all. More canned music.  If your strapped for cash, skip this album.  Get a good one like the downward spital, or broken
I don't recommend this album to trance fans out there.. i liked about three songs very well but the rest was a man singing or a women and the mood of the cd seemed very well staged and fake.. sorry to the artists that comprised this album but i wasn't very happy with my purchase!! I did really enjoy the rain stars eternal song though song #3 It was great... I supposed you would have to listen to the album yourself to really judge this album.. I am just never dissatisfied with the TranceMaster series and highly recommend it to the whole world audience fans of trance music...
After loving Serpent's Garden I was disappointed by this collection because that's what it was, a collection.  So much of it I've heard before somewhere else, it wasn't the unique product that I had been hoping for.
All of the other albums made by Helios are all instrumental based, this one he decided to make it lyrically based. I really don't like the lyrics in it at all, and I don't think the instrumentals are nearly as good as the other one's; it's like he just put lyrics in place of good instrumentals. Nothing too dynamic in this album either, the only song that stood out in it for me was "In Heaven", but that's mostly just because I remember the song they are covering from the movie Eraserhead. The rest of them all kind of sounded the same to me.I'm sure plenty of people will still like it, just make sure you preview it before you listen. I didn't do this because I figured it would be along the same lines of his other albums, and I was disappointed.
man. i want so bad to like this. i like music LIKE this, but what the crap?? it's like everyone has a HXC crazy-title-having, dont-do-anything-for-more-than-20-seconds-in-a-song-before-changing-tempos-for-no-reason, hyper-colorful-album-art "metal" band these days.there's some talent here, i think...i mean as a musician i know some of the riffs and techy junk isn't easy to play...but it's all so arbitrary. crazy for the sake of crazy, because they are trying to be like another band they like.however, this music is annoying.and the first song goes into a hardcore version of inspector gadget's theme song. it's so embarrassing...so not cute. not clever. not anything.they over-highlight the girl's voice like they have some popstar they need to lime-light, but it's reeeeeaaaaaally embarrassing to listen to. currently, there's a cricket wireless commercial on tv where kids sing "R E S P E C T" on home videos. i cringe when it comes on. i cringe when i listen to this cd. the more hardcore parts have their moments of ok-ness, and track 2 actually kicks off like it's going to go someplace, but instead they do that arbitrary change-for-the-sake-of-change...you know, to be cuh-razee.i'm a little bitter. i dont get why there has to be 1 or 2 good bands per subgenre (genghis tron KILLED it early on and no one can touch them since...why emulate something so great?)
If you like metalcore you'll probably start off liking this CD then stop soon after.This band is more on the metal side and more along the lines of grindcore. Then it'll switch to soft electronica for long periods. You may not be into that.I'll start right off with why before I go into explaining. The music will start off heavy or fast with some cool time changes and/or breakdowns that will snag you then become long, quiet electronic parts and soft parts. This stuff will seem to drag on endlessly. If you like to listen in your car and have it loud to get amped up for whatever, these quiet parts will kill your mood.Now, moving on.Yes, the vocalist is a woman and some people do care about that and won't listen to music because of it. Shes talented and her singing isnt bad but I personally can't understand a word she sings. So if you wanted some catchy singing I don't think you'll find it here.The guitar work is really well and has alot of energy and the drumming is pretty neat too.Really I think the only problem people will have is with all the sudden slow parts. If you really arn't looking for that don't purchase this album. Nothing more to say.Check out some of their songs prior to purchasing this. Pick any 3 and listen to them.If you really like this band but can't get past the slow parts try their full length.I personally thought this cd was just alright. I like the full length better.
Whilst it sounds like these are not the original singers,they are.All these tracks are either re-recorded or live versions, hence they sound different to the originals we all love so much.
This is one of those reheated comps that are so commonplace from the 70s and 80s. They take the songs, keep the music tracks but edit out the original singers so that royalties don't have to be paid to them. The music here is all the same, but these are NOT THE ORIGINAL SINGERS. From that standpoint, it is false advertisting that the artists' names are on the playlist. They are NOT on this disc.Having said that, the singers who are on here are pretty good. But let's face it, when it comes to our 70s music nothing but the originals will do!
As an avid fan of Trance and Dance music, I figured for the price that this might be worth it.  It definitely hit me with "Shock and Awe" at how bad the music is.  I found 11 tracks I consider acceptable, the rest are pure junk.  Save your money, buy the top quality releases such as "State of Trance 2007" by Armin and Progression by Marcus.  Those are examples of how a compilation should be put together.This is a good lesson in how not to produce a CD.  Worst CD I've purchased (digital download) from Amazon yet.
In comparison to other mashups that I have heard, this is mediocre at best.In general I find mashups to be very fun to listen to -- there's a huge variety of interesting rock and hip-hop samples in Feed the Animals... the problem is that they are jammed together unimaginatively and without much artistry.A great comparison would be toAs Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2, and the other radio soulwax compilations by 2 Many DJs.  Feed the Animals actually uses a lot of the exact same samples and artists, though Girl Talk is much more rap/hip-hop heavy, whereas radio soulwax tends more towards sampling other electronic music and pop.A majority (but not all) of the transitions on this album are rather abrupt with hard boundaries -- it'll go beat-beat-switch, oh now I'm listening to something entirely different with no tie-in to what I was just hearing other than it has the same tempo.  In comparison, 2 Many DJs tend to creatively blend and layer the tracks into each other, and sometimes reintroduce sounds from 2 or 3 tracks ago to tie it all together.In summary, this album has a scattering of enjoyable combinations, but they are very brief, end abruptly, and are mixed into the middle of long tracks.  It would have been better to divide this album up into 30 or 40 tracks so that we could excise the small clips that actually work -- the album doesn't play as a cohesive composition anyway.
First, you need to know I'm an old guy. I'm talking COBOL programmer old. Based on a tweet I read, "Retrofitting the Future" was supposed to be great music to write code by. For me, that means music that is present without being distracting. This ain't that. What it is is sort of Industrial Ambient Dance with an annoying guy yacking in your ear over the top. Think early NiN behind some geek mathematician doing a stream-of-consciousness rap about pi. If that's what you use to code, go for it. I'm going back to my old Pink Floyd and Steely Dan.
For the most part, I found this EP of Flying Lotus remixes dull and uninspired. Though it contains occasional moments of beauty (i.e., "Camel") and even a couple of hooks (the chorus of "Grapesicles" for example), there is not much to sink your teeth into here. To be fair, most of the original mixes were pretty dull and uninspired to begin with, and some of the remixes included here offer improvements (again, "Camel"). However, some of the featured DJs succeed only in taking an already weak song and making it worse. The original version of "RobertaFlack," for instance, might not be so bad if the beat didn't sound like two out-of-sink records playing at once; yet Mike Slott only butchers it further by adding what sounds like a third out-of-sink beat to the mix.In keeping with the original mixes, most of the beats on this EP sound clumsily inaccessible, as if spawned in the course of a forty minute collaboration between Burial (the most overrated producer of the last decade) and a rhythmically challenged cousin of Squarepusher. Ras G's remix of "Sleepy Dinosaur," for example, which was a throwaway track to begin with, sounds so crappy you'll skip it every time, guaranteed. And that song is not altogether misrepresentative of the rest of the EP.The remixes, like the originals, are needlessly bogged down by an overabundance of grit and static, haphazardly scattered about in what can only be described as a cheap attempt to add depth and texture to the music. Taking a different approach in his remix of "Auntie's Lock/Infinitum," Quarta330 adds some melodic synth lines to the mix, but his efforts only result in a clumsy and contrived determination to sound precious. In short, most of the remixes on this EP come off sounding like amateurish, half-finished Fruity Loops projects undertaken by someone who's never picked up a musical instrument in his/her life. That said, it's still better than Burial's "Untrue" (see my review of that album--if you can tolerate more blithely insensitive criticism).
I love the songs on the cd. It is a little out there but listen to it. Still trying to dig deeper to find more like it.
This is not their best performances. I wish I had listened to each track before I purchased this album. I heard them in person and these girls are amazing. The other two albums are worth the money, but this one not so much. The performers are not the problem I think that the arrangements were done in a hurry. All but maybe two of the pieces sounded rushed.  I think if they they had stayed more true to the composer's original intentions this could have been a good album.
I bought this CD because I wanted to listen to Zulu voices, and the blurb on the back claims this is "one of the most authentic ethnic performances every produced." Perhaps I neglected the line that said "Additional music written by George Raphael," because the Zulu singing is degraded by electronic accompaniment. This is about as ethnically authentic as a plastic trinket you buy in Disneyland. The original singing sounds good, but you can barely hear it under the muck of the `additional music." Really too bad. If you want to hear Zulu voices, I suggest you look elsewhere.
Track 2 & 5 are duplicates.This is the third time I've had a major problem with Amazon's mp3 service. I shouldn't have to pirate an album after paying for just to get the correct digital information.
Mistook this for the movie soundtrack.It would help if there was some indication of what this mediocre bit of electronica was.
The UK-based Plimsouls ask, "if not now, when?" The answer is: not until you pick an original band name. This techno-house band from Bristol is unrelated to the legendary Los Angeles power-pop band of the 1980s, and though they cop the use of misspelled British slang ("plimsouls" instead of "plimsolls"), they can't beg, borrow or steal the original band's inventiveness or musicality. Apparently the band is one guy who thought up the name independently, and was told "there was a garage rock band called the Plimsouls in the sixties." A quick web search would have clued him in to the history he was stepping on, and that the band is still using their name. If you're in for some mellow dance-floor electronica, check this out. If you're looking for rock 'n' soul guitar-bass-and-drums, click through to the real Plimsouls' recent issue of a periodlive album, or dig up a copy of theirdebut. [2010 hyperbolium dot com]
Ok, first off, these guys are very talented musically.  Enough so that I downloaded the album seeing as it was only $8.99.One problem, which, surprised me, after having been to their myspace and amazon page.  This is heavily influenced Christian music.  The lyrics, unless you can handle being preached too, are VERY up front with their faith in Jesus and God and stuff. I was taken aback by this, as there is just no mention of anything of the sort, unless you read the online liner notes or lyrics they have posted at the album site, which of course I did not do until after I had purchased.If you like that, or can get past it you will probably enjoy the album a lot, but for anyone interested who is averse to being preached to in music, check out their website, and have a peek at their lyrics before you make this purchase.[...]
If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed.The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all.I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance...It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing.Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.It was better than forcing myself to listen to Rap/Hip Hop though, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1...
The beginning sounds good but of course it is just a sample just get random sounds Am I getting sort of electronic or was I getting Latin rhythm or hip hop??? just wish all these sounds were separated in different tracks
Only 183 kbps file?  Very disappointing, Amazon. And I don't want your installer program, and I don't want the file automatically imported into iTunes. If you want me to buy more music from you, Amazon, I want a 320 kbps that I can download to where I choose. Also disappointed that the file size is not known until AFTER the purchase. Bad form. If you are going to sell low quality files, offer them at half price. Be transparent about what you are offering, and let the consumer decide where the file is stored.
I'm not sure that this is for me.....I tried it, but it does not seem to help me work on pitch problems.  Perhaps for some people it would be a good tool, just not me.
Not good. It bleats on the hackneyed and expected. Speaking of the expected, I assume they will lose it on this review: someone should have told them...Nyet! Stay home, chop wood.
As stated in the title the album in my opinion is not as groovy as 1x3, or 2x3.
Loved MC Lars albums, but this collaboration with K. Flay didn't really work for me. If I wanted to listen to songs about fame and sex and parties, I wouldn't be listening to Lars. But most of the songs on this album are drawn on "traditional" hip hop themes -- that is, fame and sex and parties.Somebody's Watching Me is a fantastic song, and I wish the rest of the album was like it.
If I had a choice I would not buy this album again. If you are thinking about buying this album listen to the tracks toward the bottom.
I bought this CD because it showed up as a recommendation by Amazon and I listened to one live set on Youtube. Some commenters on here suggest that Yggdrasil is of the likes of Simon Posford.  Not even close mainly for two reasons. First, Yggdrasil lacks the variety, richness, textures, and layers of sound that Simon (and Raja Jam) are so famous for.  Yggdrasil does not even come close.  Second, Yggdrasil, or at least this Prosse Edda CD, is far behind Simon Posford in terms of production. A Simon Posford CD (Shpongle, Younger Brother) makes you want to listen from start to finish, a sort of fluidic spiritual journey, while this Prosse Edda CD simply does not do that, and instead makes the mind reset after each track.  Yggdrasil seems to want to fit the unidentifiable eccentric genre that so many seek similar to Simon Posford, but Yggdrasil falls short.
I should have listened to the reviewer who said the songs with voice were annoying because they are.  The good parts are great, but I'm listening to this to filter out noise while I work and there's a part with click clacky heels walking in one song.  I wouldn't bother with this one.  Also, it's all one long song; you can't skip the craptastic songs for the better ones.
The track for "Sleigh Ride" actually skips and contains minor speed fluctuations! By no means a "digital remaster." Even for 99 cents it's a rip-off!
There are some great artists here and very nice sound production by George Solar, but there's an unidentified woman with a sexy voice talking over the start of most of the tracks, so it sounds more like a radio broadcast.  Ruins it for me. I'm a dj and don't want to hear someone talking over my tracks.  Also, by not letting the music speak for itself, it comes across as pretentious.  I haven't heard this producer's other cds, so maybe it's a style people expect from him, but I won't be buying any more from him.
One good song, Number Two, the rest, very unoriginal very cut and paste crap.  Buy Number Two, don't waste you money on the rest!
There are so many things wrong with this album that its difficult to figure out where to start. I guess we can start with the positive side: There are hints of some great riffs on this album. I appreciate ESP listening to critique of Cartographer and going for a more high-intensity album overall. Also, Unstoppable is pure genius.Okay, now onto the problems...1) Compression - Who ever did the mastering of this CD should be shot! In the previous ESP releases, there was always headroom for when the sound got truly epic. You could always hear the individual instruments and voices clearly. Not so with Makara. Almost every track (including Unstoppable) it compressed to within an inch of its life so for the majority of each song there is no space and you are assaulted with a constant wall of unintelligible sound. Strings and horns are especially decimated by this awful mastering.2) Repetition / No Progression - This was also a problem in their Cartographer release. Go back and listen to Unearthed and you will hear how each song has structure, melody, and power that builds. I have no problem with the intensity of this record that a lot of people take issue with. In fact, I would love nothing more than an entire 70 minute album that is high-intensity. The problem is this album really only has 10 minutes of high-intensity music that is repeated over and over again. Lets take 'Varuna' as an example, there is a lot to like in this song. However it is too overly repetitious to actually be called good. Listen to the section with the punchy base and high strings. It uses the same three notes in the low end and just adds more strings in the high end over and over. If ESP had any melodic vision this section could have built to something great but instead it is boring and dissapointing. Similarly, the end of the song could have been good but instead is a single repeated refrain of one measure that is just terrible! There is no progression, no building, and the one measure they use to repeat over and over again is quite a poor choice as well.3) No Melodies - With the exception of Unstoppable and portions of Arise, this album is almost devoid of any melody. I honestly was thinking there was something wrong with my album and that it was mixed without the melody track in most songs. Most of these tracks would have been vastly improved with some structural melody element as was used in all the songs on Cartographer and Unearthed. Here we have the powerful background of the orchestra and choir but no hook or driving theme anywhere. It's like ESP designed this album to have someone else write the melodies over it.4) Classical Songs - Note to ESP: "Leave retooling classical music to The Transiberian Orchestra." The redone versions of Saint Matthew's Passion and the Moonlight Sonata are downright atrocious. There is nothing of interest in either song. A good remake would have built upon the original (much like TO did to Carol of the Bells). Not only that but to have ESP cover the Moonlight Sonata and not touch the third movement is a travesty (I should know, I learned to play all three movements on the piano when I was 14, and the third movement is truly epic). Please ESP, do not try this again5) Cheap / No Variation in Production - Listen to Unearthed or Cartographer straight through (well actually on Cartography you can skip tracks 8-14) and you will hear a impressive variety of music. The various ethnic sounds, different instrumentation choices, mix of classical, acoustic, and heavy guitars, all make for a moving experience that changes over time. Now on Makara, you almost can't tell the difference between any of the songs (with the exception of 'Lavanya'). Let me clarify, I am not against high-intensity all the way through, but I am against using the exact same combination of instruments and choir parts again and again. Where's the pan flute from Cartographer, or the Urd from Unearthed, or any of the other varied sounds I've come to expect from ESP. I'm sure using the same sounds repeatedly saved the group money on musicians but I feel like this release just sounds 'Cheap' because of the lack of variety. I have a habit of putting my workstation synthesizer on a signal sound (typically some large orchestral patch) and just coming up with themes, or riffs and recording them. I feel like ESP did this as well and then just released it as an album.What a let down. I am still holding out hope that ESP gets it together in their next release. Can you imagine how awesome an album it would be if they put something together that matches the progression of their best work? Think of an album of new songs in the vain of: Cuzco, Memouthis, Pompeii, Ashief Pi, Orannu Pi, Mosane Pi, Selisona Pi, Odenall Pi, Unstoppable. That would be incredible.In summary, Makara has only 1 great song (Unstoppable), a few good ideas (Varuna, Lavanya, Arise), and a lot of missed opportunities.
I purchased this album for my husband as the ESPosthumus album Unearthed that l bought for him with the cold case sound track is his favorite album,unfortunately this one is not as good. That was little disappointing but never mind.
Some is a bit catchy, but mostly I laugh questioning why I continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle.  Sounds like someone who has spent a bit too much time in clubs and has made some friends with good enough equipment to make a CD with her...lyrics provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out.  High quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to.
Pretty Lights album Filling Up City Skies was released in October 30th, 2008 and offers a terrific blend of soul inspired music with hip-hop that is unmatched in the industry. Pretty Lights is a musical group led by Colorado native Derek Smith and his live drummer Cory Eberhard that relies heavily on digital sampling creating music that combines hip-hop beats with a twist of soul and mesmerizing synths.  Filling up the Skies is all of this in one great album. It is a two-disk set, and I would like to focus on the first disk for the purposes of this review.  The album really shows off the versatility of the group, as it is usually known for its live performances that fill venues with energy and emotion. This album is focused towards a jazzy feel that you might expect to hear at one of the groups live shows.The album kicks off with the track Change is Gonna Come, which immediately sets the tone for the rest of the album.  It draws the listener into a trance with the rhythmic pattern of the beats and the soothing vocals.  At times, the songs can really blend together, but with the similarity throughout the album it is easy to get lost in the music.There are several highlights, starting with Cold Feeling that starts off with a slow beat then enters with a vocal that is very old school and raspy.  The song gives off a old school vibe as it builds, much like you might hear in a Louisiana jazz club back in the day.  Another highlight is Something's Wrong track.  By using a similar formula to Cold Feeling, the song starts slow but is brought in with a woman's vocals.  My personal favorite track on the album is The Time Has Come.  It offers a processed guitar sound that is really interesting and fun to listen to.  The vocals also don't seem to be clear words, but the sounds seem to be just like another instrument working in the piece.The album is very consistent, and is great for driving or while working.  It encourages head bobbing and gets your feet tapping, with the beats flowing so smoothly.  The album really gives off a wintery feeling, not only because of songs titled Summer's Gone, Change is Gonna Come and Cold Feeling, but it has an effect on the body that really induces you into a chilled out relaxed mood.The consistency of the album may be a problem for some listeners, as the songs can become repetitive.  Even as I praise Filling Up The Skies for its mesmerizing tunes, the way songs blend together may not be what some listeners are looking for.  Not all the tracks would fit in with their popular live shows, and sometimes songs can arguably lack creativity.  But I don't believe the albums main goal was to re create one of their crazy shows, rather it was meant to offer a change of pace and give Derek Smith the platform to create a story only attainable in CD format.Although at times Smith's approach can become repetitive, I believe the album is successful in its mission to give the listeners tracks that make you get in a groove.
The music is good for its nostalgic dreamy quality.  However, this being one of my first Cloud-based music purchases, finding that two out of six tracks just end in the middle of the music with no fading or anything makes this a grossly overpriced offering.
The sound quailty on this lp is so bad that I almost threw the record out the window it's too bad that the LP sounds so bad becuse the music was great...
This EP plays like a collection of unfinished song ideas that were found on the cutting room floor.  Only a couple of tunes break the 3-minute threshold, and they end abruptly and awkwardly.  The listener barely has the opportunity to get lost in the nice, atmospheric grooves before they are suddenly cut off and the next tune begins.  The lo-fi approach to the final mixing and mastering fits the style pretty well, but the low end can be downright irritating, as it peaks out and seemingly lowers the volume of the whole song with every beat.  Tragically, these annoyances keep some otherwise really nice material from becoming a great collection of songs.
Many times when a seasoned veteran of a musical genre gets reviews (sources besides Amazon are not that kind to this album) with a rating this low, it may be because the artist is growing in a direction that the audience may not like.Unfortunately, even this isn't the case for Bluetech's "Love Songs to the Source." It's a pretty substantial step backwards into musical territory that has been canvassed - well canvassed at that - by other, less musical acts more than a decade ago.The rub is, this album was released on Interchill, which is more common for this type of world music (think of something you might've heard on the Pure Moods compilations, like Mythos) than what Bluetech draws positive attention for - his at-times mindboggling chill dub that he has proven time and again he can make fresh - Prima Materia, Sines and Singularities, Phoenix Rising, even his alter ego's "Dreamtime Submersible" and "Borderlands" show what he can do in different ways.In many ways, listening to Love Songs to the Source is a bad case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu - you pretty much know what's coming around each bend and you've heard it before."Waiting for Initiation" and "Polychrome Petroglyph" are among my favorite tracks. Of course, these are the ones that sound more at home on one his releases on Aleph Zero. The good news is I think after this album, Bluetech is going to be poised for an exciting return, hopefully of the Aleph Zero variety.
Sorry but this album was a disappointment.Most tracks are a bit too simple for my taste.Tracks 8, 9 & 10 are good.
I still continue to like '1453' a lot more than 'Concorde'. I find 'concorde' tunes very mundane as compared to the truley amazing tunes of his '1453' CD. I'd not rate 'concorde' as a great buy! Sorry but my refined sense of music does not permit to me to rate the 'Concorde' CD as great. I missed the 'mystic' sense that I've now learned to associate with Can Atilla's work becuase '1453' was the first of his work that purchased. 1453 is and experience of being in heaven/bliss while 'Concorde' is ground level experience!
The collision that occurs between vocals and the musical rifts occur throughout the album.  Fantastic musical rifts.  However, I am no fan of the vocals, and what they represent.  Drop the vocals and overdub with classical vocals, this album might be worth the money.
Doesn't seem to have any direction. Keeps repeating the same few beats over and over and over again. Not really as exciting as it might have been. Sounds like someone was rushing this to put it on a CD by a deadline.
I instantly have buyers remorse : (If only I didn't buy this for the one song off the xbox game.... so stupid i am
They sound like a fun and happy group.  I'll bet they are a ton of fun live.I guess, for me, it suffers from them being too good.  My favorite music is full of energy and drive and you can just hear the struggle of the group getting &#34;the&#34; sound.  I can't explain it any other way, but a group of folks just coaxing every ounce of passion from their instruments, a vocalist who is feeling those lyrics so much they can barely contain themselves to get it onto the track... that is what draws me to LOVE a band.CoT don't have that.  What they do have, I just don't care for much.  Gogol Bordello for my &#34;gypsy&#34; fix.
I listened to the music several times and there did not seem to be that much variety to the music being played
Maybe this is an album for DJs.  There seems to be extended intros and outros on every track.  The songs are mostly not very catchy or outstanding.  John Digweed's album Transitions sets a high standard that this does not live up too despite being twice as long.
I previously perchased several Beats Antique cds. This one was not bad nor was it the best. It has a few songs that I realy liked but for the most part was kind of slow. Cool cover though.
I keep hearing about how Skinny Puppy is such a great industrial band. With a crap release like this, they will never prove it. There is only one out of four tracks that I can say I enjoy and will listen to again (Punk in Park's Zoo). I kind of wish I had bought this on CD. That way I could have ripped the one song I liked and then sold the CD and recouped some of my money.
I've followed Iris almost as long as they have been around.  A Different Drum put them on Mix Rinse And Spin, almost 10 years ago now.  They still sound like themselves, but this album is putting me to sleep.
I couldn't quite put my finger on what was going on with this new Iris album, so I played it for a friend and asked him to tell me what genre it sounded like.  "Shoegaze" came to his mind first.  And indeed... "synthpop" can't quite be used to describe Blacklight, unlike their other albums.  The perkiness is gone, the urgency is gone, and the catchy melody and lyrics are gone.  In it's place is sort of drowzy electronic background noise with the lead singer sounding kind of high and lyrics that don't make much sense.  It's not a bad album, and I'll gladly listen to it, but not with the kind of elated focus I devoted to the previous release. Though at times blacklight seems more concerned with making interesting beats than good songs, I'm still wondering why all the energy seems to have been sucked out of the band. This seems more suited to a side project, and even the cover art and music video for "closer to real" come off as a little lazy.  Andrew Sega and Reagan Jones have both done A LOT of really cool things in the past, so I'm curious what inspired this one.  Who knows... maybe I am just musically jaded and Blacklight will grow on me, but for now I'm happy there's three other albums full of awesome tunes.
I wanted to like "Blacklight," I really did. I've waited more than two months to write this review, hoping the album would grow on me.  No such luck. The vocals are lost in all the programming, the lyrics are overtly Christian (when you can hear them at all), and the whole thing sounds muddy, dark and unpleasant.  I waited years for this? What a shame.  Two stars because "Marianas Depths" is OK.  I'll go back to their GREAT albums, "Awakening" and "Wrath," and leave it at that.
I am a new fan to Iris. I got the chance to see them last night on their tour with De/vision and Mesh. While at the show I decided to buy their latest album Blacklight. For a first album by the band, Blacklight isn't a band album but at the same time there really isn't anything about the music that stood out with me. Reagan Jones has a pretty decent set of pipes but his vocals tends to be monotonous though out the album. The melodies are nothing to write home about to be blunt. Blacklight sounded like your typical modern synthpop album. There just wasn't anything on the album that screamed out to me. I probably should have opted for an older album as a first Iris purchase. I certainly do plan on checking out their other albums. Blacklight is okay but I have definitely heard better synthpop albums.
I made the mistake of buying this track, since it proclaimed Stormae was the artist. Shock and horror when I played it and heard that annoying Kanye West hijacked such an awesome track. You'd be better off buying Kanye's album and listening to his garbage without Stormae in the background.
Everyone loves a litle bass, but it's starting to get old. If you've heard the rest of Lorin's mixes then you've heard them all. He is one of the better DJ's I've heard/seen but too much is just too much.
Enslaved is a pretty phenomenal experience.  I highly, highly recommend you buy it if you have a Playstation 3 or Xbox 360.  Interesting story, haunting music, fantastic performances from the likes of Andy Serkis.  Apparently it's even written or cowritten by Alex Garland...I rarely buy soundtracks, but one theme in particular is so haunting I just had to own it.  In particular, I love the song that plays on the XMB on the Playstation version before launching the game (it's also used in shorter form from time to time in the game).Astonishingly, that song isn't included in the soundtrack.  Neither is the music on the title screen, among other things.So bizarrely, while I love this game's music, and love the game itself...I have to give a negative review to the soundtrack.Some of what's here is still quite good, but none of the best stuff is...I wouldn't have bought it had I known that, and would return it if I could.
I'm a big fan of Ghostland Observatory's sound, but it's something that is borderline hokey even when it's done right. And, man, if really feels like they weren't even trying for most of this album.Many of the songs are catchy on first listen, and there are a couple that stand out, but I can't imagine giving this album more than 10 or so spins. It doesn't take us anywhere new -- it's a glossed-over rehash of their other, much better music.If you haven't bought a GO album before, spend your money on Paparazzi Lightning.
I love GLO. They have a awesome and unique sound and they put on a great show with lasers to go with their electro-rock grooves. I love them dearly, but I did not like this album. There have always been one or two songs on each album that were just "out there" but unfortunately the scale has dipped in the other direction on this venture, having more misses than hits. As a huge GLO fan, I would not recommend this album in its entirety. Just a few good songs like Give Me the Beat (probably the best song on the album), Glitter and Miracles. Personally I like Body Shop because I think its funny, but its not for everyone. You can skip the rest of the album. I downloaded the entire album for $5, so I don't feel cheated. But had I bought the actual cd  like I originally intended (but after hearing the samples I waited til it was on sale) I would have felt like it was a waste.
I just downloaded the 2010 "remastered" version of the song "With A Spirit" from the album "The Hits", and I was shocked by the over compression. The song was completely smothered by pumping and wheezing effects due to poor compression techniques. Very unprofessional approach. Whoever remastered the song had NO IDEA what they were doing. Mastering is as much art as science, and tracks can get totally messed up if you do it wrong. Mastering is much more than just compression. And trust me, I am no GOLDEN EARS audiophile. The effect is VERY pronounced, and very detrimental to the quality of the song.Because of the poor quality of the remastered version, I chose to download the original 2009 version of "With A Spirit" from the album "009 Sound System" to see if it might be better, and the difference was like night and day. The original version sounds much, much better. No extreme compression. No pumping and wheezing effect. Very good dynamics, with crisp highs and rich lows. Plus I was surprised to see that the bitrate of the original version mp3 was higher than the remastered version... 292 kbps for the original 2009 version as opposed to only 280 kbps for the 2010 remastered version.Listening to them side by side, you can definitely hear a big difference. The remastered version sounds muddy and squished. The original sounds clear and dynamic. So definitely get the original 2009 version. It is a higher bitrate file, and just plain sounds better. It is 39 seconds shorter than the remastered version, but you hardly miss 39 seconds in a 10 minute song. DO NOT get the "remastered" version if you care about audio quality!
I love the sound and the music!!!  It is awesome and the raw talent comes right through.  But MP3's are terrible quality.  The compression limits the dynamic range, and it is lossy, and I will take the album of MP3's for now, but please lay these down on digital recording.  You don't even have to use a professional studio to do so, the ability to record and produce your own CD in Digital mode is inexpensive.  I use pro XLR mic's in to a digital mixing board and record digital direct stereo mix at 24 bit, 96Khz.  Portable 8 channel are available for under $300.  I use a 24 channel board, but that is only because I mic every drum and I have a large kit. So I am digital on the board, and digital output to a separate pioneer digital recorder at 24 bit/96Khz sample. Yes, a 5 min file is 300-400MB WAV or FLAC.  You can always compress to MP3, but you can't put back what is lost.  Hope to hear more, but please put out CD quality or digital WAV. Yes, I would download the album if each file was 300MB.  I would rather it be recorded at higher quality!  THanks!Update: 2012, Oct 24:  Actually the MP3 quality is poor, and it really causes loss of the dynamics from what I saw when I viewed them live on a home theater in 5.1 DTS.  It is really lost, and hence I had to lower the rating from 4 stars to 2.  Perhaps in concert they are better?
energy drink album, found it looking for ginseng related songs...you know taurine is sedating right? that is the calming ingredient in energy drinks, prevents palpitations and stuff.
As a album representing dubstep, this stinks.  I give it 2 stars because, to me, about half the album is salvageable but not much as dubstep.  I am a hip hop lover and do like the trend of some artists adding nice bass drops and wobbles to their music, (or visa versa some dubstep artists adding some rap or hip hop to their songs.) I don't like to pay this much when I have to delete half the junk that I bought.  I did listen to the samples first, but Amazon does such a lousy job of sampling the right parts of songs and making them long enough to get a real feel for the music.  Sorry I believed the download title and fell for this disaster to the genre of dubstep.
There were a few tracks on here that I wanted, so I just figured I'd buy the whole album. Turns out, I still only liked those few songs, the other 30 were just a waste of space. Save your money and just buy what you like.
This is simple, 3 songs , that's it 3 songs out of the bunch are actually dubstep , the rest of it is some hip hop nonsense, which really sounds like well what we used to call it was TECHNO , just they threw some rap gibberish over the top, Hint to publisher; Try understanding the Genre before compiling a load of garbage which does not even fall into the category of which you are promoting it as.Disappointing waste of money,  Listen to the songs samples and buy just the ones you like, save yourself the trouble of deleting the casio keyboard crap later
I just happened upon "The Last Days of Gravity" a couple of years ago and am very happy I did.  The album is pure genius.  I was very excited when I learned that "Vaccine" was in the works and waited for its release with great anticipation.  I wish I could say something good about "Vaccine," but honestly I listened to it about 4 times and I cannot listen to it anymore because I find the vocals intolerable.  Whereas on "The Last Days of Gravity" the vocals enhanced a couple of the tracks, on "Vaccine" they are dominant on every track.  Unfortunately, Ru has a good backup voice but singing is not his greatest strength.  As the album went on I kept hoping the next track wouldn't feature vocals, but again and again I was sadly disappointed.  I listened to the album a few times because I really wanted to like it, but as I said I can not listen to it anymore.  I realize music is subjective and other people may love this new direction, but for me it is a major step backward and I will just have to be happy listening to "The Last Days of Gravity" until the next release.
Again..I was compelled to listen to preview tracks of "Omni'. Did not like the work in this CD. Find it to be very common place. I am rather impressed by Can Atilla's '1453 Sultanlar Askina' my first accidentally purchased but now a proud posession. I'd not recommend 'Omin'...not a great work in my view...and this comes from a person who is trained in Indian classical, Indian folk, Indian light music and has collected music from more than 10 countries. Instead go for Can Atilla's 1453 and also his work in the Blue Color cover CD that is advertised inside the leaflet in the jacket of his '1453' CD.
I bought this album because i'm always looking for some new electronica to expand my mind. All the great reviews made it a no brainer. I'm sorry to say this album was very disappointing. All the tracks sound the same. What's frustrating is that all the tracks have great potential with many layers and interesting sounds. Where this album goes wrong is the overuse of this abrasive, robotic sound that is very over powering. After listening to a few tracks, this sound is all I can hear. Even when a track sounds like it's going to be down tempo, here comes this brain rattling sound that keeps you from feeling anything other than annoyance. This album could have been good but ends up missing the mark.
Hmmmm what to say.  I think this next venture by PhuturePrimative is Okay at best.  Really nothing like the first album.  I really enjoyed the first album, this one I've listened to only twice.  On this record the band, in my opinion, has gotten away from its "chill" concept.  The new record is more medium tempo dance and dubstep with very little chillout provided.  If you're into a more up-tempo electronica dubstepy sounds, then this is a great record for you.  But if you're looking for something like the first record, then you will be disappointed in this effort.
I grabbed this album based on all the positive reviews it was receiving and a few of the samples I heard from the first album.  Based on what I've seen, I should have just grabbed the first album instead because this album gets way too dubstep, wobbly bass heavy for my taste.  If it weren't for all the trendy wobbly bass, they would have had a solid album here.  I do find myself trying to give it a chance every once in a while, but I can only do a couple tracks and have to change it.
I was really looking forward to this album and bought it without doing any research other than listening to the first single, "The End," which I liked.  If only I could say the same for the rest of the album.  I loved Wired and We Control.  And I salute artists attempting to flex their musical muscles and experiment - but that doesn't mean I have to like the results.The album is very uneven, with a couple of solid tracks mixed in with some *dubstep* - which I cannot stand - and some too-noisy-to-be-interesting electro.  Some of it's just flat-out awful.  If you like Hyper's previous work, it's worth just buying the tracks where you like the samples.
It reminds me of chilling out and drinking coffe on the beach.  Not what I thought it was going to be but not too bad.
Cons: it was only a portion of the song. I wish i could get my money back.Pros: it was the song i was atleast looking for.
Huge disappointment.  I am able to promote the parent album ("These Hopeful Machines") to fellow audiophiles but casual listeners are not geared for 10 minute song arcs.  I was anticipating using this as a bridge.  Unfortunately "Humble" guts the first three songs.  Their mixes/arrangements are baffling.  As tho someone imported MP3s and spliced them up in Garageband.  The transitions spike all over the place.  The remaining song tweaks are okay but many have the advantage of previous mixes.To complain more specifically, if the original "Emergency" had its final 3 minutes faded out and its first 2 minutes mixed (properly) down to 30 seconds the nature of the song would have been retained.  That would have left it at about 6 minutes."The Emergency" is my favorite song in ... years.  Past 5 at least.  The mix on "Humble" fails the song.  I will keep pointing others to the original.
I picked up this album accidentally after listening to, and absolutely loving, 2010's "These Hopeful Machines". I immediately knew something was off when the first track jarringly jumps straight into a song. The transitions between songs, and within songs themselves, are terrible! Perhaps this album will sound good to someone who hasn't already listened to "These Hopeful Machines", but I hope people read this and other reviews and buy the right one!
This album is for people with short attention spans. It is a single cd version of the two cd album "These Hopeful Machines". These abbreviated versions in some cases are very truncated and lose most of the impact of the tracks they are edited from. It's a shame, because the original versions in most cases are quite brilliantly constructed. If you are a BT fan, avoid this album and buy that one instead.
I love The Chemical Bros but not so much this one.  Many songs are very short & were probably excellent in the movie, but this did not make for good general listening pleasure, IMO.
Movie soundtracks/scores are tricky. The music itself is meant to be listened to in the film, not as an individual CD, and it doesn't always work well both ways. I think that explains the problems with the "Hanna" soundtrack. The Chemical Brothers did an amazing job with the music, which fits the mood of the movie so well and is totally what "makes" the movie. But as a standalone CD, it's just not at all as effective. The tracks don't generate the same kind of energy and excitement all on their own. Really, the only tracks I enjoyed were #4 (Devil in the Details), #7 (Quayside Synthesis), and #14 (Hanna vs. Marissa). That's not to say it isn't all great music, because it is, but I will probably never listen to this CD again because it's just not very good on its own. I will, however, absolutely love it every time I watch this movie, which will be quite often because "Hanna" rocks. :)
I have a ton of these kinds of CD's and for some reason, the pitch or something, grates on my nerves after a while...
Choice of songs are wonderful- hard to find on record or cd.  But the overall digital  transfer is poor, thus, the 2 star rating.
Never thought I'd give a BLUETECH recording a negative review, but this one qualifies. It is pretentious, ponderous, and not as enjoyable as the previous CD's In My Opinion. The female singers are both annoying. Ms. Blackstone tries WAY too hard, forcing those hellacious high notes, and cracking the glass within My head. .The Poetic Female &#34;Singer&#34; on two songs is over-elucidating silly lyrics that are snarky in their uselessness. Like a stoned Hippie grabbing for meaningful words, it is painful to listen to. Hope BLUETECH gets back on track. He creates some of the most scintillating Music out there. For Me, not on this CD though.
This CD is not bad, the production value is alright, and some of the songs are decent BUT it is not house, its contemporary disco and theres a big difference there.  Buy it if you like relaxed disco, not if youre looking for cutting edge house music.
Very east indian sounding which sounds like many other CDs... Actualy I wish I had played the samples first.  Usually I do, but Ihave bought their previous work and liked it, but not this one.
This album was alright.  I guess the first song was pretty good. After that I stopped paying attention.  These guys are no Foster the People.  Now that's some REAL music!
If you liked VoB's album Le Funk the most, there is nothing for you here. If you liked Night On Fire, again, next to nothing for you. Bring on the Comets? The final track, Over - which doesn't fit in with the rest of the album's cold, calculated dance beats - may appeal to you. Overall there a a hand full of ok songs on this album (All Summer in A Day is pretty good), but it mostly just doesn't feel like a VHS or Beta album. Very, very few guitars. They've completely abandoned their full band sound in favor of a sound somewhere between a gutless version of the presets and a less smooth version of the junior boys. I consider VoB one of my favorite bands, but the road they've chosen to travel (while I respect their right to do so) is one I will not be following them down.
I only downloaded the first tune, "On a Cloud" by PPP. The rest are average, but not worth a second listen in my book. I really have to wonder if some of the record distributors are paying reviewers to give out 5 stars on these sampler albums!
I bought this album because I downloaded "Love Here" off the last album and found myself listening to it a lot, so wanted to support the artist with a purchase. I wish I would have just downloaded a few choice tracks because this thing is nothing special. The greatest songs on here are his remixes of Ellie Gouldings "Lights", the rest are forgettable bores, he seems to rely too much on the big hitting dub step bass instead of real artistic merit.Though they do have some nice beats, they just all sound the same. To me, I can't stand when an artist doesn't mix it up and gives his/her album variety.On another note, the artist himself is a bit of of toolbag. I "like" him on facebook and he's begun to share his dumb political views. He posted a poll stating people who watch Fox News are "ignorant" and are less intelligent than people who watch regular news. Conviently the poll was done by some hippie little college in New York and he's posting that nonsense like it was gospel. Now I'm sure many of you will say "HE'S AN ARTIST AND ENTITLED TOHIS OPINION LOOOLZZ". That's great, but so am I. I just want to hear your music and not your political opinion. I wouldnt care if he was posting something about CNN, MSBNC views or liberals. I don't want to hear it. People backlashed against him and he literally cursed out anyone who disagreed with HIS view, even though it was some political hate speech.So - take this review how you will, should you buy the album? No, the music doesn't quite measure up to the last, and the artist himself is a douche. But give the tracks a listen and decide for yourself.
Leona Lewis is a powerhouse with an amazing voice. This song is extremely disappointing and generic. Also, if you listen closely some of it makes no sense! I believe she is capable of better.
A clever concept fr a song name in itself doesn't make a good song. I give this Heiko Von Schriesheim effort two stars because personally I thought it was boring.
This album would be a on a background playlist for a party instead of thumpin down the road with one awesome song.  Zoe rocks the tour, but they seem to be on the verge of just getting into the studios and mixing it up to a Bohemian lather once again.Maybe this was just a filler on their way to the next breakthrough?  :-D
not up there with Matrix, Homes and Gardens or Solutions For a Small Planet, but worth it for die hard Haujobb fans
Overall, NOT impressed. Haujobb had several years to show they are still ahead of the game. Instead, I hear demo-like tracks. I hear the influence of Daniel's remixing and playing Depeche Mode tracks. Dead Market sounds like a haujobb remix of "behind the wheel". On a positive note, I have no complaints about Architect. I think Meyer really shines in that effort.
The samples didn't do this album the terrible justice it deserved.LOVE Feed the Animals, but no, no thank you to this.
I bought 2 singles from this album: Tomorrow and I'll be waiting; both were under 201kbps in quality.Tomorrow was 174kbps, and I'll be waiting was 200kbps.I also bought the song Gravity from another album of hers, and it weighed in at 187kbps.Though I love Mini Page's music (originals), I'm very disappointed in these purchases. I've bought many other songs online, and none have been less than 320kbps.I really hope that this situation will soon be rectified, because I would like to buy all her originals.Sadly until then, buyer beware.
I did not quite like this.  It's full of too much background beatings.  Some parts, when repeated, are not clearly indicated, and it is hard to follow.
This popped up when I was searching for Ben Leinbach yoga music.  I primarily went for it because it was free.  There are some good tunes and there is some rappish stuff (I really cannot stand it that rap has crossed over into the yogic realm).  A lot of it is sappy girly vocals.
Fair warning: the credit for the track 'Sunny Day' says D-Train is on this track, but there is no vocal.
Not a brilliant collection but one or two good tracks. however the most disappointing thing was that i could not back up the CD as it proved unreadable.
It rocks!!! Buy this tune,and don`t believe the hype!! i AM A OLE` SKOOL MUSIC BUFF, AND THIS WHAT MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT!! HOLLA!!! Holla.............
you will more than likely delete more than half of the songs from this compilation. the 12 or 13 i kept are slightly above average, good enough to hold a 12 or 13 song album on their own, but all the rest is filler.
I do not enjoy listening to the music on this CD or on the computer.  Not soothing to me or my husband.
The best thing about this purchase is that each track comes unmixed along with 2 complete mixed sets.John 00 Fleming (mixed set #1) - He's one of the best in the business. His Psy-Trance Uphoria CD's are fantastic, along with his recent "Heaven & Hell" and the old but sublime "Gods Kitchen" 3-CD mix from several years back. Once again, his set is a rather impressive mix of progressive trance / psy- trance. The compilation of songs is not as impressive as other mixes, as there are some a few bland / mediocre songs here and there that disrupt the overall rhythm of the entire mix. Good, but not great. He's had better.Bryan Kearny (mixed set #2) - This set kicks off in high gear and never looks back. The BPM's are ferocious and incredibly energetic- muh more so than the first set. However, this set goes back and forth from excellent to miserable: pounding beats and hypnotic synths that are fantastic unfortunately build up to those all-too-frequent "epic" cresendos that are so incredibly lame and cheesy that it overshadows anything good that came before it. I've been listening to electronica (particularly trance)since the early to mid 90's, and there's nothing worse than the cheesy "epic trance" which became the norm when trance went mainstream in the late 90's and early 00's and never fully recovered. "Epic" trance (also known as "uplifting" trance) is an abomination to the genre- the "Spice Girls" of an otherwise worthy genre of electronica. Kearny's mix is filled with the type of cheesy epic trance that many purists despise. I'm surprised such a mix would accompany a John 00 Fleming mix.If you enjoy Cheesy "epic" Trance, then I encourage a listen. If so, listen on ITunes, since it gives you a window of 90 seconds to evaluate a song as opposed to the 30 seconds Amazon provides. Hopefully Amazon will upgrade to 90 second listening times soon.
I have to agree with a couple other people here. Although I wouldn't give this one star, it has a few problems.The first is that as noted, many of these tracks sound like something made by a 16 year old in his garage with FruityLoops. AWFUL sound quality on more than a few, with little to no post-production or level mastering.Secondly... some of these tracks are just plain awful overall. "I LOVE CENTIPEDE" could be used as an example of how NOT to write a "dubstep song that uses old arcade game sounds to invoke nostalgia." It's the audio equivalent of getting a cavity drilled.Although a few of the remixes are rather good ("HEADSTRONG" ain't bad at all, and the Wunderbros version of "ICE ICE BABY" is remarkably enjoyable), many on here are either half-baked, or just leave the listener wondering "who would waste their time programming this?" Did anyone out there really want a dubstep version of "YAKETY YAK?" Was there some underground cult following of "ELECTRIC AVENUE?" (Spoiler alert: No.)There are a few outstanding tracks, not entirely a surprise when you have Rusko, Luckytall, and Blackburner on an album. Long-standing Blackburner fans will likely enjoy every track of theirs on here. "BASSWAVES" by Luckytall is excellent. There are a few others.The problem is that many of the best tracks on this album are also included on a much better Dubstep compilation,Blackburner Presents: Dubstep Breakout 2012. The other compilation has much better production overall, and a better selection of tracks by leaps and bounds. If given a choice between the two, get the Blackburner Presents. I was silly enough to buy both of these albums, and I'd gladly return the MP3s for a refund on Dubstep Anthems 2012. Two stars for the few tracks that were worth it.
Just not enjoyable,on any level. I was hoping for at least one song that stood out,but it was all the same screechy stuff all through.
The sound effects were nice inside this cd but the cover image was un-called for.The sound effects were great except for the 1 track that made my stomach sick.And adult material should be totally removed from amazon unless they added a adult filter for adult content to permately block out adult content all together.But other than that.. all the other sound effects are great! They awesome.. but that one track and that CD cover.. made this cd lose 3 stars,..
I look for a little more umph in my music then this album has, if you like slow you will like this.
I was looking for a Christian album to workout to. This seemed to fit perfectly. One big problem. I am not a fan of techno. Almost every song has the same beat and it takes way to long before the singing beginning. This was a waste of money. Get the WOW 2012 album you will be much happier.
While a great deal for a large collection and useful when mixing songs for slightly different sound it is not good for those that want the "originals." Some recordings are well done but if you remember the originals vividly you will sorely disappointed.
It isn't fair to call every song on this sampler a flop, there are some songs on here that are passable, but I certainly wouldn't describe any of them as inspired or amazing. On the other hand many of the songs could rightfully be described as atrocious and horrible, so I feel justified in renaming the album. The overall feel of this sampler is amateurish, if these are the "up and coming artists" of tomorrow, I'm more than a little worried about tomorrow.After hearing 4 or 5 songs in a row with very (what's a nice way of saying pathetic?) vocals, I was excited to hear a song come up that sounded lively and had a decent male/female vocal duo, but then I listened to the embarrassingly juvenile lyrics. Here is a sample for you from the song Hand Dance: "I lost my lease but I'll just pitch a tent, won't take too long his hands are frisky. All I want to do is dance with my hands no need to make other plans, all I want to do is dance with my hands these hands make such big demands. Don't need a partner, don't need a friend, all you need is to find your rhythm with every finger from base to end, pinky, ring, middle, index, thumb..." If that sounds suspiciously like a song about "self gratification", a few lines later you'll be sure when they proceed to talk about hair on their palms and going blind. If you also wonder how on earth those lyrics sound when sung to music, rest assured that they sound just as bad as when reading them in this review with no musical accompaniment.Another song called Too Much Too Handle sounds like a mash-up of Borat, Fabio, and Depeche Mode (and not in a good or funny way).It's hard to knock something that's free, hence the 2 stars. A few of the songs were okay, I almost even kinda sorta liked track #11, Into the Night. And one of the songs had a Planet of the Apes reference which made my nerdy side smile, too bad the rest of that song made my ears bleed, well almost.Overall, for free, if you've got an hour or so to listen to the album and separate the good from the bad you may find a few keepers. But then again, who has a spare hour to waste these days?
I only give this two stars instead of one because it is free. If I had paid for these songs I would be sorely disappointed. For the most part they are pretty terrible. The productions do not feel inspired, and the vocals on most of these tracks puts the hammer in the coffin.There are only 3 tracks in this compilation that I think deserve repeat listenings; 11. Into the Night - Isgaard & Loic, Scarlet Soho. 13. Too Much Too Handle - Opium. and 15. Respect (Remix) - Leonard T., Starfunk.
I didn't really get into it.
it's like it.s 2002 all over again.  too many dj"s who all sound alike.  of course there are differences but it all comes down to the predictable "build and drop".  sadly EDM has gotten too big for it's own good.  the heard needs to be thinned so the focus can be on the music and the mixing and sequencing of the music, not gimmicks.  i do feel Afrojack is one of the better button pushers out there, however  the rest of talent is stale and predictable  and this collection is proof.  anyone with Mac Garage Band can do this.  don't believe the hype.  where are you John Digweed?  we need you.
I appreciate these guys for keeping the goth sound alive, but this album is pretty silly. It's just so cliche.I hope they had fun making it and didn't lose any money.
So sad, no product description just one song.  I was very disappointed that they would leave thar information out of the product description ..
Keiichiro Shibuya is an interesting electronic composer and I typically enjoy his work. "For Maria" is unusual because it's an album filled with solo piano music, composed and performed by Shibuya. Hey - the guy wants to try something new, and I'm all for that. There's no reason Shibuya couldn't pull this off, except for the glaringly obvious fact that he is really bad at it. Here's why:First, Shibuya is an awful pianist. He's heavy-handed, choppy, overbearing, and has poor control over his instrument. It's rare that I hear a pianists lack of technique manifest itself to distractingly. Some pianists have a rough or unconventional style - Thelonious Monk, for example. Or even Tom Waits. Nobody would consider Tom Waits to be a concert pianist, but that's not really what his style is about. He is, however, competent and does have a style. Shibuya plays like the amateur that he is. The reason I have a problem with this is because there are plenty of good pianists out there. Why should I pay money to hear someone tinkering with a piano?Second, Shibuya's harmonic and melodic language are quite banal. Lots of predictable harmonic motion with a weak sense of melody. He's a very inventive composer when working with electronics, but unfortunately, this does not translate into a sophisticated (or at least interesting) command of tonality. The songs appear very sincere, and I'm sure he had good intensions, but yikes; this is a lot of saccharine, hackneyed junk. It sounds like listening to your roommate fiddle around on the guitar, making you listen to some song he wrote for his girlfriend that uses ever cliche in the book. It comes from a good place and the girlfriend probably loves it, but if he asks you to pay for a CD of him playing it, that's going too far.My problem is that there are actual solo piano CDs in this style that are worth hearing. This isn't one of them. My recommendation is to stick with Shibuya's electronic music, which is actually quite good. If you're in the market for contemplative piano music of this style, you'd be much better off with any of the Alva Noto + Ryuichi Sakamoto recordings. "Insen" is my favorite, but they're all pretty good. Or, just buy one of Sakamoto's many solo piano CDs. He's an excellent pianist and his songs are good.Sorry for all the Shibuya fans out there. I'm one of you, but I cannot recommend this album.
After stumbling across Harshlizer, these guys soared into the top of my (very broad)list of Industrial/Metal bands. They were unique and original, not the usual "good", but still usual sound that so many bands have these days. So with such high hopes for this album I was terribly upset upon listening to it. It's generic in it's execution but sadly lacking in melody for much of it too. I feel some of the songs were only half realized. Dark Skies is the jewel of the album, honestly the only one worth snagging from the MP3 format, (I am a cd purist, I love having the artwork and everything) though the title track is reasonably good for what it is. I just hope with their next release they return to what they put out on Harshlizer, I love these guys and I want to support them.
I bought this CD, after hearing one song called &#34;Speaker Sweat&#34;  on NPR they play often.  Not being familiar with the artists didn't know anymore of their music.  After listening to more songs it's kind of techno-funk.  Just not my thing.  More of maybe dance type music at the clubs?  You have to pick and choose.  Small doses.  Over all disappointed and wish I had bought something else!
I would have been extremely irritated if I had decided to buy this album expecting Andrew Bird.  This is 100% not Andrew Bird.  Amazon please fix!
THIS IS NOT BY ORIGINAL ARTIST!!!IT  IS OKAY, BUT NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING!!WHOEVER DID IT DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB, BUT IT JUST ISN'T THE SAME AS ORIGINAL!!
I was pretty let down by this album. But I guess it was inevitable after putting out so many good ones. The songs lack emotion and the lyrics are simply not up to snuff with Tom's earlier albums. Anyone here because someone recommended A23, look at his earlier albums for quality music.
I love that these things exist because I am one of those kinds of guys who is rarely satisfied with other people's edits.  I find with remix kits however, that there is always something that doesn't quite mesh right with the parts of the original version that I am using, or the sound I want to pull out of the track is layered with another one in the stem that comes in the kit.
Bought  "25. Starships" for my nieces but I won't be able to play it for them due to explicit language. Should have better labeling.
So I'm super depressed when I log into Facebook that dreaded morning two weeks ago and find that a good buddy posted to my wall, a link that contained a sad article, the news that Pendulum broke up. Trying to reassure me, he tells me "at least we have Knife Party". And who the hell is Knife Party? One of Rob's over 9000 side projects he has worked on. So curious, I download the Rage Valley EP.The first frack started off nice, but then plodded along with the same boring beat for a long time on end, and it didn't take me long to... um, putting it mildly, not like it. The second track has a nice drop but is very anticlimactic, and same for track three until that narmy voice shouting "BONFIRE!!!!!" comes in and livens things up. The last track begins with a deep male voice singing "People move your feet until they kick us out, kick us ooouuuuuttttttt..." and this is pretty annoying, though to be fair there's some nice parts in it.Well, Rob doing derpstep sucks, and honestly, he had to have been high on something (he usually is) to drop a stellar band in favour of some crap side project.
it was free that's about all I can say for it not really my kind of music try it if you like
I love the song I am Free so I was thinking it was just a good Christian mix and didn't realize was for excercising.
This was not the same song I heard on Pandora.  It is disappointing and I will need to be more cautious when selecting music. The price was only 99cents but it was still not what I wanted.
I think these mega compliations, it is just something subtle about the versions they get... it is the same song, but without the soul.  That being said, I didnt listen to the full albumn so perhaps I am a bit premature.  The few versions I did listen to though, they fell short.
It's all just the same vocals over and over again with different people or voicaloids its hard to tellThe only reason I give this 2 stars is because of the bass
I did not realize these songs were covered by other artists.  The vocals are disappointing.  A few songs remind me of an Alvin and the Chipmunks CD
Theres about 5 decent (not good) on this album. I know it was only $4 but come on. That is of course just my opinion. You may find 7 or 8 tollerable. Good luck all.
A few songs are good, but the majority of the songs are a weird mix of rap and dubstep that is incredibly unappealing to me
Music was more techno than anything.  If you like techno then this is for you. If not then just pass.
I would love to ask the producers of the this reissue &#34;Just what the hell were you thinking?&#34;This is actually Augie Colon's classic second LP release &#34;Chant of the Jungle&#34;.  Although why it was renamed is a mystery to me.Most of you proabably already know that Augie was the percussionist for the late great Martin Denny. Denny produced both of Colon's two LP releases.Now back to this reissue:There really isn't much here to like other than the fact the music was reissued digitally.  But this release's audio quality is so bad, I wonder again &#34;What the hell were they thinking?&#34;  The music is presented in stereo, which is a miracle, but the audio sounds like with recorded through a wall of cotton.  It is so muddy as to be ridiculous.  The original cover artwork has been replaced with something that looks like clip art from an Ibiza Remix CD.  Sad, just sad.Ok so here is big question for all the producers out there:  Why would you reissue something and then change it and lower the quality form its original glory?  Why release it in the first place if you're going to do this to it?  Its like taking a classic old movie that was shot in color and changing the title and making it black and white.
The songs of this album are not composed by Jean-Michel Jarre but by other musicians. In my opinion, the quality is fairly poor and the album doesn't live up to the standard established by Jarre. At the time of writing this review, the songs can be listened on Jarre's official website - I'd advise all would-be buyers to do so to avoid buying something unexpected.
I am a huge Mark Farina fan. I was very disappointed with the album. Stick with the Mushroom Jazz collection and you will be happy.
i dont really listen to this song because it didnt really catch me, but if its your sort of thing then i say go for it.
I thought it was going to be better. It's ok, nothing fancy. I wouldn't recommend to spend the money if you are a chill out music fan.
Not worth it. There are better chill music compilations for a better price. I regret buying this mp3. Don't buy it.
The intro was too long. There was about 90 seconds of the same vocal loop laid over the track right at the forefront of the audio. The female vocalist on here sounds good and is right for the general tempo and tones of the song. However, every time I thought this song was going to drop hard, it didn't.  The song doesn't breakout ever, the closest thing to it occurs around the four minute mark. I think this song would be better if it didn't tease the listener with the suspense that it was going to pickup.
This is the elevator version of Dubstep. Something for your mother and I don't think she will like it either.
I got this collection for free, so can't complain much. I am still getting into Dubstep, but this collection just didn't speak to me much. It seemed a little lacking or a different style that I just didn't like.
music is amateur quality without enough "wub" if it was actuap dubstep and some of the tracks are kind of annoying
Song #2 &#34;Dust Eater (Ecstract Dubstep Remix)&#34; is the best track on the album.  If you don't like it then this album isn't for you.  This is extremely generic dubstep.
Back in the late 1970's and early 1980's dance music ruled not just the dancefloors but the world's airwaves. There were many dance divas, and many of them could sing. Some of these ladies had huge international hits, but only one of them, Donna Summer, scored one international hit after another, for several years. Thelma Houston can sing, so can Linda clifford, France Joli, Carol Douglas and various others included here, but what they didn't have was the star power Donna Summer had, right from the start. Donna's voice was the ONLY 'dance' voice that truly stood out enough for her to continue making her mark in the pop mainstream. A string of number one hit singles and albums certified Donna Summer as a global superstar - and whilst these ladies's certainly do their best here, it proves once and for all how no one can quite capture the essence of a dance song like Donna Summer always did. The sad truth is that each of these ladies are almost unidentifiable here - yet as soon as Donna ever opened her mouth to sing there wasn't a single person who didn't instantly recognise the depth, clarity and powerful precision of that most enduring and seductive of voices.
The music itself is fine but the vocals are incredibly overbearing and seem out of place. Removing or toning down the emphasis on the vocals would make this album far more tolerable. This just was not that enjoyable.
misleading... i tapped &#34;buy this track&#34; on pandora like i do when i hear a song i want to buy, but it wasn't the song that i was listening to. Even though it is a variation of that song, it is still not the one that i wished to purchase. I would never have purchased if I had know that it had been &#34;remastered&#34;
Some interesting mixes on old themes, some of these are just oldie gay anthems from years ago.  A bit dated but I did buy a few of the tracks for the interesting mixes.
i have been really thrilled to get the latest EPs from knife party. this was the first disappointment. go analog, gents.
Hardly even resembles the original.  This is too remixed. I usually liked remixed songs, but this one doesn't work.  A for effort though.
I really wanted to like this compilation. I am a big fan of The 2 Bears. I love The 2 Bears. When I saw all of the remixes of the 2 Bears songs, I bought it right away. Afterwards, I regretted it. Not that great.
It's a shame really, because this could have been a really good album. Unfortunately the production and mastering of the songs is way out of balance. The highs are adjusted way too high which leaves the mids and lows almost non-existant. By the time you turn it up enough in order to hear the actual "meat" of the songs the highs are so ear-peircing that it is unbearable to listen to. And at least two of the tracks have, for some reason, the really low frequency adjusted way too high for such a frequency, so that it bottoms out the speakers, while still leaving the mids in the shadows somewhere. I don't know if this is the affect they were going for or if somebody just doesn't know what they are doing. If the frequencies were set properly this would actually be a very good album on the whole. However, as it stands, the album is barely tolerable to the human ear. What a shame. Maybe someday if I can find the time I will just remaster it myself in an attempt to salvage my purchase.
I own all of Shpongle's albums now. I used to be obsessed with them, and I acknowledge that Simon Posford and Raja Ram are undoubtedly masters of manipulating sound via synthesizers, or whatever it is they use (Logic Pro?). This album is chock-full of the same highly intricate sound effects that Shpongle is known for. Producing this music obviously required several hours in the studio. If "trippy" sound effects are the main thing you care about, this album is for you.But I must raise the question: What about the notes themselves? What about the harmonies, bass lines, melodies? All of these elements which constitute tonal music? Is there any thing new or adventurous to be found here? This is where I feel Shpongle put in little effort. Almost all of their tonal ideas in this album sound to me like something a novice to music could have composed: simple and monotonous for the most part. Bass lines often consist of just two or three notes that repeat over and over, I'm unimpressed by the melodies, seldom do I ever hear interesting harmonies, and does anyone else here feel that once you've heard one electronic music track drag on and on in the Phrygian Mode for its entirety, you've heard them all? (Phrygian = Natural minor but with the 2nd lowered a half step.)Perhaps it's just that I've outgrown this genre. It seems to me that electronic music has gotten to a point where most of the musicians are primarily concerned with the sensual aspect of the music. The intricacy of the sound effects, the fat drum beats, and the way the music moves around in your headphones from one portion of the speaker to another (which I do admit is very cool). However, I've come to care much more about tonal ingenuity and was hoping (perhaps blindly) that Shpongle would evolve to incorporate more complex harmonic elements in their music. Sadly, my hopes were not realized.My advice to you, the reader: Do yourself a favor and listen to this album for free on YouTube before you buy it.-Colin
I bought this without listening to any samples beforehand because I was a big fan of the previous 2 albums.  This was a mistake for me as I don't like this album very much at all.It's a pretty big departure from the previous albums and obviously not my style.  I remember reading a while ago that he was putting CWL on hiatus to work on another project, and what it feels like is that the other project was just published under the CWL name.  Oh well I guess I will keep listening to the older albums.
but after trying to listen to the whole album, i wouldn't recommend it. 7 more words required. 2 more words
Planet Perfecto 3 shows Oakenfold dipping into this barrel and finding it a bit dry.  His choice of material isn't very good this time around.  Leave this one and go for one of the other Oakenfold releases, you will be better off.
Mostly uncreative crap. Warped-sounding overlays which mask the punctuation of the beats and rythm. Lots of big crecendos with no follow through. Short unimaginative amateurish tunes, like they forgot to stop recording when the good part of the mix was over. Does have a few good tunes though, just too time consuming to plod through the rest
I bought this bought my friend who listens to it every day on her way to work--so for her it's a keeper!!!
There is nothing amazing on this album. There is some good stuff, but some not so good stuff too. Frankly, it's just OK.
An OK album... Nothing really too exciting here.  Some songs are methodical and out you to sleep while others make you want to rave.
Hard to get a good preview of a 4 minute song with Amazons small duration of a sample. Especially EDM
The music is great for work outs.  The songs do not sound like the artists that truly sing the songs.  It could be the timing of the songs.  The songs seem to play faster then they should.  Not happy at all with the quality.
In the final of every song stop abruptly and I don't like that.the last song are better because the mix.
There are a few good tracks in here, but it is so disposable, and so self similar, that it is only worth a purchase if you want some background music.  Most everything sounds like a kid with a DAW and a 909 kick sample, then a few synths with long reverb tails and maybe a delay or two.  Let's be honest...Basic Channelthis ain't.  In fact the whole thing is so carelessly assembled, that at 6:49 in Track 5, the song hard edits into another - which cuts off hard in another minute.  That means that the good folks at "Prestige Music" (ironic name to say the least) didn't even listen to this before releasing it.  And talk about diluting your product - I would consider buying another one of these to see if the quality improves any, but seeing that there are going to be 70 - SEVENTY - volumes - well, it really indicates by anyone's measure that quality is not on order here.So, unfortunately, this is a pass, unless you want some bland, characterless home demo material calling itself 'minimal' (which in this case feels a lot like a cop out).  If you're a fan of Tresor Records, you need to know that this is not even vaguely as good asM SeriesorDecay Product.And judging by the utter lack of quality control, coupled with the ridiculous number of sequels, it's obvious this so called 'label' is probably a kid working out his parents' basement.  Pass.EDIT: Lower my review to zero stars.  Track 7, at exactly 6:10, falls apart into horrendous digital noise.  It's a lack of digital sync, or a bad transfer.  So two out of the first seven tracks have huge audio errors?  What a joke.  These losers never listened to this before releasing it.  So expand my review to "avoid at all costs" and "never buy anything from Prestige Music".  Honestly, why buy something that the company itself doesn't care about?  Why support a company that has no concern for the quality of their products?  This is absolute junk, and a waste of money, as is - undoubtedly - anything else from this rinky-dink 'label'.
I didn't realize I was purchasing a CD with 1 song on it. Maybe this was my error but I was not happy with the item.
Junior is one of the greatest albums of all time IMO. There's not a lot here however. Don't know who Robyn is, bad collaboration though. Wish Royksopp could find that &#34;lighting in a bottle&#34; again that is the brilliance of Junior!
I'm not saying the album was bad, just not for me.  The &#34;Do It Again&#34; song was really good and I enjoy it very much, but the songs here are not my cup of tea.  I actually hate them.  I preorded this so I was going on Do It Again as the bases for my pre-oreder and was disappointed when the album actually came out and the other songs were noting like the song I enjoyed.  The other songs are slow or just a bunch of noise.  If you are into that kind of thing go for it, but if you really like catchy songs like Do It Again, just stick to that and avoid the rest.
When it has came down to George Michael, he has a lot going for him musically with the depths of his elegance from the Symphonica live album. The album did deliver nicely. But within the middle of George's tour he did release some new music with the release of White Light, his first new song in years. Sadly, when I had heard the song a few years ago, I absolutely wasn't very driven into the song, and the remixes into the lackluster song don't drive into me either. It definitely isn't one of George's best songs at all. He had done much better with the dance songs that he had released earlier in his career with Fastlove, Freedom '90, and Faith. I just wasn't amused by the song and it definitely isn't worth the money. Instead, I absolutely recommend you get the Symphonica record instead. It definitely will tide you over for your money.Song: D+
