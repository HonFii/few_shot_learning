I purchased this by accident, but then again, I would presume nobody would on purpose.It's like listening to the radio, minus any songs you would probably recognize, with a tuning wheel on crack cocaine.I have nothign else to add besides offering my sympathy to fellow listeners.
FOR XBOX WHICH I DO NOT HAVE. I do not understand why you must have 17 more words when I already cover it. right?
I was deceived!  After playing 25 seconds of each track I proceded to download the mp3's.  However, when I played and burned the cd's then I realized that the vocal in EACH track started after approximately 25 seconds and was aweful.  I basicly wanted a cd for my Yoga class.  And I prefer instrumental with very little vocal.  I was disappointed.  I won't even play it at all.
This is a compilation album, with artists from Vienna.The Mum track in this album, does not belong to the experimental electronic ambient group from Iceland, but instead it belongs to a different group from Vienna also called Mum (without the accent on the U).This second group, focuses on trip hop, electronica and more dance rhythms. And they only have one album (as opposed to the Mum from Iceland). Beware, the cover of that album shows a picture of two heads together behind a mans belly and a light blue background.So despite of where the link in the name of the group may lead you, it does not match with the factual origin of the music.Hope this helps.
Purchased Score by mistake. WantedAdulthood (OST). This simply won't stand for a score. It's just the sound effect songs from the film, which holds no form out of context.
This album has no piano at all, and I thought that Jessica Williams was only a pianist.  This music is wild and not readily recognized.  I would like to have seen some liner notes to know what I was buying.
I absolutely adore Lullatone and this album is wonderful.  However, the mp3 version is un-listenable due to file corruption.  I pointed this out to Amazon MP3 a few months ago and they refunded my money for the downloads and said to check in a few days, but the mp3s are still corrupted 3 months later.  Just check the preview of track 6 (Morning Coffee) to see what I mean.Amazon has since failed to respond to my further requests to have the mp3's re-ripped.  And I don't buy physical media anymore...
Production of mixing is terrible. This could not have been done in a studio. Great idea if you can get past the crappy sound.
You know, you're driving during Christmas time with a Christmas disc in your player and you get stuck in traffic next to one of those "roba-roba" cars. You know, the type where both of you have your windows closed but you can hear his subwoofer walking all over your Mathis or Connick holiday tunes; "ROBA-ROBA...ROBA-ROBA...ROBA-ROBA...ROBA-ROBA". Some of these "house music" electronica outfits release their own Christmas albums or at least stick a track on the latest "Very Special Christmas" edition. Why pick on classic stuff?
I did not enjoy the remix.can't believe how the original songs are destroyed.What a mess !Doesnt sound like the original at all!
It seems that the whole album is not available by mp3, and this was the only thing available.I downloaded it from Amazon mp3.  It is misleading because some sites have some of the afterdarkcompilations available as a single track-whole mix (whole album) for the price of one track.  Thisis not that.
This is all recordings from tribute groups.  None of the song are original artists.  Quality is greatly disappointing.  Don't waste your money.
Not good.  Wannabe singers singing knockoffs.  I thought it was the original artists.  This was not a good purchase.  Bad.
I should have been tipped off that something was wrong when the guitars in the preview sounded heavier that how I remembered. This remake completely lacks the sound qualities that made the original so great.Follow the link below to get the original you were most likely after.[url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00175EYBS/ref=sr_1_album_2_rd?ie=UTF8&child;=B00175EUF8&qid;=1254384937&sr;=1-2]I Ran (So Far Away)[/url]
Song is a rerecording, not original artist as stated.  If you are going to sell covered music, please note that's what they are.
This is not the song we all remember and love!  This is a BAD remake, by some of the original band members.  You probably do not want this version!
was hoping to get the original "I Ran" but that isn't what this one is - still looking for the right version by the original bandfor all I can tell this isn't even seagulls playing the tune....
This mp3 song is not the same song I remember. This edition is not as good either. I had sampled the other mp3 in Amazon and the samples all sounded the same.
Love how this is an 8+ minute song but only 1 minute is on here...for .99.This crap adds up people. FIX IT.
I've listened to all the tracks on this album, and none of them sound remotely anything like the original. To take a beautiful masterpiece like the original and call these "remixes" should be a crime. I don't know who that other reviewer is trying to fool, but its not me.
I downloaded this from the mp3 store.Track 13 is the continuous mix, and is advertised as 1:14:07 minutes long.Mine is only 1:00:05 minutes. Don't know why. I've played this mp3 in itunes, windows media player, and on my ipod, and is not 1:14:07
I like the 3 musics that I already purchased from Rise album.  I don't like remixes.  No reason to buy same music in remixes.I opened the email to see the offer you sent to me, and before I knew it, they were downloaded.  I'd like to delete 3 Rise Remixes from my Amazon Cloud Player if possible.
When I wrote my review for The Bird and The Bee's EP `Again and Again and Again and Again' and I noted that the Peaches Remix of that `Boyfriend' song was brilliant, it was because it was everything that these Ralphi Rosario N' Jody DB Remixes aren't. These remixes are just blatantly generic and plain forgettable.I've heard this beat a million times before.The Vox Mix is ridiculously long and the Mixshow Edit is hardly much different, just shorter (not short enough).  I really wish they had played off of the phenomenal texture used on that Peaches Remix (actually, looks like this single dropped first, but whatever).  This is just lazy and it actually degrades the song in my opinion.  Thankfully this little single is salvaged by the inclusion of the original version of the song, but you might as well just buy the album (which is stunning) and skip these throwaway versions of one of this duo's best songs.This makes me sad.
Well, I bought the single MP3 track "Dark Star" as a goof for my friends and myself, "recovering" Deadheads all.I listened to the preview snippet and thought I could spend $.99 for a trip-hop-y chuckle. The full track is not identifiable in any way to Dark Star, no melody or lyrics in common with the original, so any novelty value my purchase would have had is missing! Oops! Caveat Emptor, indeed.
Wow thank you christian nazi conservatives for wasting my money. Love the fact that i finally find "neo the one" by slyder and you have to blast sum prick preaching.  Christianity has once again ruined something in my life. WASTE OF MONEY!!!
Why a remix? why not the original recording?this is a ripoff!!Don't waste your money!!!!do they think were that stupid???
I ordered this mistakenly-thought I was ordering Colt Ford. Oh yeah, there is a BIG difference. May be alright for teeney bopper girls, but definitely not for grown men.
Trying to find this on CD-- it does seem to be available that way but I can't find it in Amazon...
Sounds like I sat down and decided to mix music one weekend.  awfulUnprofessional sound, boring mix, grating tones, absurd lyrics
Not the song i was listening to on pandora....wasted $.99Downloaded it....listened to the first minute or so of the song....wrong song...delete.
I have never offered a review before, but as a fan of what NIN used to be, I couldn't let these obnoxious, overrated, fanboy reviews stand.  The only question I have is whether this was a cheap stunt to test the internet market without risking any good music, of if he has just run out of good ideas.My grandmother would enjoy this music.  That's not what I was looking for when I purchased this.  I seriously regret buying this album, and if I had purchased this as a CD, it would already be returned.
It is really sad that this is what Nine Inch Nails has become.  The sounds on this album are far from industrial rock / metal and even electronica.  This album lacks passion and intensity.  If you need some repetitive laid back noise to turn on when you are blitzed out of your mind, this might do the job.  For any other condition you're in, this album is likely to go in the trash before back in the cd player.
just never got me interested. listened once and never again. i can see what he was trying to do, but it just wasnt for me.
This album is terrible. Where are the lyrics? The songs sound so plain without the emotion that lyrics would provide. I wish I could have my $5 back to get a Quarter Pounder meal.
this warning applies only to the vinyl edition of GHOSTS I_IV.  due to the necessity of using lighter vinyl-weight in order to squeeze four records into a two-record folio, all four records and cover warped terribly.  there is no booklet here either, which is a little letdown.  NO BOX SET as was previously advertised, AMAZON took off that descriptive term after i requested it removed.the vinyl edition was warped and badly.  the music is unquestionably some of Trent's best work.  i love the CD, and i hoped the record would be of quality that i have come to expect AND receive from NIN.  but corners were cut with GHOSTS I-IV vinyl edition.  if they come out with a 150 gm BOX SET i'll buy it, but the folio is useless for four skinny records.sorry Trent.
Dont get me wrong I love trance and techno and house music.  I also love NIN but seriously this isnt and should not have been released as a NIN album, which I dont think it was really claimed to be as such, but the name is there.  Its way too mellow and dull and without Trent going on about God, politics, sex or love into the mic well, its just sounds that anyone could have made.
What a waste of the 63Mb download bandwidth. I own previous NIN albums, and rate some of them pretty good, but in the first instalment of Ghost I'm sorely dissappointed. It's a self-indulgent meandering of rubbish. Hope the others are better. Really.
Reznor records himself sitting on his keyboard....shuffles his buttocks around a bit....and then sells it.....
People ripped into 'With Teeth,' and its not half as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be.  If it takes 5 years to make anything, take 5 years!  Atleast it will be real!  Atleast, the emotion sensed from the work will be life-like, whether sad or happy or whatever!  This sounds like it was just meshed together for the hell of it.  There's pictures of equipment here like "this is it guys, here's where it happens."  I really don't know what this was suppose to be (this, or the last 2 'conceptions').  I think 'The Slip' is going to flow in the same direction.
Honestly, i think this is a joke at our expense. Sort of a "let's see if people will buy anything we put out" kind of deal. Now, I admit, $5 is NOT a lot to spend, so I'm not angry (what is that, a gallon of gas these days?), but as a musician myself, i find that about 70% of the "ghosts" are unfinished tripe that most people would toss away. There are a few nice pieces in there- nothing as good as any of the instrumentals on The Fragile, but they are not bad. The rest of it though... I really think Trent and Co. are sitting in their lodge, sipping hot chocolate and laughing while the rest of us are out in the cold night not quite getting the fact that we've been fooled.Oh, and please, DO NOT compare Ghosts I-IV to Radiohead's In Rainbows. Aside from the self-distribution (which Keith Caputo did a while ago) there is no other similarity. In Rainbows contains SONGS, Ghosts I-IV contains SOUNDBYTES. I admire the premise, but i am disappointed with the result.
This is utter garbage! I have every NiN album on hard copy, love them all in their own rights. This music is not fit for public consumption. It may be useful to someone that needs samples for creating industrial sounding music. I would call this a white label samples album, it really is just boring noise. For those that said "this is like classical but better" are gravely mistaken. The music here is generally unlistenable. If you want a lot of atmospheric, boring, NiN produced MUZAK to sleep by, this is it!
I am Cami; I wrote and own 100% of the rights to Not The End and whomever made this never got my permission or consent; I am sick of SO many doing this to my songs, images, words, etc. when they are copyrighted officially AND with ASCAP; and I have lawyers so you're caught, give up.
Just as bad, if not worse, than the first album. You'd think they would have stopped after the first one, but apparently there's a lot of suckers out there who will buy anything just because it has Christian symbolism on it.
This album was awful, I couldn't tell what it was trying to achieve and frankly, I am not surprised after finding out the "artist" (and it pains me to use the word to describe this idiot) is nothing more than a thief.
Lacking any structure to anything worth watching. It was very misleading to what you would exspect. yet it is vaugly porn.
That's really all there is to say about this band, and the others like them; hipster "metal" for guys in their sister's pants.I won't go the route of the caveman shouting about RAR TRUE METAL; that's not the point, the point is that this isn't interesting, fresh or new; they're not doing anything that Mr. Bungle or Circle Takes the Square did before them. Possessing some semblance of talent is what separates those 2 bands from this run of the mill garbage.Remember Limp Bizkit and Crazy Town; same thing; people who don't know a thing about anything will think this is some kind of cuh-razy new genre of music; those of us who've been in the know for some time will just sit there and snicker.
Like the title says, parts of the audio have very audible flaws. Clicks and pops all over the place. Its the same on iTunes as well. Only the youtube video of this track (and maybe the CD) are free of flaws.
Stuff like this has been around in the realm of secular media for some time; Christians, BEWARE!Now, it has hit the church! If you haven't been informed about Bavarian/Illuminati relatedsatanic programming techniques, it can't get any closer than this. On the list of what satanists"put out there" to destroy and bring down the Christian church, is that she will remain asleep,and therefore, not strong enough to fight in the times we live in today. Anything that resemblesa form of this "promotion of drunkenness/hypnotic state of being with Jesus" is pure demonic.Ask any doctorate who is familiar with ritualistic, satanic programming techniques.Church....grow up, and WAKE UP!! There IS NO TIME TO SLEEP!!! Deception is everywhere.
This album is not by Juice Newton, even though Amazon shows three other Juice Newton Albums as alternative purchases by those who bought the album.  Also, all of the reviewers wrote about how good this album is - it might be for those who like whoever this is but IT IS NOT JUICE NEWTON.  Do not get ripped off.  Amazon totally fouled this up and this is not a minor problem - this is a sequester type - close down the government type bit of gross stupidity.
I hope Brother Records (Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson) doesn't sue these guys for copyright infringement.
Wow, I liked My Last Day by Kim Hiorthoy a lot so I decided to pick up his other albums and the only one that sucks is this one. Most songs are complete silence. It sounds like someone brought a mic outside and just recorded. Just listen to the samples and you will see what I mean. I wish I would have listened to the samples before wasting $9 on this album.Hopeness, Melke, Live Shet, and My Last Day are great but For The Ladies is a joke. No actual music on entire album.
The album's actual title is "The Ultimate Chillout Lounge Collection of Mediocre Songs by Artists You've Never Heard Of"I've been a chillout enthusiast for over ten years and I am not familiar with any of these songs or artists.  Listening to the samples, I can understand why.
I dont like that kind of music. Im sure people do, if not they wouldnt made it. Give it to them
Sadly, it's one of the many CD that have been issued that appear to be a brilliant compilation, only to be spoiled upon playing it, when you discover that the tracks aren't originals, but are re-recordings.If you like re-recordings, or live versions, then this CD will be fine for you.I prefer original artists and original tracks, so this CD will stay in its sealed casing, never to be played on my CD player.
Instruments provided by Fisher-Price, vocals courtesy of Speak & Spell.Seriously, this album is garbage. If you thought autotune was bad on the top 50 hits, add bare minimal synths and an generally annoying overall sound, and you've got this album.I really wouldn't be surprised if any good reviews were solely for the cover art alone. I can just hear 14 year old girls screaming "OMGEE HES SOOOO CUTE!!!1!11!".Please. Stop buying this crap so maybe "Nickasaur!" will stop ruining music's name by producing this garbage.
these three girls have absolutely zero talent. they yell and talk their lyrics, which are filled with profanities, and their "music" has absolutely NO originality whatsoever. this is the worst music i've ever heard in my life.
This one failed to impress, maybe my 37 years on this planet have left my musical taste for dance music more critical than the newer generation, but the original versions from "Martyr Mantras" far exceed anything found here. Mostly a cross between ambient and electro and not landing firmly on either. Fans of Enigma might be lured in, but for those who prefer "Cheapness and Beauty", your money would be better spent on "Yum Yum" released under the name The Twin.
I've been a fan of The Faint ever since the release of Media. I was rather disappointed with "Wet From Birth", but little did I know, that their next release would be pure garbage. I've boycotted this album amongst all of my friends, and giving it 1 star is giving it too much credit. THE FAINT ARE FINISHED.
This cd was not the music i would like. it cam recommended by amazon and sometimes i wonder if they actually look at what you buy. music is not the type i listen to.
This CD was terrible. And not just because he is using other artists music, and seemingly getting away with breaking the law (for now). Being that he is making a profit with this being sold on Amazon. It is terrible because it is not well done. The transitions are terrible. Most of the songs do not have any relevancy from song to song. Where is the theme? It is closer to a 10 second clip sample on random shuffle. I thought people who liked crap like Lil Wayne, Souljah Boy, Justin Beiber, or any name from a slew of non-talented performers who seemed to sell millions of records, were in bad tastes musically. This CD takes that to a whole other level.
Nothing but samples and mash-up. A perfect example of the vacuous nature of hip hop. Snort some bath salts or ketamine and enjoy. You gotta smoke a lot of pot with this "music"...a whole lot.
To me, this album is much more raw mixing/DJing and much less a finished product of melodic songs. I'd recommend Smokers Delight or Carboot Soul over this one.
Yes, it's over an hour long.Yes, it's only $0.89.But no, it is not music.The entire track is just a long recording of sounds picked up from a street. People talking, sirens wailing, car brakes screeching, etc. It's something nobody should be tricked into paying for, and I'm very irritated at my loss of 89 cents.
Capital PlansFalls Off the Curb, Chump Style.All Your DeparturesThe City Lights Us On FireSecession in AstropolisInanomie Op.221EpHeart Of BranchesThis soporific recording & artist label owner likely & allegedly owes back taxes.  Hear the answer to the question "Why?" on "We Saw Everything."  A gigantic (asian profanity) on, in, around and through the skulls of music lovers everywhere.  One joy-killer of an album. Actually, compact disk.
I'm just asking because it's horrible.  Nevermind that the original was a work of genius or inspiration, this retread offers nothing new aside from some very grating electronica noise and padding.This is a picture-perfect poster boy for why remixes are a much maligned musical medium; they are often terrible.(Hope you enjoyed the alliteration!)
i love thomas dekker and i like most music but this was just weird. listen to the samples before you buy if you're only getting it because it's thomas dekker
I buy and listen to a lot of "electronica" such as carbon life forms, ott, banco de gaia, sounds from the ground, phuture primitive, solar fields and that type. This and the other entheogenic album I bought are a waste of money. Another "artist" who thinks weird voices and sounds are clever additions, instead of just a stupid interruption.
This is horrible.  Sounds like it was created on a budget of about $4.99, using a casio keyboard.A disgrace to the "Summer" name!
Not a good product!!  was a Christmas gift for my son and every time we go to put air in the ball it deflates.  Has a hole in it.  Product came with no return slip either which makes it impossible to return.  I STRONGLY do not recommend buying this item!!!
Purchased track from one of my FAV artist Kalabi, finding out that this group is not paying this artist for his contributions to this album.  Might Fat Records this needs to be addressed
A collection of 1-2 minute tracks for a total time of 35 minutes... about the length of 1 track of 6-7 for most ambient.. no sale..
Is this the rock band "Journey" that anyone over 35 knows and loves? This seems very suspect when the type of music listed is "Dance, Electronica"! This is VERY misleading if it isn't the band Journey. Anyone have this Mp3 only album?
i downloaded track 9.  does not contain the original vocals.  the only vocals is the chorus of the song, resung, spread out over the dance track.
The same crappy mixes released on another compilation desperate for a different response from the music audience... it isn't going to happen. The case says what hits are included.. but how are these songs hits? There is no chart history ever recorded for Radames anywhere in the world!!!
Im so glad Townsend got his mojo back after this garbage, these 1 min sound effect songs are not worth the money and to be honest are a total rip off for something with Devin's name on it.  AVOID!
Words don't even express how bad that sample I just heard was........Has someone who has heard the whole thing have any comment on it? Is it a diamond in the rough, and I was simply mislead?
To steal the name of one of the most important bands in rock history and make this garbage...what is the matter with them? Do the (real) Plimsouls owe them money? The (real) Plimsouls have several new releases out. Do your homework, idiots - you're about to get sued, BIG TIME!
This dance band gets one star for copying the name of one of the best indie bands from the 80's.  Do not buy this album if you are looking for the Peter Case band.
I have been a fan of Abigail Washburn for a long time but was disappointed with this music.  Abigail usually plays bluegrass-fusion with Chinese influences.  Her solo album and her albums with Uncle Earl and The Sparrow Quartet are amazing, but this was quite a let down.  Young people who like hip-hop will probably love this stuff.  I do not.  She speaks Chinese and has been to China many times and she participated in this album to help the relief effort for the Shanghi earthquake that happened a few years ago(similar the the relief efforts that are going on for hurricane Katrina).
I was so excited when I saw this was available on Amazon. Once downloaded I realized these mp3 all under 192kbps. $9.00 wasted.
I am looking for fun kid fitness muscic and find a download with a song titled Sex Bomb.  Seriously, this is absolutely ridiculous.
When this 2CD Alternative Versions album was released through his fanclub, I decided to read fan reviews first to find out what Jagged Edge was all about. Personally, I did not like 'Jagged' (2006) so why pay attention to remixed versions? Numan stated that when he started working on Jagged, several producers created a different sound, each worthy of an individual release, so he gave us 'Jagged Edge' and we could all hear different versions by Sulpher, Ade Fenton and others.It is now March 2010 and I was offered a copy of Jagged Edge. Curiosity got the better of me so I accepted the CD and decided to give it a try. I can honestly say that if you are one of those die-hard Numan fans, who believe his music is perfect all the time, or anything he releases should be in your collection, you will buy this album.If you are more open minded, objective and subjective to arts and listen to many different bands, you will agree that this is without doubt the WORST NUMAN RELEASE EVER!!!These alternative versions of an already poor album, is only of interest to those 'Numanoids', but if you are not (or no longer a die-hard) you have nothing positive to say about this collection of over-long, badly written songs.On the 'Jagged' (2006) album I could find maybe 3 songs that I would describe as good - but 3 good songs was not enough for me to like that album -  but this album is just so bad, so unnecessary, if leaves you speechless. Jagged Edge ruined what ever appreciation I had for (3 songs on) Jagged.The front cover of Jagged Edge should already be a good indication of what to expect, because it shows no attempt at designing anything - just Numan sticking his nose up.I tried to listen to Jagged Edge twice, but this is the first time in my entire life that I could not finish an album and took a nail to the CDs, so that when someone finds it in my garbage can, they will be spared major disappointment in an otherwise outstanding musician, who recorded some of the most memorable music in history.Like I said before - for die-hard fans only, which is probably why he released it in the first place, because as an album to gain new fans, it fails miserably.Avoid
Upon recommendation from people who didn't have ADHD, I bought it to help me concentrate on writing my paper. It gives me a headache.
I ordered this to help my ADHD children with homeschooling concentration and all it did was littlerly make them cry, i wish i could get a refund but im thinking thats not possible what a waste of 8.99 plus tax
This appears to be little more than a bunch of preview clips, each too short to really get a feel for the full length version. Too bad, because I probably would have liked many of the full length songs.
I heard Ego Riot in a mix and fell in love with it.  I bought the album without listening because I was hoping for more of the same.  It is the one diamond in the acid jazzy rough.
awesome cd but freakin amazon only lets it on 1 device. WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!!!!!! LOOK AT ALL MY DOWNLOADS FROM AMAZON NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have my iphone and my ipod want on ipod that i stick in a speaker at home and on my iphone to show my other flute friends. Extremely disgusted.
When I downloaded this it only did the last three songs. I haven't figured out why yet, and I haven't had a chance to ask amazon what might be the problem. I expect problem free delivery every time from amazon and I'm not happy I have to take the time to deal with this!!!!!
Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.
Made a huge mistake buying this set!  Save your money! DO NOT BUY!  DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! WASTE OF MONEY!
Thumbs down to every dance artist on Amazon who thinks that I want to spend $8.99 for an entire remix album full of remixes of the same song, especially in today's instant download world.  Come on, get real, it's not the 80's anymore!  Thinking you can force me to purchase the entire album just so I can get the one remix I like only gets you and every other album pusher on my list of "DO NOT BUY EVER AGAIN".  I realize that you need to make money but you should realize in today's world, that people are looking to get the most for their money.  For me and many others, that means making the choice between purchasing 9 remixes of 9 different songs by 9 different artists for .99 each or spending 8.99 and only ending up with remixes of 1 song by 1 artist.  HAHAHAHA!  I don't think so!!!
If you need Lullabye music, this album is perfect. It is so boring it will put the most anxious child to sleep.
Amazon is selling the wrong album, this is not the Fanatix album. It is something else not sure what album this is but to get the right one go to the BBE website.
this ISN'T the Fanatix album AT ALL. Amazon, please correct this. These tracks play songs from an entirely different album. You can purchase and download the actual album from the record label site at www (DOT) bbemusic (DOT) com
please don't sing like this over cod reggae, or should I say "please don't play cod reggae over this lovely vocal?...
When one thinks of the string quartet, and how music written for reached some of the heights of cultural insight, this leaves something to be desired. The whole thing is pure schtick. Recognizing schtick used to be a great way of separating wheat from chaff. Culturally speaking this effort, and ones like it, is more precisely like taking the wheat and chaff, let them ferment and rot and darken, and then using them to paint graffiti rap lyrics on the wall. Yikes!
Was not impressed with these two tracks... A Music Interested person as I... this was simply NOT in my Taste.  Not to say others would not appreciate... There was No Life to these songs... zero personality if thats what you would call it. Surely Someone understands my meaning...
The album is really enjoyable. It's techno meets string quartet. It's great! To be clear, I have no issue with the music itself!! I really like it!The problem is Amazon's conversion to mp3.The problem is track #7 (Lieutenant Kiji (Troika)). It's mostly computer noise, as you can hear from the sample available.I sent Amazon several emails about it, all I got back was silence. So I guess, buyer beware when buying mp3's from Amazon. If the mp3 file is corrupted, too bad for you.
I thought I was purchasing the MWK who writes rock songs. But, this is Spanish dance club music! Don't be fooled by the name!
Do not download this album.It is not by edIT of glitch mob.This guy needs to seriously change his name.
I did not realize at the time when I placed this order that it was not the original artists singing the songs.  I totally dislike and WOULD NOT recommend!!!!!
I was looking for the original tracks and got fooled by this compilation of karaoke remakes. A waste of money.
Very poor quality of audio files. Only poor quality Covers. You get what you paid for. Even my dog hates this when I leave it on when we go out. If I could make it half a star it's more than it's rating.........
I should have read the description a little closer.  Not the original artists but the singers are............close.  Save this one for when the party is nearly over and no one is sober enough to be able to tell the difference.
When looking for MP3's on Amazon, I keep running into crappy remakes like this one and all of Count Dee's bad music available. Poeple want to hear the music that actually made it to the charts not this cheap knock off.  Shame on you Count Dee, Keep this junk to yourself.
If there are no artists listed on any compilation CD or Album then it's a good indication that the tracks are not the original artists. Always beware of these! Make sure that there's a column listing the artists.
I feel cheated! These are not original artists, very disappointing. Perhaps some place in the ad it mentions these are not the original songs, but I didn't see it. I thought I got a good deal when I bought it, I was wrong.
I bought this via my phone on the fly so didn't see the previous warnings/reviews.  All bad cover versions, no original artists. :(
I wish I had previewed more of the songs before I purchased.  To me, as I was in my prime during this era, this is a VERY POOR remake of some great songs.
This is complete garbage and a waste of $10. The songs ARE NOT from the original artists, they are cheap local dive bar degenerates who probably didn't get paid to sing this crap.Run to the hills, run for your life.
None of the songs are performed by the original artists. It was a big disappointment to discover that after I'd purchased it. If you're over 40 and remember the originals, you'll know immediately. It's just not the same.
This is not the same Andy Hunter as the one who put out the albums Exodus, Life, Colour, and Collide. It is a completely different record label, and a completely different person.
This has nothing to do with Half Life, Sierra, or VALVe. The official soundtrack was produced by Valve's Kelly Bailey. This shamelessly is using the logo.... and even says "Sierra Presents"
I don't know where I got a song by her, but I really liked it, so when I saw this album available I jumped at it. And I'm sorry I did, because this is terrible!
Wouldn't even rate single STAR!! Thought it would be good and downloaded this Music... but not at all to my taste... Deleted the song even before I could hear the whole song!
I really don't know how you can even call this music.  There is no structure, no rhythm, no talent.  Add that to the fact that the artist seems to be a bit off her rocker.  I'm never downloading any of her "music" again.
Do you remember that old philosophical debate, about whether a million monkeys pecking random keys on typewriters for a million years would eventually produce the works of Shakespeare?  Kellee Maize's work reminds me of that, though as yet she hasn't produced much that resembles music (not lyrically, anyway).  She's apparently had the big insight that lots of words rhyme with each other or sound a lot alike, and thinks by stringing them together something profound may result.  Well, not quite.Using big words that rhyme does not an artist nor poet make.  Gosh- consonance, continents and consequence DO sound a lot alike, wow.  You can visit any mental hospital and find dozens of such "visionaries", what they produce is called "word salad".  It's gibberish, utter nonsense.  Ms. Maize is either unbalanced or having a good laugh at our expense, possibly both.  There's nary an original thought here, no- strike that- there's not a THOUGHT here, not one that's coherent or complete, at any rate.  The words SEEM to suggest things, like a verbal Rorschach test, words randomly thrown together DO, but the meaning is imposed from without, a projection, as they say. Granted, the tunes are catchy, the beats infectious.  But if you see anything profound and revelatory in the lyrics, I suggest you Google them, and have a look some Sunday morning, in the clear light of day.  I warrant that YOU are the source of your epiphanies, the inspiration and beauty comes from within, not from Ms. Maize's ramblings, which are alternately pretentious, gratuitous, and in poor taste, to put it mildly.  In fairness though, why this strikes me as rubbish and songs like "COME TOGETHER" or "I AM THE WALRUS" by the Beatles strike me as genius, I don't know (LSD way back when may have had something to do with it, admittedly, in this case, so who knows).BTW, what is an "aligned archetype"?  An archetype is ONE facet of a person, one of many that complements other facets, their confluence or amalgam forms personality. I could have made some sense of "aligned archetypes", plural, its use in the singular is baffling- how so, aligned with what?Below are the lyrics to Something Sacred.  I had to work around the obscenities, Amazon wouldn't accept them.  Some might think it a travesty, an insult to the things that people actually hold sacred to use the word thusly.  "Something Sacrilegious" might be more fitting.  Neither sacrilege nor obscenities bother me in the least, actually, but utter twaddle taken as profundity does, especially when there's so much out there that IS profound, explicitly so, like THE AVETT BROTHERS or LOVERS or HOLY GHOST! or MATTHEW DEAR, for example. I'll give you a million dollars if you can cogently explain the meaning of this song to me (well, not really, I don't have a million CENTS). But here are the lyrics, judge for yourself:SOMETHING SACRED:Alliteration for the nation, consonance for continentsI hope the consequence is that you bob your head to thisJustifiable rythymAsking what you been missin'Pimps so corporate n' kissinValues are tied in the lynchingAll the fat needs some pinchinSteady youth in a prisonNo lovin' supervisionThere's no cooks in the kitchenPoison water no fishin'All the sales men are pitchin'To steal cause circumcision[Sexual assault] us continue snitchin'Money drugs over [female dogs]I see something real differentI'll be holdin' a visionIt's not just superstitionSomething sacred sewed me sidewaysI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my wayHoly hell on a hardened highwayFeeling freaky focusedFriday to FridayI'm fighting my egoI think may be it's sequelIs opposite of evilSugar f***ed up my equalNever researched the prequelToxins all in your fecalPoppin' pills swelling measleTell me where is my peopleThey don't bow at no steepleLightworkers gettin deepaQuantum physics'll teach yaMy lyrics they might reach yaRead the poems I preach yaThis full length is my featureA mysterious creatureWe are one blood all keepersSomething sacred sewed me sidewaysI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my wayHoly hell on a hardened highwayFeeling freaky focusedFriday to FridayMy spaceship is leavin'Out the window I'm seein'End of left brain per diamPsychics say they can see themDaddy's fightin my demonsBeside me steady dreaminThat he helps me make freedomFrom the grave he is screaminF! the man and his s*menKinda fishy no reasonCorporation is reakin'Smells of workers well treatedEarth mother she is fiendin'For a break in the seasonDiscontent no one pleasin'Called a [female body part] that is bleedin'Something sacred sewed me sidewaysI'm Mirrored, mimickin' and movin' my wayHoly hell on a hardened highwayFeeling freaky focusedFriday to FridayAlliteration for the nation, consonance for continentsI hope the consequence is that you bob your head to this
What the hell is THIS?  This piece of trash is actually offensive.  Not because its about sex, but it is so asinine that it made me want to literally vomit.  I actually DID vomit.  Someone told me this band was really great and I need to listen to them.  I no longer speak to that person because they are an idiot.  This song plain sucks.
I'm a big fan of Praga Khan and have bought everything he's been included in but this leaves very much to be desired which isn't a good thing considering the title of the album.It'd be good for background music but for me that's not what Praga's all about.If you're into techno with no vocals then you'll probably enjoy this quite a bit.
ALL THIS MUSIC IS STOLEN! "Greek Winter" is actually "Luna" by "Shirobon" and is a free download on his Bandcamp page here [[...]
All of this music is stolen. Do not buy this. Read more about it here:[...]I encourage you to contact Amazon and complain about pirated material being sold through their website. I am going to do so after writing this review, but if you can read this then the item is still available and Amazon needs to be reminded that they are profiting off of piracy.
Please: Not everyone listens to music with ear buds, in a car or on a TV. Better sound quality is a must or I won't purchase it no matter how much I like it. There's too much good music available to spend time listening to this.
If it was possible to give a below zero rating, I would! This is absolutey tradgic, awful, and a flip off to the most beautiful and relaxing type of music. I don't know who thout making classics into techno was even a sorta good idea. It's a disgrace and I strongly suggest not adding this to your collection!
Same old retread crap.  WTF?  Sounds like every other jam band that's trying to "make it".  Over played, over funk garbage.
This is an absolutely mediocre collaborative attempt from NIN's frontman Trent Reznor and former West Indian Girl's Mariqueen Maandig. The music seems like it was mixed badly from tracks that were rejected from the previous two NIN albums, and the vocals are very flat and lacks emotion. Save your time and money and buy a Portishead album instead, because that's who this comatose track is trying to be.
The vocals on this single are horrible and uninspired.  It is obvious that Trent Reznor is trying to hand his new wife a career she could not obtain on her own.  There is a reason that she could not obtain it on her own, she has no talents as a musician or vocalist.  Trent maybe able to hand some of his fan base to his own personal Yoko, but not this fan.
Are you kidding me Mr Reznor. Take your beautiful wife and make babies or take pictures, but please don't waste your time or ours trying to make music with this woman.Bleccch!
yes, you read that correctly.  there is nothing portishead about this song except for the fact that beth gibbons occasionally pipes up for a second or two.now i'm not saying that a band shouldn't branch out or anything but if you wanted a single word description of this song it would be "monotonous".  no redeeming qualities at all.  it almost sounds like something a 15 year old kid with a 10 year old copy of fruity loops would create.i'm glad i spent $0.99 on this track so i could warn others.  this song is only for masochistic portishead completionists.
Sub Concious is solid down tempo, akin to Shpongle, OTT, etc.  Kinetic is solid and varies from downtempo brostep, to mellow dub with lots of melodic trance synths and glitch-mod style leads syths.Luminous has terrible sacharrine vocals on all 3 tracks which makes it pretty much unlistenable.Get the other two albums, and steer clear of this one.
only had 3 songs on it but could of been good but i dont know cause I never got item even though i paid for it.
Listened to song first, then after I ordered it, it was three completely different versions. Dont believe I will be ordering from Amazon again!!!
partly my own stupidity, I thought this was the actual song not a piano version of it. if that is what you are looking for- good product, but if you are like me and were too excited by the low price to read further- this is not for you.
This is not the same Andy Hunter as the one who put out the albums Exodus, Life, Colour, and Collide. It is a completely different record label. Hence, it sounds different.
National Geographic released GREAT World music in the 1970-80's.  This is a disgrace coming from that once fine organization.  Garbage!
This is the worst kind of cheesy electronic dance music. Nothing redeeming here what so ever. Perhaps this was recorded as an attempt to appeal to the dance crowd. I love electronic music, but this piece is what gives electronic music a bad reputation. This doesn't sound like the Stephan Kaske that I know and love, but I'm afraid it is....
Not only was this not the band Powerglove like I thought it was but it also turned out to be dubstep.
Don't buy this unless you don't want the original artists.Glad I listened before I bought it, but I was looking to buy singles.
Dear Amazon, please fix the label for this album lest some poor soul accidentally buys this autotuned abomination of an album.This is not Mindless Self Indulgence, do not be fooled by the label.Thanks
While I like the music on this album and I'm happy to be able to get a copy of it, this so-called new mastering is a vinyl rip complete with pops and clicks. It may still be worth the price if you're hungry for progressive electronic music, but it's not been given the treatment it deserves or that people expect when they see the term "remastered". I suppose one could remaster an old recording of a vinyl record, but that would be ridiculous. Is that truly what happened here?
This is one lousy album!  Fake remakes of great songs. Everything is at a slower tempo. I would return it if I could!
The entire album is composed of stock loops available from &#34;Soundpools&#34; associated with the Magix Music Maker software.  The only thing original about any of them is the particular samples chosen to build the track, but they're all just a mindless single-key loop of those samples otherwise.Moreover, because this album (offered for sale, mind you) is being spammed all over music sites the world-over, the samples are causing DMCA notices for YouTube videos containing music that uses any of the matching samples.  People looking to create their own background music strictly for entertainment purposes are getting blocked and unfairly harassed because of stunts like this.  We think we're doing the right thing by avoiding commercial music, then get smacked anyway because of postings like this.The real kicker is how the &#34;artists&#34; are expecting to get away with this, as the licensing for Magix software expressly prohibits commercial (for-profit) use of the Soundpool samples.  Check Magix[dot]com/us/eula/consumer/&#34;Exploitation of these music, video and photo files outside the scope of personally created works is illegal. Exploitation of these music, video and photo files outside the scope of personally created works is prohibited.&#34;This should be pulled from every site where it's being offered for sale, and Amazon really needs to take notice of this blatant disregard for licensing in particular.
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU AND IMMA LET YOU FINISH BUT STROMAE HAD THE BEST ORIGINAL OF ALL TIME.OF ALL TIME!
In Dubai they play the original song, not this Kanye remix crap. One star because of West, Five Star To Stromae.
If this is what Dido's fourth album is going to sound like, she ought to forget it.  Terrible idea to do an  electronic album!  She kinda crashed with her third album, this will be a HARDER crash!
This was recorded straight off an LP!  With all the hiss, crackle and pop!  (Sounds like an ad for Rice Krispies.)  Maybe acceptable back in the early days of online buying.  DO NOT BUY!!!  Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourselves for allowing these rip off producers to sell on your website and scam our money!
I was so excited to see Silver Convention's "Madhouse" recording offered as an MP3 download! I have searched and searched for the cd to no avail, which should have been a red flag. If it's not available on disc, then it shouldn't be available in any other format, no? I purchased the download, only to find after a few close listens that this was simply a vinyl copy converted to MP3. I can, and have done that myself (convert to cd) as I own a copy of this LP. My copy was pretty scratched from overplay and lending it out to some folks so I remastered it and made it sound really sweet. The copy I purchased can't even compare! Which makes me wonder, who converted the album for amazon.com and what did they pay because if you want to pay me to remaster LPs, well here I am! If you have the album, just burn it yourself until a remastered cd comes out.
Got this a long time ago and never could figure out why the bugger won't download. anyone help? it has been flustering.
For an album titled "Disco Inferno", there isn't much of it. The song is 10 minutes 47 seconds long, and here you get less than a 4 minute excerpt. Gee thanx.
I downloaded, listened to and then deleted this album. I then tried to post my comment. It was never posted because evidently you may not have a negative opinion. I have been in the Music Business for over thirty years. I have worked with and enjoyed many, many styles of music. This is not one of them.
This album is pretty much terrible. I agree with some of the reviews where it sounds like they didn't even try when they made this album. I make really bad songs in Garage Band which sound better than some of these songs.For some reason they thought half the songs should be sung by the keyboardist, these tracks are especially bad.If you're interested in Ghostland Observatory, check out their previous albums Paparazzi Lightning, Robotique Majestique and even Delete.Delete.I.Eat.Meat. But whatever you do, don't listen to this album if you haven't heard any before it. I was contemplating giving this album 2-stars because they're a great show live, but this is just bad.
Being an Austin resident it is hard to avoid hearing this band's name brought up quite a bit. For all of the talk about Austin being the greatest Music Town around, very few bands actually come out of Austin and find success. So, I decided to see what the hype was all about. Well, after buying and listening to this garbage, I am still wondering. Just not innovate, entertaining or particularly good music. Sounds like two guys that got a keyboard and a mixing board and decided to screw around. Mercifully it is a very short album.
If ever there was an award for the worst vocals I have ever heard it would be THIS person.After hearing this steaming turd I did a little research on Ernest Kohl. I have NO idea who writes his bio peices but I kid you now, he is referred to as being an "international superstar" and how he tops world charts!!WHICH charts exactly? Most certainly not national charts. I've never heard of this guy, and I dance music from the 80s to now is my thing.Ernest Kohl is literally fooling himself if he believes for a second that he has a grain of talent, or that he is a star on any scale.So this album, the productions are beyond dated, tinny, and the vocals are just hideous, and that is being very kind. The writing is so bad, it's just a wonder this album secured any form of distribution.This album and artist is to be avoided at all costs, if you don't want irreversable damage to your ears.It's the musical equivalent of getting repeatedly stabbed in the head and will actually drive you insane.A HIDEOUS MESS and an embarrassment to good dance music.
This is not a critique of the music, but of the distribution. The music is recorded as one long continuous stream of music, indexed into 8 pieces. Amazon simply rips the disc and saves them as eight individual songs. Thus, playing the album back as eight MP3's results in half-second pauses that at some points is quite jarring. Since the MP3 standard requires a (very brief) moment of silence at the beginning and end of every song, joining the eight songs requires a lot of manual work.Skip this trouble and buy the CD. Then use the "rip as single track" option on any number of available programs.
Doesn't sound like nature anything to me......I wonder where this was supposedly recorded? Judge for yourself....missed the boat completely.I don't think the studio is nature.
I have to say, I was very dissapointed in this purchase, I was expecting good dubstep with bassdrops and non-repetitive music. But no, that's exactly what I got. I guess if you like that kind of non-exciting music then you're in luck.
I should know better.  I fell in love with one track "The Moon is Gone" after hearing it played on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic show, and figured there had to be at least a few other gems on the CD. Nothing else on the disc lives up to that standard.  And yes, I previewed some of the others, but the preview windows are generally too short or placed in portions where one can't get an accurate idea of what the track actually sounds like.Too bad, I wanted to like this album...
Although I own only one Cruxshadow's CD, Fortress in Flames (which I like very much), I am perturbed by the number of times the same songs seem to reappear on subsequent discs.  This discs has 5 songs that appear on Fortress in Flames!  Are they running out of ideas or what?  I will wait for new material thank you.
I came across this on Spotify and listened to a few tracks and boy do they stink! Not that any of these songs are great to start -- the cream of the crop when it comes to pop drivel -- but Jesus H. Christ are these mediocre. Just really sub-par recordings with low rent backup singers not trying very hard and failing very hard. My question still stands: Why does this exist?
The sound is decent but a bit generic. The songs lack change and energy. As an overall the album could be better with a remixes and vocals instead of the boring and flat ebbs and flow.
I have A flock of bleeps and The last days of gravity and I am still amassed about the creativity of this band...I just love it! On the other hand, Vaccine does not even resemble Youngr brother, is just a guy with a bad case of &#34;mangina&#34; doing musical soap opera or the equivalent of a B minus movie. I decided not to delete this album for the posibility, in the future, that I might want to put a bullet in my head and I would need a little more encouragement.
Click on "Wagner Tunes" and you get thirty seconds of Gustav Mahler.  It would be nice to have a good source of classical music themes to use as ringtones, but this ignorant mash of excerpts from public domain recordings isn't it.
I listened to several tracks on this album. I wouldn't recommend buying it.The tracks were mixed by a total amateur and sound quality is horrible. :(
Do not buy this album!!! With all the AMAZING dnb/dubstep out there from UKF, Hospitality, and GetDarker this album can't even compare! Biggest waste of money I've ever spent on an album! The mixes are GOD AWFUL... not even mixed! Plus, they have this intermittent robot voice saying "ministry of sound" throughout the mixes.... Go download UKF's BASS CULTURE if you want a good album of this nature. Ministry of sound is DEAD!!!
If you're looking for the gorgeous Mark-Almond "New York State of Mind" in which there are people actually singing the song -- this isn't it.
Save your money. The tracks on this album are extreme over cooked with vocals and cliche riffs. I am disappointed because I have heard BT live with some amazing progressive works recently which i was hoping to hear on this album. This is not it.I feel as if BT is more concerned with getting the next big dance track hit. All the songs are misses.I like BT and his earlier works. However he is going in the wrong direction.Sorry BT.
Just wanted the single of the radio version.  It was my mistake and I should have paid more attention. Oops!
Thought I was getting the actual track, not some crappy remix of the original song. Felt like I was buying some kind of Chinese knock-off like Samsrung instead of Samsung
My daughter heard this song and wanted it. Unfortunately I did not check out the lyrics before I purchased it. They are sexually explicit and vulgar.
It's not often I find myself completely unable to finish listening to a film score due to me hating it so much, but that's what happened with Hanna - twice. A contemporary thriller directed by Joe Wright (who previously directed the Oscar-winning Atonement), Hanna stars Saoirse Ronan as the eponymous character, a 16-year old assassin who has been trained by her father (Eric Bana) to be a perfect, and totally unlikely, slaughter machine. When Hanna is dispatched to a remote part of Europe on a mission, the baby-faced killer finds herself having to fight for her own life when she is targeted for elimination by government operatives with a covert agenda of their own. The film also stars Cate Blanchett, Tom Hollander, Olivia Williams and Jason Flemyng, and has garnered generally positive reviews, not least for Ronan's star performance.Before I launch into my appraisal of the score, let me make a few things absolutely clear. First, I am not a reviewer who only likes orchestral scores. All-electronic scores, when done with panache and expertise and creativity, entertain me as much as orchestral scores do, especially when the uniqueness of the electronic sound palette gives the film an extra edge. Secondly, I am not a reviewer who looks down on artists from the rock and pop world writing film scores. I own, and have enjoyed, scores by the likes of Daft Punk, Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead, Arcade Fire, Charlie Clouser from Nine Inch Nails, and several others, most of whom are much more well known for music other than film music. I have always said that I would love to hear what bands like Within Temptation, Evanescence or Rammstein would do if offered a film score. I'm all for giving everyone a chance.Having said that, I found this score by The Chemical Brothers to be utterly intolerable. The Chemicals Brothers - Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons - were groundbreaking pioneers when they first emerged into the Manchester big beat electronic dance movement in England in the 1990s, and so I absolutely acknowledge their fine musical pedigree in their chosen genre. Unfortunately, film music, with all its subtleties and nuances, seems to be completely beyond them. Hanna is a complete and utter mess, an incessant and dramatically incomprehensible set of dance music tunes that do nothing to illustrate the film's dramatic arc, offer no commentary on the story, or even provide much substance as a standalone listening experience.The best cues of the entire score are the first and last ones, beginning with "Hanna's Theme", in which layered vocals sing a sweet, almost lullaby-ish motif over a minimalist, almost Philip Glass-style electronic pulse. It sets up Hanna's child-like nature and sweet demeanor, as well as her navet&eacute;, despite her ruthlessness as an assassin, and has a good recapitulation in a breathy, almost orgasmic vocal version at the very end of the score. The second cue, "Escape 700", isn't too bad either - a more upbeat, driving electronic rhythm with wavering chords over the top and a throwback 1980s sound that has a cool nostalgic appeal. So far so good, you think. But then it all goes downhill.Cues like "Chalice 1", "Map Sounds/Chalice 2" and "Isolated Howl" are little more than space invader-style sound effects tracks. "The Devil is in the Details" is simply bizarre, a calliope-inspired ditty which sounds like it should be accompanying a pre-school children's TV show like the Teletubbies. "The Forest" sounds like a minute or so of mutated, distorted whale song heard through a closed door. "The Sandman" sounds like a music box ballerina whose batteries are running low. The first minute of "Bahnhof Rumble' - which ostensibly is an action cue - sounds like raindrops combined with the sampled sound of a microwave hum, before eventually picking up a set of cymbals and a more strident beat towards the end of the cue. And so on and so forth..."The Devil is in the Beats" revisits the Teletubbie theme from earlier in the score, and overlays it with a harder and more pulsating beat, sampled vocals, and a sound which can only be described as someone doing unspeakable things to a Theremin. This theme appears again, in a very mutated form, towards the end of "Grimm's House". A couple of cues at the end - "Hanna vs. Marissa" and the nightclub-friendly "Escape Wavefold" - do raise the tempo somewhat with accelerated rhythmic elements and a more energetic attitude, but it's all too little to late, and even these pieces seem astonishingly simplistic in their construction, and of course they never miss an opportunity to layer in a grinding noise or an industrial sample akin to fingernails down a blackboard. The "Special Ops" cue, as well as the conclusive "Container Park", are especially nightmarish in this regard.It was all I could do to muster the intestinal fortitude to listen to this soundtrack enough times to be able to form an opinion of the entire score. I don't enjoy writing reviews like this. I want each new score to be great, and to impress me. But Hanna was so jaw-droppingly awful and inappropriate, showed such little understanding of the narrative requirements of film music, and contained so many bizarre and wildly out of place samples that I had a burning desire to say something about it. I dare say that fans of the band, as well as admirers of hard electronica, will love it; I have read numerous reviews online about how bold and daring and original and fresh and uncompromising it is, each written by mainstream critics who look down on traditional film music like it was beneath them. To those people, I say this: I'm happy that you like it. Knock yourself out. But I won't be listening to this score ever again, and it's only because the opening "Hanna's Theme" is OK that it gets a single, solitary star.
Lee Fields should stick with the arrangements and instrumentation that he knows.  This album is a poorly executed attempt at updating Mr. Fields sound to something more like modern R&B; and it fails miserably.  There's not a single song that is memorable and Mr. Fields' vocals sound terribly out of place.  The lyrics are trite.  The music is a horrible panache of differing styles and even the addition of some real keyboards and wah guitar on the last few songs can't elevate this album out of the morass of crapitude it exists in.Prior to hearing this album, I would have said that I love Mr. Fields' work; now I have to say that I love most of his work.  This album is terrible and will get absolutely no more listening time from me; once was enough.(I even removed it from my iTunes immediately after my post-rip listening session.)
The ONLY song I want here is Peter Brown's &#34;Crank It Up&#34;.  NO WAY am I buying the entire album for one song!
the beat is not so bad, and she has a great voice, but the lyrics suck. like a 10 year old girl wrote them.
If this annoying collection of electronic noise pollution is considered to be music,then so is my car horn and telephone ringer.
I've listened and I have to agree with the 1-star reviewer.I too became a music lover in the late '60s and the '70s.It seems to me that music should have musical instruments,such as a guitar, piano, bass, drum, saxophone, horn, or organ.None of which I hear here.I don't hear anything that qualifies this as music as I've known it.
Love Michael Posner...not Michael POSER. Bought this on accident because I was distracted while searching for &#34;Cooler than me.&#34; Didn't even notice the missing N.  It's some weird dance-club/remix song that repeats the same line over and over...would not suggest!
Gee, sure sounds veeeeeery similar to Ghosts n Stuff... Care to find some new ideas Skrillex or are you too exhausted from pressing play on your macbook?
This album is a cheap bootleg from Russia. The quality is bad and not comparable with the originals. You should download only legal material from CHILLY in perfect quality.

remix, not the original, horrible version. Now I will need to delete it. Its too bad I can't return it.
I was hoping this was a mix of real songs there all garbage. Miss leadingshould have been more clear these arnt the real songs
NOTE TO THE AMAZON REVIEWER: Please stop rejecting my submission. My submission DOES NOT violate any of the Amazon's guidelines. Get a grip!.Now, the review for the third time. In Spanish and in English:Este album consiste de mucha music electronica no muy agradable y no tiene las canciones de le pelicula del mismo nombre (Alejandro Fernandez, Julieta Venegas, Molotov, Kinky, etc.). Dudo mucho que este sea le soundtrack de la pelicula.---This album consisst of not very enjoyable electronic music, but it doe snot have the many songs in the movie with the same (alejandron Frenandex, Julieta Venegas, Molotov, Kinky, etc.)  I doubt this album is the soundtrack of the movie.
this song sucks. worst remix ever. dont waste your money.go buy a pie from mcdonalds instead or coke. its not worth a dollar.i turn it on to get my little brothers out of my room
not the real song...very dissappointed.  When you listen to the sample it sounds like the real song.. waste of money.  There should be some type of note to specify this.
"Please write at least 20 words describing your experience with this item. Repeated words don't count.":abominable, alarming, appalling, atrocious, awful, bad,  deplorable, depressing,  distressing, dreadful, ghastly,  harrowing, hideous, horrendous, horrible, horrific, horrifying,  repulsive, terrible,  unpleasant
Not sure who performs this, but it isn't the LMFAO version, needs to be more clearly labeled that it is a replica
This cover has little to no redeeming qualities. I do not like the original Party Rock Anthem, so I thought I would give the cover a try. Do not make the same mistake I did. You will be regretting the loss of a dollar that you could have spent on something more useful. Or given to a homeless man. Or drawn on. Or fed to a goat. Literally any other use of a dollar would be better than wasting it on this cover.
I'm not sure why someone would waste their money on the Bollywood version of Party Rock Anthem, especially since the actual version is currently 0.49! Don't waste your money on a terrible "cover" of the song, and go buy the real thing.
i want a refund but i cant figure out how to get one! paying almost a buck for 30 seconds of a track is not cool.
Come on,this is actually more than one band playing the same song over & over?Really?I almost fell asleep during the 1st sample.
The music is limited so much it is hard to listen to very long at all at a loud volume.  the music is so so.  Seems like the sort of thing people think is "cool" when it is really not.  Not my sort of thing.  I guess I just don't like this sort of music either.  I've been enjoying Sweedish House Mafia and Zedd, stuff like that much more.  This was a letdown.
Pretty much unlistenable except for Bob Marley's Sun Is Shining, which is genius!This style of non-music sort of proves that point that 99% of everything is pretty bad, but even within a pile of garbage there can be a pure gem ... it's the Bob Marley, Sun Is Shining mix ... get it individually and save your ears and your money.
I really could not appreciate the samples, becuase there is not enough time in play to know whats going on in the track or what the track is all about. The sample are too short. As a DJ I have to decide whether I want to buy a track that is instrumental or vocal. One of the tracks I was not sure what the hell the track was about since it repeated the same intro over and over and when it got what ever the lyric may have been about the sample ended.
Like the original song but the sound quality is terrible for this version. Sounds like it was recorded directly from a car radio.
hi I have 35 days and I not reciep my cd and I have my order number but I can't do nothing with that so I still waitin for
I've never heard this Mr Catera before, but what he's done to the legacy of this great composer should be illegal!Please understand -- I'm not a snob. I have a lifelong love of baroque music, from E. Power Biggs and Glenn Gould to more "commercial" stufflike those "Switched on Bach" albums from the 70s (which I admit I don't much care for). I thought this would be rather like that.Instead what I got was incoherent swill that would have Bach turning in his grave!Personally, I blame the education system that puts "art rock" on the same level as honest-to-goodness music. Is this what happens whenyoung composers are forced to listen to John Cage and his "machine music" ?I wouldn't play this again if I were trying to torture Manuel Noriega with it!
Maybe chillout/lounge music has to be monotonous as such, but this album takes it to the extreme. One single chord streched up to 6 mintues, without any highlights or surprises for all tracks. All "artists" from Cane Garden Bay records try to show their skills which rather ends being embarassing as all of them sound equal and equally boring.The whole chillout/lounge music scene suffers from such wannabe artists with their dilettantish sequencer playing. I doubt any of them even knows why the black keys are there on their keyboards.
I love "trouble so hard" in the original folk version or the Moby version as Natural Blues.  This music bears no relation to the song I can see... a bunch of hissing turntable flipping, no song, no melody.  If you want some techno club music that just sounds generic and unidentifiable, it's OK.  I didn't.  After nothing happened for 3 minutes I fast forwarded through it, nothing ever happened as far as I heard.  I wasted $1.59.  The only time I have bought something on Amazon that was nothing like I expected.If you know the performers and what they do, maybe you'll love it.  If you want the title song, you won't.UPDATE:OK, I missed it.  The vocal from "Trouble So Hard" starts at 3:26 and runs more or less straight until about 4:17, then resurfaces garbled until about 4:27, then is there under the overlay of club music to about 6:00.  So about 1/4 of the track has apparently a copy of Vera Hall's recording of "trouble so hard" in it.  After listening to it a half dozen times, it's sort of growing on me..but I start at 3:26.  I'd still much rather have a straight recording of "trouble so hard" instead of some of the song wrapped over around and under with club music, but since the sample piece was club music, it's my fault.  Anyway, that's what you get!
Just found out that Jet had disbanded so I thought I would check out what the brothers were doing.  Not impressed, but only listened to the samples.  I think the doom-disco is just that...doom...
I downloaded this album for a halloween party and was very disappointed.  From the samples I thought the songs would be cool dupstep remixes of classic well known halloween songs, but they were terrible.  I had to turn it off because people and my party were complaining. DO NOT BUY!!! WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
This made me want to take a nap, not go for a run! It was way too slow. I may update this review if I find a use for this music, but for running it's a no go.
How are these dubstep anthems?  Half of them aren't even legitimate releases on legitimate labels.  Moreover, a majority of these tracks aren't even mastered! This is a joke, if you want a GOOD dubstep compilation for 2012, go withThis Is Dubstep 2012 (GetDarker Presents) [Explicit].  Your ears will be thanking me later.
