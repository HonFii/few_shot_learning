This album marks the recorded beginning of the Marco Benevento and Joe Russo Duo. This eponymous release is usually referred to as "Debut" or "Benevento/Russo Duo." Predating the band's use of gadgets such as electronic drums, this organic album plays straight organ jazz. It's all too easy to describe this as 'organ trio jazz,' despite there only being two musicians. It seems that from the beginning, Benevento and Russo had a remarkable ability to create a large sound. The music is very improvisational and leans heavily into psychedelia. Thus this adventure is very jamband friendly. "Debut" contains a combination of studio and live performances. While certain tracks wander through the avant-garde, others really cook. 'Improv 1' and 'Improv 2' are especially enjoyable.  "Debut" has two issues. First, while these guys have always had a signature sound, there's also the sense that nothing is being done here that hasn't been done before. The songs aren't especially compelling and much of "Debut" sounds like run-of-the-mill jamband infused jazz. Second, the production is mediocre. Some of the tracks sound like audience recordings made by a fan's taping rig. The album sounds a bit flat as the range lacks dynamic separation. "Debut" is an enjoyable listen, but it works best as an archival record of how the Duo started. Indeed, the issues associated with "Debut" would eventually get worked out with the release of efforts such as "Best Reason to Buy the Sun." Later albums and live performances show a maturation and sonic complexity that in contrast make "Debut" seem primitive. It would be a few years after this release that the band would hone their craft and truly make their mark. "Debut" is a good listen, but one that's best for completists.This product does not have a proper entry in the Amazon database. At the time of review, "Debut" was only listed as an mp3 download. Currently, Amazon does not offer the CD version of this album. The 'hard copy' version of this release exists, but it seems to be out-of-print and unavailable through Amazon.
Hoped for something more instrumental, closer to the Gotan Project. The vocals are kinda generic, what's heard of the traditional instruments is enjoyable, but it can't compete with bands like the aforementioned Gotan Project. Too poppy and generic.
it's not bad his new stuff is still better though. if you're in the more ambien type music this one's for you
Deadmau5 has come a long way since this album but it's not to say that this album is a dud. Anyone who appreciates free-spirited electronica and Deadmau5 in general will like the album. I find the track "8bit" quite interesting, true to its name and probably my favorite track on the disc. Anyone looking for Mau5's breakthrough material will want to check out "Random Album Title" and "For Lack of a Better Name".
Demons is Jon's debut work on his new label, after leaving the defunct Grand Central Records.  Having been a fan of his last 2 releases (they still get major play in my collection), I snatched up this EP immediately. Unfortunately, this work presents only roughly half of what I appreciate from Jon Kennedy.If your a fan of the Ninja Tune label, trip hop, Tru Thoughts label, DJ Shadow, etc, but haven't checked out Jon Kennedy, then please, by all means, stop reading and check out Useless Wood Toys and Bring My Drum To England.  For the sake of brevity I'll leave it at that.  What I appreciate about this genre and similar artists to Jon, is that they take the great beats of hip hop and typically add a rich and complex other layer (Jazz for example), rather than having someone rap over the beats.  DJ Shadow was once asked why in his early work there were rap-less tracks, to which he replied it would make the tracks "too confining".  I agree, lyrics can be confining.  Unfortunately, 2 out of these 6 tracks feature rap, which, since we are talking about an EP, leave roughly half of this album feeling confined and uninspired. If you are looking for rap, you can do much better elsewhere, this is not his strength by any means.  All I can say is that I am happy that this album was not my first introduction to his work.
Maybe too much British mope-rock is making me cynical. But there seems to be something almost calculatedly sunny about the Rondo Brothers' debut, "No Time Left On Earth." Lite hip-hop gets smothered in bright tropical tunes and airy electronic swooshes -- it doesn't actually get to be as fun as it sounds."Check your wife at the door, check your child at the door with your wife," a loud voice says, right before an upbeat little ukelele starts to go. It gives way to a trippy, watery little tune called "Aquarium Blues," complete with bluesy vocals and an intensely summery little pop melody.Unfortunately, it and the rest of the album sound like the Muzak for a Hawaiian resort -- fun and pretty, sometimes quite catchy, and with plenty of rapid percussion, fun samples and the odd hip-hop or alt-rock rhythms. But it always feels sugary and a bit artificial, and lacking in musical substance.Halfway through, it begins to redeem itself with the eerie "Ghost Story Part 1" and the rolliking rock tune "Hey Stewardess." The second half is certainly a bit more diverse, and it has a somewhat more mature sound. But it's back to the all-too-sunny Hawaiian pop sound, sprinkled with the odd good song full of tropical funk, psychedelic rap and eerie pop tune.Sunny music is not a bad thing in itself -- look at the Polyphonic Spree and Pizzicato Five. But I can only stand so much ukelele, paired with songs that seem tailor-made for Poach Stevens to sing, "Go poo-poo! Go poo-poo!" and happily launch off a profanely tongue-in-cheek rap. At least it ends on a suitably eerie note with the second part of "Ghost Story."Perhaps the biggest problem with this is that sunny sparkling seaside music doesn't mesh so well with Hawaiian hip-hop. If the boys had done one or the other, this would probably be stunning. As it is, it feels like an uncomfortable fusion that is too sweet for its emo and hip-hop overtones, but too gritty to be on par with similarly sunny bands.I confess, I am not fond of ukelele. In fact, in my mind, it rates right down there with the kazoo and cheap plastic harmonicas. I much prefer it when Jim works his magic with a bass guitar, and the Brothers emphasize the wicked samples and turntabling. At those moments, sunny or not, the Brothers manage to balance out the grit and brightness. Those parts are what give me some hope for this band.The Rondos Brothers definitely gets props for trying something so different, even if it does have ukelele. "No Time Left on Earth" is mostly made of substanceless, sunny pop, but it has moments of sheer musical brilliance that the Brothers will hopefully follow up on.
only a couple of songs on this cd, repeated over. Make sure you like the song first before you buy this album.
The movie Kidulthood wasn't all that. I mean it was not an Oscar movie but the soundtrack is different. Some of Brittains finest are in here.If you like brittish hip hop than this is for you.
I consider myself to be a die hard fan of Louie Vega. Any time the man is spinning in L.A. I'm there, and it's usually on a Sun, but I'll suffer the next day just to hear his vibes live. Like one of the reviewers said I've some of his songs, though not all of them. However, I don't feel like this is some of Louie's best work overall. There is something missing on some of these tracks/mixes "I can't believe I loved her" Calypso Mix and "Casio's Theme" are probably my least favorite on the cd. "I can't believe I loved her" lacks depth to me. It's so much drum machine in my ear that I can't really appreciate the piano part at all. If I had been able to hear more of this cd before I purchased it, I probably would have purchased two maybe three songs off this cd. "Closer (King Street Moody Club)" "Bar A Thym" in a nut shell is what I appreciate about Louie Vega. I'm still a die hard fan, but I can honestly say Louie had done much better work on other cds. He can still make me dance my ass off!
I found the music served its purpose as a motivator during my workouts. Good variety and the neccessary beats to drive through the workout.
Play the samples before purchasing the mp3 album.  As of today, the first half of the album is just flat wrong.  No idea what it is actually from, maybe the same album that matches the incorrect cover art?The album itself deserves 5 stars, nothing else quite like it.  This mp3 version deserves maybe 1, as it's... not the dang album.
I had a copy of the CD about 10 years ago (the image with him wearing the cowboy hat on the cover) and I loved it.  It was one of my most played albums at the time.  Well, many moves later I managed to misplace it...so imagine how happy I was to see the MP3 version here!  It was an instant buy.Here is where things get fuzzy for me.  Is this the original version of the album?  Because I really remember a different overall feel to the album.  If this is (at least a partial) remix, are the originals out there somewhere?It's worth having on my ipod either way, I just wish it was more like I remember it...
Compared to El Gordo, And Yet It Moves and Brotherhood of Good Explosions, this one is a miss.  A few tracks (such as Phree) come through and shine, but the rest is very much forgettable, if not down right &#34;skip-able&#34;.  Still a fan of the artist.
All cuts here are not bad, if you likeTechno-Cyber-Punk, but the real gemsare the covers of Southern Girls (Che-apest Trick remix) and especially #7She's Tight (by: Razed in Black). I wasa bit disappointed to not see Big Black's'He's A Whore', but I'll check other CTtributes that may be floating around onamazon.com or amazon.ca. Pretty good pickup for the adventurous!
I'm not going to get into a big review of the actual quality of this album vs others or even the previous release this artist had with the boy band O-Zone. I stumbled onto the song Whap-pa through finding out "where are they now?" of the band O-Zone and the song just stuck in my mind. My kids loved the artsy bright colored video and beat and most of the songs are quite nice from a beat. There's a few strange things I don't quite get like the syncopated beat of something that sounds like wine glasses breaking on the floor in the Whap-Pa remix (Track 10), but I like the unique sound of it as a contrast to other American mainstream music. I do need to say that there's a few problems with the Amazon download of the album that you will want to fix -- however don't let what I'm about to say discourage you from buying the music because it's not hard to fix the issue at all. Here's the problem -- almost every song is either mis-tagged, mixed up or mis-named. (This is not a purely Amazon issue -- this same album is mixed up differently over on I Tunes.) However, here's how to fix it up like the real CD. (NOTE: When I say *Rename it* I mean the actual file itself that is on the hard drive. Retagging I mean that once you rename it, go to a tag editor and change the tag there to what  you renamed it to and the track it is supposed to be).Track 1 is not Perfect body. Rename it 01 - Whap-pa (original) and then retag it. Track 2 is not Tu Nu. Rename the file 02 - Perfect Body and retag it for track and title. Track 3 is SUPPOSED to be Ya Proshu, but the physical file is wrong. Tracks 3 and 4 are physically switched. So, go to the 04 - Zambesti... and rename it to 03 - Ya Proshu and then retag as appropriate. Simultaneously, rename the original track 3 to 04 - Tu Nu and then retag that. Track 5 is listed as "fly" on Amazon but is actualy Zambesti cu Mine. Rename the physical file and retag. Track 6 is Suna Seara on amazon. Rename it to 06 - Fly and retag it. Track 7 is listed as Leave me Alone on Amazon, but it needs to be renamed as 07 - Suna Seara (then retag). 08 on amazon is listed as Whap-pa but is not. Rename it to 08 - Leave Me Alone and retag. 09 on amazon is listed as Whap-pa. Well that is finally correct, but to distinguish it, I renamed it to 09 - Whap-Pa (English Version) and retagged. Finally Track 10 should be renamed as 10 Whap-pa (RMX RadU) and retagged. Whew!  I don't know how everything got off kilter but if you do as above you'll be fixed up to the right file/tag and match out with the album as available from Radu's website. To the quality -- Amazon's DRM-free high quality MP3s are awesome and the album is cheaper here than on iTunes.
I love house music. Love it. Some releases are meant to be floor fillers and really get you moving. While this is not exactly a snoozer, and a few of the artists have been in the scene for a while (Joi Cardwell, Ananda Project, Mateo & Matos), this release would be better suited for a come-down, post party therapy, rather than something you would play for one. Not "essential", but a good listen nonetheless.
Happy and upbeat are two descriptions other reviewers have mentioned and I agree for the most part.  Compared to his awesome and highly recommended earlier mix, Homegrown, there's something missing here.  Whereas Homegrown was a simple but serious house journey, this feels more like a lot of different songs jammed together.  The transitions between songs are jarring at some points in the mix and the songs themselves are filled with excess noise that heaped on one another get to be a little much.  By the time the mix ends your ears will appreciate the silence.I can't complain too much as I got the mix here on Amazon for a buck.  Given a choice, I much prefer Homegrown so check that one out first.
This sort of thing might be your cup of tea or it might not; the previews should be enough for you to decide. It's well done for what it is. Track #2 is mislabeled as a cover of Enjoy The Silence; it's actually a cover of Never Let Me Down Again. (This is true of all digital versions of the album from all sources; I have never seen a CD copy.)
As the title of my review indicates, the artist is mislabeled. I was looking for Hip Hop and wound up with Techno/Trance music. It's okay, but....Always listen to the samples before you purchase the music.Lesson learned.I gave it three stars to be fair. I don't really like their music style, but that's my personal preference. I didn't want to give it a one or two star review, however, I also didn't want to just hand out a five star review for music I don't appreciate either. I gave it three stars so I could write a review to help other purchasers know who the actual artist was. i figured three stars would be average (as in "it's okay").
The tracks are great. Unfortunately, the digital version cuts out most of the good stuff. I was listening to Pandora and found a few tracks that I liked so I ended up getting the physical 2 CDs. I've bought over a dozen albums off Amazon but this one was a bit of a disappointment considering how many tracks were left out. Get the Physical CDs or download the rest of the tracks elsewhere.
I bought this for the track "Liquid Stranger on the Run (2007 Mix)" and took a chance that I would enjoy the rest of the production: I do. This artist clearly draws from a number of genres, puts them into a blender, and what you get is a tasty smoothie (if you like electronic music). The tracks thankfully don't instill d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, yet none of them stand out to me other than the song I purchased this for ("Liquid Stranger on the Run", probably due to its bombastic but delightful vocals).This release is creative, but not addictive. It holds much promise, yet fails in delivering a steadily persuasive stream of sound that doesn't become tiresome. The Invisible Conquest would make fine background music for a party where people are using mind-altering substances, with the added benefit of possibly encouraging people to dance around at times.Goes well with headphones and sobriety also.Surely it won't blow you away, but it is worth adding to your collection.
Tug of War was surprisingly good considering Colton Ford isn't exactly known for his music.  The first half of the CD is a nice blend of dance rhythms, but the second half has too many ballads for my taste.  Also, the single "That's Me" is a lot better with the Caswell rap during the breakdown, like the video.  But overall a good CD that's much better than expected!
Some nice surprises here -- "Tug of War" is a sultry winner with some great falsetto work (just steer clear of the shorter remix, a horrible cheesy dance fluff confection) -- but the album isn't a complete success because it's weighted down with too many generic, forgettable ballads. Even some of the upbeat numbers lack originality or a strong melodic line.  Still, Ford shows promise, and I hope that he searches out better material.
LotusCopy/Paste/Repeat(Lotus Vibes)US release date: 6 November 2007UK release date: Available as importby Tony SclafaniTalk about taking a surprising career turn. Copy/Paste/Repeat, the new remix CD from the Philadelphia, PA jam band Lotus, takes a totally different direction than you'd expect after the band's previous release, the live Escaping Sargasso Sea. That double CD showed the five-member band stretching its jazz-flecked electronic-based music out into improvisational on-stage jams.Copy/Paste/Repeat (subtitled "Lotus Remixed") completely eschews that approach and pushes the band headlong into bona fide electronic dance music. Here, a handful of DJs tweak tracks from previous Lotus releases with mostly positive results. While it can't be considered a new direction for the band per se, the fact that Lotus conceived such a CD shows the band's uniqueness. What other jam band's music could survive such a treatment?I'm not big on conspiracy theories and speculation, but here goes my attempt at musical psychoanalysis anyway. Lotus' homebase of Philadelphia has always been a dance floor-friendly city. Some of its noteworthy denizens have included the girl group the Orlons, the Philadelphia International production team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, and rappers Schooly D and Will Smith. But most significantly (for our purposes, anyway) was a totally kewl afternoon TV show called Dance Party USA.Yes, Dance Party USA. If you're between the ages of 24 and 40, you probably remember this show as the 1980s counterpart to the old American Bandstand program, where teens danced the weekday afternoons away to the latest hit songs. Both shows, by the way, originated from the Philly area, although Dance Party was filmed in the nearby town of Secane. Dance Party got mocked as a cheesy, low-budget affair where the loud music was bested by the kids' louder clothes. And there's some truth in that (although some of us here may have an affinity for this program because - ahem, cough, cough--we may have danced on it one or twice...although we'd never admit to that in print, of course).Anyway, I contend that Dance Party USA--goofy as it was--was hugely influential and helped spawn the hip-hop explosion of the 1990s. Why? Well, because the program brought cutting-edge dance jams into the living rooms of suburbanites who otherwise would never have heard the stuff. A pre-fame Nine Inch Nails were guests, for example. My guess is that the members of Lotus were influenced by now-forgotten regular Dance Party artists like Leila K ("Got to Get"), Redhead Kingpin ("Pump It Hottie") and India ("The Lover Who Rocks You (All Night)").A natural affinity for dance grooves is what underpins all of Lotus' music and makes the band's new CD in particular work as more than an intellectual exercise. Copy/Paste/Repeat reinvents the jam band's music as dance floor jams, with hip hop and trance-influenced beats and mind-warping electronic synth burbles. That approach is as equally interesting and limiting as you'd expect. Most of the remixes here would get the nightlife crowd at your local club moving, all the while never imagining that the main audience for the band is more likely to wear tie-dye than tight pants. The downside is that the cool rhythms and additional sounds don't quite add up to tracks that work when the listener is away from the dance floor.For this project, Lotus chose songs from its previous two studio CDs, ignoring anything from its 2003 debut effort Germination, and gave them new treatments. Four songs were pulled from the band's 2004 CD Nomad. One of those, "Suitcases", gets a second remix. The bulk of the CD is comprised of new versions of tracks from the band's last studio effort, The Strength of Weak Ties, from 2006. Three of those tunes ("Tip of the Tongue", "When H Binds to O", and "Bubonic Tonic") get more than one remix each.Some of the dial twiddlers include DFA Records' Juan Maclean, who speeds up the previously laidback "Bubonic Tonic" with a tight drum machine pattern that's slightly reminiscent of late 1980s New Jack Swing. San Francisco dance scene veteran DJ Harry overlays spacey synth voicings on his reworking of "Tip of the Tongue". That same tune also gets a reggaefied rethink by the electronica group Telepath (called "Tip of the Dub") as well as a house music-influenced remix by Lotus bassist Jesse Miller. Hm...New Jack Swing and house music. Didn't I hear those genres all the time on some long-forgotten TV dance show I used to know? Maybe, maybe not...I'd better move on...The Minnesota-based electro-acoustic artist Skytree (Evan Snyder) chimes in with a mix of one of the band's most popular tunes, "When H Binds to O", that renders it all but unrecognizable. Snyder deletes the main riff and exchanges the heavy Led Zeppelinesque drum sound of the original for a complex, trippy rhythmic pattern. Marc Cazorla, of the Los Angeles-based experimental rock band the Frequency, turns the previously stompy "Travel" into airy Enigma-like trance music.If all this experimentation gets you in the mood to try your hand at some remixing yourself, you're in luck. Lotus is letting its fans engage in a make-your-own-remix contest by offering the source files of the track "Bubonic Tonic" on its Web site (look towards the bottom-right on the "News" page). The band will eventually choose its favorite submissions and feature them on the site.Virtually all of the 12 tracks included here have the rump-shaking potential envisioned by their respective remixers. What keeps this disc from being transcendent is that most of these mixes don't really improve on the original tracks. Nor do they bring out elements that lend a new dimension to this music. My positive impression is largely due to the band's audacious concept. Copy/Paste/Repeat represents a bold step for a band that clearly does not want to be pigeonholed, and is succeeding in keeping those who would typecast them uncertain. What is certain, I believe, is that Lotus has some Dance Party USA in its collective unconscious. If anyone bumps into Jesse Miller, please ask him for me if he remembers a blonde hostess from a TV dance show who went by the moniker "Princess". Betcha he'll know who I'm talking about.-- From Pop Matters, 14 January 2008
i downloaded the mp3 album.there are a few really nice tracks on this album.its worth a listen.there are no "annoying garbage " tracks on this album.safe buy.
The program is great for beginners. The music could be better - it gets boring. Overall it is easy to follow.
I have listened to quite a bit of this type of music, although I would not consider myself an expert who can name all the bands and all the albums.That said, "World of Sleepers" wasn't all that dreamy an experience for me. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's in the middle of the pack. Also, it is my opinion that the rating of 5 stars is awarded much too easily by many Amazon reviewers.
The first self-titled album by Shanghai Restoration Project was a winner on all fronts - creating a wonderful, unique, and quite exciting fusion of eastern and western music.This release I found quite disappointing.  Now, I realize it's "Story of a City" - so I expected a lot of vocals - and that was delivered.  The vocals overall were pretty good.  A lot of different talent, and different styles.  But very, very subtle in the inclusion of eastern instruments and influences - everything that made the original so amazing.I would definitely recommend listening to the previews and seeing if this album is for you, but it's a long ways off from the self-titled release on many fronts and although stellar production value - it falls short on it's delivery and expectations.
As with Shai Linne's previous jointSolus Christus ProjectThe Atonement, as can be judged by the title of his sophomore CD, is a weighty subject based CD that you'd do well to listen to over a cup of coffee or tea.The Subject matter The Atonement, relates to God' great love for us, personified through the Live, death & resurrection of God's Only Son, Jesus Christ, and includes songs relating to the death of Jesus (Were you There,& The Cross) celebrating the fact that he is alive & living today( Jesus is Alive) among other topics.Pros: As with most Lampmode CDs this is a very useful tool for strengthen your walk with Christ. Whilst I might not bump these tunes in my ride, I do listen to them on my Hi-fi system and bible in hand.Cons: the interludes, whilst interesting on the first or second play, become items that you fast forward on further plays. Whilst I can't criticize the subject matter on display, some of the production/music doesn't live up to the great lyrics on display (In Adam all Die, Were You There? The Cross)Favourite tracks: School Daze, Mission Accomplished, The Gospel
...but I don't care at all for any of the dance hall remixes.  If its available on an album I'd rather have purchased that instead, or just the single lead track.
I must confess to finding this release a disappointment. Brett Garsed and T.J. Helmerich are two amazing talents and even if not exactly household names they are undoubtedly amongst the finest and most individual stylists in the history of the electric guitar. This makes it all the harder to comprehend why they would record their 3rd CD as a vocal album with hardly any guitar solos. Their previous releases "Quid Pro Quo" and "Exempt" did have vocals but in the main were powerhouse fretboard workouts that ALL guitar fans should seek out.Helmerich here (I am assuming) is leading the way, with much emphasis on engineering and tonal effects and he provides some quite impressive vocals. In my opinion the songs are patchy, with a surprising amount of acoustic backing initially. A couple of the numbers reminded me of Led Zeppelin's softer material but the songwriting is inconsistent and some of the shorter tracks are experimental and just don't cut it - "King of Neglect" and "Simon Says" with it's megaphone vocal being a case in point. The latter would have sounded better with King's X singer Doug Pinnick on vocals"Giant" has more than a shade of Bowie's Scary Monsters" period while "Vicodin" is the sort of atmospheric instrumental that I was hoping to hear in greater abundance. The later tracks are more electronica than rock, but the album closer "Bad Luck Go Away" is a classy guitar instrumental that features melodic playing and highlights what's missing for most of the preceding 40 or so minutes.These players went on to record the two "Uncle Moe" albums subsequently but they're both in such demand as teachers, or session heads or engineers (in Helmerich's case) that neither is that prolific in terms of regular record releases. The CD (released in the late 90's) has been out of print for years but this download is not really representative of what these guys can do, and as such I find it hard to recomend to any but the most commited of fans. Listen before buying!
I personally prefer "Spirals and Mazes", but this album has it's great points. It's great for a debut album, showing a range of emotions and music styles to connect to musically. Though good, this album leaves much room for growth as a musician, growth that the artist does achieve in her next album. It's really amazing to hear the contrast between both.
the 2cd of Dockstader's pretty amazing 3-part series of electronic music, all derived from short wave radio. I used to have #1 on cd, which was great stuff. Just downloaded #1 and #2. the audio quality sounds murky, distortion happens frequently, even on a good system at moderate volume, & the breaks between "songs" are choppy, sound like the music was just chopped out. It was--& the results are jarring & upsetting.Regardless of sound quality, the music here is pretty amazing, much of it beautiful, some wild & weird, all of it complex with many sound ideas overlapping, permutating & interweaving.. giving it a rich, flowing DEEP sound. my star rating is strictly for the music itself, not the MP3 quality.
Take Mad Blunted Jazz, sprinkle it with Substances and DJ Kicks, then dunk it in Soulshine and the like, and there you have it. A blend of Cam styles from over the years- jazz, hip-hop, soul, etc. However, it's nothing over the top exciting. It's good, clean Cam, but it's not going to shatter the earth, not that it has to at all to be a 5 star effort, but this just feels a little too OK for me. Nothing bad to say, nothing great to say, so try it for yrself if you'd like.
As a person who has been writing electronica for about twelve years now I believe I may have a somewhat unique perspective on this record. No, it's not Spiral, or Hate Machine, or Broken, and Year Zero sounded not so great so I didn't buy that one either. This record is good for ten/five bucks; it's a lot of music but this is a case of quantity over quality. So on to my overall take.When you write electronic music, you have to create what are called "patterns", sequences of anywhere from 4 to 32 bars that repeat which play the same "line", (collection of notes, scales, chords, a melody in other words). Sometimes when you sit down to write it all flows and an entire song grows out of the process-it creates itself.On the other hand........sometimes you get three or four "parts" that sound good but the rest of the song refuses to complete itself. You find yourself with 2-3 minutes of really interesting music.....and no additional transition or new part to flesh it out. I have done (written and recorded) collections similar to this one.....and I can tell you (in my opinion) this sounds like Reznor sat down with a few friends and "notebooked" a bunch of musical ideas. Some of them are full-fledged songs (the ones over 2-3 minutes in length) and have somewhat of a structure. These songs (and a lot of them are mainly piano) are extremely good! Others (many others, most of the songs actually) sound like songs that refused to complete themselves-parts or patterns that are only portions of what we would expect a full song to sound like. What is usually done is that you take the best ideas and put them together into some songs and you trashcan the "remnant portions". In this case Reznor recorded and published the parts you would usually trashcan alongside the fully completed songs.What do I think of the record? I applaud Reznor for coming up with something that is different than normal, and I think the "throw in the kitchen sink" approach - releasing a whole record full of "ideas", some fully realized, others not - is a good idea. Aphex Twin did something similar to this with his "26 Mixes for Druqcks" 2 Disc set.If this record was priced at the normal 20 bucks for a 2 cd set I would have a much harsher view of it, but since he released it at a roughly ten dollar across the board price, it's probably worth the ten bucks you'll pay for it. A number of other electronic artists that came before (and undoubtedly influenced) Reznor, like Jean-Michel Jarre and the other ambient originators, are represented here; in a way Reznor is continuing an electronic tradition of releasing "ambient" records.There is only one problem with ambient music.....if you are not careful it is easy to create what I call "preset" ambient. Any piece of electronic music gear (keyboard, sequencer, etc) comes with built in sounds called "presets". Usually a lot of them are weird noises, crashes, sound effects, (can you see where I am going with this?) There are WAY TOO MANY songs on here that are just one repeating pattern (the same pattern for 2, 3 minutes) with random sound effects thrown in. Reznor also has the problem (or at least I dislike it) that he is addicted to throwing in huge pulses of distortion and discordant noises at random points during any of the songs. There is a history of this in ambient music, (what is called "Noise" music, such as Merzbow) but I can't stand it. Maybe he was trying to add some noise sensibility in. I know that he did this same thing on "Fragile" and I didn't like it there either, but I know a lot of people did so hey, whatever you're into.These songs, particularly the songs with the overloading bursts of distortion and the ones with one pattern repeating over and over for 2/3 minutes while the sound effects change....I respect Trent Reznor a lot. But in brutal honesty those particular songs sound like a person who managed to tinkle out one neat sounding piano line the first time they started up ProTools or Cakewalk and then dumped a bunch of noise pollution on top of it since they couldn't come up with anything else. Coming from someone else I would write the artist off, but coming from Reznor, since I know he is very talented at composition, it's very disappointing. There is also on this record a distressing tendency for Reznor to play out of key-badly. Yes, I know what dissonance is. And it doesn't work this time around.Overall it was worth ten bucks; as I write this I'm loading the songs I'll actually be listening to onto my computer. Out of the 36 tracks on the record I bothered to load 12 of them onto my computer. The rest (no offense intended Trent) are really.....in my opinion they're really just kind of noise garbage. Coming from someone as talented as Reznor, who has the capability to write full length and very intricate orchestral music, 24 of these 36 are honestly just not the quality of work and composition I expect from someone of Reznor's talent. If the cd had consisted only of those twelve songs I probably would've given it a 4.5 instead of a 3.On the other hand, if I'd written handfuls of records that have sold millions for the last twenty years, who knows what I would have released? I can only judge from the listener's seat.
If you want hear NIN's new sung album, The Slip, download for free at their [..]  The Slip includes the new hit single "Discipline".  Ghosts I-IV is all instrumental, so its quite different from other NIN albums.
The revitalization of Nine Inch Nails might be the coolest story in popular music this decade. Eighteen whole years after Trent Reznor's first album made him an idol of alienated teenagers throughout the land, he mounted a powerful comeback with Year Zero. The teenage angst was replaced by ominous prophecies of doom, and the soundtrack was a combination of harsh digital noise with some of Reznor's most accessible songwriting, with a modern electronic production.After that, Trent regained his confidence. Instead of disappearing for five years, as he had done before, he took only a year to release Ghosts I-IV, an entirely instrumental double album that greatly recalls Aphex Twin's 1994 exercise in minimalism, Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2. Even the presentation is similar -- two discs of untitled tracks, each represented only by a photograph. Except Trent does it better. Many of the photographs (not included in the CD package, unfortunately, but you can download them for free from NIN's website) are beautiful. The muted shots of sky and water fit the mood of the soft tracks very well.More than that, Ghosts I-IV is generally more enjoyable than Aphex Twin's opus. Even the less memorable tracks are, at least, listenable, and most of them are fairly short, so even if your attention starts flagging here and there, at least the record still moves between tones fairly briskly. Whereas Aphex Twin's record had a lot of really beautiful pieces, but also a lot of blatant listener abuse. (2:11, anyone?) This record is not like that. There are loud and cacophonous parts, but they are tame by NIN standards, they tend to be brief, and Reznor's pop sensibility keeps any one sound from overstaying its welcome.However, as with most double albums released by popular musicians, the length is an obstacle. The thing is, all four volumes of Ghosts are fairly similar. Each volume has a couple soft piano bits, a bit of grinding guitar, some weird ambient noise, and so on. It makes it seem like the record is less varied than it really is. Different parts of the record offer different variations on certain basic ideas and tones, but if you listen to the whole thing in one go, it does call attention to Reznor's reuse of those tones. It is better to listen to each volume separately, as many reviewers have recommended. Within each volume, the tones tend to cycle, from loud to soft to in between, so it doesn't feel like any one component is dominant.Also, in my view, the sludgy guitar tracks (I-8, II-10, III-23, IV-29) tend to be unremarkable. Reznor was never much for solos. With the exception of III-27, the most "solo-like" track, the guitar mostly just grinds out basic rhythms. In an instrumental album, without Reznor's newly powerful voice (and Year Zero featured his best vocals to date), this just isn't very interesting.But fortunately, Reznor does much better with other tones. Ghosts features his best, most elegant piano compositions (I-1, II-13, III-22, IV-36). In I-1, the opening track, the piano is joined by a very soft, eerie synthesizer melody that really sets the "ghostly," slightly uneasy dreamlike mood suggested by the album title. In II-12, there is an effective switch from a similar piano melody to a strident mid-tempo rhythm played with increasingly loud feedback, an example of a Ghosts track with internal development.A couple of songs complete the Aphex Twin connection. The queasy echoing sound in II-15 is very Aphex-like, and not too different from, say, 1:2 on Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2. Interestingly, the drums in this track and many others have a kind of rough "organic" sound (as opposed to, say, the very mechanical electronic sound of Year Zero). Then, II-17 uses a very Aphex-like echoing production for a simple guitar rhythm, and III-25 rounds things off with a "bubbling" mixture of odd ambient noises. Though, granted, queasy ambience has always appeared in Trent's music, for instance in "The Downward Spiral."Occasionally there are tracks that don't quite fit into any of the main templates, like II-14, which is based on a shrill, vaguely martial faux-Eastern riff, or III-24, the most "techno-like" song, which brings in danceable beats and electronic bass in addition to the sludgy guitar. A couple of times, Reznor channels his inner Peter Hook and produces some satisfyingly deep bass riffs (I-5, II-18). Especially notable is the interplay between the bass and keyboards in II-18. In III-22, another introspective piano lead is off-set by the effective contrast of crashing drums and a jangly guitar counter-melody.If I had to choose, I'd say that the second volume of Ghosts is the best and most varied overall, but the single best track on the album is IV-28. There is first a long stretch of tentative guitar strumming, which gradually mounts into a steady, rhythmic build-up, softened by gentle production. A similar technique is used in IV-34, with a piano break. If Aphex Twin were to release such a thing now, it would be hailed as a breath-taking return to form.It doesn't make a lot of sense to rate this album on a five-point scale, since you can find tracks on it to fit any rating. The sheer volume of material means that you'll find stuff you enjoy and stuff you don't, and the very loose concept makes it a bit hard to tie all the tracks together and listen to the album as a coherent whole. But it is definitely very different from anything Nine Inch Nails have done before, and it firmly identifies Reznor as a singular musical voice, which perhaps we knew all along. "Industrial music," if that label still applies to NIN, has never had its boundaries pushed as far as on this album.
Last year, Nine Inch Nails bounced back from the artistic decay that was "With Teeth" with "Year Zero", a record that I believe to be Nine Inch Nails' artistic high point, a dense but never fractured album that featured some of his highest production and some of his sharpest songwritting.Now, only a year later, Nine Inch Nails and their leader Trent Reznor, who for all intents and purposes is Nine Inch Nails, have returned with the nearly two hour "Ghosts I-IV", a set of atmospheric instrumentals.Now, if you would have told me even two years ago that the words "prolific" and "Trent Reznor" would ever, EVER be mentioned in the same sentence I would have laughed at you. But apparently after getting sober and getting the awfulness of "With Teeth" out of his system the man is just that. A total of thirty six tracks, "Ghosts" is as sprawling in ambition as "The Fragile", even without the accompaniment of vocals.In fact, this new, quicker working version of Trent Reznor works much better for the music than the one who would spend a good half a decade pain stakingly going over every note. Like "Year Zero" last year, there is an immediacy to "Ghosts" that previous NIN records lacked. Though the record is dense and layered, it is never overblown with needless tinkering and a million small little pops and bells and whistles that can be found on earlier NIN products.It's also nice to see Reznor in a true collaborative spirit, as "Ghosts" is co-written by Atticus Ross and Alessandro Cortino, NIN's current keyboard player. The difference in perspective helps give this record a feel different of any previous Nails album.And let's all be honest with each other: the weakest point to any Nine Inch Nails record has always been the lyrical skills of Reznor. Usually clumsy, occasionally inane, Reznor lets the music do the talking for him this time, which is a nice plus.So why only three stars for this record? Well, because at times "Ghosts" feels like a collection of ideas rather than songs. Though there is nothing awful on this record, there is also very little that is extraordinary, and it is too long for it's own good. The mood swings of the record are all complimented well, but too many song build and build and build and just stop, rather than fully taking off and entering someplace different and more interesting.In fact, the best place to listen to "Ghosts" is probably in your car, late at night, driving home, where it can sink into your head but you're never really paying close attention to it.But "Ghosts" is worth the purchase for sure. It's price, and the quality of good, if rarely great, music, and the fact that after almost twenty years Trent Reznor actually sounds like he's enjoying the process of making music.Hopefully this is a series that he will continue to work on for many years to come.
In theory, I love the idea of an all instrumental Nine Inch Nails album.  Trent Reznor's tortured and perpetually adolescent lyrics don't have the same effect on me that they had when when I was 13 or 14.  They used to scare the crap out of me, but now they seem more childish every day.However, Reznor always makes fascinating musical backdrops.  Reznor's music is challenging and accesible at the same time.  I love his layered and meticulous production.  The music on Ghosts I-IV is almost like a sampler of the various musical styles that he's been through.  You have songs that sound like The Fragile, songs that sound like Year Zero, and songs that sound like With Teeth.  It all features Reznor's typical deft production, except it has more of an ambient slant.So Ghosts I-IV is Reznor's version of Music for Airports.  Having listened to this album closely as well as using it as background music while i'm working, i've got to say it functions better as background music.  Just like Music for Airports is suspose to be the musical equivilent of art hanging on the wall, Ghosts I-IV functions in much the same way.  I wish a close listen was more rewarding, but Ghosts just doesn't bear out close examination.I have to comment on the distribution, which takes the In Rainbows model to the next step.  Instead of paying what you want and getting some low quality MP3s, Ghosts is avaliable at different price levels and the MP3 quality is much better.  You can also get it lossless format.  This is the future of musical distribution.After getting sober, Reznor has either rediscovered his ambition or is bored as hell, because this is his second album in as many years, opposed to twice a decade releases fans have had to endure in the past.  The packaging on the deluxe editions is quite lovely, and the slide show and booklet that come with the download are interesting, especially if you're a fan of musical gear.Ghosts I-IV will definitely please fans of Nine Inch Nails but isn't going to win over any new converts.  It's an interesting experiment, both musically and in marketing.
First and foremost I am a huge NIN fan and rarely find anything unfavorable to say about Trent's work. But, I have to tell you I am very disappointed in this album. I've been wanting Reznor to do an album like this for a very long time and when he finally does he fails to deliver. Don't get me wrong all the tracks are good in their own right, but most tracks don't even reach the 3 minute mark. So when I find myself starting to get into a track it ends like 10 seconds later and leaves you hanging. Leaves little to be desired in my opinion. I love the concept behind the album, but should have had a shorter track list with more substance ala "Leaving Hope" from the "Still" album. Trent is a master at telling a story not only with his lyrics but his music as well and I simply don't get that with this album, it's like it cuts you off right before the plot hits.
This is an excellent release for trent's first release on his own private label. I enjoyed it quite a bit, the unfortunate bit of it was that it didn't include anything but music, which i understand is for trents newest fad of wanting remixes made of his music (see year zero remixed). I enjoy the industrial noise, but i wish it had had lyrics.
For those looking for the standard Nine Inch Nails album, DO NOT come here, this album is completely instrumental, but while instrumental, Trent did not disappoint and the music is beautiful and is a very good listen.
...Which is my only complaint with this record. I pre-ordered the whole thing over a month ago and got the free download. After a month of digesting, I must say that this really is not as musically redeeming as other NIN albums, and thats not because of the lack of vocals. I've always loved NIN since the Broken days and I think every album up to this one was great in its own way. To me, each track on Ghosts seems like an incomplete musical idea. As soon as one track starts to build and get interesting, it ends. Other tracks are just looped sound effects with no real variation. More than anything, this album is a fantastic showcase of electronic sound effects. I think its really cool the types of sounds Trent has made with his electronical synths and moogs, and other various toys. Ghosts really shows you what you are capable of doing with todays modern electronic musical equipment. Sadly, as a NIN album it failed to hold my attention, even as background music. I think if Trent were to take the strongest tracks here and have them fully realized into songs, then it would really feel like a new NIN album. This is an experimental effort only. But a cool one. Needless to say, I don't think its worth the $300 dollars (now $600 on ebay) for the special Ed with the Vinyl records. Bottom line, definitely get this if you are a NIN fan at all because it is a fun listen and there are cool sounds on here. Just beware, as the songs don't tend to go anywhere. Have fun.
Ghosts is a 2 disc CD containing 4 sets (Ghosts I-IV) of 9 tracks. This is very easy to listen to and is the type of background sound you can toss on to work, read a book, meditate, etc. It's a fully lyric-less experience built in an industrial sounding environment.There are a few reasons I don't like this album. One is that there isn't much difference throughout the tracks on the CD. Another is that it has little or no music. It's full of, what I would call, sound effects drawn from cling/clang pots and pans with occasional decent piano mixed in. I was hoping for something more like the instrumentals from The Fragile but, those are songs where I couldn't say that there is one song on this album. On closer listens you will not anything more interesting in the tracks on this CD. Read some of the other reviews with negative points discussed, I'm sure I would conclude finding the same thing.Instead of taking up more of your time I'll wrap this up. This is not the Nine Inch Nails CD you're looking for. Face it, you are looking for something more like the greats (Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Downward Spiral, The Fragile). With Teeth and Year Zero are both much better music CDs then this. I like a lot of CDs that have no lyrics to them and contain instrumental music. I just don't know how to explain it other then that there's no instrumental *music* on this album.If you're a hardcore NiN fan will you like and appreciate this? Yes, I would definately say that you will find enjoyment in this experience if you're looking for it. But, to me, this is not what NiN sounds like even in its instrumental stages. The only thing I find NiN about this album is the artists name.
This music is really intriguing and easily worth $5.  I really love instrumental stuff for studying (I'm in college) and this is really laid back stuff for the most part.  All great music just to study to or think to, great background music if you are in a reflecting mood.
this album makes for excellent background music, but fails to be interesting enough to warrant attentive listening
It's okay, good sound design type stuff, but it's more of like a big improv jam which is cool from a listening standpoint, but not from a fan who just wants the NIN crew to write some songs with lyrics as well. If this album has lyrics mixed with instrumental I would like it better maybe. I should probably give this another chance at some point.
At first i thought this album was alright......Then i listened to it a few more times and thats where it falls apart...Music doesn't need words at all..If it did then classical music/jazz/electro beats would've died as soon as they came too...  But, as one listens to this you find that it's got nothing to grab you and move your imagination...  Listen to "kind of blue" by miles davis and you start to drift and make your own stories listen to certain mice parade lp's you dream of south america ect.....Listen to this album you feel nothing...It really has no flow to create what makes music a great  story of dreams/ideas ect... this is just what the modern background noise today is.....just background noise.  Ok if you're plugging away on the web or some other mindless task but, if you're in the mood for a mood it doesn't deliver any emotions.  It dosen't resonate happiness/sadness/movement.....Think to why one listens to music and what you like and you'll find this album doesn't bring forth any emotions hence it's souless and bland over all.... A nice try by Trent but, why didn't he really try on this lp?  He left major labels just so he could produce this?  All else fails should've just done some cheap hash of all his past albums with no lyrics and that'd of been at least  some attmpt to some sort of emotions and flow...... Think of pretty hate or downward or fragile with no lyrics it'd still have told the story of trents pains and ups in life....this tells nothing cept trent felt the need for  background noise while he does trivial tasks in life...
The downward spiral away from music with any semblance of song structure continues. The God of Anger Pop, who once created the singularly perfect musical moment that was Pretty Hate Machine, must have reached his seventh day of creation: for he is clearly resting on Ghosts. This is Reznor on a lazy day, bored with nothing better to do.Ghosts I-IV is an organized chaos of happy (and angry and sad) accidents. I imagine a herd (or pod?) of Macs and samplers, pots and pans; left to their own devices, could produce something akin to Ghosts if they tried real hard. And I suspect Trent made exactly what he intended to make.I admit that I'm still a pathetic hold-out waiting for Pretty Hate Machine II - The Revenge. Thus, nothing less will ever truly satisfy. Ghosts is neither fixed nor broken. It's really not that bad, but it's just not that good. And for a small fistful of dollars, I shouldn't complain.I certainly like the progressive and revolutionary distribution (a la Radiohead's Rainbows) where the evil middle-man record company is kept out of the artist's and fans' relationship. I have to give kudos to NIN for fighting the good fight. So at worst, Ghosts I-IV will take up some precious space on your iPod. At best, it's harmless background noise. NIN Ghosts is a little haunting but definitely not scary.
I didn't expect much, and so I guess it meets expectations.  For $5, it's good to have some music in the background for some tasks/projects.
It's as simple as this:This is collection of sounds.This is Nine Inch Nails without an image.This is Trent Reznor doning what he wants to do....And as with ALL Nine Inch Nails records, either you really like it or you don't.  In other words, either you get it, or you don't.At first listen, I didn't like this album very much at all.  But after a month of listening to it off and on, I have found things that I like about it (hence the 3-star rating I gave it).I'm not going to sit here and act like I'm a Rolling Stone or Spin journalist and write an in depth review of this album like everyone else does when writing a review for Nine Inch Nails -- comparing and contrasting every single NIN album to date, and how or why Trent's music is the way it is.  If those reviewers had any brains they would know that NIN has always changed their musical direction and Trent has pretty much done what-ever the hell he's wanted to do with his albums.  It just so happens that people like what he does, pin an image to him, and expect the same for every album.  Ghosts is an example of what he's always wanted to do sans a major lable - letting his creativity run wild.Bottom line:If you can enjoy music for creativity, this album is definitely up your alley.  If you've always liked Nine Inch Nails for the same reason, you might find yourself enjoying this album.  If you are none of the above, I'm sorry, but the odds are you aren't going to like this album.  You will probably consider it strange, weird, pointless and/or a big waste of time.  Ironically, the same can be said about ALL OF NINE INCH NAILS ALBUMS.Either you get it, or you don't.As for me, I'm a huge NIN fan and I believe that I will find myself liking this album more and more as time goes on.
Only if you want a bunch of vague background Reznor stuff should you buy this album.  It never attains the heights, or even the foothills, of some of Reznor's aggressive tunes elsewhere.  What it really sounds like is a very high quality album of &#34;Music for trick or treating.&#34;  Which is fine; just be forewarned before you get it: it's not going to be like the best NIN.
Having listened to "Ghosts I-IV" several times, I'm now left with the daunting task of trying to gauge my overall reaction, which I suppose could be summed up with two words: underwhelmed, perplexed.  I'm not quite ready to write Trent Reznor off as an artist just yet, but, on the horizon, I sense that day looming.  It's not there wasn't the potential for something good to have been created here, because, obviously, there was.  It's just that Mr. Reznor gives the impression that he simply couldn't be bothered.  What disturbs me most about this collection of starts and stops is that, during some of it, I found myself being eerily reminded of New Age music--you know, the stuff they have you listen to when you get a massage.  There's little doubt in my mind that a few of these "Ghosts", had they been fleshed out, would have made great songs.  And I give Trent credit for experimenting with his piano playing, even when it doesn't work particularly well.  "Ghosts I-IV" may end up haunting me--but for all the wrong reasons.  I'm hoping that it's a mere stepping stone to real acheivement, as opposed to a death knell.
I bought this out of curiosity and it's not that bad incomparison with most of the new records out their.but if your expecting another downward spiral forget it,those days are long gone.
The reviews here are not for the disk that is pictured/sold on this mp3 site.  They are for TEX 3, Trance Europe Express 3.
Great collection but stuff is missing. Maybe it's just me but I fell song and themes are missing!! All in all this collection seems fair but not complete...
If you're an Iris fan, you'll want this remix-album-plus.  If not, you'll probably want to start with one of their three solid studio albums.This is a perfectly respectable remix album (like Reconnect before it), with three new tracks that are neither better nor worse than what came before.  It's certainly worth what I spent.  In particular, as a Meshoholic, I'm glad to see the Mesh remix of "Lands of Fire," which even the synthpop experts at A Different Drum weren't able to help me locate when I inquired about it last year.Still...I hate to say it, but these guys seem to be in a bit of a rut.  In my review of their previous album, _Wrath_, I made a comparison to Everclear, and I'm going to have to reiterate that opinion here: both bands have approximately two songs, one of which is slightly faster than the other, and they keep re-releasing them with different titles (and varying amounts of guitar in Iris's case).Good band, Iris.  I keep hoping that someday they'll be great.
This is a complex album with some songs that are pretty user friendly and some that are not.  There are definitely songs I skip.  It does smack of pretension at times as with many composers who are trying to create true art.  Muhly has scored movies with a skilled hand, so it's clear he knows what he's doing and is making conscious choices, not throwing notes together.  That being said, I feel very confident that there are times that the notes are not being played exactly as written, but that there is a fair amount of improv, possibly with the score giving directions as to how to create a certain feeling more than actually defining which notes and where.overall, a good listen.  there is a lot of beauty and musicality in this album.  sometimes it sounds like the song is playing with itself like a cat and an invisible mouse, that's fun.
A good compilation from TD - this is a mass market version of a collection TD has released on their own label, just slightly expanded. Good quality music, some from the vintage era, some newer. Well worth the purchase.
Some excellent tracks and even some sub-parts of tracks.  However, the whole album is simply not my style.  A bit too &#34;housy&#34; for me - I like progressive trance/house, beats, break beats, trip-hop, and whatever style Spunkshine has.  On the other hand, the good tracks are really good.  So about 3.5 start from me.
this is a really cool release of some music you probably will never want to hear again, but hey, some music is just ok, first time is always the most intense.i liked it though, was creative enough, i suppose.
Spreading The Infectionwas a fairly solid album/collaboration between Prospero and a flotilla of industrial, electronic, and ambient artists, both genre-spanning and cohesive.  However, with this release, it seems like the magic has been somewhat lost.  The first four tracks -- the eponymous "elements" -- are OK, but fairly repetitive and often boring.  We then get one really solid new track, "Protection and Precaution," which is then followed by the abysmally bad "Discipline" and "Techno Zombies."  I've never heard any of Ayria's own music, but if "Discipline" is a representation of her vocal prowess, then I'll be sure to skip it.  The album rounds out with two more remixes of songs from "Spreading the Infection," both so-so, and one more new collaboration with It-Clings, a decent and long track that is mostly dark ambient.  Overall, this release is firmly in the "mediocre" category, but a few standout songs give it a push.  I'd give it 2.5 stars out of 5, but I decided it was closer to 3 than 2.
David Pajo is the lead guitarist for the band Slint. Not sure if this is the same David Pajo. The sample of that track sounds very interesting.
Are you open-minded?Do you wonder what the world would be like if the Hindenburg disaster wasn't blown out of proportion?Do you like movies like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW or games like BIOSHOCK?Was the airship your favorite method of transportation in the FINAL FANTASY series?Does the word STEAMPUNK ring a bell?If you answered yes to any of those questions above then you should seriously give this album a try. The music is very steampunk-influenced. For example, there are songs about airship pirates, dolls and crazy doctors.A few of my favorites . . .AIRSHIP PIRATE--The album gets off to a good start with this song about Airship Pirates that are (to paraphrase) more a danger to themselves than to others. Starts and ends with the buzzing sound of engines to put you in that flying mood. Has a very catchy chorus.THE EMPORER'S WIVES--Hmmmm, this one is hard to explain, but it creates a soft atmosphere. The lyrics are a bit hard to hear but tell an interesting story. Lots of drums and electronic sounds.SLEEP ISABELLA--My favorite track on the whole CD. Starts with a pleasing drum and string intro before going into male vocals with occasional female vocals in the background. Has loud and clear lullaby lyrics with a foot-tapping beat.SHE--Starts off very mysterious-sounding, like you're walking into a dusty attic that hasn't had a visitor for the past 100 years. Very good lyrics.THIS DARK AND TWISTY ROAD--The acoustic background on this song is really good. The song is slightly faster-paced and more upbeat than the songs before it. All of these tracks I've mentioned so far are really good to chill out to.So there are 5 out of 11 songs on this CD that I liked. Not all the songs are slow and dreamy, but those are the types of songs that attracted me the most. There are some tracks that rely more on the electronic/industrial sound.If you get a chance there are some awesome Youtube videos of this band playing live. They all dress up as if they were really airship pirates, too.The CD comes with a booklet, but no lyrics at all. It always disappoints me when a band has good lyrics but never bothers to put them in a booklet.While not the same type of music, you should definitely try the somewhat similar ROMANOVS who do a Neo-Victorian sort of music. In fact, if ABNEY PARK could somehow get Morgan Kibby to sing for them, I think the band would be the better for it.
Stumbled onto Abney Park via the iheartradio app in a station I made themed around Steam Powered Giraffe. The song that got me was Airship Pirate, the first track on this album, and it's a really great song. The opening instrumentals combined with the sound effects set the tone then the lyrics, especially the chorus, create an interesting story. Impressed, I purchased the digital version of this album. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the first track is the best and the rest of the album just doesn't live up to the initial standard. It's not terrible, I can sit through the album and some songs I enjoy, but it's average at best. Still, I like Abney Park enough that I will probably consider checking out their other albums in the future.
this cd is ok but I think it has too many vocals and cheesy songs goin on
I am a super music lover of the sixtys thru the seventy's and that includes DISCO.  Roller Disco Hits sounds great and great to dance and work out to. The main problem I find with this 2 c.d. album is although the sining is alright it s NOT the original singers that are mentioned on the description. The price was only $2.00 so I was very pleased with my purchase.  This is well worth the price.Dennis B.
I digged this crazy beat man!! I am a huge music fan, so beats like this gets me!!! I`ll buy more..
Check the album playlists - Both of these songs are present on other albums available by Tycho. So if you're buying &#34;all of Tycho&#34;, you can skip this. Also, these songs aren't particularly my favorites... he has several other songs, on &#34;Dive&#34; and &#34;Past is Prologue&#34;, that I enjoy much more.
Back in 2002, the first edition of "Anime Toonz" was released. The album featured voice actress Inoue Kikuko ("Ranma 1/2', "Ah! My Goddess" and many other anime series) and a second release in 2004 with voice actress Kawamura Maria ("Aura Battler Dunbine", "Slayers" and many other anime series).Both albums received reviews for those who dislike remixed music and those who support it.So, a third Anime Toonz album was released but this time featuring Asian American Indie artist Kristine Sa who has received attention for singing covers of anime theme songs. And again, fans were a bit unnerved that the album has ventured away from anime voice actresses but fans of Kristine Sa were happy to have a collection of anime covers by the performer.Here we are in Aug. 2008 with a new Anime Toonz album and a return to featuring anime voice actress with Fukui Yukari (voice actress for anime such as "Kare Kano", "Gunbuster 2', "Gurrenn Lagann" and many others).The album features 12 tracks from anime such as "Bleach", "Gurren Lagann", "Saint October", "The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi", "Paradise Kiss" and many others.When it comes to J-Pop remix albums, I've reviewed so many of them in the past 15 years that the best thing can say is that many of them are subjective towards the listener and sometimes how much you enjoy that artist.I can take a Hamasaki Ayumi, Pizzicato Five, SMAP, m-flo, globe, m.o.v.e or dream remix album and have non-fans and fans listen to it and the results are typically 50/50. Those who enjoy remixes can appreciate a DJ or producer's ability to take a song and give it a new life and those who cry foul for a desecration of a song or simply, the music is not their cup of tea.With the latest edition of Anime Toonz, let me first say that I'm a big fan of Yukarin (Fukui Yukari). I enjoy her voice acting performances in many anime and it was interesting to see her transition from gravure model to voice actress to a singer (she made her singing debut in 2007 for the "Saint October" anime series with the ending theme "Michinaru Basho e").With that being said, unlike Inoue Kikuo and Kawamura Maria and even Kristine Sa, Yukarin hasn't really been a singer all that long.And for seiyuu singers, some like Hayashibara Megumi and Momoi Halko are able to have success with their music. But for some, the otaku are very hardcore when it comes to seiyuu-related music and will support there favorite voice actresses no matter what!As for remix albums, as mentioned before, part of the musical experience is to hear a remixer take an original song and give it new life.With the songs featured on "Anime Toonz Volume 4', I have to admit that I'm not familiar with many of the original songs but there are songs that caught my attention musically.The second track "Lonely in Gorgeous" (Opening theme from "Paradise Kiss") features popular Philadelphia-based DJ and producer Nigel Richards (especially known for his record shop 611 Records) creating a whimsical, dreamy dub track.The third track "Inori You Raise Me Up" (Opening Theme from "Romeo x Juliet) features fan-favorites DJ Sharpnel (Japanese electronic artists Jea and Lemmy) who are known for their happy hardcore, gabber and speedcore style which they infuse with anime sound. All in all, this track was energetic, fun and overall enjoyable. And Sharpnel returns with a transcore remix of the same song in track 12 which was very fast, upbeat and enjoyable as well!The fourth track "Motteke Sailor Fuku" (Opening theme from "Lucky Star") is a remix by dj A.Q. For one, dj A.Q. is known for remixing anime and video game songs and known for getting his start with his remixes from the 1998 MTV Music Generator game. And appreciated his music when I found out that his influence was trance DJ System-F (Ferry Corsten). The track is fun, light and energetic.And again, the same can be said for dj A.Q.'s remix of "Koi no Mikuru Densetsu ("Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" insert song) which A.Q. did a great job onThe sixth track "Houki Boushi" (originally sung by Younha) for the anime BLEACH. Loved the original for it's rock track and her vocals but Yukarin's version and Yukarin's vocals were ok but I really enjoyed Darkhalo's remix version of this song (3/4 of it). A lighthearted, upbeat version of the song. Although, near the end of the track, it becomes a bit more experimental with sounds and it becomes too pronounced and for me, it took away what I enjoyed of the track.The eleventh track "Michinaru Basho e" (the second remix version of Yukarin's Saint October theme song) receives a very cool remix by New York's Proper Villains. Definitely enjoyed the vibe and energy from their remix.And as many tracks on the album that I did enjoy, there are songs that are not bad musically but marred by bad singing. "Sorairo Days" from "Gurren Lagann" was an awesome rocking track by Nakagawa Shoko but vocally, Yukarin's version was just not well done. I'm sure hardcore fans may find it her vocal version cute but it didn't work for me at all.Another track is "Onna no Ko Otoko no Ko" ("School Rumble" ending theme) where the vocals were a bit unstable but the music by DJ Seoul were very cool.When it comes to J-Pop remix albums, I've reviewed so many of them in the past 15 years that the best thing can say is that many of them are subjective towards the listener.Among my fellow Japanese music reviewing colleagues, many of them dislike remix albums. And those who do are primarily more inclined to say that the remixes they have enjoyed are from Hamasaki Ayumi or artists that feature well-known DJ's.And again, I can take album remixes from various J-Pop artists and some will enjoy it and some won't.As for "Anime Toonz Volume 4', it's strength is that it features various talent known for remixing music for various genres. You get dub, happy hardcore, trancecore and more. So, the variety is there.You have some impressive names on this album such as Nigel Richards, DJ Sharpnel and remix fan-favorite dj A.Q. and also other names known for their music as well.As for Yukarin's vocals, some tracks are hit and miss. But again, it's subjective to the listener and for me, I don't listen to that much seiyuu music but know that what some may see as vocally not that good, another may see it as cute and adorable.Remixes are never easy to review but if you are a big fan of Fukui Yukari, fans of the talent who remixed the songs on this album or want to hear different musical interpretations of anime theme songs featured, then definitely check this album out! It's now available on iTunes.
There's just not enough variations in this arrangement to make it more than just an okay track.  The variations that do exist are creative, however.
It's been a long, grueling 4 year wait for the follow up to Wet From Birth, and well I must admit this record was nowhere near worth it. All the energy The Faint had on previous releases is pretty much nonexistent here. The tracks on this record  move slower and in the long run get boring. Some of the intro's to the song's show great potential like "Machine and the Ghost," which teases you with the same vibe that something off Danse Macabre would, but ultimately tanks the second the song kicks into full gear. "Mirror Error," is about the only song on this record that captures what the Faint are about, but even the worst song off Wet From Birth surpass that. Fans of The Faint I would recommend you pass. If your new to The Faint, I would start off with Blank Wave Arcade and Danse Macabre which are hands down, dance record masterpieces.
I own the rest of The Faint's releases, and I don't think this quite stacks up.  I agree with the reviewer who said that it is a letdown.  It just doesn't have the same whateveritis that grabs you from their other releases.  It's not a bad album by any means - still better than a lot of stuff out there - but it just doesn't live up to the expectations set by their previous work.
The Faint have released their first album in four years in true DIY fashion, recording, producing, and releasing it on their own label, blank.wav after leaving Saddle Creek. Fans will be happy to know that their sound hasn't changed all that much; there's still a heavy amount of vocoder, dark lyrics that fit the industrial moods and tones of their bleep-and-blip electronica, and more synths than you can shake a Depeche Mode record at.Unlike their previous three albums, Fasciinatiion doesn't really have any overarching theme, instead jumping around from childhood injuries to the price of fame to the problems of mixing religion with war. The Faint have always been at their best when their lyrics coincide with their music, and when it comes to their shadowy, instinctive brand of electronica, those themes have normally been primal and violent (see "Erection" or "Drop Kick The Punks" from Wet From Birth or anything from Danse Macabre). Although variety is to be commended, it's always been more about the feeling with the Faint than with the message.On some songs, however, the beats are sexy enough to keep the band afloat, as on opener "Get Seduced," which has some of the dirtiest synths of the year whirling around about the halfway mark, and the buzzing, throbbing guitar rhythms on the following "The Geeks Were Right." The best song of the bunch, however, is easily the unusually poppy "Psycho," a jumpy, surprisingly major-key apology with the catchiest chorus on the record.Like Wet From Birth, the Faint's previous effort, however, Fasciinatiion is more than a little uneven. "Fulcrum and Lever," the aforementioned song about an accident in singer Fink's childhood, is a story in the mold of "Desperate Guys" from Wet From Birth, but unlike that song's ADHD-violin/drum machine beat, the song trudges along on a mess of gnarled synths and buries Fink's voice in layers of reverb to the point where there is little difference between verse and chorus.On "Mirror Error," one of the record's more bouncier tracks, Fink sings, quite self-consciously, "I might distort myself a bit." Fink's voice is certainly more than a little distorted throughout the course of the record, and the worst songs are those that reduce his distinctive pipes to a robotic caricature like the above "Fulcrum and Lever" or the preachy, uninspired "A Battle Hymn for Children," which has one of the worst beats on the album.However, the Faint are still pros at crafting innovative electronica-rock that is more dance-y than most contemporaries. While some tracks might drop into boredom ("I Treat You Wrong") and others build up without really going anywhere ("Fish in a Womb"), the syncopated keyboards and the shouted chorus of "Machine in the Ghost" and the guitar crunch and speeded-up feedback of "Forever Growing Centipedes" are proof that, if everything else fails, the Faint can make a tidy sum moonlighting at a rave.
Fasciinatiion (2008, Blank. Wave) The Faint's sixth studio album. **1/2Glitch electronica is so often one of those rare and criminally underrated things; that is, of course, when it's done correctly. The Faint have opened up a barrage of problems on their latest LP, Fasciinatiion. One is that they don't really know what they want to do; all the songs are very glitch-heavy, with blips and bleeps like you wouldn't believe, but at the same time they introduce an electric guitar and hip-hop elements. Experimentation is great, but it doesn't go with anything they've put out here. Not only that, but the electronica beats they do have are far too harsh; the beeps are loud and obnoxious, trying to act as a facade of intricacy. It's too muddled and in the middle, for Fasciinatiion isn't soft like The Eraser or fluent like Sound of Silver, yet at the same time it holds itself back from being as violent as You Have No Idea What You're Getting Yourself Into. And at that point the album is drab, with Todd Fink's vocals being a poor version of Phil Collins. In fact, Fink is a major problem for the album, as his growling baritone and virtual nonexistant range make him boring to listen to. Had they a vocalist like Alexis Taylor, the album's strong points like "Get Seduced" and "Forever Growing Centipedes" would be a qualifying apology for the rest of it. But alas, even the better moments - "Forever Growing Centipedes especially, as grooves don't get much crunchier than that - are only slightly above mediocre. Not to mention that their lyrics are beyond ridiculous, and even though they develop an interesting dystopian theme, it's laughable when you listen closely to tracks like "A Battle Hymn For Children."
Solar Sun Remix , 8:09Stephan Grodin Remix, 10:04FC NOND Remix , 8:19None of the remixes compare to the original, two of them hardly use the vocals.
Good selection of tracks nice combination to listen at a house party, it has a nice collection of old to current dance/house music
Don't buy from Amazon.  This record is available in either FLAC or MP3 format on the label's website.  If you like it, then definitely make the donation.This record is a valiant attempt and Gillis often exhibits a talent for melding disparate styles into some fun mash-ups, but overall, Feed The Animals has no theme and caters too much to short attention spans.  For most, this will be little more than a fun collection of samples to play at parties.  Definitely check out Play Your Part and the first two-thirds of In Step.Generally, such schizophrenic sampling is alright for clubs, but in a collected format I had hoped for more of an examination of what's possible from this genre.
This is a review for "All Day," the genius of the Girl Talk albums. The previous lp's were a bit too ADD, relying much on rock and not enough on soul. "All Day" is like an album from the prophet himself. As is the case with most progenitors, this album redefines popular music, it's a whole new ballgame. The former best album of mashups, "The best bootlegs in the world ever," had set the previous standard, but I'm sure registers thin compared to "All Day." The transitions here are seemless and throughout the entire album you find yourself in unchartered territory--the new land. How did we arrive here?--don't know, but it's a smooth ride. You also discover, as Dale Lawrence once argued, these mashups are better than the original. Welcome to the future--it's time to get your booty on. The only hesitation I can offer here is after listening to the entire album you get a sense that someone is shuffling through their ipod; 20 seconds here, 30 seconds there...Isn't this how the kids listen to music these days, anyways?
Like one of his other CD's, I bought this after hearing Girl Talk at a party. I don't know if it was the alcohol or what, but I liked it better at the party. It's ok, I guess. He's a very strange person.
I thought that there would be more of a get ready for some hard dance techno but it is alot of industrial noise.  It is good but not what I was looking for.
I was introduced to FM Belfast by the song &#34;Par Avion&#34; on this album, and immediately fell in love with the group.  Initially I didn't buy this album, though.  I bought Don't Want to Sleep first, and there are a ton of songs on that one that I love.On this album, there are a couple of decent songs besides the brilliant &#34;Par Avion,&#34; and then there are a few songs which come off as trying too hard.  There's a particular cover on this album that was probably an attempt to be clever, but looked too deliberately ironic to make me think anything other than a formulaic hipster approach to art.If you're a fan, I do recommend at least &#34;Sylvia&#34; and &#34;Par Avion.&#34;
I am a big House, Dance Trance, Electronica fan.. This Rocks!!! Bigdaddy Rob,,, OUT!!!!!!!I buy all my MP3 downloads from Amazon..
Not quite as energetic as I may need or want, but I think I noticed it was filed under, downtempo or easy listening or something ?...Great music though.
Classic techno from Mental Overdrive with his debut PLUGGED. "Spoing" starts with those swirling synths that have since become associated with trance; here, Martinsen sets them to some deep breaks. "Disto Disco," with its Moroder-like melodies, adds in some flanged percussion, and while there is a piano on "Piano," it's accompanied by an industrial backing. "Higher," is a bit dull, unfortunately, and "Please Hold On" doesn't really go anywhere. But the gentle "Child" brings things back to earth. Indeed, "Jaz" nods towards Detroit, and the long final track, "Moves" goes almost beatless. Good, though it shows its age.
"Muitiro" by Phil Flarvh is an eclectic CD unified with traditional South African cultural music and modern day electronics. In a unique contrast of cultures, Flarvh has mastered the art of creativity in collectively combining these two contrasting styles of music. The electronic drums imply the modern day dance club rhythm while the piano keeps a soft and serene chord structure. The delicate hints of synthesized strings embellish the tone of easy listening music. The lyrics are gracefully spoken yet sung with themes and variations. Perfect harmonies keep form and integrate the vocal with an ensemble providing the shape of African tonality. The title track is a great example that rhythm, form, and harmony from opposite classifications can merge to create a new type of musical style. If you like the music of Lady Smith Black Mambazo, you will enjoy listening to the easy listening CD "Muitiro" by Phil Flarvh.[...]
Amen is a powerful arrangement.  I suggest getting just Amen from this one and getting the entire Freedom No Go Die. The music of Kapital is good, but the lyrics are dumb and hard to ignore.
wish i could find a training program that actually had upbeat music behind it! This is like elevator music - bleh
Big change from their early years.Although still showing the extraordinary creativity by the members of Shadowfax, the heavy techno,rapp and rock sound combination ,is just not Shadowfax.
Not bad but i prefer the first two albums. they had a more Shpongle type sound which is why I like this group to begin with.I will still eventually acquire the rest of there music but Im In no rush. Listen to the samples , they give a pretty good idea how this album sounds.
There are not too many standout tunes on this comp, but it is definitely far from lacking. The sound makes a great effort not to sound too familiar, and at the same time, not trying to distance themselves from other electronic dance tunes. This album would be a great addition for laptop Dj's with big hard drives who not afraid of having too many fillers.
Always disappointing, so I note it first: this is not a DJ mix compilation. Most of you are leaving the page already, I'm sure.First couple of tracks in and this has little to do with acid. Clearly no TB-303 is being used here, and, as far as anyone has said about what makes acid music, the TB-303 is the only distinctly defining feature of the genre. There are some compositional qualities in common with the acid I've heard, but they're more indicative of techno than anything. The album has a chilled atmosphere like some acid does in contrast, but this atmosphere is more akin to progressive house than acid. In addition, there's a consistent smooth 4/4 kick drum throughout set at walking pace which is much more indicative of progressive house. It's marked elsewhere (that is, not on Amazon) as electro, but that doesn't make any sense, based on the electro I've heard. Okay, the song I'm on has some similarities to electro, but again I would more readily call it a thoroughly techno-influenced version of house (so tech house then). I'm enjoying what I'm hearing, but I'm pissed off that I ended up buying this thinking that it was actually acid. People need to stop using terms they don't understand because their ignorance is contagious.
This live recording of The Art of Noise is based in the era following the release of "The Seduction of Claude Debussy".  As such, it contains much of the narrative threads that tied that album together, but also attempts to weave other Art of Noise favorites (such as "Moments in Love") into the mix.Unfortunately, much of this doesn't translate well into an audio recording.  It might have been more fun to watch on video, to see what was happening onstage, and perhaps to feel more like one of the crowd watching.  Without that, we have a concept album that's been chopped up, interspersed with crowd noise, and had a couple of "Greatest Hits" inserted here and there.  The narrator is one of the members of the group, and he takes whimsical diversions between tracks into anecdotal stories and diatribes about getting drunk.  These don't add anything to the recording, and come across more as "had to be there" moments when confined to audio as they are here.If you are an Art of Noise fan who truly enjoyed "The Seduction of Claude Debussy", then this will probably satisfy you.  Fans new to the band will find little here that is inspiring, and would better enjoy any of the many Art of Noise studio albums more than this.
IDM, Black Dog-style, with Detroit synth sweeps and rhythms that eschew the traditional 4-to-the-floor: this is Dimension 5's ALIEN ARTFORM. Some beautiful grooves on here (like the robots-in-love tones of "Automation" or the across-the-wires glide of "Network"). "Analogue Assault" sounds like the soundtrack and dark and grimy cyborg spy movie, while "Think Tank" merrily slides in some funk. "Intruders" delivers on a steady beat, a heartbeat from a calculator factory. Unfortunately, as pleasant as this album is, it really doesn't offer anything new (worse, the tracks tend to get repetitive) and mostly fades into the background. It's like a cool Michigan breeze that refreshes as it passes by, but then quickly disappears in the distance.
Philosopher's Stone is a cool, heavy, somber track that should have been on RR and definately needs a longer mix. The Mandala remix also has a nice beat and a faster tempo.Unless you really like Vampires I wouldn't bother with them.
Yvat creates highly jagged and melodically inventive music sure to satisfy most connoisseurs of abstracted electronic music. While I rarely find his music less than engaging I often wished he would branch out more compositionally. Here, as is with many of his other recordings, the songs are kept too similar to create the kind of peaks and valleys a full-length album needs to make it a satisfying journey. Every track introduces an off-kilter melody followed within only a few seconds of the beat. Individually these tracks are all brilliant, but it soon becomes too predictable, and frankly tiresome, where the music will go over the course of the entire listening experience. Gliae could do with some tracks that have a focus on ambient passages or varying tempos. Perhaps others could develop into longer compositions.I feel that Gliae is a monochromatic painting that could do well with some additional touches of color.
I wanted to get a CD with some chip tunes for a party we were having. After I ended up buying this one since it was the most diverse. After buying this CD, I kept looking around for more chip tunes.I ended up coming across this website [...]. The website is run by 8bitpeoples and Bit Shifter. It has over 150 EPs of chip tunes. Most of them are free. I was able to download over 600 chip tunes for free from the production company that released them.I was able to use the tunes at the part and never have a song repeat.
I really enjoy a Latin beat of the variety presented in BYE BYE. After listening I was reminded of two albums by Gary Mcfarland, "Soft Samba & In Sound". I'm listening as I am typing and I am having difficulty typing re my moving with the rythmic sounds. Although I didn't understand a word of the lyrics - who cares-, this number is hot! I listened to the other songs in the album but couldn't get the great "bye bye" vibes from any of the other selections. I don't know the story behind the arrangement of this song but if Deja-Move could assemble an album with some similar arrangements I am sure they would be very marketable.Koss KTXPRO1 Titanium Portable Headphones with Volume ControlIt is the remarketable sounds presented by the unbelievable low cost Titanium Headphones (especially the bass) that makes you feel you are there with the players in the studio.BYE BYE!!
AMAZON -- HINT, HINT!!!It's too bad I can't add this to a wish list so I can come back and buy it later.. it sounds like a totally sensual set of mp3's :o(
The  music is Ok, After scouting the purchase with the previews I had been expecting a bit more oomph to the music, it turned out to be more repetitive than anything else. If you want this download do it when i's on sale.
Some nice older Excision, still hard enough to make even the "hardest" hip-hop listener go into a coma from the awesomeness.Check him out at Electric Forest June 30-July 3rd!
This is an album I have very mixed feelings about. I always hate it when a band I really like produces something that really fails to live up to the standard they set for themselves.  That being said, my biggest complaint wasn't necessarily the songs themselves, but rather the sound production of the album in general.  Somehow, Chakra Red came across very... FLAT -- which is a very bad thing for any music, but especially music in electronic and industrial genres. Industrial should never sound bland. There were not really any songs that stood out to me in any great way, though I feel like some of them would have if they were recorded with more dynamic sound.  While this wouldn't be my recommendation for your first or second Project Pitchfork album (real fans should probably still own it), I would still recommend checking out some of their other works, as there are others that are definitely worth your investment.
I'm still not sold on the raw-sounding vocals employed here (a carryover from recent Joy Electric work, as on "Write Your Last Paragraph"), but this is an interesting new facet for those who follow Martin's output avidly.Hard to describe, ultimately... but it's almost like Joy Electric meets the Juno soundtrack.
Anyone know why this album is on here twice, and at two different prices? Everything else looks exactly the same.
This album is good, but in my opinion not as good as the first Natural Born Chiller album. About half the cuts are good.
These are high-quality tracks, but there is no purely instrumental version available. The Instrumental Version listed here has lead vocals on it, just like the Lead Vocals Version does. It appears that both of these are the same track.
This is not a game that will hold your attention for very long, but it is fun in small bursts.  It's a very wacky smash brothers-esque game.  I found the fish tossing game to be both great fun and hilarious.  And the soundtrack is AMAZING.
I bought this, finding many names and mixes I remember loving.Well, that was 13 years ago, and things have changed.  The fairly basic repetition and no-changes-at-all mix has gone the way of WinAmp, and the opening track by none other than Fatboy Slim.  This is a fairly annoying and monotonous mix that will likely do more to annoy than the latest Pauly Shore movie, which also thankfully is years in the past.Do yourself a favor and keep looking.  This isn't the overplayed Sandstorm, this isn't that one thing by Darude you liked, heck, it isn't even 9PM by ATB.  It is just another forgettable bit of forgettable which was packaged in a bikini.. but enough about Ibiza, this CD is also rather monotonous, too.[Edit: This is for the 3 CD set by Decadance.  I did not buy the MP3s.  I have no idea how this got mislabeled on entry..]
When i looked at this though like most items with the name karaoke in them they include cd+g files but not this one what give I mean the sound quality on the song is a little off but the least that could be done is keep it karaoke and actually have the cd+G download at the same time as the mp3.
I don't own this item. Is it just me, or is it a bit improper to include a cover of Tom Jones' Sex Bomb ON AN ITEM AIMED AT YOUNG CHILDREN???
Perhaps you don't recognize it, but this is one of the saddest things you've ever seen.  You see, there once was a band called the Format.  Though they only released two full length albums and a handful of eps, this group accomplished much in the way of brilliant songwriting and integrity to their craft.  Their second album in particular,Dog Problems, was loaded with some of the most original content heard in the last decade.  The feat they accomplished best was combining melancholy lyrics with bubblegum melodies to make the listener find the sweet in bittersweet.  Indefinable in genre, the Format found a niche in the hearts of many music lovers.  Nate Ruess and Sam Means, the foremost members of the group, had finally found what they had been searching for since their days as grade school friends:  an opportunity to share their songs.Not sad, you say?  Here it comes music fans, here it comes.  February 4th, 2008:  The Format puts a notice on their official website that they will not be recording or playing shows together anymore.  Fans crushed, myself included, our secret happy place falling down around us.  Today Nate Ruess is trying again.  I just found a new single from his new group "fun." on itunes.  Catchy, but lacking that slightly haunting quality that showed up in the Format.  And where is Sam Means you ask?  Well my friends, this is the saddest part of all:  You just found him.  Here. Making ringtones.  Without so much as credit to his name.And yet I have hope for Mr. Means.  Surely he's working on something bigger than Ringtones EP vol 2. And I'm eager with anticipation to hear that something.
Review By Miranda PaulFreelance Writer and AuthorWhen Nomad's debut CD, The Spinning Compass, arrived in my mailbox, I was intrigued by the cover art...let's just say, it looks a bit unusual among my collection of jazz, pop, folk, and reggae CDs.  But after the first listen, I must say this-Nomad understands exactly who he is as an artist: a musician who doesn't want to be placed in a single "category."  And I commend him for it.Tracks like "Chasin' Echoes," "Sandcastle," and "A Prayer For Broken Hearts" became my instant favorites, with their finger-picking guitar riffs, steel-drum sounds, and reggae beats.  But an interesting contrast to the album is the track titled "Unwritten," which almost could be categorized as pop or even...dare I say...a rock ballad.Another track of note, though not my favorite, is "Carousel Lullaby," in which the piano accompaniment resonates like a sweet-turned-curiously dark Queen song perfectly played on repeat mode after a messy breakup.  Like Carousel, the track "Anthem" features several of those `cant-get-em-outta-your-head' electronic piano sequences that remind me, in a charming way, of a catchy Apple commercial.  Beware:  you may find yourself humming Nomad's tunes in the car, shower, etc...While the CD has a few technical sound oddities (i.e. faraway voices on a few tracks, microphone `pops'), what's overwhelmingly amazing is the fact that John Thayer, mastermind behind the album, designed everything from cover art to album jacket himself, and recorded all vocals and instruments entirely on his own.  In a word:  Talented.So where is this indie rocker / one-man-band headed? Well, the compass is still spinning; currently the needle points everywhere and nowhere all at once.  In his first CD, he truly is a Nomad heading in every musical direction at the same time-a refreshing and positive aspect for listeners who like diversity instead of 10 repetitive-sounding tracks!I will say, wherever Nomad is headed next (musically) might include more Queen-esque vocals, or could be an expansion of his punk and ska undertones.  Then again, perhaps Nomad won't ever settle down into the classification of one genre, either.  Though his future may be impossible to predict, I'll be here listening, ready for more.
Armin is among my favorite DJ/Musicians and I've been following him for four or five years now, picking up mixes, remixes and his artist albums along the way.  If this album was being released by a new-to-the-scene DJ, I'd be impressed, but because it's Armin I'm underwhelmed.  This is probably his weakest State of Trance compilation to date.Disc one is actually quite good with a few nits to pick.  It starts off just right (it seems like O'Callaghan can't make a bad piece of music these days) and maintains a steady mood and pace through out.  It's a nice exercise in trance-styled EDM that's more laid back and less in your face.  Outside of a few awkward breaks and and a questionable track or two, I was very happy with the first mix and looking forward to the second.Unfortunately, disc two is very disappointing.  I'm not sure if Armin phoned it in or what, but the track selection combined with the relatively lack luster mixing and beat/break/build just wasn't working.  It may be that the relative death of hard trance is making it harder and harder to put together trance club records that don't have to dabble in progressive/electro house along with other genres of EDM.  As a result of the dabbling the mood is broken up, and the whole mix feels inconsistent and frankly, uninteresting.I tuned into his radio show this week in which he played a recorded set from Ibiza, and he sounded like he was in fine form, so I'm not sure what went wrong here.  At the very least it leaves plenty of room for improvement next year.  People looking for a better and more traditional trance mix would be wise to check out Solarstone's Electronic Architecture, which came out earlier this year.
Really good sound. There's some folk feel to the snippets as well as some chill/neosoul/electronic/r&b mashup. Wish the full cd were here so I can buy it and get to hear all tracks.
I was loading up my Amazon Cloud Drive (funny how you can't link to that in a review) with some trance mixes for background music and stumbled across this album. The samples aren't long enough to get a real feel for the songs... or so you'd think. The songs are both over 8 minutes long and don't really vary much over than 8 minutes. I guess that's the idea with trance and I really won't notice when I play it as background noise. It's not offensive. But it's also not compelling.I also don't see much connection withSunglasses At Night. Maybe I just don't get this kind of music.
I really enjoy the Loud remix of Xerox and Illumination's &#34;Night Shift.&#34;  All the other songs on this album were below mediocre.
I have most of 2minds releases... maybe all. They are a solid Israeli psytrance act, i guess you could say i'm kindof a fan. There is nothing particularly wrong with this release - it is just not my favorite.The production quality on just about everything i've heard from 2minds has been outstanding, and this release is no exception. Solid kicks & basslines, crisp leads and accents, predictable, yet well-done transitions/drops/etc... These guys are not especially innovative (very few are) - they tend to adhere to established, proven formulas of full-on psytrance, and i like it.I'm listening to it again as i write this to put my finger on why this release is... underwhelming.1. Beyond Tomorrow - Nothing particularly wrong with it - a couple sounds i didn't like very much. Build up got a little fluffy.2. Drive In - pretty epic full-on... in fact, a little too epic. Gets a bit fluffy for my taste.My favorite releases by 2minds: Instromental, Wave Shell.I'm curious if anyone will ever read this.... :::)
Really beautiful Vocals A shame vocals get covered up with electro dance music Should have just allowed the vocals to be the song with out the disco dance music
"Free," the cut from Mills' last studio album, '04's "Born for This," was not ear-catching in its original form.  However, the remixes on this follow-up up the ante, so to speak, turning it into an ear-friendly dance-ready tune.Though the cuts are good, including the dubs, they're still not up to par with the songs that she released in the 80's.While Mills' powerful vocals come through, it's still disheartening a bit to have her masked behind the throbbing musical accompaniment.  Actually, with such long intros and outros, Mills is relegated to serving as "filler" in-between them.  Such is the case of many dance tracks.A singer of her caliber deserves a little more but if the song brings her "new" fans, I wish her well.
The mix is okay. There are just a few songs in this album that I really like, others are ok.
Average songs collection but totally worth the price. I bought the collection for gym and some of the songs serve the purpose.
It really isn't as good as his later work. Coco Part 2 has much more memorable tracks on it, and it's a much better purchase.This album randomly has two hip-hop/rap tracks on it that don't fit the rest of the tone of the album, and both feature lackluster lyrics sung by even more lackluster artists.Save yourself the money and buy Part 2. You'll enjoy it much more.
Cazwell's music does not disappoint if you go into it knowing what you're getting. His music is upbeat and imminently danceable. It's not transcendent or anything but I gladly admit whenever his music comes up in rotation I always crack a smile and groove like the awkward white boy I am.
For a good chunk of the disco craze, especially in the gay disco world, there was a subset of artists that specialized in taking relatively current hits and then rearranging them into club items. Paul Parker may have been the best known of these men, and the biggest hit version was when Nikki French took Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse Of The Heart" to number 2 in the 90's. Colton Ford's "Under The Covers" mines that same turf, plucking out songs like "By Your Side" by Sade, "Lithium" by Nirvana or "Losing My Religion" by R.E.M. and clubbing them up. There's also a surprisingly supple rock-dance cover of Faith No More's "Ashes to Ashes."Unfortunately, Ford and his producers decided to include a capella interludes of other songs that bobble the flow of the disc. I'm not sure why these snippets were inserted between several of the songs (they aren't used as lead ins, these are strictly stand-alone cutlets). These sap the energy of away from an otherwise enjoyable dance album. Also, the cover photo? The remix version of the dosc has a more seductive and color friendly picture than the blue-tinted current picture. Ford is a man who made his bones as an adult film star, so why the totally unattractive pic? The music is OK enough to hold its own, the cover puts the CD at a disadvantage.
The songs is too similar to a porn background music
I feel guilty... i own all of his albums, (even the mini Brewskies album), i love all of James Kochalka Superstar's comics and music but only gave him a 3 star rating here.... why?I wanted to give him 5 stars like i would on all his other albums, i really did. And if you are looking at this album you are probably already a fan - so whatever don't worry about my 3 star review - buy it, its still great. But if somehow you stumbled into this album's Amazon page without knowing JKS already i would say go back and buy a previous albums first. Any one of them, they are all 100% 5 star gold. This is the one I listen to least.Its not that this album is bad, its that (to me) it was disappointing. First off its not even 20 minutes long; that right there is a BIG strike against it. If it had been sold to me as an EP maybe I could have swallowed it better? Or maybe just as an MP3 release? (It is called Digital Elf so that would be fine). But i bought the actual physical album which was full CD price. Insult to injury the album came in a cardboard slip with no info. So the mp3 version is really not a bad way to go on this one.Secondly I referenced the Brewskies album already - that was a mini album that him and his buddy made in the guise of a white rapper and DJ; it was fun but not JKS level if you know what I mean? Not an album everyone would buy. Just fans of his really. Unfortunately Digital Elf feels more like the Brewskies mini and less like a JKS album proper for the most part; with songs like "North End", "Beyonce", and even the similarly titled "Bacharach" song on each of them. Its the white rap style of his that can be funny - but musically I am not a huge fan of. Sure "Dragon Puncher" holds up to his old stuff, but that's about it. I wouldn't put anything else here on a greatest hits album of his. And sorry but like James with a real band. Game boy bleeps and loops are fun and sometimes done well, and maybe he just couldn't get the band going for this, (again it is "digital", I get it!), but it just fell short to me.What I would have liked to see is maybe on TOP of the songs collected here; he has a great back catalog of unpublished songs, maybe he can't use them or doesn't like them I don't know? And i know it was a gameboy theme here, (maybe that's part of the problem?). But "beat down in the shower", "raindrops of the dead", the beautiful version of "honey I sure miss you", "ruvy monkey", or "christmas can of corn" - anything like that would have put some more oomph and needed minutes into this album. Here is to high hopes for the next release!
I was a big fan of Caviar (and actually just Caviar, not Fig Dish until later, as I randomly picked up the fist Caviar CD).  Those two albums, especially the perfect pop of the second, with dashes of punk, emo, synths, and supurb intrumentation is one of my favorite albums of the decade.  So how does this differ?  First, half of the songs appear to be not sung by the lead singer of Caviar.  The second main difference of course is that most of this album is electronic.  Less synthy, more dark dance/rave/a little goth(not much)/some loud guitars in the mix club music.  This means most of the songs are not pop songs like Thin Mercury Sound, with the usual verse/chorus, but more excercises in sparser lyrics working with the propulsion of the music.  Does this work?  I think it does for the most part, but honestly, I was hoping for more pop songs, as this type of music gets a bit tedious for me.  But as someone who likes synth pop of the Pet Shop Boys over, say, DJ Shadow, this music does have good production, good teeth, and does hold my attention pretty well.  In a couple of places the lyrics do get a little trite.  There are a couple tracks on here, such as the lilting Beautiful Shadow, that do hark back to the glory days of Caviar, just with more electro this time.
This is not too bad an album...just not what I expected. I don't listen to it like my other chill groups.
Bought this for Gstring and Dies Irae.Dies Irae is a super cool moody tune. Gstring is an epic glitch hop style tune.The rest however, were pretty sleepy and unremarkable. Not that the songs are bad, they are just not to my taste like Gstring and Dies Irae are.If you are looking for an album full of Gstring style tunes, you are going to be disappointed. If the slower, mellow music is your thing, this one might be for you.
... and now I'm disappointed. Honestly, after 'Plume' and 'First Narrows,' it'd be hard NOT to be disappointed. All the live stuff he had posted got me really pumped to finally get my hands on this and I bought it the day it was released. After digesting it for a bit and giving it multiple listens, I've decided that I'm just not that into it. First off, the songs are much more dark and tense than anything Loscil has done since 'Triple Point,' and I was really digging the relaxed atmospheres. Secondly, the pieces sound very static to me. Part of what I always loved about a Loscil track were those slow and subtle changes that ebbed and flowed through each song... to me, these three pieces just sort of build up and then die out without fulling realizing their potential. The second track is my favorite, but it's also the shortest. Ah well. Here's hoping for a proper full-length soon!
&#34;An act involved in such mystery and closure from the rest of the English-speaking world, no wonder why the Welsh-language album Stwff by Llwybr Llaethog hardly gets any clout. Stwff, while excellent and varied in construction, does not exactly strike as a purely important or rhythmically intriguing album altogether but a hodgepodge of what their sound is like altogether. While there are several songs from their much better and rhythmically dynamic Chwaneg (Blino and Ar Fy Llw), Stwff only has one particularly enriching and melodically beautiful toward the end known as Aberdaron. Full of spoken word and mysterious piano, emotions and visions of childhood often convey here much in the way Funki Porcini illustrated an eerie vibrance in The Third Man on his album On or The Big Sea on Fast Asleep.&#34;
As a fan of Ladytron, Metric, Goldfrapp, and even the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' last album, I was hoping to like "Fixin To Thrill" a lot. Unfortunately...not so much. Most of the tracks underwhelm, failing to hit the electro-pop dance-rock target they're aiming for. The title track is an exception; an unqualified winner, it's easily the best song on the album. After that, however, it's mostly downhill, with "Gone Too Far", "Easy", "Pick Up The Phone" and "Big Sunglasses" being the only tracks worth a listen. The rest are mediocre and forgettable. For the price, though, I don't feel burned: I basically paid for five good songs, and that's exactly what I got.
I like Continent's songs that are more upbeat.  This time I wasn't looking for slower songs.  Not being being negative here.
Chill music...nothing more and nothing less.Check this out for yourself.  The length of the track was good also.  Go for it.
I wanted to get this album specifically because of the song Morning Room, which is a really great piece of music. However, it's missing from the MP3 version of the album. On the CD, it's track 11. I notified Amazon about this a month ago but the track is still missing. So, if you buy this and there's no track 11, you're missing out. Once they fix this I'll be happy to update the review.
Amazon didn't include disc number metadata for this release, so the two-disc continuous mix is all out of order!It's a quick fix in desktop software, but I have higher expectations from digital music vendors.
Although it is not the &#34;only album you'll ever need&#34;, it is still worth the price. Even if you have to delete a couple of songs here and there.
This has a good mix that has a little bit of everything new age or fusion for dancers.  Don't expect any classics on here except for a couple redone as mixes.  Some songs, to me, are "eh" others are really good.  I also like the end song mix to play as ambient music.There's few glaring issues though. Song #34 Meltan by Oriental Star is actually song #40 Cybele by Solace.  I don't know if there was an error when the mp3s were ripped or if the actual CD has the same two songs on it or if Oriental Star just grabbed a Solace song and called it their own.  So you're not getting 40 songs and mix you're getting 39 and a mix.  Oh, and #35 Kassar Army by Pete list is also a Solace song that I recognize from one of the albums I have.  But I don't think it's repeated on this album.  At least not as a Solace song.  Also, #36 is a Solace song, not a drum solo as listed.  Thinking about it, I think some of these may have been misnamed when this was created.
This album is ok, but I really would have liked the original groups that first recorded the songs to be the ones that sung them.  This is a remake of the songs with different artist.  I like original..
Thought I would enjoy this but maybe I didn't like the disco era as much as I thought.  It's fine if you like disco
I purchased these a LONG while ago, and downloaded a few more since then. The only ones that really work well without absolute concentration and undivided focus are the ones designed to make you feel paranoid O_O OBVIOUSLY I'm going to be looking around hearing footsteps and such around me. My boyfriend at the time got the best results from Peyote, while I'll admit that Orgasm and Acid were better for me. The only time I got a real sense of a 'drugged' use was when I listened to them half asleep. Acid still pops up on my phones random playlist and I let it play, mainly because it is just interesting. =]
Same thing as I said about the other CD is this series...its just eh...not anything I would use for a scene or a playhouse at all
I have ALL 3 Posthumus CDs. I was Disappointed with Makara! It is just a wall to wall onslaught of Action Movie background soundtracks. The FINESSE & Beauty of songs like "NARA" & "ANTISSA" from the "UNEARTHED" CD are sorely & sadly missing!
Let me preface this review by stating that I own both of ESP's previous albums, and several of those albums' tracks are my absolute favorite pieces of "trailer" music. This genre has exploded into more general public awareness lately, helped very much by ESP and Globus.That said, Makara is lacking in subtlety and variety. As another reviewer mentioned, this is constant high-octane action music, and it gets tiring very quickly. If you enjoyed the more delicate aspects of Unearthed's Nara and many of Cartographer's Pi mixes, I'd recommend avoiding this release. The 30-second previews give a pretty good idea about the intensity of the tracks; now simply extrapolate and imagine that intensity being sustained for the entire length of each track. There's only so much emotional bombardment one can take on a single CD.Don't get me wrong; it is pleasantly surprising when one of the tracks show up during a shuffle-all playlist, but they are too grating for repeated, dedicated listens.Here's hoping their next release is a good mix of emotional highs and lows with more delicate orchestration!
Makara left me rather disappointed.On the up side:Posthumus dropped the songs from "Cartographer" and did stick to what they do best. Very dramatic and melodious music. They do a splendid job there. There isn't a single moment in which the album calms down.On the down side:The album sounds very cheap. Posthumus did a gigantic backflip here. Most symphonic metal bands and quite a few commercial trailer music companies start with synthetically produced orchestra sounds, because they can't afford a real orchestra. Nightwish, Within Temptation are now using real orchestras and "Two Steps from Hell" did so from the first album on i think. Both "Unearthed" and "Cartographer" used the real deal (the Seattle Symphony Orchestra to be exact) plus a choir, but this time around it is very obvious that no real orchestra  and absolutely no choir was involved and that the brothers simply used a computer. The album sounds flat, there is no depth  and no soul in the sound. Yes the arrangements are still epic, but even the harmonies are of the cheapest kind and I can't say that I was swept away by the music, the way I was while listening to the first two albums. I am very sure that tracks like "Vishnu", "Manju" and "Kuvera" would have sounded truly massive and epic with a real orchestra. Maybe the brothers will make more money with the album, because they didn't have to pay an expensive orchestra, but the listening pleasure has been equally reduced.  Especially bad are the two classical tracks that have been newly arranged. Just horrid with this computer generated orchestra. The weakest entry of Posthumus so far. No question about it.
I totally agree with the review made by Fire from New York - this is defenitely the weakest of the 3 albums with very little variety - the album is full of high paced tracks which at some point just makes you go the the next song, only to figure out that the next one is also bombastic. I got tired of it quickly and it actually made me feel stressed out. Perhaps this album is best for action movie soundtracks or driving on a highway or if you need to rush to the hospital ! The last song is a remake of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata - although nice, they could have made it much more beautiful by adding in a choir. Overal a disappointing album of one of my favourite artists - it only a 'nice to have' , nothing more.
First time through the album it is striking and powerful.  But soon a monotonous experience begins to form.  While a few of the cuts do retain their magnetism others are very reminiscent of each other.  In rich full sound it is impressive though.
I like it, especially Start None and Godette. Some songs have a Tricky influence, which to me is good. I downloaded this album for free, and I think I will be purchasing her others.
I've been a fan of Kellees since her first CD but I must say that I enjoy the second one alot more! All the beats on the album are awesome and she adds the perfect lines that fit each song. I'm currently living in Pittsburgh and have seen Kellee perform a few times and shes definitely making the city proud! I can't wait for her next album I'm sure that it was will be twice as good as her first and second.
I listened to this CD because one of my friends had been nagging me for weeks to check it out. Suprisingly I really enjoyed it and have added it to my itunes and now listen to it  willingly. Kellee reminds me of a little of Ke$ha + Lady Gaga + Rapper. Shes definitely unique but it's refreshing that shes not your stereotypically blonde haired singer who starts off as a teeny booper then transitions into rebelious stage later becoming "semi normal"**cough cough Christina Agulera, Britney Spears, etc etc** I will definitely be spreading the word about Pittsburghs very own Kellee Maize and would recommend anyone to give it a chance!
A very average pop/hip hop album. Nothing really special about it at all, but it was free so that's ok. It's worth a listen if your interested.
I didn't like this album as much as I thought I would. I generally like Thornton's music, I listened to all the samples before purchasing, and was still a bit disappointed.  It seems like a re-hash of a lot of his stuff from the "Egypt" albums. I also thought that in many songs the screechy pipes/horns/whatever drown out the percussion.
When I saw this compilation, I had to buy it; I'm a huge fan of the game and the music is absolutely wonderful. But what I love about the music doesn't translate to this format. The stages, which in the game loop hypnotically for long stretches, here only have four bars of music each. It's too rushed. Descent, which is a fifteen minute level, is here squashed into under 3 minutes.Then the big problem became apparent: what makes the music in the game so thrilling are the almost sonata-like ways the bits combine on each stage to create rhythms and melodies which are truly missed here. The syncopated bits on Growth really make the song work, and here it just sounds bland. I wish the producers had just recorded a perfect completion of the whole game, rather than this sparknotes treatment. And the inclusion of the incidental music is nice but unnecessary.The original remixes are a plus, though, and earn the 3 stars all by themselves. They're good, hold true to the retro style, and manage to entertain in a humble way.My advice, listen to the samples first to make sure you really want what you're getting, I was disappointed.
This should be called Borderline...I think its Vanilla that puts BDSM on this CD series...no one in the LifeStyle would dare put this on them
Is this the sound of Shanghai?Nothing that will blow your mind, but a few shining tracks make it a fair buy.Much love: B6, JinbaobabSome love: Mu Xiao Hu, MHP, Sun Ye
the music was fine i bought the whole cd and i feel the best one was krishna dub. i had hoped the rest of the cd was like this track not quite but still ok
I'm in the same boat as everybody else - the tunes are superb here! But the quality of the sounds really do detract from its greatness. If the sound-mix could've been at the high-quality clarity that we are so used to in our High-Def world, I would give it 5 stars. I wish I could blast this in my car, but when I do, the obvious lo-fi quality of the "washed-out" sound quality gets to be a bit hurtful on the ears as it sounds like the music is distorted - and it is, but we don't want that, do we? Anyway the music is a mellower version of Justice or General Midi, it's in that sort of range. It really is a shame though that they had to go for this distorted quality - I don't think it needs to purposefully sound like it was recorded and mixed on tape.
This is a nice CD.  It is motivating when you listen to it and you want to work out more and more.
I wish this was released as a CD because some of these mp3s have really bad sound quality, and are almost unlistenable. (skips and gaps) In spite of this, I liked the music. Some of my favorite songs are Elegua, Chango (Inle-Gue), Da Drum, and the Jungle/Drum'n'Bass track Barasuaye.
A great album by a great band. They are like a mix of older incubus, 311 and a bit of 90's electronica
I like this genre of music MOST OF THE TIME!  However, THIS is one of those albums that'll simply have to "Grow On Me".  For some reason, it appeared to come across as somewhat "BLAHH"!  Maybe after I hear it some more, it may be a bit BETTER!
Although these are some great 90s hits, this seems to be a bit of a bootleg.  Not sure who the artist is, as it sounds like the same person on all songs.  Decent versions to listen to while working out or as background noise.
its a great sound to a night of party or a get you moving sound tech style that sounds addictive
Nice tune but took 5mins to ramp up! thatz about 3mins too long. If you like this, you will like Pitch Up by Spirit Tag. Another Amazon freebie.
You really must see this band live. Although this CD show cases most of the songs the band is currently playing in their live set, the recording does not capture the band's energy and humor.  If you have a chance to see this band live; DO!
Ordered to show my son that Christian dubstep is out there as well.  There are a couple of songs that I can definitely see as being uplifting, but all in all, sounds like more dubstep to me.
I bought this shortly after listening to the more recent release, 360, which is thoroughly excellent. Here, the composer occasionally does what I was so happy not to find in his newer work, namely use world music and foreign samples as a go-to signifier for 'otherness.' The danger on the passive end of that scale is that the music could sound like a new age waiting room --this work is a bit more active and instead comes across occasionally like an undiscovered Peter Gabriel film track from the mid-'90s. And that's not even necessarily an insult; it's just that as a listener I'm tired of what sounds at times like musical tourism. There are a few too many panpipes over synth washes for me.That only happens now and then however, and overall, like all the Ultimae releases this is a workmanlike and well-executed release. The composer is excellent at creating and developing emotional moods that evolve seemlessly from one to the other.
Warning: The Elli Mac track, So In Love [d'still'd Mix] on this "single", is actually taken from the Moonshine Mixed (Vol. 1), which is a Continuous Mix. You get an abrupt beginning and ending to the track. Why they (Moonshine) did this for the digital single...I have no clue. It's an awesome mix. Too bad there wasn't a warning about the track being extracted from a continuous mix before I downloaded. I would have simply ripped the track from the CD, which is in my collection. I did not purchase the other tracks, as this was the only mix I wanted...so, I can't comment if the other mixes are complete.
It's okay. That's the three stars, I guess. Some sorta mix kinda EDM or electronica sort of thing that if you paid attention might jump up and grab you. I think it needs a lot more vuvuzela for deeper meaning. Waaa haha ha ha.
I don't remember buying this, listening to this, seeing this, or doing anything with this.  But I still liked it
As you can gather from the previews, this music is mostly just laid back beats with a few instruments laid over them. Not really what I've come to expect from either DJ.
Julius Papp ranks as one of my favorite House DJ's, but "Open Mind" is not as exciting as his earlier albums.  I can't imagine anyone jackin' their body to "Open Mind."
The last song on the album is actually incorrect from this amazon purchase but the rest of the music is good.
It's ok. Not the best. Some songs are good. My husband is still not sure if he really likes it or not.
Unexpectedly, Blacklight is the best Iris album so far. It's certainly a lot better thanWrath. They finally cut back on the silly fantasy-hero lyrics. The words are now more "safe" in that vaguely angst-ridden way, not quite as overbearingly emotional as before. Yet, there's also a new, more humble air that prevents the lyrics from being totally forgettable. The chorus of "Disintegrate," the centerpiece of the album, consists of a dramatic, prostrate call for help to Jesus. Sure, it's still a little bit self-aggrandizing (all Iris songs are), but it's definitely different from Reagan Jones's usual style of depicting himself as a world-weary, heroic traveler who has seen it all and easily sees through disguises (cf. "Imposter," "Lands of Fire," "Hell's Coming With Me" and just about any other song fromAwakeningor Wrath). There's still some good old "I/you" dichotomies, but thankfully much less "fever" and "pain."I've criticized Jones's singing and writing before, but on Blacklight, he acquits himself pretty well. On the other hand, his cohort Andrew Sega (a.k.a. Necros) is still dragging his feet a little. Necros has been a perpetual "rising young genius" in electronica for over a decade now. I bow to no one in my admiration of such classic tracks as "Amber Poison," "Martian Lovesong" and "Winter," but he never made the brilliant, classic electronic album that these tracks promised. Even his solo albums asThe Alpha Conspiracyare uneven (speaking of which, he said there'd be another one a couple of years ago -- what happened there?), and starting with Wrath, his output in Iris took a turn for the generic. On Blacklight, he's still doing those same overbearing, peppy shuffled break-beats that were all over Awakening, Aura and Wrath. Nearly every song (except "Disintegrate") has the same percussion style -- the drums pound the same rhythms stridently. The rhythm tracks are busy, with dense high-hat patterns, but there is very little variation, and no memorable drum fills. This sounds fine in upbeat songs like "Closer To Real" and "Red Right Return," but it's too much for the soft songs like "The Marianas Depths," which is supposed to sound more ambient.Percussion was never Necros' biggest strength, his classic songs are driven by brilliant melodies. But the minimal production of Blacklight brings the drums to the forefront, and uses melodic elements mostly as background texture. Sometimes they surface in an effective way. "Xwires" starts off totally forgettable, but halfway through a droning, repeating chord appears suddenly in the verses, producing an arresting effect and drawing one's attention back to the song. "Fighter" has the usual goofy Jones lyric, but the bouncy keyboard passage in the second half perks the song back up. Grinding guitars are used much better here than on Wrath, surging suddenly in some choruses, then instantly subsiding. The one-two guitar line in "Red Right Return" is quite a rush, boosting Jones's chorus into the most elegantly anthemic Iris song to date. And "Closer To Real" even has an instrumental keyboard line appearing after the second chorus, a first for a band that has always over-emphasized the singer.However, while this is all much better than Wrath, and makes for a much better and fresher direction for Iris as a band, the music doesn't have the uncanny originality of classic Necros. It's mostly a matter of using simple elements like guitar chords, acid synths (like in "Cross Product" from thefirstAlpha Conspiracy album) and well-placed synth drones to accentuate parts of different songs. But there are very few melodic hooks, or novel production techniques. It's the best Iris album, but it pales next to the heavy, ultra-catchy feedback riff from "Martian Lovesong." Furthermore, while Wrath is a chore to listen to, the echo/riff combination in "Hell's Coming With Me" is more novel than any song on Blacklight (even if everything else about Wrath was underwhelming).Still, Blacklight is good at creating a sense of a dramatic turning point; for once, its moody tone implies introspection without showing it off. Half the songs don't make much of an immediate impression, but there's nothing bad to say about them either. The other half is tightly written, with a couple of distinct details that pin one's attention, with the only real weakness being the very self-similar rhythms. In general, Blacklight is much leaner and more focused than any other Iris album, and thus is a highly enjoyable listen ("Disintegrate" is the most affecting Iris song to date), even if the music isn't quite up to par with the Necros classics.
Following two of my favorite albums of all time (Awakening and Wrath), I must say Blacklight comes as a disappointment. First of all, nine songs does not seem quite enough to make an album unless some of the songs are rather lengthy, which none of these are. I wish they had taken the time to add at least one more. In terms of the music itself... It's actually pretty good. Unfortunately, though, this album is lacking some major hooks - whereas the previous two had hooks aplenty! But my biggest issue is the lyrics. On this album they cross way too far into the Christian category for my tastes. If Reagan wanted to make a Christiany album, I wish he had done it as a different project, as to not repel those of us mega-fans who are not of that faith. My final complaint is with the cd case and booklet. I like the cover art, but the rest seems sort of rushed and cheap.All that considered, however, I still like the album. Even though there weren't many big hooks to grab me initially, all the songs have grown on me and I do find them enjoyable. The two tracks that come closest to reaching the greatness of past Iris masterpieces (like almost every song from Wrath and Awakening) are "The Marianas Depths" and "Disintegrate." Personally, I think the weakest track is "Closer To Real." The chorus needs...more.So anyway, I still consider myself a fan of Iris... But dang it, if only the lyrics were a little more secular. That's been the biggest obstacle keeping me from loving this album the way I did the last two.
Not splendid, but good though.If you happen to buy this one as your first Iris album, all the next ones will touch you even more.For those who like Camouflage, Iris is very similar.Always good entertainment.
Iris are a great, underrated band in their genre, but this album is kind of plain. If you compare it to more recent releases like the three songs on 'Hydra' and 'Wrath'(which is a brilliant record hands down) 'Blacklight' is somewhat...boring? Now, there are some stand out cuts; Panic Rev, Cruel Silence, Red Right Return... but the rest are kind of...boring? Er yes, I said it again. Every band has their 'off' record, and look; this is still a 'good' album and a must for any Iris fan. What I would like to see Iris do on the next one is ramp it up a bit; progress, and turn up the bpm. How about a concept record guys? Science fiction alien sex themes? I'd like to see more imagination, and expansion into some new territories from this band. Let's see an EPIC fifth record, take your time and make a masterpiece. All your fans, and the new ones you gained on the LOST tour, will wait patiently.
The first track, So Hard to Say, is really tough to classify.  The listener feel like they've listened to an hour's mashup of so many different genres that it fails to deliver a singular idea.  I have no idea what the first track is about and maybe that's the point, I don't know.The second track, The Bomb, is a pretty flat tune, yet somewhat catchy with a side of hopeful for better.  It's got some fun bits where the synth trumpets come in for a few measures and some other interesting parts with high pitched, yet soft rhythmic tones.  Very nice, really, but a bit underwhelming.  This song feels like the 50's housewife who occasionally has a cigarette and it's really exciting and euphoric.  It's great background music for housework or writing reviews about the song in question.  Yes, I do (did) the latter. :)The third track, Future Disco, is fantastic!  An alternately driving melody/baseline pulls you through many different soundscapes of soft, soothing, yet motivating rhythms.  The transitions are long and smooth, yet exact in their execution.  I'm really impressed with the finesse involved in this piece.  The listener is teased, rather than thrust, into the next direction the artist dictates.  This is Cinnamon Chasers making some of their best music!
It is no better than all the other endless electronic junk with no character that's circulating out there. When will somebody finally come up with some decent chill out music that is pleasing to the ear and the soul?! If anybody knows of such, please let me know. Thanks
Overall not a bad effort. There are a few club worthy tracks. A couple of things that bring down the latest music by Faderhead: 1) Overuse of the cheezy auto-tune vocal sound. I can appreciate a band that isn't boxed in by a label..(Industrial, EBM, or whatever) but overkill on the auto-tune sound seems out of place. 2) Silly and over the top songs like "The way to F**k God". c'mon really?  How very rebel and Industrial-ish. Way to alienate potential fans. Aside from that, this is a decent album. I would give it a 3.5 star.
Originally released in 1980, as this was the French art rock duo's third and final record. Maybe not as stellar as their first two lp's - the self-titled debut and 'Trip In The Center Head' (see my reviews of both) but I, personally thought that 'Playback' is okay. Tunes that are worth mentioning include the pop oriented "Love Machine" (completely out of character for Space Art) and the well-played three-part "Alpha Du Centaure (Part I)", "Alpha Centaure (Part II)" and "Alpha Centaure (Part III)". What's really amazing is I saw on You Tube where the two musicians who make up Space Art has actually recently reunited. Nice.
I BOUGHT THE MP3 OF &#34;SPEND THE NIGHT WITH ME&#34; (MY FAVORITE SONG BY THE LADIES) & THE SOUND ISNT VERY GOOD,I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEW ON THE SOUND QUALITY,I CAN &#34;RE-EQUALIZE&#34; THE PLAYBACK SOUND OF BURNED CDS I MAKE FROM THE MPS ON MY SYSTEM OTHERIWISE IT WOULDNT SOUND AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL 1977 LP &#34;LOVE IN A SLEEPER&#34; SOUNDED (THE LP THIS SONG WAS TAKEN FROM.)
I like this CD. Though the first song sounds like someone is passing gas. It feels like an experimental album of some sorts. I definitely get the vibe that this was done on someone's home computer and I am paying the heft fee for this. Maybe I should buy a Mac or some special software and start doing this as well.
Enslaved was a great game, and the score is sweeping and gorgeous in parts. I like listening to video game scores while I work, and this one is quite good for that. The only song that I absolutely hate and even went so far to outright delete off the album is Pigsy Blues. Completely disrupts the mood of the rest of the score.
I really enjoyed the game, and most of the songs on this soundtrack are great.I didn't particularly like the songs which include quotes from the game, because I felt they took away from the overall atmosphere of the soundtrack. On their own, they're interesting, but in a playlist they're a bit jarring.However, I did like the variety of music types. There is a good mix of slow/low-key music and upbeat instrumentals. For example, "No Death in Love" (which sounds similar to a vocal track from a Silent Hill game) is very different from "Cloud Surfing."My advice for the soundtrack is the same as my advice for the game: give it a try, see if you like it, then pick it up if it fits your tastes.
The music in Enslaved is amazing, but this soundtrack fails to deliver. Not only does it exclude some of the best tracks in the game, but several of the songs it DOES include are short and just... loop for 5 minutes. You get tired of them quickly. Scattered throughout the soundtrack are random quotes from the characters in the game, which is also pretty weird.Overall disappointed. I loved the soundtrack, but this compilation isn't something I'd recommend. 3 stars.
I originally bought this album because I'd heard one of the songs in spin class and really liked it. I don't love the whole album, but there are some fun songs on it that keep you moving!
IF YOU LIKE REMIXES AS IN HIP HOP OR BOOMING TYPE THEN YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS, IF NOT YOU PROBABLY WON'T
I really liked the song one night, one kiss when I heard it on the radio so I snagged this album. I think the songs will go well in a party mix but listening to them all in a row they get on my nerves a little, too poppy or something.
If pretty lights separated their albums by hours of their set, this would be their 3AM. Although it features no standout tracks, the mellow, one degree softer than dubstep tracks are easy for a worn out body to groove to. Pretty Lights have been known to play sets from 7PM-7AM, so they need to mix up the pace and let the crowd relax every so often. The final track, So Much in The Dark, teases that the calm is almost over with the heaviest bass of the album. Be patient, it seems to say, rest up. The next one will blow you away.
So I purchased it.  It's ok, but honestly, I'd rather have my money back.  Her voice is pleasant enough, but sometimes tends toward 'over-singing' and doing all of these runs that just don't quite hit the note head-on. I have a very good ear for music and a few of the songs just sound very slightly off-key.  It is a fun album, though - I will give it that.
This was not the artist I was looking for. Even though I previewed this it turned out to be one of her works. It catchy anyway.
Not his best work. Not the worst either. If you're a die hard fan then I suggest getting it. Overall it's alright
excellent beginning nice energy flowing, the melody is intense, then it slows, then energy goes down, song slows, and the melody, tempo are everywere not so bad but not as good as the beginning. I preffer energy throughout with a good low volume finish and no words. Would have gave it five stars if it didnt slow down the flow from 2:00-2:40. I respect the artists creation. I hope to create some tracks some time in the future.
this is a good album for any com truise fan..the other albums are better but for the price its way worth it
Not for everyone, but a fine collection of electronic music.  The price was great.  Not all pieces are winners. It's OK for what it is,
You hear it on the radio it sometimes gets played often. Its really an eye catcher I just had to purchase the mp3 album.
The entire song list is OK, however there are a couple of songs that are repetitious, meaning when it gets to the bridge of certain songs the bridge is too long. Maybe it's done for mixing purposes, I don't know. Overall, the song list is OK,nothing really stands out.
Psiconauta - Philip Glass on speed, that's a neutral comment.Elastik - Same as above with more phasing.Many Thoughts - puts me in mind of buzzing around the foothills above Catania (Sicily) tre espressi doppi into the drive. I like this track.1 of 3.Remember kids, don't over-caffeinate and drive.
