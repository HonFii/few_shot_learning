The reason I love and subscribe to Pandora is because I find other bands/music from "liking" other music and they play similar music. That's how I found All India Radio, I heard it on one of my stations.The album is mellow and stylish. I've only listened to the whole thing once or twice so far, but I really like what I hear.
Great Stuff. All excellent, but two are some of my all-time favorite instrumentals. You can listen to "permanent revolutions" and "open sky experiment" thousands of times and never get tired of them.
I was working away, this album in my headphones, and I don't know if it's my mood today or what, but I have enjoyed so many of the tracks that I have been compelled to come a write a review.  I am really enjoying this album, lots of unexpected references to different cultures vocal sounds layered against sonorous electronica.  Yumm!
Got the album just to get a song from Burn Notice (the TV series).  Little did I expect the whole album to be so great.  A little unknown gem here with Jessy Greene...
This record is quite different from everything that came afterwards, and more in the vein of his Halcyon441 work.However, I still enjoyed most of the songs as they are not bad in any way. Intelstat is a great example of a trancier Deadmau5 song.
Deadmau5's album "Get Scraped" is one of his early compilations of music.  It is an interesting mix of beats, dubstep, etc.  My son is a HUGE fan of Deadmau5, and I have come to enjoy listening to this album.Get Scraped
An interesting look back at deadmau5's earlier work. This album is much, much better than the marginal "at play" albums recently released on Amazon MP3.
Though the album is entirely different from his mainstream saw pluck synth and drawn out style, as an electronic producer I can appreciate Joel's more experimental youth as an artist. Gte scraped would rank top 3 in my Deadmau5 discography. One thing that annoys me is that FlashTV is not on the digital download album, ONLY on the CD release which had limited quantities. FlashTV was another great song that I would of like to have owned through this album download.
I rate albums based on replay-ablilty and how many songs on the album I like.  This album had 9 out of 15 songs that I really like and after a couple of weeks I'm still listening to it.  Great background music to code to.
This is a nice house compilation brought to you from Music Brokers - a company based in Argentina.  I like the uptempo house style, but I think you could also consider this Sexy House and this is one of my favorite compilations of theirs - great for background music or regular listening.
Ever wondered what would happen if glitch met easy listening? Well, wonder no more: Original Recipe's NOISETTE answers that for it. All the happy perkiness of lounge melodies come against cut-and-click programming, resulting in a concoction that's quite unlike anything else. The jazz bass and horn of "The Chase," for instance, runs into a stuttering, digital hip-hop beat, as layers of noise accumulate, reminiscent of the old Chocolate Industries label. But "Flanched Farney Garney" has more of a post-rock feel, with its woozy guitars and a pretty little melody augments by the swelling horns. Meanwhile, "Gravel" finds a subtle delicacy in its slow build. But, if you think that's too soft, chopped up hip-hop lyrics find their way onto "Parking Lot," which still manages to be delicate. Indeed, the delicacy finds its way onto several tracks, from the acoustic guitar strums of "Big Tesuque" to the ambience that kicks off "Wine & Candles." "KlymaxXx" has more of a apparent rhythm, replete with 80s flourishes, and "All Things Temporary" has those thick post-rock layers again, though with the obvious electronic meddling. "Are You Being Served?" closes the album with more IDM flavor, the crunchy percussion, the snip-and-pastes. But it makes for a delicious meal overall.
These are a far second from the original and you do not get the B-Side Kryptonite. I will say I normally have enjoyed Dave Londons remixing and production but this record was such a break through that it's amazing they even tried to re-work it. Props for them getting on board with Jinx though, the guy is brillant!
I found Katy vs. Evil from the song 'Fool' on Pandora. The whole album was only $4 so it was an easy purchase. Every song is a dramatic departure from the last. Some songs have a jazzy feel. I have had a hard time pinning down what genre that I'd put her under. There is also very little other info out there about this artist. I'd love to find out more, but can't seem to chase it down. There is no bio in Pandora either.
I'm really, really fond of the first disc, Latex Empire's "Waveland".  It's repetitive, loopy, acidy goodness.  Think the rave scene from "Blade".  Not particularly innovative or anything, but highly listenable.  Despite the compilation tag, this is not really trance.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)The second is Holophonia's "Psych-O-Range", which is not at all bad.  It's much more trance-influened, and also quite listenable.  It doesn't go the path of epic trance, sticking to a more (per the album name) psychedelic side, with its dark, industrial/EBM touches.The last disc is Future Trance Trax, a Hypnotic compilation.  It's got its moments (Giez's "I'm a Hero"), but I haven't listened to it in a few years, whereas the other two I still do.It was a pleasant surprise to see this available for MP3 download here.  I hope this helps you decide if this is something you want.
This, in my opinion, is some good hardcore. Heavy kick and a higher tempo than other types of electronic music. Deepack shows his stuff on the drum machine here: punchy, deep kicks and other sounds that really help round out his sound. His voice samples add flavour to an otherwise-stereotypical EP. He makes for some good, headnodic music that would be good to drive to.
It's too bad that Mark is not actively playing around New York as he once did. I regret never having the pleasure to see him perform in person. This is a very tasty trio outing that show's Elf's musicality and mastery of his instrument. He even takes a stab at replicating the great Tal Farlow's trick of playing whole lines on harmonics, a risky endeavor for which he deserves credit for even attempting. The results are good if a bit spotty, but I've never  heard any guitarist besides Farlow get it right (and he had famously huge hands in addition to his virtuosic technique). New York Cats by Mark Elf is a worthy addition to the collection of any jazz guitar fan.
Ive gone thru alot of stores looking for original tahitian drum music,this the best of the best cant get any better
Mark Norman has proven once again what trance can produce going beyond the usual mundune boundaries of genre.  DJ Joop's original testifies to high sound and the club experience.  DJ Joop knows the trance club the flavor clients/listeners want and he delivers.
Okay.  We need to figure out what the heck "chill" means.  "Chill," to me, has a positive connotation.  A light-scented, hazy-candle glow to it.  I'm not saying "chill" can't be dark, but this album is downright wicked.Don't get me wrong.  I liked it.  This music just doesn't feel passive, which is usually a staple for albums that incorporate the word "chill" into their titles.  Instead, these songs sound like the kinds of things that would be playing on movies as the background to some seriously dirty stuff: drugs, adultery, and other forms of socially unacceptable sex.Don't get me wrong.  I have been known to enjoy socially unacceptable sex.  ("Top 5" and "Wash" are two tracks especially suited for that.)  The only real problem with the album is its niggling inconsistencies.  It starts out heavy on the doom and gloom (the first three tracks have to be some of the darkest ambient music I've ever heard), but then it just turns weird.  "Hey Rainman" sounds like it may or may not be a joke.  "Monkey In The Black Sky" would be captivating if it weren't ten minutes long.  "Lisse Gruv" would be a great addition to a light jazz album, but here it feels like a ballarina among mobsters.  The final five tracks are my favorite block of the album, a coherent collection of deeply unsettling grooviness.This CD is great if you're making your own compilation of dark or chillout tunes.  As is, it's a mixed bag.
If you are into chill-house music this is a pretty decent album. I like playing it while eating dinner at home or just lounging about. It's good music to play in the background or really late at night.
Somehow I missed this when it first came out but now it is a favorite for working out.  So many fun songs with hooks and a beat that is just perfect for me on the elliptical or cranking through some weights.&#34;she just wants some money, he just wants some sex.....&#34;.  Lol give me a break these songs are irresistible.  Solid album that I play all the way through but I suppose someday I will work them into various mixes.
I listened to highlife on the radio in Nigeria in the early sixties, and Victor Olaiya and his All Stars featured prominently. This seems to be a representative collection, though I've been unable to locate any background information on the tracks included in the Three Decades of Highlife album. Everything seems to be copyright 2006 by Premier, with no further metadata. The bright, blaring trumpet brings back memories of the hot, sweaty nightclubs I managed to sneak into. The mix is probably faithful to the original recordings, but so bright I have to keep the volume down to preserve what's left of my hearing.
The material is great, I like to ear the expression of the artist materialized and delivered. Great job.Any new music soon ???
I don't know why I like this cd but I do for some reason. probably because it can really hep u tune ur system
Damn good noise if you ask me.  Good beats, and great use of imagination.squirrel
Although every track has its strengths, there is one in particular that is on my all-time favorite list. "Insomnia" is a hidden classic.
I'm preparing a "Battle Of The Sexes" set for an event in Orlando, FL. The difficult part is find enough female synth/future pop contenders. Well, The Crystalline Effect dow not disappoint. This is an excellent album from a fairly new arrival. I, for one, like it a lot and look forward to hearing more from this band.
Youth was certainly at the forefront of psy-trance back in the '90s.  While this may not break any new ground, it's totally solid for the genre.  Youth is one of the best.  He has a natural feel for the music, never going overboard on the psychedelic part - ie, cheap, overused samples; too much wild sweeping; etc.If you're into this genre, can't go wrong here.
I got this album because I liked the songs featuring Daryl.  After listening all the way through, those are about the only ones I like! The rest of the album is ok...not terrible, but not great.
The future is now on Sugar Coated Bullets, the first studio album released by the electronic rock trio Future Rock.  Future Rock blends electronica techno-style dance beats with jam band rock into their own unique style.  Fans of the Disco Biscuits (with whom they have toured) and trance style techno music like that spun by DJ Tiesto should really give Future Rock a listen.  If you'd like to try before you buy, the band offers free CD length podcasts of their live shows on their website.Sugar Coated Bullets is oriented toward discreet three to four minute songs in contrast to their sprawling live versions, but the tracks still manage to blend quite well and the lack of lyrics makes this music ideal for mood setting atmospherics.The rock element is slightly softer on this CD than in their later music, and track six is my least favorite of the set sounding a bit like an old style video game gone awry.  However, the rest of the CD is excellent, and if this is the future of music, it rocks!
This is a long running side band from Cryptomnesia, also on the same label Interdimensional Industries. Not as dancy or industrial as Cryptomnesia, but closer to chillout or goa. The songs are instrumentals (so, no vocals unlike Crypto) and not as layered.If you like older Underworld, The Orb, or Richie Hawtin, check out this Canadian band comprised of DJ Nate Kelly, Alus Cognito, Amaneusis, and Van Dorp, all DJs from western canada.Should really fit in well with the right DJ set of similar music, and definitely better than all that other Top-40 stuff. Checkout their site Interdimensional com or preview em on iTunes, if u like EBM- you will like this CD.
Great album.  Good music for background or just to let your mind wander into imagination land.  I only gave 4 stars because they do some weird mechanical noies at time that can detract from the ambiance but not to the point where it riuns the music.  It's till great, especially &#34;the view&#34;.
This was the second part of the purchase and like it as much as the first. So far so good. Only listened to it a few times but liking it up to this point.
Just found Implant and liked the first thing I herad from them so bought this and like it also thus far.
This group does a great job of mixing the Minyo style and Electronic to come up with a twist on Okinawa culture mood music. You will need to do a lot of re-sampling to get this danceable. This music is more of a kick back and enjoy the ear candy music. Wanted to hear a few more familiar samples of local Minyo's, but since I didn't recognize them, I gave it a four star.
I have only heard Mars Rain as of now, but I love that track.  It is very evocative of the subject.  It's exactly what I'd expect rain on Mars to sound like, if there was anyone there to have heard it.
Sarah Nixey's voice is one of the most beautiful, clear and enjoyable I've ever heard. Better than Kahimi Karie's breathy little girl, sweeter than, dare I say, Sarah Cracknell of St. Etienne, with a point of view all her own. May appeal to fans of Auteurs, Suede, St. Etienne, Dubstar, etc...
Great album. I have listened to this band for several years. They are a great band if you are into any industrial/rock type of music. Amazon, check your labeling, you might want to fix your stuff.
This is a great album as all of Rivertribe's are.  They are most gifted musicians that bring soulful rhythmic instrumentals to a whole new level that sticks to your ribs! I have most of them on CD and in my top 10 of favorites in this Genre.Amazon:  I have uploaded a Scan of my original CD Cover and included it on both CD and MP3 sources.  This album cover will not show up in the Cloud player probably because its messed up.  I hope that you can use my scan to fix this problem and honor this groups work.  Thanks in advance.4 Stars because of the cover art...5 for the album.
I just downloaded this and it is very good. But is it intentional, that the album cover is upside down?!! I doubt it!
I never expected so much sound and beats come out of The Angel and was suprised with the work she put in to this. It would have been better if she didn't remix songs from her No Gravity album, but all in all I was happy with her work.
good classic Shiny Toy Guns, with the original singer up front (now back in the band). unfortunately there are only two songs.
Track 1 is a great song for working out, running, anything where you need some up beat music to get you going.
Bought all three tracks but the labels are wrong as of 10/15/2011.  Listen to the samples to be sure of what you are getting.  First track is actually Stars.  Second track is actually A Song For You.  Third Track is actually Something Got Me Started.
I recently heard some of these songs at my job! I work in a boutique-like retail store, and they've begun playing some of these tracks over our speakers. I liked the sound of it because it wasn't your typical Christmas songs re-sang by current or unknown singers. Even though sometimes they do good renditions. But these songs are hip and fun! What you have here are songs from classic artists of an older era, mixed with a fresh, experimental sound. The song that prompted me to even find this cd was, "Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer (John Beltran Remix)" with Bing Crosby. One of my favorites from the album!Other favorites of mine: Happy Holiday (Beef Wellington Remix), Frosty The Snowman (Rondo Brothers Remix), Jingle Bells (Dan The Automator Remix), Winter Wonderland (Future Loop Foundation Remix), Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy (Red Baron Remix), Jingle Bells (Rise Ashen's Reindeer Dub).The other songs, either I thought were ok or I had to get used to them. So I can't say that I loved every track on here. But the ones I did love were enough to win me over and get me in the holiday spirit :D
When rating a remix album, you have to take into consideration artistic expression and creative license. There's nothing wrong with the tracks on this CD, they have the Christmas feel, the cool grooves, the works. A great addition  for the Christmas Connoisseur. Something here that's not just another compilation of the same 30 songs on every CD. Instead, some really cool remixes of them. It's new and it's classic all at the same time. Well done.
it pains me a great deal to think just how criminally ignored this brilliant band/CD is by our world :-[
This album is bangin'!  Smooth beats, tight lyrics, and a totally individual sound for the time!
Nice work, interesting beats, keeps things moving.  Good music for the car, workout, or background.  I would recommend to any electro fan.
This is a preliminary review but I think it's best to get out my initial impressions because DJ Keltech is almost unknown in the USA (or "the states" if you speak the Queen's English).  I am by no means a music expert, just an interested observer with an informed opinion.DJ Keltech is a master of both scratch and production and this album is a testament to that.What appears to divide popular scratch/production masters of the USA (X-Ecutioners, DJ Q-Bert, DJ Green Lantern, etc.) from DJ Keltech is that Keltech's style appears to settle further from hip-hop and more in the dance/techno realm.  Songs like 'Bionic Breaker', 'Cerveza and Olives', and 'Speaking With My Hands' typify DJ Keltech's predominate dance/techno style in which he impeccably maintains a level of production high enough to compete with the reigning genre masters (Crystal Method, Chemical Brothers, etc.).All of the songs on Strike Back are brimming with clever samples, fast scratches and flawless mixing.  The song which stands out the most to me is "Pimp My Horse" as it appears to be the most innovative without being overly dancy.  "Plucking Hell" is also one of my favorites though far more traditional and hip-hop sounding but unrelenting in scratch and sampling.The only low point of Strike Back is the overtly hip-hop songs ('My Conscience', 'Dream Weaver') which sound a bit forced and uninspired, perhaps because they try too hard to mix dance and hip-hop.  The beats are still far superior to 99% of the hip-hop scene in the USA today but not quite par in spitting.  I must admit though I form this opinion never having listened to much British hip-hop and having a high affinity for Wu-Tang Clan, RJD2, Artifacts, etc..  Nevertheless the aforementioned low point can hardly be considered a pitfall in an otherwise very impressive album.It's important to note that the MP3 version of this album does not appear to be complete so I'd suggest seeking out the actual CD version if you're a fan.
Remixed from their equally accomplished album,Archipelago, this album's songs have more shape and energy. The originals would all be more accurately classified as psychedelic trance than anything else, but here each song has been given a unifying drive and purpose. Although I liked the original versions, they were also like unfinished slabs of raw product awaiting molding.They've been beautifully molded here, but the general shape they take falls prey to a problem common to electronica: repetition. Although I enjoyed every song, very few of them sustained my complete interest all the way to the end (exceptions include Omnimotion's remix of "Tierra Azul" and Decoy's remix of "Sudden Comfort"). Still, it's a better collection of house-infused IDM than you can often find under one artist, and it's worth a listen for anyone who is already a fan of Vibrasphere.
Great sampling of underground russian electronic/IDM. Kmsh by EU is worth the price of admission alone. Can't overstate that enough....download that track and thank me later.
I feel like I'm still on the beach at Boracay, Philippines. A 'feel good' music and very relaxing to listen to.
Psytrance they call it, which makes it sound like it should combine the expansive spaciness of trance with the complex acidic tonality of psychedelia. Vibrasphere, as the name suggests, do in fact do that, but they add a bit more to the formula. A lot of artists in this genre get by with a few looped beats, a handful of interesting harmonies, and some digital chains of jittery electronica, stitching the whole thing together with choral progressions that are usually four-to-the-floor and par for the EDM course.I wouldn't say that Vibrasphere breaks much new ground here, but they do provide a wealth of good beats and rhythms for anyone looking to DJ their own sets or for those who aren't looking to confuse or entice listeners out of more than a background head bob or foot tap. Far too energetic too be trance, but not exclamatory enough to be house, this music rides the kind of bass-heavy line that will eventually evolve into the the distant (less argumentative) cousin of dubstep. Gritty but smooth, grim but gleeful, and always on the move, the album isn't a stand-out, but it is a workhorse, and sometimes with this genre, that's enough to get the job done.
Excellent ambient / atmospheric / slow psytrance album by Swedish duo Vibrasphere. The album is not run-of-the-mill psy with scorching fast beats and cheesy samples, but quite a thoughtfully put together set of songs. The mood is generally pleasant or even upbeat, and the tempo varies from song to song. Tierra Azul is my favorite off of this album --- a slow, uplifting track with lots of natural sound samples.All in all, highly recommended for fans of the ambient or chillout psytrance ("psychill" :) genres. I give this album 4 stars only because some of the songs (minus the samples) sound repetitive after a long time, but again, that's perhaps not so much Vibrasphere's fault as an artifact of the psytrance genre. I think that Vibrasphere have done better with their newest offering, Exploring the Tributaries (check out my review there too).
Great mixes of two legendary Shannon songs that epitomizes the music from the 80s.  I had never before heard these mixes but they are fantastic. Any Shannon fan should add these remixes to their collection.
Pitch Black is a little dark for ambient music, but draws me closer anyway. Not a 5, but a solid 4....
Lovely Lovely voices.  Would have liked faster paced songs, which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
I disagree with the other reviewers, but I can certainly understand where they are coming from. This album does contain some very free interpretations of Grateful Dead songs, sometimes with little or none of the lyrics and/or melodies. But hey, aren't some of the live dead bootlegs like that too? Ha Ha Ha. I find the Box of Rain cover, with just a few "scat" vocals at the end and none of the lyrics, to be strangely touching. Excellent versions of Brokedown Palace and Cassidy. And the other stuff is pretty good too, just don't expect it to be recognizable. I like the cool detuning synth sounds on Feel Like A Stranger.
Great work by Dolby and the Mafia Horns. Rich Armstrong is an underrated trumpet player and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him.
The music is great but the download is missing some of the end portions of a few of the songs.  I purchased this twice thinking the download didn't completely work the first time but it was the same for both downloads.  Some of the songs have dead air time for at least 1 1/2 minutes before going onto the next song and the music is not complete.I would buy the actual CD for this instead of downloading.
2007, apparently. Lord knows what label that is, and lord knows why Morley doesn't have a far wider listenership than he does. Fans of his early R&S; material, both solo and withAndrea Parker, need to jump on this. Most of the material is deep, vaguely rhythmic ambient in the vein of his 'Stardancer' EP, with a few beat-oriented tracks mixed in, and most of it dates from the late '90s (hence the title) and was freed up and subsequently reworked once Morley had done with various contractual obligations. 'Ghosts' features some of the best material from one of the finest experimental electronic producers of the past twenty years, and it's depressing to consider that it never even got distribution in this country. (If you know where I can find a CD copy, please let me know!) Very few people are making music like this anymore, and fewer still are doing it this well.
This is an extremely special compilation album.  Full of instrumental beauty, smooth transitions, and interesting changes.  Give it a try.
The South African's got in going on in the downtempo department. Who woulda thunk it? This is a fabulous album slipping all over the downtempo spectrum from glitchy idm chill to jazzy hip hop beats. If you like this, you might want to also check out The Real Estate Agents, Markus Wormstorm and other artists on the African Dope label.I give Sibot's album four stars because well I think the downtempo artist Bonobo deserves to remain alone and high up in the five star position. However Sibot is really really good and definitely an album worth buying -- especially at the low amazon mp3 price!
Believe it or not, I heard this CD while sitting in a roof top lounge atop a hotel in Venice, Italy.  Thought it was interesting and nice background music.  Nice treatment of songs we know.
If you like you like you're drum & bass mixed in with a touch of evil, this album is for you. It's a bit less accessible than previous Dj? Acucrack albums, and by far it's darkest. This album wanders a bit over the electronic music map, but always keeps an evil drum and bass feel to it. Highly recommended.
This cd is a neat fusion of older 1930's Shanghai Jazz music with Electronica. The first 5 songs of the cd are the remixed versions and the last 5 songs are the originals (didn't originally realize this---issue reading on my part LOL). I wouldn't say this is their best cd, but its still neat.
I must say i'm impressed by amazon's download service.  Very quick and good quality.  I enjoy tiesto's music, therefore I have to say this one is good as well.  Couple of the tracks I didn't care much for, but that's just my taste.  Overall, enjoyed DISC 1 very much so.
Ethereal female vocals? Check.  Obtuse lyrics? Check.  Thunderous beats? Check.  A reasonably priced trance compendium for all your trancy needs.  Some tracks are better than others, but they're all genre indicative and none are truly awful.  Then again, none of them are really genius either.  You could almost say it's rather generic, but the album overall does what it sets out to do.  It provides trance and lots of it.  Worth blowing your couch change on.
I had those Cassette version and was stolen past 15 years ago.. So, I had been hunted to find this Beat box music and just very lucky find at Amazon! THANKS Amazon!!! Life Saver! It was pleased have MP3 Version nor CD!! Cool! Been listen almost everyday.. Missed over 15 years and still love it.. :)
I have been a big fan of Black Lab since YBAM put "wash it away" on the radio back in what 97'? This is definitely a departure from their usual work. I found a few favorites in River of Joy and Living too fast and hearing some familiar tracks revisited such as Ecstasy and Remember was a nice twist. As much as I like the lead-in on the Transformer's theme I eventually became a bit disappointed with the result but I don't fault that on the band, I just thing it could be hard to write a song about Transformers and have it turn out amazing. All in all I'm happy with the purchase. Not an expected project from Black Lab but I must say, well played.
Heard the track "Old Bak Ache" on my Pandora station and loved it instantly.There are a couple tracks that seem to be kind of a waste of listening time. But for 3 CD's worth of music, it's a great deal.
This is a fun album. It's entirely instrumental, so is ideal for relaxing or a car journey. It's quirky and tuneful and has a variety of styles, from the latin influenced "Un Boleto.." to the electronic chill-out style of Tiger Jones. The tunes stick in the brain and demand repeated listens.An excellent and unusual album.
If you were to randomly pick a track on this one, it would actually, possibly, mislead as to the direction of the whole album.  This is one of those that will keep you wondering what's coming on the next track.
I'm thrilled to finally get Chaz Jankel on CD. Just to hear "Glad to Know You" again makes my world spin faster. This guy wrote some great tunes, from pop to dance. Very underrated songwriter (also check out the stuff he did with Ian Dury and the Blockheads). As another reviewer noted, there are a few more songs that could of/should have been included, but I guess that's nit-picking when it comes down to it. Overall, this is a very good collection that is packed with lots of fun music.
Unless she is multi-tracking herself, which is possible. Sounds fantastic, many dissonant chords that sound amazingly deep on the cello.
This is an impressive release from a band I can't find any information about on the internet.  It's obviously heavily influenced by the Shpongle school of trippy ambient dub, with mesmerizing basslines, relaxing flutes, and a tasteful smattering of ethnic instrumentation and funky percussion throughout.Okay, so maybe I just described every ambient dub release from the last ten years, but these guys pull it off very well.  I guess it's not breathtakingly original, but they have a great feel for the genre they are working within, and they have served up a very classy selection of dubby goodness.  A fine addition to my chillout collection.
Contagion is a fantastic group I discovered live in the early 1990s.  Contagion was so amazing live they came back twice within a six month period for their PCB album.  I have been looking for them since the PCB album, but was unable to find them until Amazon.  Then I come across Infectant and Amazing isn't the word, more like Incredible describes it better.  I now know who did the music for the Thrill Kill game that EA never released for the PS1. Contagion rules and has amazing diversity in their styles.  This is a must have album, do not pass it up get it while you can.
Zoe Keating's musical stylings are original and very nice to listen to.  Although it seems like the genre could possibly be too repetitive, each track manages to stand on its own.
i was worried that this might be a bit too close to ambient (eg boring) as i listened to it on my commutes to work. however, i had the headphones in at peet's over the weekend while doing some reading and oh this collection was just an aural delight. great!
I'm a terrible runner but want to get into better shape so I decided to download this program.  I've only started week 2 but I see an improvement in my running ability already.
I spent $6.99 on this album JUST for the Dragonette song which is AMAZING.  Listen to it with headphones on!  This sounds strange but the fading from left to right in the song actually tickles your ears and feels physically wonderful in addition to it (I Get Around) just being a f---ing amazing song.  Seriously.  That one song alone is worth $7.
I own 5 of the Kitsune Maison compilations at this point and #4 definitely doesn't disappoint.  I am a huge fan of the very last track in particular.  It's broken out into three songs and I love them all.
This Compilation Series is One of the Best in the World and cotains a perfect mixture of excellent Electronic Songs. The "old Europe" knows how to compile great Music to a great collection of music.If you like this you should also Listen to "Dolomiti Super Chill".Great Chillout and Lounge Music!
I'm not a big fan of the "Tabernacle Choir" or "Jolly guy singing around the fire" kind of Christmas music, so when I heard a selection from this collection, I was curious. Needless to say, my curiosity made me buy this collection of fine remixes of classic Christmas tunes.... and look, no barking dogs.....
Personally, I can't stand either the typical "classic" Holiday music, or the pop remakes of it.  So, in order to get in the Holiday Spirit, I have a bunch of the electronica-techno-electro-whatever-you-want-to-label-it Holiday Music.Just picked this one up this year, and, compared to the others in my collection, I like it a lot.  There are a couple of tracks I don't care for, they go a bit "too eclectic" for me, but overall, and especially for the price, this is a good one to own if you want to add some new tunes to your techno-holiday music collection.
I really enjoyed listening to this album and will continue to follow this group.  I hope that they continue with this line of music for future releases.
Bought this years ago for one song off the album but the rest of it is not too bad, got it for free or mostly free with a MP3 credit I had.
Like so many others, I had to find out what song played at the end of Mass Effect. I found this album, previewed it, and decided to go for the whole thing. I'm glad I did! M4 Part 2 is definitely the catchiest song on here, but the others still have a morose energy to them that I really enjoy. This album is pretty different from their others (this one's less ambient, and more powerful--a win, in my book).
Very unique set of music by local artists - mostly Asian/South Asian-based electronica and fusion. Has a calming effect on those long flights or played in your hotel room at your destination. Not all songs are of uniform quality. That said, it may be less expensive to buy the whole album than just a few of your favorites. My own personal favorites are "Satori" "Zen Life" "World" "Golden Sunset" "Brand New Delhi" and "Lost In Beijing."Could have been a soundtrack for "Lost in Translation."Definitely worth getting if you like this type of music or are willing to give it a try.
Off the hook!
No weird gimmicks, music, etc.  No surprise bursts, booms, bird chirps, etc.  Nice constant background white noise with uniform waterfall/brook sounds overlaid.  Matches the preview!  My only complaint might be that the white noise could be dropped a few dB, but this is much better than other "surprise" tracks out there that suck once you purchase and download them.  Fades in and out gracefully, so you can use REPEAT on it.
I'm into more well known stuff like the Thievery Corporation, but surfed across this and downloaded it. Solid album, well arranged and produced. Very laid back and a good sound. These folks know what they're doing. Definitely worth checking out.
The original of NOTHING IS WRITTEN gives itself over to pleasant synth-pop, courtesy Justus K&ouml;hncke, and it's certainly pleasant enough.  Coloma give the track a house rub with their "Damascene Conversion" mix, but retain a smooth melody and a delicate sensibility.  Tobias Thomas and Superpitcher offer an extended an "Accidentally Overdosed" remix  which digitizes the vocals and puts them in an electro-house context, even bringing in some strings late in the game -- nifty.
The tracks &#34;Freefloat&#34; and &#34;Perspectives&#34; are the most noteworthy tracks on this album - they are five stars.  The others are also good, though.  I like listening to this when I want to decompress at the end of the day, or if I want to &#34;check out&#34; while I'm on a plane.
Although I like the sounds Electronic Jazz take some getting use to. The price is cool and the instant down load was great! Thanks.
This is solid music that sounds good at first and then doesn't wear thin in the long run.  It exists in a unique spot, not dance but not ambient either.  Sometimes when I don't feel like listening to any music, I can still listen to this.  Highly trance influenced yet also it's own thing.  These guys know what they're doing when it comes to music... something not to easy to find nowadays.
Excellent version of the Knight Rider theme song well done with voice over from KITTT  if you like remixes of songs this one is really a good one to have
Rob Dougan is justly best-known for his track "Clubbed to Death," which first appeared when Mo'Wax was a can't-miss label. And the cinematic quality which marked that track (as well as the track itself) reappear on his debut album, _Furious Angels_. More interesting, Dougan adds his hoarse vocals to his creations, which veer more towards country-western than to pure electronic music. It's an interesting combination, if not an entirely successful one. The title track has a gospel chorus that add tension to some potentially overwrough lyrics. "Will You Follow Me?" sounds as if it came straight off a soundtrack -- John Williams would be proud. Not sure what Mr. Williams would think of the dirge-like "Left Me for Dead," however. At times, Dougan sounds as if he's straining his voice in an attempt at emotion, and it's at odds with the elegant orchestrations. When he doesn't try as hard, as on "There's Only Me," he gets across a sense of desperation and sadness much better, as does the melancholy trip-hop and warbling falsetto of "Nothing At All." Not surprisingly, on the instrumental disc, the tracks in which Dougan's vocals proved problematic feel improved with just the strings, but the ones in which the vocals were an asset feel slightly empty. But the most surprising track would be "Drinking Song," which has much of the simplicity and directness of the Pogues' "Fairytale of New York." It brings romanticism to a drunken haze -- reminiscing with a gravelly voice.
My main purpose in purchasing this album was just to listen to "Clubbed to Death" - the signature sound from "The Matrix". Yeah, sure; I could have bought just that one track but there an instrumental a second remix so I figured I'd just get the whole album (the album cover really caught my eye, too!).It was the right choice! The music is melancholy, the lyrics are deep and the vocals would feel right at home on a Tom Waits album. The "Drinking Song" convinced me of this.I read one review describe this as dance tracks you can't dance to. Perfect. I can't dance, anyway.Tracks like "There's Only Me" and "One And The Same" give a great sense of very personal subject matter. Just when the beats from "Furious Angels" get you going, "Left Me for Dead" and "Born Yesterday" pull you back down and "I'm not driving anymore" is an unlikely pairing of those feelings.If you fancy the mellow and melancholy (sorry for using that word twice) but still want a beat to move to (even if the movement is just in your own mind), get this album.One more thing - this is just Disc 1. Disc 2 isn't available on Amazon (digital version, anyways). At least, I can't find it.
This album gives several slightly different impressions of the old James Bond theme song. It is a worthwhile purchase for any fan of the James Bond film series and its music.
Ashley  has 8 mixes of Freestyle song "Here we are" my fave mix extended mix, also has bonus song which i give 5 stars "when's it all gonna end?",which is a freestyle song i like alot more and wish that was the single rather than "Here we are" but still a good maxi-cd single.
I heard DJ Dimi's music on my satellite TV music station. This is a fun fusion of old Chinese instruments with cool downtempo settings.
I was listening to Pandora and came across this Artist and instantly liked his music.  Can't wait to hear more of his music.
The title says it all! A friend of mine lent this to me years ago and I've been searching for it ever since. I only had the title Moth Music, that's it! I finally tracked it down and it turns out there are several volumes. I've only heard this one but it's very enjoyable either for concentrated listening or excellent background music. Very upbeat but relaxing and chill at the same time. Lots of different vibes throughout the tracks, I don't really know how to classify this music-loungy, perhaps? If you care to hear samples, you can hear them in ITunes. They have all six volumes available there, for $9.99 ea.All in all a fun disc to listen to, great for parties where the music shouldn't be a focal point but fills the room nicely! I didn't give it a full five stars because I don't think it would suit all tastes, but it's one of my favorite fun discs!Hope this helps!
Revised: Based on the cover music alone I'd place this on the upper shelf. It might be a "drummers on top" cd, but that's what's being showcased, ...and I am still listening. Some beautiful work in here. The long-ish explorations of music (instrument solos) are characteristic of this style of jazz. (btw: I appreciated CH's detailed review here, ...even if a mite strict/stingy with his stars. ha.)
This is a great album. Every song has something to offer, some more than others. Only wish there were a few more tracks and less interludes.
This album is great to play while going to sleep. If you focus on the music, it's rare that you'll be awake to hear the end of the song.
I heard a remix of the song "The Great Bath" and I just had to listen to the original. The other songs are "filler" which makes sense because they are background songs from a game. But "The Great Bath" is something else.
I bought this CD on a whim because the price was right.  I am really enjoying the music.  As my title says, it is a really nice, fun, varied, multicultural listening experience.  Good to use during my yoga class, or driving down the road.  Give it a try!
I discovered this CD while looking for music similar to Shpongle. While I wouldn't say this is very similar, it certainly is cool, bringing together electronica and trance with everything from Spanish guitar to aboriginal instruments, African influences and even some Scottish sounds. If you like trance and/or world beat you'll get a kick out of this.
This album "modernizes" the soundtracks by Henry Mancini. It would be great music for parties, or just to sit down and listen to.
I first found this album by hearing the last song on di.fm's chillout channel. It's got a few tracks that, upon hearing them, I was just about ready to put them on reapeat and play a few (dozen) rounds of nethack.Well worth a listen, even if you don't play nethack. Especially "[Human]" and "A Forgotten Ritual".
I love Billie Myers voice. This is a CD (single) of sorts. The same song, "Just Sex" in 5 versions.
I came across Ananda Project via Pandora Radio and immediately fell in love with the music. Being a strong music lover I came across his work on Amazon and went to purchasing all of his albums. Night Blossom although not one of my favorites is pretty good. It's just a lot of remixes from the Fire Flower CD which is phenomenal. I much prefer Fire Flower over Night Blossom but if you're really into remixes then you may prefer Night Blossom. Everytime I listen to Ananda Project it makes me feel really good and that's what good music should be about.
I heard "Bad Touch" on Pandora internet radio and wanted to hear more, but couldn't find anything else by Dj Methodikal. He/she doesn't a website or even Myspace, nor do there appear to be any other releases by him/her.This is a sweet album from start to finish, I don't think I've ever skipped a song off it. It kind of sounds like what you would get if you mated Stunt Rock and Nero's Day at Disneyland and turned up the gain. It's hard to describe, but really good if you like glitchy noise ridden music. Listen to the previews available here on Amazon. If you approve I highly recommend getting the entire album.
I purchased the entire digital download and the songs are quite good, but deffinatly NOT your typical dance music.  Jeffree Star takes this unique sound to a level all his own.  The first cut is th best!  My only wish is that this ep was released on CD.
I always have loved Jeffree Star, his originality, sex appeal, and creativeness. I really enjoyed this EP because of its funness and lack of blandness. I also must compliment the remix track at the end. I also wish this would have been released on CD because its one of those i really like and would have bought on CD. I also own his EP Cupcakes Taste Like Violence, and debut album Beauty Killer on CD, so the fact this isn't on CD is disappointing. But we can get over it.Track One, Eyelash Curlers and Butcher Knives:Okay so you read the track name and go WTF. Like for real this is a example of Jeffree's ability to be fun and creative. I really like the thumping bass and spunky lyrics. Great Opening Track. 9/10Track Two, Plastic Surgery Slumber Party:Okay so we have another example of a creative and fun track from Jeffree. Very good and the lyrics and thumping beats all just fit. This was one of my favorites from the beginning. 9/10Track Three, Straight Boys:By far a very shining highlight, I love this song! It's so catching and fitting to Jeffree's main tone. I love it. Especially it's references and fun little lyrical content like the line "To Eat Me Out Like Jeffrey Dahmer". I know its completely gross. But it fits. 10/10Track Four, Ice Cream:Fun little song or snippet. Its really fun and sexual tinged. It has a dark tone to it and its really cool. Its catchy chorus and thumping beat that makes you tap your fingers.Track Five: We Want C---:Okay so I can't spell out the whole title due to the fact that Amazon will not accept my review but whatever. This is considered by me, Jeffree's anthem. It's like him saying all about him and saying this is who I am. I really like it. 8/10Track Six: Remix Track:Really good and fun ending track and remix. It might even outshine the original. 10/10Overall, I really enjoyed this EP from the beginning. It's really catchy and stealthy throughout. I recommend it for fans of Blood On The Dance Floor, and bands like Breathe Carolina. Great opener to his career, 9/10
This album is pretty good considering how much she was a part of the "freestyle" era, with "Summertime, Summertime", "Let's Go" and "Tell U So", it is certainly a big welcome to hear newer music from her and not too far from the genre that many of her fans know her from.  But overall, this is great music (maybe a tweaking in remixing all songs to a more grab-able beat like the fisher king remix).  Nocera, you have a unique voice that sounds great in the arena that you perform in, keep maing good music and we will listen!  I gave it 4 stars because it lacks the remixes of the other 2 songs.  Love Ya.
I ran into this band while trying to find the soundtrack to a Dolph Lundgren movie called &#34;Silent Trigger&#34;. Yes, it's a guilty pleasure movie, but part of what makes it work so well is the music, notably the first two tracks from this collection. The rest, however has been quite enjoyable, and something I'd recommend if you want to expand your collection in new directions.
This was an old Brenda K Starr demo song that her producer leaked online years ago because it contained some very prominent background vocals from Mariah Carey, before she got famous.  Great song, awesome cover verison by Krista, and consistantly solid production by Josh Harris!
I really enjoy the rhythems and beats.  I only wish some of the songs had words, like a guest vocalist or something.  Other than that, really good.
This EP tries very hard to get that key 80's vibe. The only thing it appears to be missing is some sweet synth. While the synth is there, it's not quite as warm as it could be, and the abrasive bass over it lessens its effect also.
I knew Laaaji's work only through the Ambient 3 album, produced by Brian Eno.  But recently I came across someone's comments that Laraaji had a large and varied body of work, so I searched out for more.  I decided to give this album a try (the title, graphic, and 30-sec samples said "go"), and I was pleasantly surprised. Quite a lot of variation even on this one release: from spoken word, to mature, flowing works with violin, electric guitar, and of course dulcimer, from driving beats to extreme spaciness.  I didn't realize how much I liked orange.  Well done.
Good listen. Funky and upbeat. Found off Pandora, glad I bought it, good energetic fun songs. I knew nothing about these guys before hand.
A powerful and provocative work.  I laughed, I cried, I fell down.  It changed my life.
Their first effort Supertron is the more accessible album - each song on that album has immediate first-listen appeal; the more mature sounding Stems definitely takes a bit longer to grow on you.  It's experimental and way less poppy, using more white space and sparse arrangements.  Either album is a good buy, but getting them together makes for a eclectic musical experience.We've enjoyed seeing Fading Collection live twice now and enjoy.  Lead singer has goosebump-inducing pipes - well worth it if they visit your town.
the album itself is really good: filthy beat concepts and progression. however, the songs with the guest stars are the least impressive. When I listen to the song with Cypher Linguistics it is painfully obvious that they can't rap at all, their lame name should have tipped me off
I never knew Ben Benjamin could be so... moody, but THE MANY MOODS OF BEN BENJAMIN, VOL. 1 gladly proves me wrong. Merging the electronic and indie rock has never been easy, but he shifts tones quickly, from the plinking and New Order-like stylings on "Selective Periphera" to the guitar-and-electro combination of "Sassy Blanche." He can even shift within tracks, the way the jittery electronics of "Hypertexan" give way to acoustic guitar. There are plenty of short, pop ditties, (like the banjo-driven "VIP LCD"), though he can get more contemplative too: "Butane Wayne" goes off in a minor key, and "Chamber," with its piano chords and lingering tones, is like a sprint through a cathedral. The tempo slows down for "Sideways Cerebus," as well, which gives that track a more considered feel, even as it explodes halfway through. "Chixen," too, has a lulling quality to it, but "Fishin' for Coldy Winds," takes the the album on a funky note. Plenty of moods to go around!
When Nine Inch Nails released their 2002 live album And All That Could Have Been it came with a bonus CD entitled Still, containing deconstructed alternate takes of well known songs and original instrumentals. Regarded by NIN fans as one of the band's best recordings, listeners were left coveting another album in the Still style. Six years later fans were blindsided by the entirely unpublicized  Ghosts I-IV, a series of EPs recorded in secret and released to an unsuspecting public in the midst of an ostensible off season for Trent Reznor and his various assistants.Effectively the spiritual sequel to Still, Ghosts is dark, evocative and somehow lyrical in spite of its lack of vocals. While none of the songs have names, which makes referencing individual tracks difficult, suffice to say that the record is an astoundingly disparate one. Each of Ghosts' songs has its own distinct feel and elicits a different emotional response. Some are moody and atmospheric while others are unsettling exercises in high-tension instrumentation; some are like aural embraces in their sweet, comforting melodies while others tap into a primal aggression through their vitriolic machine noise.Additionally, Reznor and co. should be commended  for opting to alternate the eclectic tracks rather than allocating the heavier songs for one disc and the textured, atmospheric work for the other. The sense of not knowing what to expect next contributes much to the unique experience of listening to Ghosts.Although not quite on the same tier as The Fragile or The Downward Spiral, Ghosts is far more than a stop-gap record between proper albums. Unique, evocative and distinctly NIN, Ghosts I-IV serves well as a score for reading, writing, and personal reflection.
Even if this album had been pumped out merely for the sake of adding one more number to NIN's halo catalogue (which it wasn't), Trent Reznor deserves every accolade that's been heaped upon him for finding ways to keep his music relevant in a 21st century musical landscape that is both unsettled and unpredictable.  The man is a work-horse.  This cannot be debated.  Despite relentless touring in support of two albums in the past three years, Reznor also found the time to get in touch with his inner Richard James and Brian Eno in the form of "Ghosts I-IV," a 2 hour opus that comes closer to ambient soundscapes than anything since "A Warm Place" found its way onto "The Downward Spiral" back in 1994.Described by Reznor as a "soundtrack for daydreams," do not put on those headphones with the presumption that you'll be getting 120 minutes of the top selling disc from your local Hallmark.  This is a NIN record after all, and even without the nihilistic and cathartic lyrics, some Reznor trademarks are there: the studio wizardry (do yourself a favor if you have the option and go for CD quality rather than mp3), the industrial white noise, the glitch and stutter of electronic drum loops, and the occasional plunk of isolated piano tones that have more of a Fischer-Price decay than a Steinway resonance.  Unlike Eno's "Music for Airports," "Ghosts" doesn't provide consistent stretchs of bedroom atmospherics.  Rather, it effortlessly wavers between harsh, subdued, cautious, elegiac, abrasive, and soothing textures over the course of its 36 tracks.  Personally prefering the occasional foray into ethereal and hypnotic moods, "1 Ghosts I," "1 Ghosts II," "32 Ghosts IV," and "34 Ghosts IV" are all standout tracks.Maybe some of it is really filler.  But it really doesn't matter.  With the varied pricing/packaging options NIN provided, you've got something for everyone.  I myself pursued the $16.99 download route; I got an immediate download of all 36 tracks plus a .pdf file packed with artwork.  The pressed CD was then mailed to me on the official release date.  Given that the double CD alone would go for more than that at your local electronics megastore, it was worth every penny.
A slight departure from most NIN releases, this is almost 2 hours of instrumentals.  Nothing intense, all sort of mellow, almost more of a classical structure, very progressive with some catchy themes.  I find this is about perfect music to do &#34;thinking work&#34; to, or when you just want some non-distracting background tunes.  A few of the sounds are reminiscent of much older stuff like on Downward Spiral and The Fragile.
One of the previous reviews has a point; the one with Trent and chocolate fountains [a little weird].Listening to Ghosts, I could not help but think of the Fragile. I liked the Fragile and I like this album as well, but I would not call this album anything new. And in addition to that, there seems to be some recurring theme in some of these songs, which unites them in one way and makes them a little bland in another. I also do not understand why Trent Reznor chose to release 'The Slip' - even for free. It feels like some Rap album, three good songs with the rest just blah.Though the songs on Ghosts are not named [ghost 1, 2, 3 etc] I can see titles fitting "Somewhat Damaged Too"
this is goodyou know the actual kind of good where it presents something new (like a new meduim for art) as well as saluting the past (just like trent has always done) and mashing it together into a something thats definetly worth the 300 dollars (should you have bought that edition)and god forbid i actually say that it's . . .beautifulyou never feel the gnashing industrial guitars, you don't smell any hate, you don't see any pain, you don't hear any sex, you don't taste the fear and isolation . . .all you know is beautyits weirdand then suddenlyBAM and theres a sudden change in pace and you can almost hear trent whispering some hypnotic spell in your ears, but he isn't singing and the songs are quiet and its all in your head,whenever i listen to this i think of the BROKEN(ep)'s unreleased video-esk type images in my headthe album is that provocitive.and that trent would be able to accomplish this without words is insaneas well as brilliant
If you like "Ghosts", then get yourself a copy of NIN's harder-to-find "Still" EP. Much of "Still" is instrumental pieces. The last two tracks-- "The Persistence of Loss" and "Leaving Hope"-- are amazing and would fit in well on "Ghosts." "Still" also features a couple instrumental extensions of material from "The Fragile", some 'unplugged' versions of classic NIN tracks, and the song "And All That Could Have Been" (which is the most poignant NIN song since "Hurt"). The "Still" EP is only available as a download on Amazon, but you can buy it as a new cd directly from NIN's website. Enjoy!
Last track on Ghosts III and tracks 1, 4, and 5 off IV are really good. Thus far I'm enjoying Ghosts IV the most. The track naming convention strikes me as similar to that of how verses are labeled in the bible. It'd be a heck of a thing talking about this album at a party, trying to tell someone what your favorite tracks are. Especially after a cocktail or three.I listen to music while I work and for me this release works pretty well. There's a heck of a lot of material to digest, for sure. I can't imagine someone cranking through the whole thing in a sitting or two and declaring it brilliant. For me, it's more of a soaker. It's certainly good enough to draw me back to it. Time will tell...let it roll around my mellon for a bit.Honestly for most folks it'll be more of a stretch than previous NIN releases. It is less explicit, more open for interpretation than most NIN material. Quality-wise it's what fans and critics have come to expect. Here here for stretching us out a bit and being challenging in groovy, thoughtful ways.
At first listen I am reminded of Tool. I like this a lot, and will listen to it much more in the years to come.  It is one that you can get lost into. Daydream.  I think I would more use it as background.  Over all a very good piece of work.
In 2007, Trent Reznor fulfilled his contractual obligation to Interscope Records, and announced he was going to create music independently. Upon hearing this news, I was very curious to see what he would create without the shadow of a record company over his shoulder. Knowing this, a 2 disc collection of 36 instrumentals just seems to make complete sense as it's the exact type of thing that a big record company would reject as being "not commercially viable."The album as a whole strikes me as a grand experiment. Some of the tracks are songs with an identifiable beginning, middle and end. But many sound like just a bit or a piece, as if Trent wrote a song, decided that he only liked one part of it and decided to simply clip off the rest rather than try to build a full blown song out of one good part. Or maybe they were simply songs he didn't feel needed to be extended past two minutes. Trent Reznor, rather than make an album of conventional music, used his first chance recording free of a the control of a record label to make music without any boundaries and created a unique musical experience.I don't feel as if this album is meant to be studied. It has no deeper meaning. The tracks don't have titles, as if to say "just to make sure you don't bother to look into their meanings." They're not "about" any one thing. The songs are simply songs. The sticker on the front reads "A soundtrack for daydreams," and as that, it works perfectly. It's excellent as background music for your subconscious to absorb. Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a niche record from an established artist. Ghosts I is available for free from the official website to give you a chance to see if this is for you before you pay for the whole thing. If you don't enjoy Ghosts, don't feel as if you're missing out, as it's not for everyone.
I'm really surprised at the quality of this album.  Nine Inch Nails really experiments in a way I've never heard them, or other similar sounding artists, attempt before.  You have ambient sounds mixed with hard rock.  The band members must have had a desire to try something different, and I'm really happy the results work.  I'm not exactly "in" as far as new music is concerned, but if there's more music like this out there, it might be worth digging deeper into certain bands catalogs.
This is purely an instrumental album of short melancholic soundscapes. I really enjoyed it and have always loved moody music.  So if you prefer your music to have lyrics or like only upbeat music, then this will not be the album for you.  However, if you like dark, moody music then you will really enjoy it.
Pick a Ghost, listen to it only, and stop.  Once the thematic similarities of each one become familiar, the album as a whole really comes together in its subtle genius.  A terrific creative tangent, but hopefully not the new NIN categorical mainstay for future records.
Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, infamous for long delays between albums, sure has been productive lately. 2007 saw Reznor release the critically acclaimed "Year Zero" and its' follow-up "Year Zero Remixed." In addition, last year Reznor produced Saul Williams' "The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust." Now, out of nowhere, with no advance notice, Reznor is back with NIN's sixth album, the instrumental "Ghosts I-IV.""A soundtrack for daydreams," is how Reznor sums up the new album...and that, I feel, is the best way to appreciate the new NIN. Rather than listening to this album as background music while driving or doing housework, "Ghosts I-IV" is best appreciated with relaxed, yet concentrated listening. Lie in bed or on the sofa, relaxed, and immerse yourself with this CD. Just sort of daydream--meditate, think about whatever...and let "Ghosts I-IV" be the soundtrack...And as the mood of the album changes, allow your mood to flow with the album...try to get lost in the music.Some have commented that "Ghosts I-IV" sounds similar in style to the instrumental music from "The Fragile," (1999) but I don't know if it's all that accurate to say that. While the instrumental music from "the Fragile" sort of held the vocal compositions from that CD together like glue, "Ghosts I-IV" is a little more "out there." It can, therefore, be seen as a mosaic--of several different styles--piano compositions, industrial beats, the avant-garde--all mixed together, with no real dominant flavor overpowering the rest. And while the album is all-over-the-place, treading many territories, everything works; "Ghosts I-IV" takes so many twists-and-turns-its always interesting. At the same time, with almost two hours of music to absorb, "Ghosts I-IV" is best appreciated with repeated listens--to fully appreciate all its' rich textures and intricacy.
I don't know how he does it. The creativity, the sonic greatness, the depth.  Even without the voice, it still rocks.  This is the music I wish I could create meself!!  Buy it.
...but a very entertaining effort nonetheless. I like that Trent Reznor had the courage to try an all-instrumental album. And you sure can't argue with the price! A must-have for NIN fans, but probably not something a casual listener would like a whole lot.
For a musician who has taken 6 years and 5 years between albums in the past, Trent Reznor sure is active lately, and we can probably thank the rising technical possibilities for working outside of record company strictures. But it's important to remember that Ghosts I-IV is NOT the next proper NiN release, and it should be viewed more accurately as a side project. Here Trent eschews lyrics and vocal melodies (his traditional Achilles heels) for 36 instrumental tracks that mostly provide atmospheres for not-so-easy-listening mood music, while highlighting Trent's sequencing and programming skills. It takes many, many listens for all of the tracks to differentiate themselves in your consciousness, but your patience will mostly be rewarded. Ghosts I-IV occasionally recalls the classic albums, delivering mood manipulation a la The Fragile (tracks #3, 11, 17, 28, 33); and surprisingly for this rather quiet collection, harsh Downward Spiral-like angst (#4, 8, 19, 23, 31). There are also a few experimental surprises that have not been heard from NiN before, such as weird bluegrass guitar (#14 - courtesy of Adrian Belew), pummeling rave (#16), old-school gangsta-hop (#24), bass-driven heavy funk-rock (#26, 27), and even vaguely Asian world music (#30).But even with those occasional throwbacks and advances, many of the tracks on this release still have trouble rising above the pack. Primarily, almost all of the songs are just too short for their ideas to develop beyond basic introductions. In fact, just two tracks (#20, 34) feature more than one basic beat pattern or chord progression. And there are just too many weak tracks that turn moodiness into boredom - ranging from thin beat programming exercises (#9, 18), simple piano melodies propped up unsuccessfully with random noise (#10, 13, 22), and basic sequencer patterns that repeat to the point of absurdity (#6, 34). Of course, fans should feel as mellow and moody listening to Ghosts I-IV as Trent probably did while creating it. But at times there are just too many under-developed ideas vying for the listener's and the creator's attention. [~doomsdayer520~]
Not bad, a departure from the older stuff, but I liked it.  I listened to a lot of Ambient and Electronic Music back in the day, so I find a lot of this is stuff that was done 10 or more years ago...  Even still, it is only $5 and I think it's well worth it if you have an open mind.If you like any of this, be sure to check out Aphex Twin "Selected Ambient Works Vol2" and Autechre "Amber", "Basscadet", and "Tri Repetae".
I have to say, Trent's approach at immediacy with this release and the many small musical themes in encompasses, shows a lot of maturity and depth.  It's lively in its ideas and production.  And although each piece averages about 2:30mins, 36 tracks worth gives you insight into NIN's ability, scope, and current direction.
Nine Inch Nails has returned, unannounced this time, with a new album.  This one is a 36-track collection of short, instrumental pieces that have no order, no agenda and no direction.  But this is not a bad thing!  It's vintage NIN.  It's abstract art, coming from the mind of one of this era's greatest musicians.I LOVED how Trent released this album.  I wish I could've gotten the $300 version.  The presentation of this album is nothing short of immaculate.  Even if you only got the mp3 album, the presentation is a cut above your average internet purchase.  Each of the 36 songs has a different picture attached to it.  On my iPod, instead of the album cover, it shows one of these for every song.  It's little things such as this that make Trent's music so invigorating.Obviously it goes without saying that this is not an album for the mainstream.  You can't just pop this in and listen to it like you would any other NIN release.  This one requires a certain degree of active listening for you to pick out the subtle nuances that Trent put into these songs.  As background noise, you won't hear much and no songs really stand out.  This is why the best way to listen to it is through headphones, while allowing your mind to fully take in the music.This is one of the most unique releases ever.  Not for everyone, but still a masterpiece.
Nine Inch Nails have some great songs in their catalog, but none of their albums have kept the momentum going all the way through for me.  WIth this one, there is no momentum.  Luckily, the consistency is what makes this album so good and the peacefulness of listening to it in its entirety is what fans should expect when putting it on.  The music sounds like a cross between Nine Inch Nails and Burial (underground British industrial dance music).  It is not something you can actively listen to, but instead, it is an album that makes people look inward and reflect.  However, if nothing else it makes perfect study music.  At five dollars, how can you resist?  Well, there is one downside.  Only several of the songs on here could make it to become live material.  The rest would simply not be suited for an energetic concert atmosphere.
It seems a bit trite to say this is an instant classic - but phu%& yeah! This IS what we've been waiting for from NIN. Without a doubt the best $5 dollars you can spend online!. The best $5 dollar nine inch nail you can put in the RIAA coffin.Take heed! This is they way it should be done. Thank you Trent.
Don't bother reading many (close to all) these reviews listed for this release.  If you are familiar with nine inch nails (maybe even consider yourself a fan) you will find something among these 36 tracks that will spark a somewhat further insight into Trent Reznor and his 20+ year creation that is nine inch nails.  A lot of today's nails fans refer to the band in relation to their 1999 release of "The Fragile" and many of them relate this release in relation as well.  The simple fact of the matter is that nine inch nails have been around since late 1980's, and since their first release in '89 with "Pretty Hate Machine" we have witnessed an imeasurable amount of growth and inspiration that has made them the industrial gods they are commonly revered as.  To say that this release is unlike any others is to make a true statement, whereas any and all halos (remixed halos aside) are unlike their predecessors (previous halos).  "The Fragile" has become the new "Pretty Hate Machine" for all those individuals that weren't around during nine inch nails' beginning.  Considering that it was released 10 years following "Pretty Hate Machine,"  it sounds nothing like anything before it, but yet was a product of everything before it (if that makes sense).  Now Ghosts i-iv, being released almost 20 years after "Pretty Hate Machine,"  brings an additional level of growth -- not to mention the fact that a few albums ago ("With Teeth") we first bore witness to a new and sober Trent (for which i offer my congratulations)... and yet people still want to hear a continuation of earlier work (you get that with the remixed versions - which are of plenty in the nine inch nails world).  If you want an additional nails album to redefine that which we all feel music IS, make no mistake about this title. If you want "The Fragile part 2" or "The Downward Spiral 15 years later," play those records again because as sure as the nine inch nails empire has and continues to evolve, you as the listener surely has as well. --truley a great and greatly inspiring addition to the halo catalogue.  'nuff said!
This collection isn't for the typical NIN fan (what, NO LYRICS?). It's also not for those who think instrumentals mean lame background music. Listening to this sounds like a bastard child of Aphex Twins, David Byrne & Brian Eno. The typical Trent Reznor use of distorted pianos and guitar used to link his songs in The Fragile are here, but with the shortness of each track, he challenges himself to come up with 40 different themes. It's like his own audio museum where you move from painting to painting. You recognize the brush strokes and the technique while the subject and colors are in constant transition. Like a painting, especially contemporary ones, they often require focus and concentration to get the most out of it. And like artists will do, occasionally a work fails to impress or the message gets lost in noise and distortion. But for the most part, Ghosts succeeds in staying fresh, suspenseful,  inventive, and imaginative. No you won't be humming these during your drive home or your morning workout. Trent wants to haunt your head, not to scare you. And in that regards, it works.
this is quickly becoming my favorite NIN album.  i can listen to the entire double disc album on a loop and not get tired of it.  the fact that there are no lyrics, keeps it fresh for me.  to me Reznor always excelled at composing music and this puts that right out there w/o the lyrics to overshadow it.
There are 36 tracks.  No lyrics.  A handful of the songs are really amazing.  The others are slow and methodical but still have the unique trent reznor sound.  Definitely worth it if you already like reznor's style.  Otherwise, you might be disappointed.
I'm really impressed with this latest release from Nine Inch Nails. It's darkly complex, rich, thought provoking and compelling--I love it.
I came up with these names for them.  The ones with astericks are my favorites.  I left out the tracks I don't like as much.

After twenty years on the scene, the artist wants to come out with something experimental. For most bands this is a signal that they're out of ideas and are about to collapse into radio nostalgia on way-back-weekends.Not Trent Reznor. The Ghosts are truly something very new on a long-known but previously underdeveloped foundation. Consider "A Warm Place" off Downward Spiral or the opening to "Something I could never have" off Pretty Hate Machine. These were reminders that beneath (and even coexisting with) the screams and mechanistic vicissitudes that define industrial music, Trent Reznor is a consummate musician."Ghosts" is fully a harmonic successor to the atmospheric movements on the very underappreciated "The Fragile". Consider the 1999 album's "La Mer" or "Pilgrimage" as opposed to "Where is Everybody?" or "The Wretched". Not to say that NIN isn't atmospheric, but rather that there are definitely tracks with an intentional message as opposed to tracks that are more meant for the listener to get lost in. Ghosts is clearly the latter.This is not an album you'll "get" in one sitting. It would fail miserably if it were so simplistic. Let it grow on you as you meditate through it.
Trent Reznor at his best without his voice.musical geniusenough said.
A sountrack to very different moments. An interesting record, specially Ghosts III and IV.Very good, but the instrumentals from The Fragile are way better.
I take it back. Although short and sweet, many of these tracks are already beginning to stick in my head. The only problem is remembering what number coincides with what music. This may not be a "CD", but it's hella handful of music. No groundbreaking radio hits but a few hours of cutting floor gold that could have been their own disks. Can't beat $5 bucks to download.
This is an instrumental album that you can relax by reading something....I dont recommend meditate because is  alittle strange music. It reminds me good soundtracks of video games. Sure this album is very strange and total different than their other albums. But i guess that if you like NIN then you would like this album too
Ghosts appeared on my head. I heard it arriving...Still Remember  the 03/03/08, when Trent made the big announce.Exit from the day - dream I was inside in between and come into the eyes wide close one. I go trough each one of the 36 stations, the space of a glimpse, and I make it clear. In the attempt to understand the spirit livens up the album, try to define the tracks. Because the beauty of the project is you can find a song describes every moment of your life.- 1) The first one speaks to me about an ending, not a history goes to open... but...carry on. From the end, a new beginning. - 2) The piano leading role. A whisper of something just arriving. - 3) Drums a go - go,  all lined up. - 4) Guitar talkin' about an opportunity to take - 5) The waiting time. - 6) Like a classical suite takes place in a limbo full of hope. - 7) Echoes of industrial tones. - 8) Distortions, choked screams, fighting, in the better tradition of Nin. - 9) Quiet, relaxing piano, a rest, but not a resignation. - 10) Fingers scratch the walls, difficults, but notes are climbing... - 11) Blows, thrilling, cinematic atmosphere. - 12) Melancholy, misunderstanding. Disappointment for all that could have been but... and the piano digs furrows in soul. - 13) This is the sea, or La Mer. Waves of calm before (others) storms. - 14) Tribal, exotic sounds push themselves way through the crowd. A rainy dance. - 15) Sense of lost, Shouts so far away, but deafening. - 16) Those voices, so chemical. - 17) A typical line of contemporary industrial civilization. - 18) All the people in queue for something, synth synth synth. - 19) The way before, pushed to the top. Flexible tubes, electronic hammers, breakdown tones, Nin's style at maximum. - 20) Instrumental textures building the alienated man, towards illusory resolution. - 21) Red Lanterns, directly from Hong Kong. Metropolitan labyrinth. - 22) Classical influences came from the childhood. - 23) Like barks of wolves in the mist. - 24) Tension dissolves itself. - 25) Alerts from the Future. - 26) Find a way, passing through. Many stops passing by. - 27) Bad tongues, fire spiral, audio effects, your penance. - 28) Urban Cowboy's long way home. How much effort and wisdom piled up. - 29) The same faces, the same routine, but different to you. - 30) Japanese mystery frame. - 31) From tunnel's bottom, awful visions. - 32) At times, sweaty, wet, ready - to - go, in front of the great choice. - 33) Scared of your intimacy, in a stranger body. - 34) The gates of evolution. - 35) Resist to the Ghosts. - 36) Embrace the Ghosts.Some tracks seem light like a feather, as in American Beauty, some others seem bring it on all the world's weight.All of this always In balance between symphony and metal.And the pdf book? It deserves a review, doesn't it?Ok, just a few mentions. A quote from Hitchcock's masterpiece, "The Byrds".On the whole, a suggestive scenario, a Journey in wich each song is like a travelling around yourself, as a planet.But the full - lenght album is proposing like to be the soundtrack of our times...We don't tell us about, all of us want to enter in TR's brain to understand much more.Now you are exploring everything, T., join the extremes together, make the Hard Rock and the Classical nearby.Now write a partiture, beat it! Or a OPERA, wonder everyone! So you're the man kick the world.I think T.R. is at the 4th mutation, really it's difficult to imagine a person more changeable... If you take the young Trent and make a comparison with the present, you find a man so different. But it's a resource.Did I get you T.?AtFirstSight
Ghosts I-IV is a 36 track instrumental collection, which was recorded over 10 weeks in the Fall of 2007.  It is totally made up of improv pieces performed by Trent and some friends.  This is definitely the most non-commercial release that Nine Inch Nails has ever put out.This is the kind of release that you have to sit down and listen to in its entirety; you can't easily pick and choose which tracks to listen to.  None of the songs have actual titles, and at first, that can seem rather annoying.  However, after you listen to the work, you realize that titles wouldn't truly help you identify any of the songs.The music on the release ranges from slow, piano-based pieces to some rather uptempo pieces.  You can hear some elements from the Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral eras, but that's not to say Trent Reznor is regressing musically.  When you listen to the music, you can hear the elements, but they're cast in a more "modern" style.  Most of the songs clock in between two-and-a-half and three-and-a-half minutes (only three or four of the 36 tracks clock in at over five minutes).While this was an interesting listen, it's probably something I won't listen to very much.  Not because it's bad, but because right now, I simply don't have many opportunities to set aside two hours of my day to just sit down and listen to music.
I'll admit, it took me a few listens, as I like the music, but each song is a very short single-themed piece which I wish had been maybe half the number of tracks with interwoven themes.  That being said, it has become mandatory writing music, as the music builds soundscapes that are quite conducive to imagery.  After listening to the SLIP (which includes "The Four Of Us Are Dying" - a superior instrumental that DOES mix themes), I'm quite intrigued to find out if/when Trent will do GHOSTS V-VIII.  Of course, as I'm a die-hard NIN fan, I'd like him to do another three albums for purchase next week... but I think the poor man needs a nice long break.
It's more "The Fragile" than "The Downward Spiral".  It might be stronger with a bit of editing, but hey, it's self-published and Trent has a right to put out whatever he damn well wants to.  Although not atonal, it reminds me Jonny Greenwood's soundtrack to "There Will Be Blood".  It's sparse and subtly menacing, not the multilayered, claustrophobic aural bombardment that he's so well known for (and I mean that in a good way).  Each song is like the nagging doubt in the back of your mind:  incomplete and ambiguous, unsettling you the more you listen to it.  It's very much in keeping with David Bowie's "Low", one of Trent's favorite albums, or a darker version of Eno's "Music for Airports".  It takes a somewhat patient ear to appreciate the nuances of Ghosts, but it's worth the effort.  Examining the deep recesses of one's psyche is not for the meek.
Well, it's been a long time since I've bought a nine inch nails record.  The last one I bought was "Still".  Since then, I just haven't liked what Trent's been putting out.  I won't bash it or bash him for releasing it.  I've always had respect for Trent as a musician, but I guess maybe I just grew out of my ability to enjoy his more angsty/vocal side like I could when I was a wee shaver.  Having said that, I think this album is a very refreshing release.  I really like what he's done with the various release formats, and I like that it didn't take him 5+ years to come out with this.  The opening tracks I found to be stunningly beautiful, and while I do enjoy the rest of the album very much, I was hoping there'd be more low-key instrumentals in the vein of "Leaving Hope" from Still, etc...  Nevertheless, if you're a fan of Trent because of his musical creativity and not just because of his image, you'll probably be able to appreciate this.
Finally free from record companies, contracts, and the like; Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor has unleashed "Ghosts I-IV", an entire album of instrumental work.  As a longtime NIN fan, I personally was a little apprehensive when I first approached "Ghosts", but thankfully, I ended up being pretty satisfied.  Tracks 22, 24, and 28 in particular are the most memorable moments to be heard here, as there are some great uses of the piano (!) to be heard that are peppered throughout the album.  Although at times "Ghosts" borderlines on self-indulgence, as a whole, the album is a real treat, and is a welcome departure from Nine Inch Nails' usual brand of discontent.  Clocking in at under two hours in length, "Ghosts" moves along without ever really feeling that long at all.  All in all, "Ghosts I-IV" is a more than welcome cry of freedom from Trent Reznor and co., and with more "Ghosts" promised to be appearing in the future, here's hoping that Nine Inch Nails continue to climb new heights of creativity.
For those unfamiliar with this album, it's a collection of short instrumental "sketches" that Trent Reznor fleshed out with several collaborators including Adrian Belew.  Probably not something to throw on at a party, or listen to in the car during rush-hour, but it makes for great listening while reading, writing, or web-surfing.  It's moody in places (with Reznor that's a given right?) and sounds like pieces from some spooky film noir movie.  A great value for the price, and I honestly find myself more taken with it than anything he's released since the "Downward Spiral."  Hopefully he will release something else along these lines in the future; I know I will snap it up if he does.  Thanks Trent!
This is an important work, and the fact that some of the hardcore NIN fans don't like it means that Trent is growing.  Some of you need to think about that.
This is a modern symphony to life that volleys between intensity and sweetness.  There are elements of classical music, heavy metal, rock, tribal beats, alternative riffs, lyricism, and moody keyboard work.I can't say I loved every track, but it certainly held my interest.  (Some elements reminded me of Wendy Carlos' synthesizer music.)GHOST would make a great score for a movie, but I'm sure someone has already optioned it.All in all a worthwhile use of five dollars and your time.
I never thought I'd hear something so pure from Trent! It's very exciting times to be a NIN fan! Imagine if all artists did this?
What an interesting collection.  Certainly visual music, with no words, that easily gets me distracted while I'm driving or talking.Not as hard as one might expect for NIN at times.  Certainly as complex, rhythmic, industrial at points as expected.  I can forsee this music being used in movies, if allowed.Very lurky, mechanistic, sometimes erie. Menacing. Lots of simplicity leading to confusion & chaos.A feel in a spot or two of Pink Floyd type Dark Side of Something.Being 36 tracks, I haven't made it entirely through as many times as I'd like. The more I listen, the more I like.
Year Zero and AWITHA TEETHA were massive disappointments. There was no creativity or effort displayed in most of the songs on those albums, a few truly were good though. After spending 1989-1999 on an amazing creative stretch it appeared that Trent was out of gas.This shows that Trent still has more than a little left in the tank and that he has grown as an artist. This won't be for everyone, especially those kids who recently discovered Broken. I think for those that are roughly Trent's age and have followed him from the beginning this is an effort worth appreciating.The one thing that I haven't heard much about is the license that Trent released Ghosts under. It is an open source license.[...]That means that you can actually  share these songs with friends and strangers alike without worrying about getting sued. You can also remix it and release it. I am interested to see how people finish these wonderful, but obviously unfinished songs.Trent is also having a film festival of sorts, highlighting visual work based off of Ghosts.These sorts of things show how valuable it is to move the money stealing, soul crushing major labels out of the way between the artist and fans.Hopefully others will follow suit, I would love to see an unfettered Smashing Pumpkins. I truly hope that Trent and others use this type of model and their fame to help up and coming artists get more exposure without being filtered by big business.
I've never been the biggest NIN fan out there but I am really enjoying this release. My only wish was was there was a bit more separation between the ambient type songs and the more upbeat/techno ones instead of them being as interspersed as they are. Other than that, the music is very creative of course and I hope Reznor continues with this series/project.
Reznor's "Ghosts I-IV" is good.  That much I am sure of, and while I'm not completely sure what I think about it yet, whatever the final verdict is, he had an interesting idea that was worth exploring."Ghosts" is odd not because of its large number of tracks or because it is purely instrumental, but because it is so thematic.  Despite the wide spectrum of possibilities he could have explored making an instrumental album, and his proven ability to conjure up some truly bizarre ambience (like in a lot ofThe Downward Spiral), he focused almost solely on loop driven, rhythmic pieces in which most of the sound comes from guitar or piano.  For better or for worse, "Ghosts" is nowhere near as diverse as the instrumental work from theThe Fragile.Although others have said they find each volume of the 4 contained in "Ghosts I-IV" to be thematically different, I find the entire thing to be a consistent mood piece... spacious and reminiscent of a desert landscape, with forays into cool caves and shaded spaces, but always with that incredibly dry aesthetic.  The volumes only differ in the sounds added or subtracted from their palettes (for example, III has a lot more Aphex Twin-esque synth basslines).Initially many of the guitar riffs and piano arrangements seem signature Reznor, almost to the point of self parody.  However, the strength of "Ghosts" really lies in the careful organization and panning of sounds, the gradual swell of every track into a usually abrupt cut-off.  Despite lacking the free-form organization of true ambient music, these songs really are sound environments.  The lack of development in each track matters little when each song is a trip back to a different area of the same imaginary land..."Ghosts I-IV" may lack some of the intensity of previous NIN because the way it's put together prevents any kind of tension from building, but it's still full of great ideas.  I also give "Ghosts I-IV" a lot of credit for being a double album that I almost always listen to in one sitting, a rare thing (I don't even usually do that withThe Fragile).  It flows very well and is very listenable, and it feels much shorter than it is.So for $5, how could you go wrong?
This isn't a bad release as it is a lot of new material.  It is all instrumental though so don't be surprised not to hear Reznor's voice.  My only complaint is that you pay $5 on Amazon for the mp3 downloads yet you can pay the same price and buy it directly from Nine Inch Nails and you get a lossless copy.  You can also pay $10 and get the CD release along with immediate lossless downloads.As I said, this album isn't bad but it definitely isn't Reznor's best work.  Think of it as more of a collection of ideas that wouldn't normally make a Nine Inch Nails record.
2008 Release 36 Tracks - Wanted to know what this was about. &#34;Curiosity Killed The Cat, but He Died Satisfied&#34; - am glad to have this in my collection, some tracks are more interesting than others, but it can be hard core, no vocals, instruments, sounds, hey, it's Metal. 9 tracks of Ghost I, 1st starts with a Piano sound, Some tracks in II have Piano sound, Some tracks in III, (Track 24 has a interesting sound, drive to it, like this one,) Ghost IV closes it's sequence with some resolution.  This is NOT John Cage with &#34;Prepared Piano&#34; it might grow on you.  My beautiful yellow, green & blue parakeet seems to like some tracks, sings along track 11, 29 Ghosts IV - is it organized noise? Are you man enough for this Album set?  You decide.. I'm a long time fan of Frank Zappa, & The Mothers, but many of his compositions have &#34;comedy relief along the way&#34; like &#34;Uncle Meat&#34; which was complex, but at least I could whistle the main themes, but this NIN is much more of a challenge. Thanks to Professor Fischer at Pasadena City College in '70 for introducing me to so many different kinds, types of music, Gregorian Chants to &#34;Sunken Cathedral&#34;, and the many beats, musical scales. I did get an A- on my Synthesizer paper, learned much as well. It was my &#34;fun&#34; class when I went to college after USAF in '70.  This is a long way from singing in Church on Sundays. *keep smiling* -30-
So Trent Reznor has been making music for a long time now and ever since "With Teeth", he has been in one of his most prolific periods.Also, even since "With Teeth", it seems like he has been getting more and more minimalistic with his work.  Do not get me wrong, it is still good and this album as well as his newest one, The Slip, are both awesome.  This is an instrumental work that covers a broad range of musical styles and moods, but as I was saying, it is more and more minimalistic.If you are a NIN fan, you must own this.  If you are a fan of electronic music, this might suit you, but you are a fan of only the poppy NIN stuff or the radio hits, this is not the album for you, but on that same note, the entire cd is only 5 bucks, so you might as well check it out and if you do not like it, you are only out a couple of bucks in the end.
Both...It was playing the game SSX Blur that made me want to buy this album, and after long period away from the game, the music made me want to go back and pick it up.... Well, either that or dance.It's a 'feel good' album; it can make any day feel like Friday.
This may be sacrilege to some die-hard Basic Channel fans, but "Phylyps Rmx" is by far my favorite version of the classic "Phylyps Trak." It has an intensity and an immediacy that just grabs you, forces you to dance, and doesn't let up for its entire 9:51 duration. It's a shining example of the Basic Channel boys really hitting their stride. The dub echos are reined in to allow a sense of space and clarity to take over. It's lighter than other versions, but still has the intensity and drive.Lyot Rmx is not my favorite Basic Channel track (technically, it's by Vainqueur - aka Rene Lowe), but it's not bad by any means. The balance on this track always throws me a little bit. The drums are firmly in the background while a weird bass synth dominates with some odd filtering. I think I would like it better if the drums were more present, but then I suppose it would be closer to the original mix.Overall, this is worth picking up for Phylyps Rmx alone. It's that good.
"Radiance" is one of the stranger Basic Channel releases. The dance beats are all but gone leaving only dubbed out bass lines and the murky ambience of echoey synthesizers. The three variations put different components of the track in the foreground with one focusing on the bass, one focusing on the chords, and one sort of mixing the two. I can't really imagine hearing any of these in a club, but I suspect that these tracks are often mixed with beats from other records. Even if it's not too danceable, it makes for interesting, if repetitive, listening.When talking about Basic Channel, I'd either start with their self-titled CD, or the Quadrant EP, Phylyps Trak, and Inversion. However, once you have some of the essentials, "Radiance" is a nice take on the Basic Channel sound and should compliment the other tracks nicely.
The 3 new tracks alone are worth the purchase, despite the recent move towards more guitar driven tracks.  The remixes are good, but honestly you can't improve on perfection, more often than not the remixes often just make me thirst for the original track because the remix doesn't satisfy my want to hear the song.  Aside from 1 remix being so-so, overall they are good and even though they try to put a different spin on the original, they aren't as good as the original but it's nice to see my favorite tracks in a new light.If you're fan, this is a must buy, if you're new to Iris, I recommend you check out their previous two albums as this isn't a good starting place to sample them.
This Band surprises me with their great, catchy pop tunes.  I really enjoy the melodies and harmonies they seem to be able to do so effortlessly.  Their albums are unique and the songs always work.  It's catchy pop that you can play and sing too or just have in the background to set the tone at a party.  Highly recommended!
Back in 2007 while getting a soda pop at a gas station in Boardman, Oregon, this CD was right by the checkout stand with a hand printed sign that mentioned the artist was a local girl. Cool, I thought, and bought one, not really expecting the incredible voice and music that came belting out of the cd player! Wow. What a surprise.Hope she tours the local area soon.
I had heard a song by Maduro and was hooked.  I came to Amazon looking and found 3 albums by Maduro.  I downloaded all 3 to play at Market where I vend my belly dance wares!!
These are some interesting and unique sounds. It's like a cross between Mortal Kombat and Lounge. I particularly liked #3. If any artists want to know how to sell music on Amazon google ADEDistribution. Also, if you like the music on this page, you may also likeFind My WayandThe Party Peak
Caryn Lin visited my daughters elementary school this year.  She came home and talked about nothing but the assembly and wanted to find some of Caryn's music.  The music is lovely and we play the album almost every day.  My daughter will be in the 4th grade next year and has decided to take up the viola (her big sister plays the violin and she absolutely can't play the same instrument ;-)  Thanks Caryn, keep up the good work.
I already have a huge Tangerine Dream collection, (over 300 CDs,) and I bought this boxed set just because I love this band so much. It comes in a very nice box with 2 CDs, a nice booklet, and a badge. I was very impressed when I received it, considering the price.More importantly, when I played the CDs, I was most happy with the collection of tracks. Other than the very nice, albeit primitive early works of the band, there are a few treasures in this set, mainly, "The Seventh Folder." I can't get enough of this song! I find myself playing it over and over and over because it captures the essence of what I've always loved about Tangerine Dream! The sequences are hypnotic and Edgar Froese's harsh and crude electric guitar playing perfectly compliments the beat of the music. This is truly one of my favorite TD songs of all time!Tangerine Dream's music has always been about contradiction and contrast; subjecting black against white, loud vs. quiet, peace vs. war. This set is no exception, and the more I listen to this collection of songs, the more I realize why I like TD so much.If you're new to Tangerine Dream and simply want a "beginner's" set, I recommend this collection. If you're a serious TD collector, like me, I don't think you'll be disappointed. "The Seventh Folder" alone is worth the price of this collection...
All the tracks are good but track one, 'Introduction to Distance', has stuck in my brain like a bit of food in my teeth that continues to seep flavor long after the meal is done.I'm not easily impressed by live electronica. But swayed by Swante's live performance in a little now-defunct coffee/performance space in Seattle, WAAY back around 2003, I bought this album.I have to say that the first track, 'Introduction to Distance', is just swell as hell.Ambient with deftly sculpted micro-rhythms, beats without a pattern, juking glitch stabs missiling in from 9 o'clock delivering a payload of one beat, thin woozy amber synth layers.Smooth but spiky, silent but noisy, if ambient could be called crafty then this is a contender.Music to be anxious by.
Even though these two mixes of MY FUNNY VALENTINE are available on the Big Muff remix album AURALLY EXCITING REMIXES, the single is worth getting for the full-length &#34;Fire Island Vocal Mix,&#34; as opposed to the &#34;Radio Edit.&#34; The extended length allows them to develop both the groove and the emotional content of the track. The Francois K & Matty Heilbronn &#34;Body and Soul Mix&#34; is certainly worth having again too, of course.
If you're looking for something transcending, sexy, and exotic with Middle Eastern and Indian beats, this is it! Didn't know about Mo-Shic until about a week ago. Love his style!
Absolutely  some of the best new chill-out and down-tempo music available on the internet. From the guitar pulsed rhythms of Sine's "Dreamin" to the reverb laden guitar and piano interlude of 4tunes "Statements". This collection is smooth and relaxing but not boring. I enjoy listening over and over again.Scott Lachance of the DigiTubeCast- Downtempo/Chillout PodCast
If you're into lo-fi recordings of bored college students then you ought to find this entertaining.I don't think either of these guys had any illusions they were making inspiring music--but that's exactly why it is still listenable even though there isn't a whole lot here.  At times it seems like they were trying to make each song sound as strange as they could.  This isn't a Velvet Underground-like attempt to be annoying just because they could, it is more an attempt to show that as long as the people are enjoying making the music, it doesn't really matter what the end product is.  There's an obvious flaw in that statement, and if you can't figure out what I meant by that then you probably should go buy something else.  But if you're interested, download this record.
The duo of Eric Guillanton & S&eacute;bastien Fouble make up the French electronic group Remote.  Released in 2008 on France based label Kill The DJ, Remote's - Dark Enough album is a varied mix of electronica that's good and sometimes great.  Utilizing deep and melodic voice filtering on several of their tracks give's Remote part of their unique sound.  Here are my thoughts and track ratings on Remote's Dark Enough;1.  Black Fi  7/10 (Standard electronica)2.  Teaser  7/10 (More basic electronica3.  Bullit  7/10 (Decent minimal electro track4.  Veron  8/10 (Nice tech-house5.  Dark Enough  7/10 (Dark as the title suggests with a narrator describing a panic state in a nightclub6.  Berliner  7/10 (Slow minimal with vocal sample7.  Allow Steady  9/10 (Superb minimal with vocal sample8.  Sinister Boogie  9/10 (Excellent minimal with vocal sample9.  Hardstick  8/10 (Great minimal10.  Microdrive  7/10 (Tech-house)Stand out tracks on Dark Enough were Allow Steady, Sinister Boogie and Hardstick.  Remote adds some considerable (albeit sometimes repetitive) talent to the electronica/minimal sounds.  I actually discovered Remote's music while listening to some live mixes by Oliver Huntemann which included the tracks Allow Steady and Sinister Boogie.  If you're a fan of darker minimal dance music Remote's "Dark Enough" album is worth checking out.
"The best way to know where you are is to know where you've been" -UnknownBy itself, "Early, Rare, and Unreleased (1988-1998) would not be a strong album.  However, put it into context of the discography that Tom Shear has produced over his 20+ years of creating music, it makes a clear picture of the path he took starting in the days of "Wavers."  Definitely some great roots started here...
The title pretty much sums up the album.  Nothing really stands out making you wonder why it wasn't released, but nothing really grates on the nerves, making you wonder what Tom was smoking when he wrote it, either.  It is a good insight in to the roots of A23, and somewhat entertaining to get a peek at how the sound started, knowing where it has since gone.  Obviously a lot of the sound is similar to thier first album, Contempt.  Not something that everyone will enjoy, but if you're a die hard fan or a dicography nerd, it's certainly worth picking up.
Good album best of the best of all nerdcore rappers. Wish he could team up with some dope beat makers. Lyrics are complex and very original.
Very kickin' electro house piece, very catchy.  A great mixture of familiar and unique styles.  Great for dancing and just home listening.  I would suggest just buying the radio edit though, it seems like it works better as a shorter song and it feels better structured than the club edit.  I haven't checked out any of the remixes yet, but those are my two cents on the original mixes.
It's not like I haven't heard anything similar, but this album (especially the remixes) fit well in my electronic electroclash collection.
I guess this group wanted to try their hand at something new. Its the only stuff they make that I like. There are a handful of songs that are addicting, but they are all made with 8 bit Midi sounds and varying but minimal vocals. Good for a while, but gets old eventually. Id give it 3 and a half, but a four will do.
