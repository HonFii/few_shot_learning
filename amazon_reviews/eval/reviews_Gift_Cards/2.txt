sure, xbox live is very nice, With all the acessibilty and freedom the product gives you, but lets go into how much it used to be, This item was 50$, yes it still is, but before you woild have a free game with the package, along with the headset and cd, now you get a demo instead of the game, A DEMO, the game made the price,to prove that, lets add things up. You woul;d get a headset (Lets price that around,say 11$) adn a geame, (lets make that 39$) and the live cd, wich shouldnt cost anything because thats the service, but microsoft didn't want to lose to much money so they changed ity too a mere demo, and I close this by saying, dont write a letter to microsft if you are anoyed by this, they will only send you a recording.
Be warned, do not order this item from target.I ordered from target and received gamerpoints. I returned it for replacement and once again received gamerpoints.DO NOT ORDER FROM TARGET UNLESS YOU WANT 1600 GAMERPOINTS
Great place to buy an Xbox Live Gold subscription. Pre-paid is especially nice as it avoids MS getting ahold of your credit card for automatic repeat billing. Unfortunately, Xbox Live is not the most amazing service in the world: Wii and PS3 are much more functional. Opponent matching is quite slow. You can't play against opponents on other platforms. Your achievements are permanently tied to your Gamertag and e-mail address. Your e-mail address cannot be changed without a support call. Entering information and navigation while shopping for purchases or games online is extremely difficult using the Xbox controller. Although Xbox Live has a great web page, they don't use it to solve this usability problem.
We made a mistake when setting up my son's XBox Live Gold account that we paid for with this card. We noticed the problem the first day of the account and contacted XBOX.com. Our only recourse was to cancel this account and open a new one. If we had paid with a credit card this would have been possible, but since the live card is non refundable and non transferrable this was not possible. So now we either have to live with the problems of the account or lose the money and pay for a new one.
While the price is definitely right, and playing games online a blast, the shipping times for this products are absurd. It was supposed to ship on Jan. 23, then got moved back to Jan. 26, and now they're saying Feb. 2nd. For something the size of a credit card that is plentifully in stock?! Totally, 100%, without-a-doubt ridiculous and insulting to me as a customer. It will most definitely make me weary of buying from Amazon itself (not a vendor on Amazon) in the future.
It's 1600 M$ points. You to add these points to your xbox live account and spend them in the Xbox Live marketplace. For their price they should buy more, but unfortunately they are from Micro$oft so they are overpriced and don't get you much.
Rip off.  I would not buy again.  What you get with the points is downloadable crap.  Do not buy.  To expensive.
I ordered it 10 minutes ago?! It ususally takes just a few seconds to get what i need so i can play
Someday Microsoft will give up on their use of their own limited currency for what were &#34;microtransactions&#34;, and just replace them with a standard credit card purchase. Until then, we have M$ points, which can be purchased at 80ms to the dollar. I like buying them from Amazon instead of directly from MS because then I get to use my Amazon card for cash back on each purchase. If only I could find a currency market and mechanism by which to exchange my M$ points for real money...
So i have 10$ to get that 800 ms points but to get it i need to have a credit card wtf i have 10 dollars in my account
The first time I ordered this product it worked fine. But this time I have to wait for the order to process. It says it can take up to 4 hours. I am very impatient and next time I think I'll just go to Walmart or Gamestop. So bored I need those points for an arcade game. Oh well guess I will have to wait.
First, I would like to thank the reviewer who stated his work-around for an invalid code.  I also received this error when inputting my code directly into the console.  The trick is to redeem this code on your PC via your XBOX live account on xbox.com.  It shouldn't be this hard, perhaps the code needed more time to become valid on the console-side, but without this helpful review I would have been stuck waiting.The code does take a long time to generate on Amazon.  I have a very fast broadband connection and was surprised it took a few minutes to do it's thing.  I can see how someone with a slower connection might have given up assuming an error had occurred.I think I will be purchasing a physical card from Amazon or utilizing the xbox.com marketplace from this point forward.
This is just MS's way of confusing the dollar value of items and using base psychology to convince people that they can't just leave a couple points sitting out there.Its a smart business move, but a pain for the consumer.The item did exactly what it was supposed to do, but I feel the product as a whole is sub par at best.  Thank god they switched to real money transactions and got rid of this nonsense.
had nothing but trouble reedeming it and by the time i got it to do something beside say invalid it said it was reedemed and no point were deposited on my account had to get a new one
I figure buying the online code would be faster, but apparently I'm wrong, i've been waiting for 3 hours, and still have not received my Xbox Live Point Codes...
took way to long how long does it really take to get a code read it think it would be fast not up to 4 hours lol what a joke i guess thats what i get for reading that would be a digital code sent to me instantly
Xbox live was not able to redeem my newly purchased game card code from my device.Microsoft has advised me that this card can only be redeemed on an Xbox 360 console.Information that was not disclosed at time of purchase. They are, however, trying toresolve the problem, although its been three weeks since I made the purchase.
Xbox live has constantly badgered all thier customers/clients with more charges/billing/downloads etc to all thier loyal customers & weve been loyal since the 1st Halo. Now Halo4 Lags,internet play sucks at high speed with boost! Legendary on spartan ops is weak. Maps are ripoffs of H2-3.weapons all suck except beam rifle. weapon tech should increase & get better as games go. Not worse!
Everything you want to do on the Xbox seems to costs extra. You want to change the name of your character? You need Microsoft points. REALLY Microsoft???
so xbox is changing over there systems making my life a pain so i contact them and they say go to amazon and purchase a online game code card. so i do so and then you tell me i may have to wait up to 4 hours to get my digital download code when i could have just went to the store and bought it within the hour thanks for the hassle amazon!! why would you just not send me a verification code
Half of the time the code appears on the screen in less then 2 minutes. Other times it can take up to an hour and then another hour to get the confirmation email. So dumb. Buy the card.
So there's nothing wrong with the card, however, Amazon advertises immediate retrieval of the online code, and it is not the case at all. In reality, you can spend up to 12 hours waiting for the code. Also, while you do not pay taxes through Amazon as one reviewer pointed out, I don't pay taxes when I buy from Gamestop either, so if you really wanna buy and play something now, you should go elsewhere.
It is OK because helps you with something in a hurry, but it is just a few for downloading  & obtaining big features.
The points where there but i had trouble adding them on my account and needed xbox support to help me out
it took a while to get the actual code to use it since my credit card didnt want to work on live. thought this was a fast process but it wasnt.
It's bad enough the xboxs apparently have self destruct chips one day after the warranty expires now I have to buy a subscription for my son every year.
I bought these points  for my grandson and paid for them via credit. I was expecting to receive them in the mail. It took several weeks to discover that they were not coming and then more time to find out how to retrieve them.
I'm so disappointed Microsoft decided to discontinue their partnership with Amazon.com to offer MS points and XBLA sales via Amazon.The news is that all that has been transferred to the awful retailer GameStop. Microsoft apparently took their business elsewhere, as will I.I'm never giving Microsoft my credit card info again - they ran up indiscriminate charges and it took me over a week to have sorted out.I trust Amazon with my CC info, but I'm not moving my business to GameStop.I would happily continue to purchase online codes from Amazon, but if Microsoft wants to make my shopping difficult, I have an easy solution.I'm moving my business to Playstation Network, where I can be charged only as much as I am paying, not have to buy "points" with no relation to dollars and cents.FWIW - I only need 30 more MS Points to purchase Ilomillo (yep, about 60 cents). I really wanted to play, but it's Xbox exclusive. Now, the developer will not get any money, nor will Microsoft, and I will be telling all my friends what a failure of a company Microsoft is.I swear, the longer I have my Xbox the worse the service gets. What gives Micro$oft?!?
It took about 4 or 5 hours to get a code, just like the other reviewers mentioned.The code, still - 16 hours later, continues to give me &#34;0 credits&#34; when I try to purchase apps from the MS phone store.I'm still waiting for Amazon support. I needed the app yesterday. Now there's no point, but still would like my credit to function.
It is outrageous that on top of having to pay for the video programs you want like netflix,  you have to pay for access to be charged access for these services.
I didn't want to put my CC information into Live, so I figured I'd use Amazon instead. Unfortunately, I had to put my CC information in again (for 1-Click Purchasing) anyway, so that was a bit annoying.Put in my information, purchased, and... nothing. It told me that the processing would take up to four hours. An hour later I finally got the code. If I need Live points again (not likely, since I don't have an Xbox) I likely won't buy them through Amazon.
The redemption process for this is supposed to be fast, but Amazon takes 20 minutes or half an hour to process orders.  It's frustrating to do this here, especially when the instantly available Microsoft ordering system costs the same.  Don't waste your time with Amazon's poorly implemented redemption system.
I bought the code and tried to redeem it and it was invaild. I want a refund for this purchase.
4 hours for a code? That seems to be a bit excessive. Very dissapointed with four hours man if only i could download my game but i am waiting sour right now sour.
ok, i went to use the code right after i purchased it; and xbox says that the code was already used. What the hell is wrong with you amazon.
We know what they are and what they are for. I wish it was dollar for dollar instead of mind games with points. If you get burned buying content you are told to contact the company that released the content on XBOX Live. When you contact the company they tell you to contact Microsoft for a credit because you paid them... It's all a trick!But we sure do love our XBOX to take those chances. Enjoy!
The Product code that not work at all.. And have not got any update from the Amazon i was asked to call but is keep on hold for a long time.. So fix has been given to this issue..
I ordered this hoping that it would be a quick fix to get some points since XBL was really acting up that night. It took over a week for me to get the codes because the initial e-mails weren't sent to me. My debit card that I used was also suspended when I purchased these because, apparently, many people that use this service use stolen cards. After a quick call to the card company, this was resolved. HUGE hassle.
Well I spent too much time doing this to be quite disappointed.I decided an online purchase would be quicker than the 5 minute drive to wal-mart.Then after I made my purchase they decided to tell me, Oh..well this may take up to 4 hours to process.BOO!
After looking at most of the reviews for this product, I figured it would be a gamble to see if I would be a lucky one. Turns out my luck ran dry as I tried to painfully stick the game code with my xbox controller over and over again, always saying the code was invalid. Im going to assume many others have tried this right after they received their code if they did get it. I attempted to contact Amazon support for help, but figured out what to do instead.If you have a LIVE account (I'm going to assume everyone does when buying this product), try going on your computer and accessing your live account via computer and redeeming the code through there. This might save you a bit of trouble. The points instantly come in and I downloaded all I needed to download. So if you're having trouble validating the code, try using the laptop first instead of the xbox.The low score however comes in due to the lack of help amazon provides for its customers if they do have a problem (I got received help the morning after), telling me to contact support for LIVE is not good service. This is not so much a review against the actual product, as it is against Amazon for their lack of help about this matter.
These Wii cards can be hard to find I'll admit. But those selling the cards charging them over $20 when the card itself is worth approx $20. (Every 100 points is equivalent to $1 for those who are unaware of this.) You can buy these points on the Wii shop channel if you have a credit card without shipping and handling or wait until you can get them in your local store.If you REALLY REALLY REALLY need a Wii card and none are available to you and you do not have a credit card(Or bank card), try looking somewhere that will charge more around $20 so you aren't literally wasting money.
Be careful. If you order this card through the link on the first page they charge you $16.12 shipping and handling to ship it from Target.  If you go to the 'other buying options'  button, it says $2.69 shipping from Target.  I called customer service about the difference and was told that if you buy it through amazon then target, that is the shipping.  Customer service did refund the extra shipping (Amazon has great customer service in my experience), but you should be aware of the problem.
As long as you get this with free shipping and handling then it is fine, not a deal but not paying more. However do not buy from any other company claiming on selling it cheaper they simply over do it on shipping and you pay more. I f you don't like using your cards online go to your local Toys R Us store you can buy Wii points there. Wii points 100 points equals $1.00 U.S. Dollar. They come in 2000 point cards only so a max total price should never exceed $20.00 U.S. Dollars
You can buy the same points instantly on Wii Shop Channel!! $20 US dollars=2000 points.. Rule of thumb is to move the decimal point over 2 spaces and add a $ dollar sign.. So 500 points=$5 US dollars..1000 points=$10 US dollars..
This is a great product and still cheaper than in the stores.  However, this can be found on other sites for less.  There are two sites I know of that you can get this at less than $60 after shipping.
I paid a couple dollars less then buying it on Ebay!  I bought this because I was looking to purchase a 12 month subscription to Xbox Live. So I bought this and gave the game and messenger kit to the kids. They were happy, and so was I.  Oh ya, the kids like the game, but I find it dull!
I would buy one, but Amazon needs to change the quantity of denominations and make them more accessible.  If they would do that then I would more willing to buy one.
Love the idea of an Amazon gift card but hated the difficulties I experiences trying to print a certificate that I can wrap.  It's has been a huge hassle.  I want one that I can instantly print because - duh - I waited too long. So I most certainly did NOT want to spend more time and more hassle trying to print an "instant" one!Next time, I'll give myself enough time to order one that will be delivered.
You sign in, go to kindle, create a gift card, put in your amountand the trouble begins. You put in your visa card number (doesn'tmatter if it is already on file), you go through more &#34;continues&#34;,then &#34;purchase&#34;, and Amazon tells you that your gift card is readyto print. Try to print it; Amazon asks you for your credit card numberAGAIN. Press the &#34;print gift card&#34; button and you get an &#34;html&#34; filewhich is the Amazon sign-in panel. This is what Amazon downloads.YOU GET NO GIFT CARD! Customer service was very cooperativeand gave me a refund; said they would fix the problem.
When I purchased the iPod touch on Thanksgiving day, there was SUPPOSED to be a promotion that would include the gift card at no charge.  When I received my credit card bill, there was a charge of $30 for the card.  Although I used the gift card to purchase another gift for Christmas, I feel that this should not have been charged to my account!!!
love amazon and their gift cards.  the only thing i HATE is that they automatically take first payment from your gift card balance.  when i get one as a gift from someone, but then i run out of say, baby wipes, i don't want to use MY gift balance on baby wipes.  I would rather like to keep the balance aside to use on something i WANT as opposed to something I need.  SURELY you guys can figure out how to do this?  It would make amazon gift cards nearly perfect!
Here is my problem... the reason that I had to get these gift cards is because Kindle has not figured out how to gift books. I mean come on Amazon is a great company but the can't figure out how to gift books!
I'm going to have to get with customer service about being charged $50 for this $50 gift card.  It was supposed to be free for purchasing a Wii plus the Fit Plus balance board bundle.  I'm not too happy about finding a charge to my credit card.  I hope dealing with CS will not turn out to be an unpleasant experience...
In the age of computer tech.......Why bother with a "card" - just email the recipient! Much faster and more efficient and cost effective.
I am only disappointed in the check-out process not the card. I clicked on an IKEA card and was a little disapointed that I couldn't buy 2 $50 cards.... they just offered $25 cards, not the end of the world so I thought I would just buy 4. When I got to the checkout screen it showed other denominations so I chose the $50 one. It MAY have been clear to someone else that they were now buying an Amozon card rather than an Ikea card but I didn't notice. SO I got the wrong cards and because I procrastinate on everything I had no time to return so I just gave those cards. It could have been totaly my fault.
I wanted to send electronically and didn't like the 24 hour delay to get it mailed. Birthday wishes were therefore a day late. Also, gift amounts should be my choice. I would have sent a different denomination than $25.
I was expecting this gift card to be plastic (like a normal gift card).  Instead, it is just a piece of thick paper.
Not as Amazon promised, I didn't get additional reward for purchase the card. Amazon promoted for 5% back. But it didn't happen.
If you've never had a problem shopping from Amazon.com, then you really are not experienced enough to be giving the "gift" of Amazon to someone else.  Wait until you've experienced your first screw up, and then evaluate.I received a gift certificate, but have had trouble using it, because Amazon.com's outsourced customer service does not handle issues well.  They are apparently scripted to say that an appropriate person will contact you within 48 hours, but in my experience, follow up contact is not timely.  When contact is made, it has been to tell me that the issue was not well documented by the prior agents and to start over explaining my concern once again.  After that, I was told, once more, to wait 48 hours for follow-up that did not come.  Rinse and repeat.The problem is that Amazon.com has apparently fire-walled these folks in Bangalore (or some other asian town) from the rest of the company.  Therefore, there can be no quick responses to customer concerns.  For me, after five contacts, I spoke with a "team lead" who indicated that prior agents had not documented the subject matter of my prior calls (even though I was promised a pompt resolution by those agents).Add to all this the fact that during the recent holiday season, Amazon.com raised the price of the item I wished to purchase more than once, at the same time that the item's manufacturer was offering it for considerably less.  This makes having my "gift" money tied up in an Amazon.com account less than ideal.Do not expect that the person to whom you intend to give a gift will not have to deal with the customer service department.  Try to be forward-thinking enough to consider that a problem might occur.  If it does, the recipient will likely have a very negative experience, regardless of the variety of products offered by Amazon.com.When I asked an Amazon.com customer service agent why Amazon.com was charging 150% of what the manufacturer was selling the product for directly, I was told that the additional expense should be considered to cover the expert customer service available at Amazon.com.  This is terribly amusing, considering that the only thing that the agents tend to do is instruct the customer to wait 48 hours for someone else to address the problem (which, in my experience, does not happen).If you are set on letting someone choose their own gift, you should consider a pre-paid Visa or Mastercard.  That way, the recipient could use the funds at Amazon.com if he or she so chooses, and is still free to purchase something locally from a person who could not avoid responding to a customer's concerns.
Good idea, but Amazon really needs to give a discount on these.  No reason to spend this much and not get some type of discount.
Well a reviewer said that Amazon.com dropped the price to $20.00, but not today. It is $23.95, "reduced"  from $24.95.Do people with a Wii realize, that this 2000 point card means that it allows for $20.00 worth of online downloads online for the Wii.The 2000 point (or $20.00), card does give an excellent value for downloading classic games and some of my favorite classic rock tunes for Rock Band.But, why would anyone purchase this on Amazon, when it is so easy to do online via the Wii main screen ?????There you pay $20.00 for $20.00.Jon
If you're interested in buying this, keep in mind that there are no refunds once you buy.  Amazon will not give you a refund.  Microsoft will not give you a refund.  Why should you care?  Most reviews of the xbox 360 have determined that over 30 percent of consoles will fail within two years.  A recent GameInformer survey found that 54.2 percent of xbox 360s failed before they made it to two years.  The only thing worse than finding your xbox 360 is broken and won't be repaired under warranty is knowing that the remainder of your prepaid subscription is going to waste.Statistically speaking, over half of xbox 360 owners will have to buy a replacement out-of-pocket.  Unless you have that cash sitting around to instantly buy a new console, you're going to want the option to cancel and get your money back for the unused portion of your subscription.  Take my advice and protect yourself by purchasing directly from Microsoft.
Flimsy card, couldn't get the # off the back, waste of $$$
This product arrived quickly and looked great, but the code hadn't been activated when I tried to redeem it. Without being activated, this product is useless.
Playstation is much better, its completely free. You just pay for the items you need in the Playstation store. Xbox Live is a joke.
Nothing wrong with the product. Just bought this for my 10 year old son to use but he has/had no interest in going this route. He actually did not enjoy the thought of playing against people he did not know. He also did not seem to understand (and I definitely don't) Sad I spent the $$ on it.
Only review i can write about this item (which should be free) is, thanks microsoft for making us pay for online gaming "amenities", keep cranking price up, well its recession time, worlds largest and richest organization must get more money out of people who are addicted to game.
Modders, hackers, cheaters, glitchers, and boosters have ruined the Xbox 360 live experience for me. If Microsoft is going to charge us for Xbox Live, the least they could do is boot the modders and hackers. I actually wouldn't mind paying for the service if I thought I was getting something for my money.I will be renting most games from now on, only playing the single player, and avoiding the online multiplayer.
I have the same complaint as everyone else who thinks this is a "cheap" way for Microsoft to squeeze even more money out of their customers. Yes, I know I have an alternative, which is to simply not buy their products, but this is a review of my opinion of this product - and I gave it.
How do you review a product like this? It either is what it says, or it isn't. In my case, it wasn't. It was advertised as a 12 month +1 card. When I activated it, I only got a 12 month subscription and there was no information anywhere on how to get the bonus month. Be warned.
XBOX has a quality online platform so it at least feels like you are getting some value for your $60.00.
Had to contact Xbox. When I first tried to use card. It said that card had been used already. I contacted Xbox and they fixed the problem
This deal used to be good when it was $35 for 12 months but now the price has gone up to $49 which is $10 off retail price but is not good enough. Walmart has it for $39.96 which is even better!
Basically the only advantage to this is to be able to play online, I hear that they now offer a free game with the subscription, but still nowhere near as the value you would get with Playstation Plus, on the other hand they are the best at party chat on the Xbox 360 (the Xbox one is actually a step backwards sadly, but I'm sure it will be fixed), but overall to me it wasn't worth getting another year as of yet
You've got to hand it to the people in Redmond, they really know how to squeeze every last time out of the consumer.  Xbox Live Gold is no exception.  Unless you are a hardcore gamer, you probably find no compelling reason to subscribe to XLG but the service has been revamped in the last year and goes beyond online gaming.  While not a bad service, per say, Microsoft requires Xbox Live Gold for services unnecessarily just so they can make more money.  I found this out the hard way after subscribing for Netflix last week.  You can watch movies instantly on Netflix through your Xbox 360, PS3 or Wii at no extra charge, how great is that!?  No longer do you have to wait for a new DVD to come in the mail, nor do you have to sit hunched over at your computer screen anymore.  I connected my 360 to the internet via ethernet and after a quick update began to enter my Netflix info.  Wait--what's this?  Xbox Live Gold is required to use Netflix on your 360.  What complete bull!  Microsoft isn't even providing you with anything but they expect you to pay them $9.99 a month (if you buy Live monthly) for a service you're already paying for.  What's worse is that Sony and Nintendo do not charge you anything extra to watch Netflix through their consoles.  Essentially all services offered through XLG require a separate subscription to that service all the while Microsoft is providing you with nothing.
Companies that lure customers with their 'deals' offset by outrageous S&H need to be dissed and derailed.  That kind of practice reeks of deceit and deception.  Prova*tage has a 12 month subscription for $38.41 with reasonable S&H--that's about as good as anyone will get for now.
I wasted a lot of time waiting for the card to come in the mail. Now Amazon has a site where you can purchase JUST the game code! Do that and save time and money!
The me, the occasional gamer, this wasn't worth it. Barely played online and just don't see paying regularly for it. It just gets expensive. You have to be a real gamer to justify this.
I bought this and I regret it, what is the point of Gold subscription, to watch netflix, and Lebrons family TV show? I wish I had bought PS Plus instead - go Japan! btw Windows 8 is awful!
Said it came with 800 ms points, it did but code was expired. Disappointed should have not said it was coming with 12 month xbox live
Was really disappointed when I found this way cheaper on another site, (only difference was no card, still get the code to use it)  So I guess next time I'll have to look around more!
because im confused by the two opions they give you and the custmor service does not help at all with my issue
It came quickly in the mail, package was only a little damaged but not that it really mattered. Only problem is it was completely in Russian! I had to get another one because I couldn't read the instructions.
I have yet to receive my code via email but it seems legit.  When i receive it i will update this review based on the buyer, not the product.
Bottom line... Stupid to have to pay for this every year.  I already have to pay for Internet access and its just another way for microsoft to push stupid fees on to their customers.
We ordered this gift card for family on the other side of the country.  When it arrived at our house we re-packaged it in a Christmas card and mailed it.  I checked the invoice and papers that were in the packaging for important info and found none.We received a phone call from our family when they finally tried to use the card.  It would not work because it needed an activation code????  If it was included,  it was in a very sneaky place because I never saw it!Be careful!!  Not the "easy" gift you think it is going to be.  It is now February and I am still trying to get it taken care of!
I ordered a gift card to be sent to an address in Indiana, not sure when it was delivered, because the card did not say who it was from. I asked the recipient if he had gotten my "present" (did not want to say what it was), he kept saying no, so after about 3 weeks, contacted the company, claiming a lost card. A few days later, got automated response, but in that time he discovered that the card had arrived earlier, just didn't know who it was from. I contacted the company to report it was not lost, but keep getting auto replies asking me what I want to do about my lost card. Disappointing service, won't order gift cards here again.
I have always enjoying going to see a good movie. So I was waiting with anticipation to receive this gift card (which I purchased for myself). I agree with the other reviewers. There seemed to be no activitation code on the card. I returned the card and it was replaced with a good card.There is a problem with this product which needs to be fixed.
the gift cards I purchased for gifts came bent and looked used. I used Amazon because I hate going to the stores.
It has not worked correctly since we got it. One day x box live works then a week it won't connect. We have bought a new router, and talked to Game Stop to trouble shoot any problems and cannot figure it out. So I hope we didn't waste $50.00 we have already lost one month just trying to get it to work.
Ok, playing online for xbox is very fun. of course,you have to pay for xbox live gold. xbox live is pretty boring with a silver account, so gold is the way. i was pretty excited ordering this because it is my first time having my own gold account. since i chose email delivery, i expected it to be at my email by, at the most,about 8 o'clock. it is now the next morning at 10:17 and it said it just finished processing. The only bad thing is that it takes so long to get the code.
... Just to watch Netflix, which I also pay for, through my XBox. There are no other useful features of XBox live to me. I don't play online, I just want Netflix streaming. Microsoft sucks.
Installed several times. After using for a day or two will lock out and say not connected even with full signal from wifi. Have to reboot system several times and attempt to reconnect to get working again. Ends up being off more than it is on.
Netflix, Hulu Plus, ESPN, HBO and many other streaming services under XBOX LIVE already charges you a monthly fee for subscription. in addition their apps all available for free on almost every TV or streaming box out there so why do I need to pay for XBOX LIVE just to have the privilege to pay for Netflix, HULU etc..?I understand that the online gaming is a unique service to XBOX 360 and that actually justifies a fee. No argument here. however this should be separated from the streaming services because it just doesn't make sense to pay a fee for the option to pay again for a service. Access to the streaming services should be free because I already pay for their subscription.
DON'T PAY MICROSOFT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TOMy problem with Xbox Live is not with what services it provides, but what it charges for these services. Most users who subscribe to Xbox Live use it mainly for online gaming and at the same time enjoy the complimentary access to the Netflix, HBO-GO, VEVO and other applications. But for someone who doesn't do a lot of online gaming and just wants to access YouTube or watch a movie on Netflix, this flat fee of $5 per month seems just a waste when you're already paying for the Netflix or HBO GO subscription. Paying this additional $5 doesn't net you anything; your experience of Netflix or HBO GO on Xbox Live is nothing great or different compared to your experience (for the same application) on Apple TV or IPAD or Roku. Next time someone asks your advice on buying an Xbox or PlayStation, tell him or her to go buy a PlayStation because it not only offers free online gaming and free access to YouTube and Netflix and other services, but it also helps you save money - by not paying for Xbox Live - which can be put towards buying a new game.
A waste of money. Psn is better and free. It is an absolute ripoff. Luckily i only spent thirty dollars.
was on phone with Microsoft rep for 40 min.finall got it resoved| 7 more words required| 7 more words required
The product itself one couldn't possibly have complaints about, but "processing" it took over 4 hours because I opted for the online code.  I've purchased plenty of points this way on Amazon and had them instantly available, so I'm unsure what took so long buying Gold time in the same fashion.
Its keeps asking me if i want to upgrade to XBox Gold, and that is what I was suppose to already have and have paid for????That is the reason for the  low rating.  Beverly Whites
So, I love the fact that you can get a three month card cheaper on amazon than in stores, and I ordered mine mid-May. Let me just say it is now June 22nd and it still isn't here.I understand it says it won't be here until July sometime, in which it may be right on time, but even if its coming from the other side of the world, it still shouldn't take that long. I have ordered them before from other sellers for the same price and it arrived in a couple weeks. Needless to say, I am disappointed!!
Even with this, the stuff they want they have to pay for so not impressed. have not used myself but dont see actually paying for it after trial expires.
I personally think the 24 month is worth the purchase than these small 3 months.....ANYTHING than having Microsoft take money from your bank account every month (which is a lot) ....purchase the 24 month and get it over it, especially in black Friday,its cheaper.
had a really hard time getting this card to work.  My son had to contact the company several times to get it to run.
I bought a code for myself and decided to buy another one as a gift. I get on this morning and the amount changed $15 higher over night. I should be able to get both of them at the same price.
This is taking too long.  I expected to receive the code immediately but now I have to wait up to 4 hours.
Grandson got one from someone else. Is there any way to deactivate and get money credited? Otherwise he will have to wait a year to activate
Like previous commenters I was burned by asking for gift cards with the intent of purchasing this product. After speaking with multiple agents with Amazon's customer service I was finally told that all digital downloads require a credit card to be added to the account to verify the purchaser is in the States. While this is a requirement (legally or contractually I don't know) Amazon could go a lot farther in making this clear.
The old xbox live allowed you to have a family account under one account.  Now if you want to have separate people you have to purchase new xbox live account.  but to play our xbox we have to have an account.  I'm so sick of big business nickel and diming the consumer.
2 starts just because I had to wait too long, like 4 hours to process payment. never try this again
THIS WAS A DAILY DEAL.THE PRICE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 35.00,BUT I WAS CHARGED 49.46.I DONT THINK THIS IS A FAIR DEAL FOR LOYAL AMAZON.COM CUSTOMERS.
Won't be purchasing another online .. It's too expensive . Might as well just pick one at the gamestop. :/
Bought this for my grandson's birthday and when he entered the code he got some kind of error message.  He will be calling microsoft to figure out the problem.  Not the kind of thing you want for a birthday gift.
This added online feature is way too overpriced. You can't surf the web without it, can't play games with others, no access to downloading game add-ons, can't use Netflix or other streaming services that require additional payment. Not to mention it's a huge pain in the ass how at times, the Xbox decides not to log me in to Live or logs me out automatically with no visible reason.
While I am pleased with the ease of these prepaid cards and codes, and I enjoy the services provided through an xbox live account,  I am not pleased with how convoluted the pricing is. In what world is it cheaper to mail me a card than it is to simply give me the code? There aren't ground fees, there is no postage required. So why, of all things, is the easiest option more expensive? At the time of purchase, $10 more expensive. The last time I checked? The cost of the online code was still a penny short of $60, and the card itself was somewhere around $52. So tell me, what is the reason for charging $8-$10 dollars more on average for the online code option? If someone could share that wisdom it would be appreciated. The only reason I purchased this was because it was a gift, and their subscription ended tonight. Work on your pricing, my dears, because it is a**backwards.
I went to use the code and it didn't work for me and now i'm out the 20 i spent on it
As I see it Xbox gold just gives you the right to network to other peoples machines, so it doesn't really add much value or seem like a service worth paying for.  However, it's the only game in town if you want to use your Xbox for online gaming, so I buy it.
My code worked, I love Amazon, and I love my Xbox BUT we shouldn't have to pay for this membership in the first place. Also my friend's code didn't work... which makes it not worth the discounted price. Who is pocketing the money anyway? Probably Microsoft. Overall, I think we should go on strike until this is free.
Its cheaper than buying it at wal-mart,but the real trick is calling up xbox customer service and politely asking them if they are running their 34.99 .....12 moths subscription and if so can you renew next year at the same price and write it in your xbox360 profile for you.
If I buy an online code, which is sold worldwide, why microsoft set location restrictions fur just US users with online codes
Although this way is the fastest way to access your code to get xbox live, it took 4+ hours for it to process so I could have gone to the store and bought one faster then this worked. What a bust.
I just hate that xbox makes you pay to get netflix.... so we got a wii.  We will never do xbox live again.  But we are not online gamer people so...
and why is it more to buy the code than buy the physical card?  I like xbox sony is going to win if they keep up bad marketing schemes
I do hate the fact that you have to pay for the service because if Sony can be free why cant live be? Literally if you don't buy a subscription, your console becomes a 200$ brick/paper weight. Almost everything is disabled without it. I won't be surprised if you'll need a subscription to play the campaigns of games next.
I paid the Microsoft extortion money and now I can watch Netflix through the Xbox. I thought there would be more content for Xbox fitness, but it feels like it's still in trial mode.No problem with Amazon or the code, just disappointed that Microsoft thinks $50 (or 50 Euros) is a fair price.
I normally can make this purchase via shopping cart. I keep getting a message saying I can't purchase it through the shopping cart and it reverts me back to the add to cart page. What's going on???
After many attempts, my XBox finally recognized this code.  Not sure what the deal is, but where I do have &#34;Live&#34; membership now,  I dont have Gold.  It keeps asking me if I want to upgrade?  Sure, maybe my Xbox is getting old.  It also wants to protect my security every time I sign in.  But if it did in fact eventually except the code I purchased, why isnt it reading it as gold?
I saw the note on this product page that gifting is available after purchase, and decided to buy this code as a birthday gift for a friend.  After purchase, I was only given the code and an option to print it--no option to send it as a gift at all.  Even the &#34;help&#34; page showed an image of the same page, only with the gift option, but this was not available to me.  When I contacted Customer Service, I was told that gifting is not, in fact, possible with this code.I can't speak to the quality of the code, but I thought it should be known that the note about gifting is not correct.  If you want to send an XBox Live membership code as a gift to someone, you'll need to look elsewhere.
$20 more for an online code than for an actual card in the mail?  Are you kidding me?!  What a joke
I am only using the xbox to stream Netflix movies and find the interface clunky. With a newer TV and PC I no longer need this expensive yearly add-on. Good riddance.
My husband had to call your help line and get this card to work ... It took days to activate.  Not as easy as you would think.  When my son finally received it worked fine.
There was no 2D barcode which requires the individual to enter a 25 digit code instead. The 25 digit code I received failed to work several times (am still working to get this resolved).How can such a simple thing as a code on a card be done so poorly?Xbox Live is great. Without that this would have been a 1 star review.
i bought the online code version because i could use the code right away then waiting......i didnt get the code and amazon stated it was taking extra time for processing? just go buy it
OK, it's not Live as such. It's just that I now have 3 Xboxen with Red ring of Death sitting in my shop. Can't keep one running long enough to use the card. I got about 6 weeks of playtime out of the last year. Got a ROKU for entertainment and a cheap PC for games. Not much for twitch games but at least I can keep it running.
The code I received was rejected multiple times when I tried to redeem it. After a few days, the link finally worked. Not quite sure if it's worth the money to get a code a wait a few days for it to work rather than buy a regular card.
I have one XBOX and four kids. I have to buy four of these per year (and that leaves out the two parents). That's way, way too expensive, especially since it never happens that all four kids are playing online simultaneously. The pricing should be associated with the XBOX itself, with only a minor increment for additional players.
I could not redeem the online game code. It did not work in the console or website either.I asked for help but neither worked
I had a hard time setting it up and although I got it set up, the game console does not recognize that I have such a membership. Very frustrating.
I get my Xbox live 3 month redeem code in the mail from Ups order from amazon & my code is invalid and isn't working I would like a new 3 monthly please
So the penny scratch off doesn't always work.  Smeared black and made two digits illegible.  After guessing hundred times, had to return it.
So having this emailed to you cost more than them to ship it? That is plain stupid, they should make the email one cheaper because they dont even waste money on shipping
the product itself is good but amazons price was outrageously high the same product at Walmart was 30 dollars compared to the 50 i paid here.
Not the deal I wanted all I wanted to do was save.  It's a gimmic to make you pay for something should be free.
For the current price you can find better deals. Watch for it on sale. Buy at the right time and it's a real bargain.
might be good but couldnt use because 360 problems  so herd was a great item but i didnt get the chance
I paid for a 3 month membership which I purchased on October 17, 2012, and it has already expired. I always seem to have problems getting the full membership I pay for through Xbox. I just wanted to make you aware that I was short changed almost a month of my 3 month membership for this card.  Thank you.
My daughter says she has to pay extra for every different application wheras we thought this covered the cost for all applications a a trial. We were obvisouly dissappointed int the limeted activites compared to the playstation 3
Bought this for access to Netflix on the Xbox 360 and *surprise*! -- Microsoft dropped the requirement for Gold to access Netflix about a month later.  But it's not completely worthless -- there is still the &#34;Games for Gold&#34; program which has a few games that I like (and a few Mortal Kombat/Street Fighter games that, even though free, completely disinterest me.  I have *one* multiplayer game that I play about twice a year and this card cost more than the whole game.  So, I probably won't be renewing my gold membership unless the price drops significantly (Say $1.00 per month)If you play a lot of multi-player games on the Xbox 360, then this might be a good deal.  You don't need it if you just want to watch Netflix or the media delivery services.  I can't comment on its value for the Xbox One.
The concept of the Gold Membership required to access basic functionality seems absurd.This 12 month membership comes with 3 free games...  but only for Xbox 360 - NOT for Xbox ONE; although this was marketed along with Xbox ONE.  Disappointed that they bate you to get this with the offer of 3 free games that you cannot use.
I have purchased this in the past and it has worked fine, but this time it did not. I was surprised that it didn't work on the xbox or on xbox.com.
can not be used out of U.S, and it did not mention in the description. I have wasted $25... sad~
I agree that Xbox needs to fund its interface, but EVERYTHING you do on it demands money.  I feel that they could do well enough just making their cut.
Xbox live is great, and this card does the trick, but it took unbelievably long for this card to arrive in the mail.  The one I got was a few dollars cheaper than the codes you recieve instantly, but the long wait was not worth the little money I saved.
I did not get a chance to really use it, but it seemed if I took the time to I would of liked it.
I am a amazon user, been one for many years, but when I ordered this code, they put a delay on it for hours which caused me frustation.  I was under the impression I would immediately get the codes.  My son had a friend over and he needed a new code.  I am happy with price, but the delay is frustrating.
Was short on scratch so that's the only reason I bought this instead of the 12 month. But if you can spare the extra cash, just get a 12 month. Or don't, considering Netflix doesn't require it anymore in a few days.
I hate needing an active subscription to use apps on my Xbox that are also paid for monthly. For this reason, I will only use ChromeCast and boycott Xbox Live from here on out.
Just save yourself some money overall and just buy a year's subscription. Anything less has you paying far more than necessary.
I lost this card for a little while, and I searched high and low to find it. then my subscription was up, still couldn't find it. I got on my xbox to watch a youtube video and I cannot believe they make you have gold to watch those. So I got on my ps3 and watched the youtube video on the big screen. really upset me.eventually I did find the card and was able to resume multiplayer. I really don't understand why everyone loves the 360 and claim their multiplayer is so much better. I get just as much lag if not more at times.
services through amazon are great - got it in time but - Make sure your local restraunt doesn't close before you can use it.  All sales are final and now I can't use the card..
Bought this for a gift for some friends but they never got it.  Seller has no tracking number, all's well that ends well, refund with no problems.
I ordered these online because I had hurt my back and was not able to get out and buy them here at home. It took about a week before they sent them and then another 5-6 days before they arrived at my brother's house. In that time, they had left for a trip and held their mail. When they got home, they were not there in the mail. The seller was very understanding about refunding us our money. That I have to say is a BIG positive. BUT, if it had not taken so long for them to be sent out, they would have gotten there before they had left on their trip. The actual cards are great. I just had a bad experience with them taking sooo long to be mailed out. I would not do this again.
You pay $25 and you get $25.  Can't get ripped off with this item.  It took longer then expected to come in the mail.  I mean, com'on.  Put it in an envelope...address it and send it.  Why would it take two weeks to get to me?
It looks like a nice package doesn't it? Yeah, even though you're probably getting a nice deal buying this bundle let me tell you how much of an illusion it is. The plus side to this package is only the fact that it has a year long membership and 400 Microsoft points.The headset is disappointing. There's a certain loudness at which you have to speak into it for it to register into the headset's microphone. This can be troublesome especially if you need to play in a quiet place but still want to communicate. You have to practically shove it down your throat for it pickup.The keypad sucks! This the most irritating thing I've had to deal with in a while. The only thing going for it is that it looks pretty cool on the remote. But then again just for looks is kind of defeating its purpose isn't it?First off the buttons don't register consistently. You find yourself: A: Pressing it too hard, which often results in entering the same character twice or B: Just pressing buttons that don't do zilch!Don't be a fool and fall for this sucker of a bundle. Look, do yourself a favor and buy a wireless keyboard and a headset! You want a great deal? Go for the year membership by itself.
So I thought: cool, this thing lets me text? Why not?Let me tell you: I've only used this thing a hand-ful of times in the 2 years that I've had it. The extra headset? Thanks, but I already have like 3 others since Microsoft is so adamant in including a headset in any way they can.So it boils down to the 12 month subscription thing, which is starting to get on my nerve since I always hear PS owners lament how free is better and how by us paying for this service allows us for better content.... last I checked, PS owners had almost identical services as XBL.
It was a great deal, I don't see any price like this anywhere but microphone didn't work(broken?) We thought it was xbox it self got problem but when we bought just another microphone it is working fine.
I thought the keypad would be bigger in size. I could not use keypad letters r to small for me to read.
It would have been REALLY helpful to have a minimum requirement posted in the description. Now i have xbox live but the net in my neck of the woods is real slow so its absolutely worthless. Thanks alot for getting me to piss away 75 bucks.
I purchased this twice. Both times the chat pad doesn't work. Returned the first one but keeping the second one since its still a better deal than buying the year of Xbox live and headset at retail. I repeat, the chat pad WILL NOT WORK
This is the third Xbox headset I've bought, in addition to the one that came with my console. I keep buying them because everyone I know uses them without any problems. I figure maybe I just got unlucky with my first couple. They aren't the most comfortable or the best for sound quality, but they work, for them. Not one pair I've bought has lasted longer than a month or so. This third set didn't even last two uses. I don't throw them down, I keep them stored properly. And yet still, the mic cuts out and doesn't work after less than 4 hours of use. Fool me once...Because this starter kit came with some Microsoft points, a year Xbox live gold membership and a chatpad; the headset was basically free. But they retail for $20. I suppose you get what you pay for, but I feel like they should just not sell the things if they are so hit or miss on performance. This is not some third-party, cheesy knock-off product i bought from eBay. This is what Microsoft includes with their console. This is how they show how much they care about accessories for the most popular part of their gaming system. They don't even offer a step up in quality, if I wanted one. And I do.I rated the overall product 2 stars for the value that you get in the bundle. But the fact that the headset is junk, I feel it could be a cheaper bundle and better value if it was left out.The Amazon part of this order, however, was great. It shipped and arrived promptly at my local Amazon locker and was well packaged.
This is the first time I've really been disappointed with a purchase from Amazon.  The card comes in an envelope suitable for mailing.  Which would be great except it states boldy on the front of the envelope that it is a 'gift card'.  Does Amazon really think the card would make it to the indended receipient with that on the outside?  So I had to find a different envelope, which was more work than I intended.
These Amazon gift cards did arrive quickly, but the free 1 day delivery actually took 2 full days to deliver. No big deal, I got my gift cards when I needed them and distributed the cards at a holiday party.Each card was supposed to have a personalized message for its intended recipient. These greeting cards, however, were all BLANK! While I did receive the itemized shipping invoice showing that each gift card had a different message printed on it, The actual cards were blank.I like many others who have reviewed this service over the years have had this same issue. If you intend to order any gift cards from ACI I would not rely on them to print the greeting card for you.
My message was not included in the greeting card for some reason so I decided to write my message. The glossy paper didn't absorb the ink from my pen and the whole thing became a mess. I had to run after a Thank You card and include the part of the card that had the gift card and instructions. I could not cut it nice and straight line so the whole thing looks like a lame excuse of a last minute present. I general I can't complain about Amazon, but this wasn't very helpful at all!
I selected the WEDDING design, but received a THANK YOU design. And also, even if the correct card design had been sent, it was all bent and wrinkled - not suitable for giving as a gift in my opinion. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to exchange/replace this, so I'll have to go to the store tomorrow and find a gift card holder type of card to replace.
I love Amazon and this won't change my shopping habits, but.... I spent half an hour trying to decide on just the right inscription for each of the seven cards purchased, and they arrived today....blank. The inscription showed on the confirmation and the invoice received with the cards but it was not on the cards. I will write them in the cards, but don't offer what you don't deliver.
I have purchased giftcards from Amazon before and have been happy in the past. This time however, my note to the recipient was not included so the person had no idea who sent them the giftcard.  She literally thought Amazon was &#34;just being nice&#34;. I spent the last month asking her if she got the card we sent for their new baby. So what should have been a straight forward gift to let the expecting couple know we were thinking of them became some aggravated stalking session and me thinking Amazon or FedEx screwed me out of my money. Thanks Amazon for making my easy peasy gift a pain in the rear.
This gift card is in US dollars, I live in the UK. I can't spend it at Amazon.co.uk. I will need to spend it on the US site, and half the value will be taken up in postage. Why can't Amazon let me spend it on my local site? So I'm going to save it until next Christmas, and then send it back to the US relative who sent it to me. A big fail as far as I'm concerned.
I did not like this item. It was not what I wanted and the website should have more pictures telling more about this product.
I made this purchase with time running out on Christmas shopping.  If I had realized I could not return them, I would not have bought them.  Now I have 3 gift cards I don't need.
Very disappointed that the gift messages that were to be on the cards were not there. All 3 cards were to have messages, but none did. Why offer this service if it's just going to be ignored?
I received my gift card, however the message that my brother and sister-in-law did not arrive.  They had taken a good deal of time to make the message fit given the limit on the characters, and it did not even make it with the accompanied card.  The gift card arrived quickly, but still that next step of getting the messages into the cards have been overlooked.Thanks for your time.
The first card sent out wasn't activated. I had to wait for a new one to come in the mail
First of all, its a gift card, so obviously it is going to work and the recipient will be able to buy wonderful things with it. With that being said, the card and envelope that the card is attached to came crumpled and folded. Also, dot waste your time writing the gift note, as its just a piece of paper thrown into the shipping packaging. Mine didn't even print fully; its half cut off.
So, it's hard to mess up on a gift card, but this says free one day shipping. I did not receive the gift cards for nearly a week. Fortunately, I had ordered ahead of time, but it could have been a disaster if I had ordered at the last minute.
Received this product on rainy day box was completely soaking wt and there was no protection on my card so that got damaged as well the only good thing is that the gift card is plastic other then that very poor delivery and packaging, please make sure if anyone orders don't let them leave it at front door
Everything was great except one HUGE thing:  there was nothing identifying that I sent the gift card!!!  So while my friend was quite happy to receive the gift card, he had NO idea who it was from!  I finally had to call and ask him if he ever got it!He is a frequent Amazon buyer and so am I .  He swears he looked all over the envelope and card and nothing!
This was purchased as a gift for my grandson.  When the package arrived it had been crumpled beyond belief and the card along with the plastic gift card were all bent......not real conducive to give as a gift.
I ordered  one $20 gift card and received it but the next day received another $20 gift card that I had not ordered but was charged another $20 for.
If you order one of these, find a way to confirm the greeting card actually gets sent with the gift card. The person I had this sent to did not receive the card and had no idea who sent it or why.
Giving this a poor rating not due to Amazon but it's shipper as the birthday card and gift card came all bent up, had to dump the card and try to flatten out the gift card before putting it in another card
I sent a gift card to my niece, and while it got there okay, the card said that it was from &#34;the finance department.&#34;  She had no idea it was from me..lucky she didn't just toss it out thinking it was a prank!!!  It took her mom to ask her if she got anything from us for her to figure out what happened.  Bah Humbug, Amazon!
Tracking stated it was left on front porch, the recipient of my gift card searched all over the area, could not be found. What are my options now?  I have been using my Amazon  account for many years, and up until this incident I have never had a problem. I won't say at this time if I will continue to use my account, i will wait to see how this issue is resolved.  Constance Tolle
There are several different gift card sellers on Amazon. I decided to go with this one because they advertised free 1-day shipping. The gift cards didn't arrive for over a week. This was very frustrating to me - I am a teacher and had planned to give these out to students as a reward for a job well done. It was very disappointing that I had to wait an extra week to do this. Had I known this would happen, I would have paid for expedited shipping through another seller.I'm giving it two stars because once they arrived, the gift cards were very nice, the cards that they came in were good quality etc.
I have this card and what i'm i to do with it. I would like to use it toward my next order is this possible?.
I get it... The shipping is free for next day which is normally amazing, but UPS has been notifying everyone of shipping delays for 2 weeks (and they still haven't figured it out) yet Amazon still has posted that the gift card should arrive next day.  I'm in no hurry really, but don't make empty promises when you know you're carrier is behind.Everyone else in anything that touches the retail industry usually prepares for the holidays, but apparently UPS didn't and now they're making the retailers look like liars.
I am still finding it difficult to see a plus in my account when I order books because I still seem to be getting charges on my American Express.
Easy to order, delivered on time, but ....The card and gift card came separately and the message in the card was missing.Fortunately, the family member to whom it was sent was not too embarrassed to ask if I sent something.
I ordered four gift cards.  This one was missing from my original order.  Amazon sent me a replacement for the missing card.  This one arrived in a bent/folded envelope and it was missing any personalized notes that I ordered from the original.  The original order had three gift cards come delivered but none included the personalized notes.  Sloppy work all the way around.
I ordered this gift card on December 3rd and asked for free one-day shipping, expecting it to be delivered the following day.  Instead, it arrived three days late because it was sent to the wrong shipping facility (500 miles from my home).  I contacted customer &#34;service&#34; to see if I could have another card sent, but they refused and told me to wait a few days and contact them if it didn't arrive by December 6th.It finally did arrive on December 7th (three days late) in a large envelope that could have been used to ship a book.  Does Amazon really need to use a giant envelope to ship a little gift card?  That is just a waste of paper.  Also, I wrote a message for the card that was not included in the card.  Instead, I received the gift card inside a blank card.  Don't give the option to write a personal message if it's not going to be used.I only ordered a gift card from Amazon because I thought it would be more personal than those generic gift cards you can get at any grocery or drug store, but after this experience I think I will just buy the card myself.
I wanted to send an amazon gift card in the $$ denomination of my choosing via email with a code for a friend's birthday. Instead, amazon only offers that ability via SNAIL MAIL. Seriously? in 2013? They need to fix this.
I guess the one day shipping for a gift card is false advertising?  we ordered one thinking it would be here in time for a birthday, but is coming 1 week later.  I am very disappointed and don't know if I would order this again.
