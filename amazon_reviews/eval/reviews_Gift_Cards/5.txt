Don is one of the greatest saxophonists I've ever known. I've played the sax with him, when he flew up here to Anchorage, and he really knows what he's doing. He pours his heart and soul into his music, and even when he  plays a simple half note, you can hear he's really thinking about it. He  rocks! He's 72 years old, and he's played for 64 years... since he was 8!  And he's one of the nicest guys around...
I bought this disc soon after its release in '98. Two gorgeous tracks, one by Marc Seales, piano and the other by bassist Doug Miller bring me back again and again. The highlight of the disc IMHO is After Letting Go by Doug. The rhythm section trio is called "New Stories" and is terribly under-recorded. So good to see the entire Origin Records catalog available including some new artists. To the discs, each of Origins productions I have are beautifully recorded. This particular one is my fav of latter day Pete Christlieb. On soprano Don Lanphere shows great restraint and supple melody. The two weave their lines well. Definitely highly recommended.
I bought a 3 month kit of xbox live to see if I liked it;however during the sign in, it said to enter a major credit card.
This kit is so cool.  you cuz at you enemies, and say what to do with you team mates.
Xbox and Xbox Live provide the optimal gaming experience for gamers of all ages. The ability to talk via the &amp;quot;communicator&amp;quot; in real time to you opponents is AMAZING and really adds the competition and friendliness of video gaming. Also, many games even support the real-time voices of up to 16 other players all at the same time, providing a diverse and immersive enviroment. Games like Amped 2, Links 2004, Project Gotham Racing 2, Rainbow Six 3, ESPN Football, Hockey, and Basketball are all unmatched on any other gaming console. While many of these games are also on PS2, they do not support voice while in online game play but the biggest factor is they all only support 1 on 1 play. On Xbox Live, you can have 8 vs 8 in games like Rainbow Six 3 or a 8 independent players in games like Amped 2. All playing independenly with NO Lag or Choppiness. If you have an Xbox and do not have Xbox Live, you have not even begun to experience what the xbox is really about. If you don'y have an Xbox, do yourself a favor and pick on up as soon as you can; with a new xbox, you get two free months of xbox live so you have nothing to lose at all.
This is tight you need to buy this if you have xbox and cable or dsl. I have the beat meaning i can play befor all you. i am also going to get the real thing to so ya. JUST BUY IT
The Xbox Live Starter Kit is right up there on the &quot;must haves&quot; list for any Xbox owner with Halo, Controller S, and Splinter Cell. If you are new to online gaming or a veteran from the realm of PC gaming, you are in for a whole new world of hurt!When developing Xbox Live, Microsoft payed attention to what gamers wanted down to a universal player list, lag free gameplay, and the freedom away from keyboards. Some people will complain about the keyboard deal, but honesty... when you are in the heat of combat in MechAssault or trying to school someone in NBA 2K3, you don't have the time to type. Plus, the voice chat is crystal clear and the headset fits comfortably in your ears.When getting the kit, there's a handful of games to accompany it currently and in the future. MechAssault and Unreal Championship are fan favorites along with Ghost Recon and the Sega Sports games. As for games coming out, most of them will have some form of online interaction from gameplay, downloadable content, to stat tracking. Seriously... when Capcom vs SNK 2 comes out not only will you get to play one of the most polished 2D fighting games ever, but play it online! Yup, for the first time we get to play people online in a fighting game. Only on Xbox. Only on Xbox Live.
I'm currently a Xbox Live beta test and I must say this has been an INCREDIBLE system so far. Xbox makes everything from hosting and joining games, to keeping track of your friends and their locations as easy as possible. Easily the best online system ever, and with its across-game features, it has the potential to top the PC in online gaming.
Hi,I started out as a beta tester.  I was concerned about the connection quality, since I live in Alaska.  We have lower than recommended broadband upload speeds (128K), plus I share the connection through a router/switch.  Anyway, all of my online games (NBA 2K3, NFL 2K3, Mech Assult, Moto GP, and NFL Fever 2003) play great online.  People are amazed they are playing someone from Alaska.  Human opponents add a truly new dimenson to the games.  The unpredictably and challenge that a human opponent offers is great, plus the ability of talking to them is even better.  I've learned all types of great gaming tips this way.  The XBox Live system allows you to keep your team rosters up to date, download extra levels, characters, and equipment depending upon the game.  The startup is very easy and I have never had to use any tech support to start playing games online.  I'm concerned that the people who give the poor reviews are diehard PS2 lovers.  XBox Live is really what sets apart the XBox from the PS2 and the Gamecube.  Sure the other systems have online capability, but at added cost and without a standardized connection process and security.  I hope this helps and my apologizies for the long review.
I'll say this before I start my review, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CREDIT CARD TO SUBSCRIBE TO XBOX LIVE. They need it so after one year, if you want to continue your subscription, they can take it out. It works out alot better this way, trust me. It's also very safe, Microsoft uses the same security as the government. Don't let this stop you from buying this product. And... YOU MUST HAVE BROADBAND! No dial-up connection. I LOVE this. People that use dial-up slow the games down, so the screen moves really,really slow and the game has ALOT of lag. Believe me, you'd rather have it this way.Ok. I know alot of you are wondering, &quot;What's the difference between version one,two and three?&quot; Well they're basically the same as the first, except version two has a free &quot;full&quot; copy of Tetris Worlds and version three has a free &quot;full&quot; copy of Mech Assault. I also know alot of you are wondering, &quot;Why is this incredibly smart young man using quotation marks when refering to the free games?&quot; Well, thank you. And the reasons for the quotation marks is because even though they're the complete games, they come in paper sleeves. You don't get the XBOX cases or manuals. I ALSO know (smart, ain't I?) you're wondering, &quot;But is it good man!?!???&quot; Why, yes it is. It's VERY good. Not only do the games rock harder than a fat kid on an ice cream truck, the use of the mic is amazing. Microsoft requires that EVERY XBOX Live game use the mic. Only about half of the PS2's games use the mic, so you have to buy a keyboard and type. During the game...Sometimes racing games...huh. The catalog of games the XBOX has for their online plan is alot better as well. And as for the price...ahh well that is something that has been argued by fanboys for many,many moons. When you buy the starter kit you get the mic and one free year of XBOX Live. After that year, you can choose to pay $50 a once for an additional year, or you can pay $6 a month, which adds up to $72 a year. There also is no charge for seperate games. So lets review. $50 for mic and one free year, an additional $50 for a one-year renewal. Now compare this to the PS2 online plan. $40 for the network adapter, and then the majority of the HUGE, must-have titles charge a seperate monthly fee. Games like Final Fantasy XI,Gran Turismo 4 and Resident Evil Outbreak are charging as much as $13 a month...each. And don't forget the mic. With Final Fantasy XI, you can use the mic, but since the game has been out in Japan for a year, 90% of the people online only speak Japanese. Gran Turismo 4 is definetly one of the most wanted PS2 games...but doesn't use the mic. A racing game...that doesn't use a mic. So you have to pause the game and type...on a racing game. Resident Evil Outbreak uses the mic...kinda. You play with three other people, but you can't hear their voice and they can't hear yours. You speak a command and the computer tells them what you chose. That sucks MAJORLY. Now I'm going to list games that are out, and are coming out, for XBOX Live. I'd tell you about each one, but there's just too many. I guarantee that each game that I type down is extremely good. Here they are.Black9BreedConker : Live and UncutCounter-StrikeCrimson SkiesDead Man's HandDead or Alive 4Dead or Alive OnlineDOOM 3ESPN NBA BasketballESPN NFL FootballFull Spectrum WarriorGhost ReconGhost Recon 2Ghost Recon : Island ThunderHalf-Life 2Halo 2Madden 2005Men of Valor : VietnamMidnight Club 2NBA Inside Drive 2004Ninja GaidenOperation FlashpointPerfect Dark ZeroProject Gotham Racing 2Rainbow Six 3Rainbow Six 4Return to Castle WolfensteinSoldier of Fortune 2Star Wars GalaxiesStar Wars Jedi Knights 3 : Jedi OutcastsStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2Tenchu : Return From DarknessThief 3Toejam and Earl 3Top SpinTrue Fantasy Live OnlineUnreal 2 : The AwakeningUnreal ChampionshipXIIIAnd that's not even all of them! Also, using the XBOX harddrive (which is already in your XBOX, no purchase required), you can download exclusive content to alot of games like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic and Splinter Cell. The content consists of new levels,weapons etc. I have a PS2 and I've tried their online plan. It out and out sucks. If you're looking for ultimate online gaming, XBOX Live is the best out there.Note to the fanboys : If you see a game on my list that makes you say &quot;WHAAAA???&quot;, go do your research before trashing my review.
To put it bluntly, Xbox live is the best internet gaming plan ever created. Some may whine about the cost, but after beta testing for weeks, I find this plan incredible.In a word, voice command is brilliant. As a long time gamer, I used to play PC games online. I would have to stop and write a message, then continue playing, all the while hoping I wouldnt lose my edge in the game. With Xbox live voice control there is no longer a worry. Just say what you want to say. If you are worried about your voice, you can use one of the voice masks avaliable, or create your own. On the downside of voice masking, sometimes I find it hard to understand some players when their voices are masked. If you really dont want to talk to anyone, mute your mic, and you can even turn off everyone elses voices. In cooperative online gaming, this voice communication will be invaluable. Not only hat, I have found it enjoyable to speak with people online and taunt them as well.The service itself is rock solid. With every game being required to include optimatch, friends, and the headset, you are guaranteed to enjoy every game you play online. I have only had Xbox Live for a short while, and already I have 5 or so friends from all around the country that I play with on a regualr basis. Anothe nice feature of Xbox Live is that you can always play with people who are of the same skill. This is made possible by a ranking system. If you want to create a game where only people of a certain skill can participate, you simply choose a rating, and you will immediatly have a game where you play against those of your skill level.While all of the features for Xbox live are nice, the real importance lies, of course, on the games. Luckily, there hasnt been a funner and more anticipated group og games then those coming out this holiday season which are prepared for Xbox live. With killer aps such as MechAssault, Unreal Championship, and Ghost Recon fulling using the service, fun is guaranteed.If you have a broadband sevice and an Xbox, you cant miss Xbox Live. Its to good. And I didnt even mention all of the excellent features for it, I only grazed them.
The Xbox may not be the best selling console yet, but of the people who own consoles, Xbox owners may be the most eligible candidates to create a strong online community.  The hardware in the Xbox include all the necessary components: hard drive for upgrades and memory cache, broadband adapter for connection and DVD drives for FMV and plenty of space.I received the Xbox Live Beta kit recently and let me say that this is for real, folks.  It comes with a perfectly engineered microphone headset that has a separate volume control and mute button that you connect to a controller.  Your headset only receives audio from other gamer's headsets so you can adjust the game sounds and music separately.Signing up was a breeze: punch in numbers and you are signed up for the next 12 months.  At the end of that term, you get to re-sign for the same rate ....  It took about ten minutes and then I was ready to go live...Three online demos were included: MotoGP, Whacked and NFL Fever 2003 (though only MotoGP and Whacked will be in the retail package)MotoGP is a lot of fun to play, hardly any lag and you can talk ... as you fly by someone on the course.  You can customize the soundtrack...but let me say it sure is hard to turn.  Whacked is kind of like a third person shooter with a very zany cast of characters.  It is a fun little game that seems to top out at four players online.  You can staple, freeze, mine, and blow up your opponents for frags or in the "combat" game mode, you collect stars from other players.NFL Fever 2003 probably is the least refined of the three, but is also the most ambitious scope that Sega began with the Dreamcast.  I played a few matches, two with single players, and one with three players hooked up to one console (one account holder and two of his guests).  Loading times were a bit excessive, running about two to three minutes.  But once in game, there were not too many problems.  I forsee people needing to be a little more picky when it comes to choosing low ping players in the same region.  There were multiple freezes where a "Congestion" type message popped up, especially during the match with three live players.  I got booted from two games and finished one.  Personally, I prefer Madden or NFL2K, but Fever didn't seem to suffer much in the way of its graphics being online.  Perhaps graphics need to be scaled down a touch for latency purposes.  But it was loads of fun to play a real person.  I'd imagine you'll be able to play 4 on 4 between two Xbox Live owners & 3 of their friends if the connection is solid.For [the price], the value is very good.  If you have the setup for it, broadband and an Xbox, with MechAssault, Unreal Championship and many more to come (approx 60% of future games will be Xbox Live), this is going to be the online package that everyone wants.
Xbox live is a great addition to the system, but only worthwhile if you have broadband internet access.  Dial-up just will not cut it.  However, if you have broadband, the combination of online play and additional downloadable content for Live games makes this investment well worth your time and money.
Let's be honest here. I own a Playstation 2 and an Xbox. I was first in line to buy the PS2 adaptor and an early beta tester for Xbox live. XBL is the most amazing service available. Sure, HALO 2 isn't available yet, but if you spent enough time on MotoGP to actually finish a track (which comes free with the XBL kit) you'll be addicted. Then you realize (unlike the PS2 online) there are many other INCREDIBLE games to play online. Unreal, MechAssault... Heck, you probably already own some of these because they're awesome single-player games.My point? Buy the X-box Live kit. Stop playing against a computer you know you can beat and start playing against the world.
There are few things that Microsoft does really well.  I expected xbl to have the typical Microsoft bugs and annoyances, boy was I wrong.  XBL is by far the greatest thing to happen to gaming in a long while.  An additional benefit, I can play with my friends across the country and talk to them for free.  If you get xbl, Ghost Reacon is the game to get.
If you have XBOX and High speed internet then you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't get xbox live.  I got the beta a couple of weeks ago, playing against people is much more fun than a computer.  Add to that you can humiliate a person, a computer doesn't care who wins.  The voice capability is also cool.  Here the people cry when you win or be heard call them cheaters when you loose.  This thing is sooo cool.  The other thing that is great.  EQUAL PLAYING GROUND.  No one has a super xbox (not like pc gaming) the playing ground is equal.Last but not least Microsoft is an American Company.  We invented gaming (ATARI=USA) let's take it back.Xbox Live will do that for the USA while razing your gaming expectations ten fold.
Hey everybody that is considering purchasing this or the PS2 online adapter should know that this one is defienty better.  I am a beta tester for the Xbox LIVE! which is due to go online on November 15th!  Xbox Live could have came out the same time that the PS2's network adapter did(or earlier) but Xbox took the trouble or creating a beta tester program so when the sysytem does go online EVERYTHING will run smothly!  From using the system over the past hew weeks I can tell you that it is the best thing since sliced bread!!  And come November 15th when more games are realesed for Xbox Live it is going to be even better!!!!  I will see you online !!!  :-)
Now let me put this into words for everyone who plans on buying it!!! Everyone else is saying it sucks and i got lags and stuff so let's straight this out. Xbox live is fun but you MUST have a broadband or cable connection. The reason people are complaining about lags are because they are going through dial-up. It is also $50 a year or $6 a month. You must also buy another cable that is sold seperatly. Now not all games are for xbox live! The game must have under the logo have an orange line saying live. That means it is online enabled. Some of my favs. are Mech Assault and Unreal Championship. Now if this review was helpful please take a moment of your time to click yes on the bottom so i know i helped. Thanks!!!
I purchased LIVE 3 days ago and have been playing UNREAL on the network.  I have been very impressed.  This system works very well.  I was initially skeptical, but am no longer so.  Addittionally, I live in Southern California, outside of LA, so I thought my cable internet connection would lag due to the number of users surrounding me, again I was worried for no reason.  This system is a winner.
if you have the following; xbox  -  broadband capabilities  -  the required dollar to buy  -  a working brain and mouth, then stop reading and buy.if you dont have any of the above get them sorted while i explain why you need a mouth and brain that work. YOU CAN PLAY AN EVER INCREASING CATALOGUE OF GAMES WITH PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD FROM YOUR HOME SPEAKING TO THEM AS IF THEY WERE THERE.... and more. as a stand alone product for your money you get the following. 2 fully live enabled demo games (moto gp and whacked) that are hardley demos trust! which ease you into the LIVE world perfectly, years subscription to the service it self and the coolest headset that any gamer will be proud to plug in. all this is worth about 200.....The brain and mouth you may ask, well simple you must be able to talk and have fun with retative strangers or you'll end up crying or shouting and someone you will never be able to hit.  if and when you do go LIVE play nice, your involved in a peice of gaming history
The Killer app for the X-Box.  I only wish it would work with Halo.  Otherwise MotoGP is great fun and I'm looking forward to Ghost Recon and others.  The Voice system works great too.
So far it looks like Microsoft has done a very good job with XBox Live. The starter kit gets you a disc that updates your XBox with Live capability and includes a couple of demo games. Frankly, the demo games aren't very exciting. I recommend picking up a new game (such as Unreal Championship or Mech Assault) when you purchase the starter kit. The kit also includes a headset for talking with other players (more on this later). Finally, your [money] gets you all this and a one year subscription to the service. After this, there is a monthly fee. Conveniently (ok, very annoyingly), when you go through the setup process, you enter your credt card information and accept an agreement that will auto-bill your credit card once the initial year passes. I would have preferred to have the option to automatically terminate the service, but why give the consumer what they might want? :)Once you get setup, fire up your favorite XBox Live enabled game and enjoy a relatively lag-free online gaming experience. I've primarily played Unreal Championship and have had no major lag issues and always had a great time playing. Talking to other players really adds a new dimension to gaming. People aren't too chatty just yet, but I've had generally good experiences talking to other gamers online. Interestingly, even though you can opt to mask your voice, most people don't.One final note.  The XBox Live site doesn't advise using a wireless network (technically, they aren't supported).  I've been using a wireless network exclusively and have had no problems, even while running Unreal servers hosting 5 or 6 players.So, if you want to take your XBox gaming to the next level, sign up for broadband service, grab the starter kit and enjoy!
Broadband users only. That's great, because that virtually gurantees no lag. If you pay for a second phone line, you're saving money anyway when you get broadband because you can use your phone at the same time anyway. It's SO worth it!This takes the Xbox over the top. It's more sophisticated and user friendly than Sony's decent online setup. You have buddy lists and the whole nine yards and one ID over everything you do.The headset is a nice bonus where you can talk to your opponent(s) in real time. Nice and clear most of the time.MS has a lot more familliarity with the world of onling gaming than Sony does. That experience shows with this product and the games that go with it. Xbox's online software is stronger and more varied than Sony's. You have MechAssault, Unreal, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, and all the Sega sports titles right off the bat.All Xbox owners need to get this!
If you have a high-speed internet connection and an XBOX I would recommend the live kit.  I only have Mech Assault and Ghost Recon, (LIVE games) so far but the two are a lot of fun on the LIVE! system.  It is cool to be able to play with a few other people and have to see things in split screen.  I think my next purchase maybe NBA 2K3.  If Microsoft keeps expanding the system like they promised this will be very promissing.  Sometime you may want to mute people for the foul language but you can still enjoy the game experience on the live system.
I am a veteran to the Xbox Live gaming world and know much about it. Many people are doing a lot of complaining on the many different factors of X Box Live which is highly ridiculous. X Box Live succeeds past Sony's network adaptor because it is a better service, just because you have to pay 50$ a year for X Box Live doesn't mean you don't get your moneys worth. X Box Live offers very little lag because it is Ethernet(Broad band) only you usually get a lot of lag using Sony's network adaptor because it allows you to use dial-up, even if you are using broad band you get a lot of lag if you are facing a person who is using dial up. Also X Box live offers a gamer tag which is an ID Sony offers temporary gamer tags which you must make up a new nickname every time you use the network adaptor after you stop playing the online game, X Box also lets you keep track of your friends with your friends list you can see what game they are playing and invite them to play. Sony only has a headset that works with only with Socom so far, X Box has a wide array of online games that have voice chat. X Box has a built in Ethernet port you don't need to go out and buy one and X Box has a HDD to store downloadable content. Many people complain about the price 50$ a year if you can't afford that price that is to me ridiculous you wouldn't offer a service that is costly for free to a total stranger it takes man power to run these Xbox live servers not hopes and dreams many people work hard to control the internet traffic that Xbox live costumers generate. Many people say that in the future online games will come out in which you have to pay that is unlikely to happen for the following reason MICROSOFT MAKES CONTRACTS WITH GAME COMPANIES SO THAT THEY DO NOT CHARGE MONTHLY FEES MICROSOFT PAYS WITH NOT ONLY THERE MONEY BUT WITH THE MONEY WE PAY AS x BOX LIVE SUBSCRIBERS. In my opinion Xbox Live succeeds over the PS2's network adaptor as well as Nintendo's online plan in which you have to pay per month per game. X Box Live is great, get it if you're a serious gamer.
DOES IT WORK FOR DIRECTWAY 400K
the xbox live starter kit it is good and usuable you can talk to people while playing against them it is the best.
Strategise with your team or trashtalk to your enemies... BY MICROPHONE!  For all that don't own this and play online games and chat by typing, THIS BLOWS IT AWAY!  I just can't say how great this is... if you own an X-Box, this is the ONLY way to play!  I couldn't even imagine not playing with my microphone...  Wow...
I am a beta tester, and also a parent.  Yes, the xbox does require a...per year subscription and a credit card number that can be used to download additional stuff.  However, there are PARENTAL CONTROLS that can block access to purchases without a parental password - you can't complain about that.As far as the...subscription is concerned, the xbox live comes with a very comfortable newly designed headset.  This price is the same price I would pay for a single game for the xbox.  My family has gotten more than our...worth of enjoyment from it, and I have only had mine for about three months.From all I have seen so far, the product is reliable, the help desk is quickly available in case you have a question, and Microsoft is doing a tremendous job of making this new innovative tool for the xbox a reliable and entertaining gadget.
I have both the PS2 adapter and the xbox live beta kit. I can tell you that i love my PS2 but it has been collecting dust since i received my beta kit from microsoft. The network is pretty solid and the play is mostly smooth. If you have an xbox and broadband service pre order this now. If you do not have a xbox or broadband service order them both NOW! This has completly changed the way you will game. As for the PS2 version of online play. I will just say that I am VERY VERY VERY happy with Xbox Live. I so into xbox live and only have 3 games and played it for over 200 hours now........GO GET IT.....see ya online come find me and I will do my best to whoop ya at nfl fever 2003....gamertag is JC23
Great use of voice over IP combined with online gaming.  There is no delay.  It's as if you were sitting on the phone talking to someone you're playing against.Although the headset package is not necessary, it adds to the gaming experience.
The requirement of broadband for Xbox Live might cut out a few people that might otherwise enjoy it, but if you have broadband access and have an Xbox - you really should get this.  I'm one of the beta testers, and I have to say it was surprisingly easy to get set up and going.  Playing against others and talking to them is quite fun - the buddy list system is awesome, you can invite folks to play a game if they're online.  You can also have one screen name that works across all titles - so once you sign up, you have that screen name in every game you play.Go out and get this when it's released.  You won't be disappointed.
if you have an xbox you better get live.  I was a beta tester since september.  I don't buy games unless they are line enabled.  For the price of a game for a full year, you are crazy if you don't get it.  The talking over the mic sounds great.  Better than a cell phone.  Buy live, Unreal, and Ghost Recon and you will be hooked.
This has to be one of the best things developed for console gaming.  The set up was easy and I love the ability to download content when it is available.  The first year is free but I think it is worth the yearly fee once the free period is over.I am stationed overseas and have played NFL Fever 2003 over Xbox Live with some people in the states with no problems at all in lagging.  The gameplay was as if I was playing by myself.  The voice isn't great but voice over IP has never been great.Now we just need more Xbox Live enabled games on the market.
Well I owned my Xbox for a couple of months before I bought Live and it has increased my enjoyment of the system a lot.  While Xbox has great graphics and is very fast, the choice of games can be a bit lacking.  The real advantage of Xbox has proven to be the Live service.The setup is easy and the price is right ...with the disc and headset.  I have experienced very few problems with the service.  There is the occasional lag, but that is to be expected with online gaming.If there is a warning to be given, it has to do with interacting with others online.  Anyone who has ever played online computer games or even used a chat room knows that the anonymity of the internet allows people to act however they wish.  And certain people tend to act like jerks.  The majority of the people you'll deal with will be polite and friendly, but then there's others.  Those who'll drop out of a game as soon as they start to lose and some will harass other players just for fun.This doesn't come close to ruining the service, but it's something to be kept in mind.
I bought one of these older xbox live starter kits hesitant that it wouldn't work for my xbox 360 since it was so old. I found it for cheap, only like $20.00 and it said it included a 12 month subscription and headset so how could i go wrong. I got it and i got everything i wanted and the subscription code worked on my xbox 360 even though it was from 2003. Awesome deal seeing as a 12 month card alone goes for $50.P.S. The xbox headset is sooooo much better than the 360 original headset minus the no volume control part.
This is by far the most amazing system ever.  That Takes a lot for me to say this.  But Live pushed it beyond the normal systems.  I currently only own mechassault, which is amazing online. There is no lag and the game play is so vivid.  I can only wait for more money to flow my way, that way I can get Unreal and Ghost Recon.  Thankfully Christmas is coming.
Ok, the starter kit is only $[amount] and it gives you a year of service-that enough is worth $[amount]-it also gives you the headset to talk to your foes or allies-very interesting actually-and the starter kit also come with a demo disc of like 2 or 3 demos including MOTO GP.  Setup is long and has many blanks to fill in, but it took about 20 min. or less, and it is sort of a hassle to try to type in all the stuff with a controller, but down to the good stuff.I have 3 Live games: Unreal Championship, NBA 2K3, NFL FEVER 2003Live is so much fun- there are always people to play against you, and there are many options to choose from. There's optimatch, friends, quickmatch, voice masking and many other things to choose from.  The only drawback is the broadband-I have had broadband since it started (DSL), and it is awesome.  As we know from gamespy and XBConnect (xbox tunnel services) FPS and other games require a high amout of bandwidth! I wont lie to you, but sometimes-not very much- there is a bit of lag.  Not really bad lag like Gamespy, but a quick little rip.  Maybe one little rip in about every 3 min or so.  Its not bad at all.  I just wanted you to know because the other reviews on here are saying "THERE'S NO LAG AT ALL" that not true at all.  NBA 2K3 is the bomb for basketball fans. Unreal Championship is for FPS fans, and NFL FEVER 2003, well its for everyone.Summary:Pros1) features galore2) friends service3) rare lag problems4) broadband excepted only5) voice6) one free year of gamingCons1) lack of headset use (some people dont talk when your playing)OverallGet this!!! This is a must have for Xbox Owners! You will enjoy it!Think u can beat me? gamertag: Wright Bros
Live is incredible. MS is constantly updating ther servers and beefing up their connections (as well as implementing the BETA tester's requests, which we are all happy to see MS is playing a VERY active role in getting Live to be the best experience for gamers), but most importantly they designed this from the ground up alongside with gamers themselves to ensure a top-notch, intuitive system. The system works right off of the xbox dashboard (not in BETA kits though), so there isn't too much guesswork involved, simply create an account, sign in and you're done! Once signed in you'll have access to: Online Scoreboards, Friends lists, voice communications with voice masking features, virtually no lag online gaming, content downloads, and game updates to name some of the strong points of the service. A definate buy if you're always looking for some friendly multiplayer or fierce competition worldwide. Games that support Live are already in the shelves with many more great ones in the works. Enjoy! :)
Like the other guys here I'm also a betatester for XBox Live since early September. I haven't spent much time on games since the days on the Commodore 64 and the Amiga, but when I got the XBOX it was like being taken back to those days of fun. Now with the Live service I've found a brand new level of entertainment and made a few new friends already. XBOX Live allows you to create your own gamertag list where you can save you friends gamertags (your unique ID on the network) and see if they're online or not. If they are you can invite them to your session even if they're playing a different game at the time. Of course you can also block people so they don't see you, and, a feature that not many people know, you can kick players out of your session (it can be useful if someone misbehaves). The Communicator allows you to talk to the other players to exchange strategies or just have a good laugh, and you can decide if the other player can hear you or not. This headset is one of those you wear behind your head, not one of the most comfortable headsets I've used, but not too bad either. The microphone instead is pretty nice, it gives you a flight controller look. The quality of the audio is really high, usually I feel like the people I'm talking to are in the room with me. Another great asset of XBOX Live (and thanks to the console's own hard disk) is that you can download upgrades to the games, so if for examples new levels of a game come up they can be downloaded straight into your XBOX. Right now we are betatesting four games but many more will be available once it goes public (Nov. 15th) and since it's been confirmed that Halo2 will support XBOX Live it goes untold that that alone is a good reason to get it. Only drawback is that you need to have a broadband connection, but thinking again that's not a drawback as it provides for better sound quality and higher gaming speed avoiding lags as much as possible. Few of the titles designed for Live are:NFL Fever 2003, Project Ego (title might change), Unreal Championship, XIII, Counterstrike, Whacked (one of the betatesters games, I love this one), Dominion, Phantasy Star, Ghost Recon, Mechassault... wow, there's so many, and you can bet that most games from now on will support the online capabilities of the Xbox. Ah, another interesting feature is that you can copy your account data in a memory card and bring it over to your friends' so if they don't have an account you can use yours at their place. One more feature: as you play you get something like a network score for your games which practically tells the network how good you are, and if you like you can do an Optimatch and have the computer assign you to games played by people as good (or as bad) as you.
I have been a Beta tester for the last 4 weeks.  I have to say, Microsoft has really gone the extra mile with this online gaming service.  Although I initially had no intention of using the voice communicator, (basically because I felt like a total geek) the dynamic that voice in game adds is immeasurable in value.  The Moto GP demo that LIVE will ship with is addictive and a blast!  Connection to my DSL could not have been easier (plugged an ethernet cable in the Xbox, and the Xbox detected and set up the connection with no hassles), and the game lobby where you meet co-players and make new long distance friends has been great!  This is the best $50.00 you could spend if you are a gamer.  Yes, its that good (and this is just the Beta experience!).
Well, I've played Halo 2 with my friend and he has Xbox Live, and I have to tell you it's the best thing you can buy. It's so much fun talking with your teammates and strategizing, Personally I think it's a nescessity if you like playing Halo 2 with a lot of people. I mean you can play for hours and it will never get boring, I'm suuuperr excited that I'm gonna get Halo2 and Xbox Live for X-Mas, and I suggest anyone who has Halo2 to get it. This is a great product. :)
10/30/02 - I've been a beta tester for about a week now.  The experience thus far has been fantastic.  If you have a broadband connection and an Xbox, this is a must have subscription.  I'm very impressed with the voice sound quality of the other players as it's almost as clear as a telephone.  The disguised voices are a little annoying, but to each his own.  I've not experienced any lag associated with the MS servers, but occasionally a contestant will fall off due to their own connection issues.  After all, with or without broadband the internet can still be a bit fussy.The only issue I've had is that since I don't have a router other family memebers can't surf the net or check email with the PC while I'm playing XBL.  There is a list of certified routers on the xbox web site.  You will need to purchase a router if this is an issue you can't live with.  Another solution is to have your ISP provide you with 2 IP addresses and use a cheap hub, but Roadrunner charges $10 extra per month for an extra IP address so for my dollar the router is the best solution.Here's how it works.  When you purchase the starter kit you are subscibing for a year.  However, when you activate your account you will still need a credit card because MS wants to automatically renew your subscription after one year.  Also, MS needs a credit card on file in case you want to purchase any of the proposed &quot;premium content&quot;.  If you're concerned about your kids purchasing content without your consent you can block that feature, but you still have to submit a valid credit card.MS is monitoring behavior on the site and there are strict rules of conduct.  Users have the ability to post feedback about each other and MS has promised to ban or restrict users who break the rules.  There is no guarantee that your kids won't hear a few &quot;f-bombs&quot; and other colorful language from frustrated losers, but if they are reported enough they will be asked to tone it down.  You also have the option to mute any player you find particularly obnoxious.Look me up when you get on!  My Xbox Live usertag is Ekim Namtort.
I am a beta tester and I got the kit only yesterday but I played it ALOT. MotoGP isn't that great online because personally I don't like Moto racing. Whacked can be fun, but difficult. NFL Fever 2003 is the best online I have played yet. The voice communicator works great, and there was only one case where I could barely hear the person talking. The voice masking is great, but it doesn't save your options for the games so u have to remember after you turn xbox off and back on, the voice masking will be set to off. I have had no glitches yet except in Fever it paused for about 5 seconds and said NETWORK CONGESTION...That only happened once or twice and only when starting a game of Fever up. I can't wait for Unreal Championship!
All you get inside the package is a mic for your gamepad, and an xbox live update disc. You put the disc in and it automatically updates itself in the xbox menu. From there (Make sure your connected to the internet first) you create your account, create your username, password, etc, and then you're ready to go. Start with any xbox game thats compatible with XBOX LIVE (I recommend Mechassualt and/or Ghost Recon) and go to multiplayer for some xbox live action. And I must say, this is the best multiplayer experience ever. You not only talk to one person but you talk to the entire group. Talk back, make fun of, taunt, do anything that makes you happy. With a cable or a DSL modem, it gives you a good clear connection to the game. No skipping and no freezing. Xbox Live is a great experience to any gamer. And whats great about it is that you automatically get a free year subscription (But the down part is that you have to pay a monthly fee afterwards). Buy this, and have fun.
For many years now, hard core gamers alike have either been able to play other's online (those on PC) and those that couldn't.  Those that couldn't owned a console, and we have never seen a console (besides the DC a few years ago) go online; and for that matter, go online to the capabilities of what PC gamers can.  Well, that's going to change now, as GC and PS2 owners will experience it...in a few ways.  But for those of us with an XBOX, we will be able to experience it to the MAX, and at the level, or even perhaps higher, than the PC gamers.  All this is possible through a little thing called XBOX Live!XBOX Live is something u hook on to your XBOX that lets you play hundreds, thousands, even hundreds of thousands of other XBOX gamers around the world through a high-speed internet connection (broadband).  It keeps your stats, rankings, and you can even have a buddy list.  Here are the basics of why you HAVE to get XBOX Live, and what makes it sooooooooo AWSOME!!!1. The System Itself: XBOX Live allows u to do many things.  You can download new content to dozens of games, including things like rosters, costumes, new equipment, new game levels, and just about anything else u can imagine (perhaps DEMOS???).  You can have a buddy list so you are playing with people you WANT to play with, it keeps your stats and rankings.  Ever counsidered being the #1 ranked NBA 2K3 player in the world?  Or wan't to know how many people's toosh you've kicked in victory (wins), or see your win percentage?  XBOX Live keeps track of it all.  And to top it all off, it comes with a headset, standard with every Starter Kit.  This lets u talk strategy with your teammates in a game like Ghost Recon, or talk trash to your opponants.  It's very creative, and the sound comes through crystal clear!Finding someone u can play with: The thing about XBOX Live is that you can find people who are at YOUR level of gameplay, or find a real challenge.  This means u won't be facing 8 year olds every 2 or 3 games, as you can easily find people at YOUR skill level.  The same goes the other way if your new to a game, and don't want to play veterans at the game.2) Games: Right now, there are less than 10, but within a few months, there should be a TON more!!! Microsoft announced that there are already 60 games in developent for XBOX Live.  So within a few weeks, even months, there should be several games that suite your taste.  As for the ones out now, easily AAA titles.  Here are 3:A) MechAssualt: Work as a team of 4 to fight incredible odds of computer Mechs, or take on another team of 4.  Will you be victorious?  With all kinds of power ups and abilities (turn invisble, fly, rockets, machine guns) during gameplay, and stunning graphics, with huge destructable envirements (bring buildings crashing down on YOUR oppenants), this game is top notch.  Even wanted a few 40-foot, massive ton Mechs for you and your friends?  These babies are built for destruction, and there are dozens of games to play with them!B) Unreal Championship: This fast-paced, non-stop action game will keep you coming back for more!  With dozens of games, gorgeous graphics, and dozens of people and teams able to participate in any game, this is sure to be a game people will be playing for a long time on Live.  Can u say Super-human warriors kicking toosh all over the place?C) 2K3 series: Right now, 2K3 (by SEGA) sports games are for hockey, basketball, and of course, our beloved sport, football.  These games are top-notch, and take a ton of skill to compete in.  Are you ready for some...football, basketball, or maybe a little ice?  *lol*4) Getting Live: Shouldn't be a problem, as it supports dozens of companies, and sometimes DSL.  I myself am getting TIME WARNER, and it's working just fine!  Just go to xbox.com to find out what you'll need, but take it from me, it shouldn't be very hard.Overall, I'd reccomend XBOX Live to any gamer; hardcore or not.  The fun, competitiveness, and the ability to play HUGE games with friends is just too good to miss.  That, and trying to build a reputation, (that all fear) and play people all across the country, and soon the world, LIVE will bring gamers from all over the place into gaming envierments, working together in a fun fun way!  Take it from me, it's a HUGE BLAST!!!  No real LAG problems either.Well, that's everything, and don't miss-out, XBOX Live is the wave of the future.  We knew (us console gamers) it was only a matter of time before we'd catch up to our PC counterparts!Thx!
I am a beta tester, and I would like to tell everyone that this is really great. The connections are great, the games are great and you can update your rosters and download new items for games.
This thing is FUN!!!!!!!  I've only played Mech Assault (Which I HIGHLY recommend!) so far using LIVE.  If this game is any sign of things to come on Xbox LIVE, then video games are about to be revolutionized to the extreme!  It's especially fun to play your close friends online and really talk some trash into the headset!... :)
I would have given this 10 stars if the rating system went that high.  I haven't been able to put the controller down since I bought the kit.  The only problem I have had with Xbox Live is that all my old games that aren't online enabled are now collecting dust from not being used - Yes, including &quot;HALO&quot;
It worked right out of the box (okay, you have to give Bill everything but your soul to register) and the connection was great. The headset/mic is fine. For the price, it includes access to all games for a full year, though don't think all Xbox games are available for Live. In particular, the Live football game is poor and Halo isn't yet supported, though Halo 2 will be, and that'll be out in the spring. Anyway, if you have broadband (only), it's worth it.
After reading some of the reviews of Xbox Live (like the guy who thinks the Xbox has a modem - it's an ethernet adapter - and the guy who is mad because he can't connect at HIS college, even though all he has to do is spoof a registered computer's MAC address) I felt it necessary to chime in.Xbox live works nearly perfectly. I have MechAssault, Splinter Cell, and various other Live games, and it's of incredible value. MechAssault is VERY fun online, although don't use the headset if you're easily offended. There are a lot of stupid kids on Live!, so their language reflects their maturity.At any rate, I have a connection (shared T1) that maxes out at around 120k/s. This is typically slower than most cable and DSL connections, but I've experienced no lag whatsoever.The voice communications is really great, and is probably the aspect of Live! that makes it stand out among the competition. That, and the fact that all Live! games are hosted on Microsoft's servers, and will therefore be uniform in their speed and security. (Unlike PS2 or Gamecube, which will be painful to play because of lag, or, even worse, cheaters.)If you have an Xbox... GET XBOX LIVE. 50 bucks for a year is pretty darn cheap, especially since you get the headset with your starter kit.
This is the best fun I've had playing video games in years... Any time of the night or day, for as little or as long as you want, you can jump into a game against someone else who could be almost anywhere in the world. First time on, I played Moto GP (comes with the kit) against a woman from London and a guy in California. My son spent hours late Saturday night on MechAssault-- easily jumping into four on four games. Took all of six minutes to set up Xbox Live; the communicator turns out to be the coolest thing ever-- hard core players take charge of forming up teams, giving advice, etc. making it easy to keep up. And let's face it-- after you get past a moment of awkwardness, there's just no beating the comments and quirks of playing real gamers.This is online done well-- Quickmatch gets into you a game in seconds (good for MechAssault, Moto GP, Unreal). Optimatch lets you tailor the game you want (best for NFL Fever or the Sega NFL, NBA, NHL games, and Ghost Recon; also good for specialty set ups on any game). Friends List means you can always hook up with someone you know, or keep in touch with players you find on the service and enjoy playing.New content is coming too- updated player stats on the sposts games, new mechs, levels and games for MecAssault...
Of the two consoles currently participating in online gaming, microsoft has done a much better job than sony in my view. I was a beta tester for xbox and have played on ps2 online. As a beta tester for xbox live I found out quickly that this is one of the greatest things that has happened to the gaming system. For 50 bucks this kit is well worth the price. Not only does it include the headset (which fits well and works great) but it also includes a whole year subscription to xbox live. You can also mute and adjust the volume on the communicator. For the price of a single game this is a great deal!
Hey, i am part of the Xbox Live Beta Team since august when i was selected, i hvae played Ps2's online via their modem also, i have found that , no offense, i like the xbox live version better. It's The REAL DEAl,with all those features.
Xbox live is amazing.  Zero lag in many games that I've played (Whacked, MotoGP, Ghost Recon, Mech Assault).  Some lag in NFL 2K3 but sometimes no lag even in that game.  Across game invites, friends, the voice, just amazing.  Everyone running the same hardware is something never seen in the PC world.  The only titles I'm buying from now on MUST support Xbox live.
Xbox Live is the absolute best online gaming I have ever experienced, it is the most fun too!Sure you need a broadband connection but that is so that every gamer is playing a game at the same speed as others that also means no lag (lag slows all players down, it also makes them unhappy).To get on Xbox Live you need to buy this Starter Kit, it comes with an awesome headset and One Whole Year of Xbox online gaming.You also need an Ethernet cable, you can buy those at different lengths (be sure to pick one up in the Electronics store, they don't cost very much). The Ehternet cable plugs into the back of your Xbox and you can then plug it into a Hub connected to a broadband connection or maybe where you PC is plugged in (that's what I do). When I first got Xbox Live I was a little confused about this so I hope that it might have helped.In a couple of words XBOX live is the most fun I have had in al long time. It is enjoyable talking to other players and if someone is annoying you can mute that person.Xbox Live is great, be sure to get an Xbox live ready game like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and I'll see you on the battlefield.
I was selected as beta tester, and so i have no problems with the headset. SO i wold recommed this to any one who has a xbox.
I do.Because I can.And I will.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.So.You Should.Play.NFL Fever.2004.On.Xbox Live.Today.Oh yeah!!!!!Its the bomb and I love playing other xbox live games too and yeah so buy this online xbox and sports and gamer freaks...!
XBOX Live surprised me.  I love it.  I actually use the voice system alot, and it is a blast! Rock on.
Xbox Live is the best thing I have ever bought. I spent hours and hours and hours over the summer playing Unreal Championship. No two games are alike, you always meet new people and have fun talking. I love my Xbox Live. The best part is when people trash talk you and then you go and whoop them. I always win at Bombing Run in Unreal Championship. People think they are all that and I shoot them with rockets. I've also played Rainbow 6 3. That game rocks. Even though I've played in almost 1000 games in Unreal Championship, I'm still not bored. And then when Halo 2 comes out in April, everyone is going to play it. I reccomend getting Xbox Live just for Halo 2. All the days I spent killing my friends at Halo are going to pay off when I beat total strangers from all around the world. Xbox Live is a must have for all Xbox owners. There is always a game going on. You never go on and have absoutely no games going on. I think the best part is the voice communicator. I spent hours talking to people in Canada and Britan for only 50$ a year. If I was talking on the phone, imagine how high the bill would be. Unlimited gaming, unlimited voice chat, tons of great games...all this for 50$ a year...definitely worth it.
LEt me just say this is the coolest thing ever.  If u have an xbox a must have.  SO far ive played moto gp, whacked, fever, nk3, ect.  They rule.  I cant wait till MEchAssualt and Unreal Championship.
The sender was very fast and kind enough to include instructions on how to properly view the code as it has given many people problems in the past. I had no troubles what so ever. Many thanks
This was a great buy at the time, helped me out greatly and i would recommend if still available to buy.
Should rate this low because Target sent me a points card not 3mo XBOX Live for XMAS...Some are the real kits though with no points card....Be carefull
I ordered this like 2 years ago and whats in the description is what i got.
Honestly, I don't care about using the webcam that came with this pack, but it's still the best deal I could find, besides some ones where I was put on indefinite 'back order' for a kit without a webcam.This is an easy and convenient pack that will give you a year of online play, a headset, a webcam, and some 'xbox live marketplace' points and a couple free (if cheesy) old arcade games.It ships free with the 'super saver shipping' and arrives fairly quickly. I got mine and am waiting until HALO 3 releases before I activate my account.
Not much to say about this product. It provided me with another year of Xbox Live. It worked as expected.
Xbox 360 live.  What else can you say?  Try it and decide for yourself...
The XBOX 360 Live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their Live account, even if you do have the headset. The card itself is $50, and the points, bonus game, and $20 dollars off a new game (limited time offer) easily helps to make your money back. Even if they didn't include the rebate, it would still be less than buying these parts separate. In fact, it's almost like you're getting a headset for free!So, like I said, if you need live, buy.Also, this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at Best Buy. I checked, and he was mistaking the card for the kit.
I guess this is a good buy, especially when Corporate Vice President and Chief XNA Architect of Microsoft says so.  I just thought it was interesting when J Allard gave a review of this product on Amazon.com
If you have an Xbox 360 and you already have Xbox Live, then you know how much of a necessity it is. Microsoft has put together an amazing online community! I've had no problems so far. Your games will become even better when you can take them online. Under $60 a year for this great service is awesome. It's very affordable and you won't be able to live without it!
This is the KIT not just a card.  A previous review indicated that bestbuy.com was selling this for $49.99. That is not correct.  They are selling the CARD for $49.99.  This kit comes with the card plus several other components, thus making it $20 more.  You may find this kit cheaper elsewhere, but not significantly.  It does what it intends to do.
Works, not much of a kit though, a lot of stuff was expired but I bought it knowing that. I just wanted the Live Card.
Excellent item, very easy to install. Peel the sticket and enter the code it's that easy.
No.  This is not a game.  However, it does let you play actual games online.  Pretty sexy, if you ask me.  Which you did.  Good for you.
It costs more to sign up on Xbox Live than use this card online. It's a great deal and you can get free stuff in the kit when buying the card here. Thumbs up on this one... :)
This was a GREAT DEAL, with fast shipping.  With this card you can play ONLINE with up to 32 players at once.
I didn't think that paying for Xbox live was worth it since the playstation3 has the same thing for free but this is so much better than the PS3 online experience
I play gears of war 2 and without playing online it wouldn't be as fun. If you have an Xbox 360 then having xbox live is a must have. It is worth the [...] dollars for a full 13 months!
XBL is great and it's really cheap when bought on Amazon! Well worth the money and recommend anyone thinking about hooking up with XBL to do so!
This product is really awesome!!! Activating the code of XBox Live is really easy, and you don't have to make a big effort to find friends online. I have used it to play Halo 3 on multiplayer mode, and I have passed a lot of hours playing it.
I certainly don't like to pay to play with other people, but XBOX live and the people at Microsoft have to jump on the bandwagon and make sure that the gaming industry turns into a bunch of money-whores.If you want to save some money and you know that you're going to play a lot of games like I do, then you will want to invest in a 12 month membership. You get an extra month, so they really should just call it a 13 month membership and stop being douchebags and calling it a 12 month plus 1 month free membership. You can get it cheaper off of Amazon so I definitely recommend you just order ahead and save with the wait--unless you just happen to have enough money to just pay full price. Even when it is not on sale you will save money over Microsoft's price. Strange how Amazon does that...
I purchases a 13 month subscription to XBOX Live about a month ago, and I love it. If you know you are going to have your XBOX for a good long time, this is a very sound investment. Make this purchase today.
Get it and stop reading this. Why you may be asking? Well remember in the past when you would finish a game and then there was nothing else to do in the game well now there is: Show what you've learned all those hours by playing the AI alone, online with other people which makes the game a longer funner experience. Oh did I also mention that you can play virtually all the 360 games demos before buying. Chat, send messages download movies you name it. See you online!
good product.bought it 10 dollars off plus one month free cant beat that.Must have if you need to renew your xbox live.
This X-box live 13 month membership was a really great price. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a great deal.
If you have xbox 360, you're missing out if you don't have xbox live. Most games have it where you can play against other people online through xbox live. [...].
the product itself was fine i mean it's xbox live, clearly i knew what i was getting.But it took for freakin EVER to get it even shipped. I don't understand how one stupid card could take like a week and a half to receive.
You get off so much cheaper buying the long term cards, and at that the discounts on Amazon rock.  This is totally the way to get XBL.
We also have a PS3 and so don't quite understand why Xbox charges a monthly fee (or gets away with it).  I've seen nothing in XBox Gold I could live without, but for thirty eight and change for 13 months, it was worth a test drive.  Yet to be seen whether or not it will be renewed.  (This is in no way a PS3 vs. Xbox argument overall - just finished Halo 3 and loved every second of it!)  My card came quickly and I did not have to scratch anything on it to get the code.
I hear people that don't have 360's complain that the online portion should be free like the PS3's. I have both a 360 and a PS3, and paying less than [...] a month for a smooth, polished, fast online console experience is well worth it. Nearly every 360 game has free demo's, and the online experience for games is fantastic. Netflix streaming makes this a fantastic bargain. I wish Sony would take my money and make a polished online experience where you can download more than 1 demo a month. Don't get me wrong, the PS3 hardware is much better than the 360, but the online experience is nowhere close.
The product is very nice but I have had delivery problems: delay, the product was lost and the product delivered was the wrong one and had to be replaced.
This is probably one of the best things that Microsoft has ever come out with. I just recently enabled it on my Xbox 360, and it has been great. The online gaming es exceptional (especially for Call of Duty 4). I have also downloaded several demos, and enjoyed playing them thoroughly.I would recommend this to anyone who owns a 360 and any Live games.
not much one can say about this product, it allows you to be able to play your xbox games online, which is great.
Microsoft wants $49.99 for 12 months of xbox live... Amazon wants $43.99 for 13 months.  You tell me who has the better deal.
The price is great, but becarful when scratching off the back. It's very easy to scratch the numbers and make the code unreadable.
I ordered this item (12 month Gold XBox Live membership) little worried, because some had reported they scratched off the code when trying to reveal it. Not only it was not an issue, for it was, I am assuming, I newer card, where you do not need to scratch anything, but I've got one month extra too. The card was sealed in a hard-plastic wrap that needed to be cut-open by scissors. The code was printed on the back of the card, no scratching necessary. The face of the card reads: 12 + 1 Bonus Month. That gives me 13 months of Gold membership for about $3.39 a month; that's almost $13 saved in total over the standard 12-month card if buying locally (do not forget the tax! :-)
With this you can play 1 YEAR! for nothing.... (45$) nothing! buy it..Comprenla, un ano de juego con el XBOX 360 por casi 45$, no es nada de verdad para todos los ratos de distraccion que tendras!
The best deal your gonna find! Amazon ships it fast and free from tax! Best deal to buy if you use Live a lot. Comes with the bonus month and is the cheapest in the long run. Recommend to those who play on Live a lot.
This is a good deal. Save about 11 [..]. just have to wait a few days for it to ship.
Card was delivered quickly and included an extra free month.  XBox live definitely is the way to go if you have an Xbox 360.
Great price from amazon, it has the 12 month subscription to xbox live gold plus one month free. So for a good price you are getting 13 months of xbox live gold.
The same card is $50.00 + tax at walmart and target. Nothing more needs to be said! I have a few issues with Xbox Live, but that is between me and microsoft. While microsoft has its issues, its the only game in town. So if you want to play Xbox Live, and you really don't have a choice, you might as well pay the least to play. What it all boils down to is Amazon sells these card for less that everybody else!
This card was shipped to me from Lexington, KY on 6/10/08. The packaging was different from the picture for this item. It's now a brighter orange and it's reading "12 + 1 Bonus Month Gold Subscription" on the background paper. The card itself is silver and it has two logos on it: "Games for Windows (R)" and XBOX 360 under a big orange "LIVE" in the center. The card is made of cardboard and instead of scratching the silver coating, you need to tear a perforated part of the card to reveal the code underneath. Pretty easy and safe and no scratching off the code as some people have complained. I guess they have realized that people were having problems with scratching cards and that's the reason for a design change. I entered the code in [...] and got 13 months of XBOX Live so the bonus month works as well.
This is by far the cheapest and easiest was to buy live.  first off if you don't have live you are seriously missing out, and second if you buy a subscription from any where else you are a fool. the price per month of live with this is just under three dollars compared to 8 dollars a month if you buy a monthly renewal subscription from microsoft.  it seems like a no brainer but i'll let you be the judge.
The XBox 360 card is exactly what I needed.  My better half got a 360 as a present (from me) and when the trial ended - we needed a bonus card.  As other reviewers have stated this is the least expensive option if you want to get a subscription.I'd actually recc. you buy this the same time as the 360 so you don't have any downtime in waiting for the card to arrive.  Amazon shipped fast - it was just my delay in placing the order.
No complaints here - this is a great deal when compared to what Microsoft charges when you purchase via your XBox's marketplace.
Well, it's kinda hard to review something like this because you really can't go wrong. You just enter the code and boom...you're online for 13 months. Xbox Live is awesome, it brings gaming to another level. I usually prefer to game online and play against real people as opposed to computer. Amazon usually sells this cheaper than other places. To me it's a "must have" for Xbox gamers.
What A great price! I have told all my friends on Xbox Live about this deal. I think I am going to buy another just to have when my subscription runs out in 13 months. This is a must have for any gamer.
i don't know how i went so long without an xbox live membership. you know when a great game gets EVEN better when you play it with your friends or others, the whole multiplayer thing? well this is exactly what the xbox live membership does with your xbox! plus this was on special so i could not resist. downloading demos and stuff is great fun but all the games you've played and never tried them online, now is the time. it actually extends the replay value of your game and most of the time its a completely different world than any single player campaign in any game.
I bought this card from Amazon for 10 dollars less than I have seen it anywhere else.
Well this thing was pretty cool because it was basically 13 months for the price of 12 months. The best thing about it is that Amazon usually has good deals on this thing, i got it for under 40 so it was way better than getting xbox live through microsoft.
Xbox Live is Microsoft's online service for the Xbox 360.  While Sony provides this online servuce for free at the moment for the Playstation 3, Micorsoft has put a MSRP of $49.99 on their online service.  Though recently, retialers have been discounting these cards $10-20 off so keep your eyes open for a good deal.Xbox Live's main function is that it allows you to play the games you bought online, if the feature is included.  For instance if you bought Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the single player campaign is only 6-8 hours long.  Pretty short for a game that is costing you $60.  With Xbox Live, you can now play that game against people all over the world for 100s of hours if you like.  In essence, Live can extend the life of a game pretty dramatically.Another cool feature is the access to Microsoft's Marketplace.  Here you can buy Xbox Live Arcade games like Bejeweled, download demos of games released or soon to be released for free, rent/buy movies, buy DLC content for you games, etc.Also Live has a ton of community features like Facebook, Last.fm, Twitter, friend list and voice chat.  Voice chat is great because while playing a game, you can talk to your friend without having to use your cellphone minutes.  You do not even need to be playing the same game to chat which is great.  Just pick your friend out from friend list and start chatting.While Live is great, there is a major problem that parents should know.  Every game played online has voice chat enabled.  This can lead to some players being complete jerks where they will use foul, vile language that is not suitable for kids.  I guess some players find it funny to talk like sailors, but it can get very offensive.  Now I play mostly Mature rated games so I assume this is not a problem for kid games, but it is an issue that parents need to know.  Always be sure to check the ESRB ratings found in front of games before buying.Live is a great feature that is definitely worth paying for so keep your eyes open for when retailers like Amazon have these cards on sale.  See you online.
So you're looking at a 12+1 month Xbox Live subscription card on Amazon, and if it's still the same price as when I purchased it ($40), you might be a bit skeptical on the authenticity of this offer.I'm going to dispel that thought. With standard shipping, it arrived much sooner than I expected (wasn't more than 3 days), and it arrived in it's original plastic packaging. Just open it up, punch in the code on the card, and there's your 13 months of Xbox Live.
So, it's 12+1 months of XBox Live. You play online? You need this. Good price, but less than a day after I bought it from Amazon I found it for $10 less. Too bad. Hadn't even shipped but Amazon wouldn't let me cancel it, even though I had ordered it on Sunday 5am and tried to cancel it on Sunday at 7pm.Still, this a product review not a store review.The product is great. Worked great. Love the extra month included. Much MUCH cheaper than paying monthy through XBL, and a better deal than buying a whole year on XBL as well.
Xbox Live offers a ton of content and online gaming for a very low price.  It has it's flaws like any online gaming service, but for the money it cannot be beat.
It's a gift card basically.  Go into your xBox account, type in the numbers and get a confirmation.  Very easy.
There's really no way around it. If you really want to fully enjoy the Xbox you have to get the Xbox live gold version. It turns out to not be very expensive, but it is a bit irritating that Microsoft continually nickels and dimes the heck out of everyone. It's pretty complicated to set up and join Xbox live so be prepared to spend some time doing it. First you have to set up an MSN email account which you can do on your computer. Then you go to your Xbox and begin the lengthy process of "joining" Xbox live. You have to type in a lot of information and then there's an update to download which takes a few hours. Downloads on this unit are pretty darn slow, but that's my biggest complaint so far. Otherwise it's a pretty impressive system that integrates computer access to the itnernet.
This was a good price with free shipping.  It gives you 13 months of xbox live gold membership which is a wise thing to have if you own an xbox.
You are not going to find a lower price anywhere for 13 months of Xbox Live, not even from Microsoft.  Great value, you wont regret this purchase.
13 Months of Xbox Live for the Xbox 360. Perfect for any gamer with an Xbox 360 looking for some online competition in their favorite games.  Also needed for the "Instant Streaming" from Netflix. *Must have Netflix Account to Use*
IF you can get this for less than $30.00, the sometimes sale price, buy them up.  Everyone with an XBOX should maximise their use of it with online play.  Otherwise, what are you using it for?
Thanks to amazon for this great deal and specially for the serious business relationship they offered feel secured when dealing with amazon I can testify by saying that my card got lost in the mail and I just called them and with no hassles they sent me a new one wow I was shocked !! thanks a lot !!!!
If you want to play with your Xbox360 online, you need to upgrade your free silver Xbox Live account to a gold account.  One way to do it is to enter your credit card information into your Xbox, but that has caused some people problems.  I've always bought physical cards, because it provides a level of security and allows me to keep my decision to renew up to me.All in all, I'm happy with my decision to go online with my 360.
Worked exactly as it was suposed to and saved me money off the cost of renewing directly though xbox live - what's not to like?
You can get it at any electronic/game store, but its cheaper here and you get a month free.  Also cheaper than just signing up with microsoft.
I found this online new for much cheaper than what retail stores sell it for.  I also recommend that this is much better than buying it from xbox live marketplace because not only is it cheaper, but you get an extra month with the card.I used the free shipping not expecting to get it till after Christmas, but it came 2 days prior anyway, which was a total surprise.  A few days later I punched in the code and it was accepted and now I have 13 months of live gold again!
Everybody need's to have a XBOX 360 live card. It's the only way to enjoythe true enjoyment of playing games.
Easy enough to type in the code and activate another 12 months of Xbox Live.  Can't go wrong with the bonus one month as well.
When I entered the code it gave me an extra year and a month.... What more can be said in a review about this other than I got the extra time on live and it worked! :)
Its a xbox live subscription, the amount of fun you have with it depends on what games you have and how you choose to use your membership.
Like most of the other reviews,  I'll just say this is exactly what you expect it to be,  Xbox live Gold for 12 months and a free month. Glad to get the extra month, and it only takes a couple days for Amazon to deliver it with free shipping.
I enjoy playing online with friends on XBox Live. If you have a 360, and your friends do as well, YOU MUST GET THIS! A whole world of people play 360. A MUST GET! I got mine free from [...]
Microsoft will charge you $50 a year if you use the auto renew feature through the Dashboard. So for $35 + free shipping this is a great deal! Stop getting ripped off by MS and buy these 12 month subscription cards while they are cheap!
You save five bucks on this as opposed to buying it through your x-box or at a local retailer. Can't complain!
This card is always cheaper than paying per month directly with Microsoft, and can be substantially cheaper if you get it on sale. Amazon sold it for just under $30 a few weeks ago, with free shipping.Xbox Live is a well developed service that's reliable, has many features, and is well worth the price.Note that Xbox Live silver is free- the big selling point of Gold is online multilayer gaming, there are some other features. But online gaming is a major component of many 360 games, so a gold subscription is worth the price.
If your like me, and you get bored once you play through a game. Even if you can earn some special skills and re-use em through the game; You still get bored. You want something that is constantly different and changing.Well Xboxlive is for you then. You get four zones to choose from. Recreation, Pro, Family, and Underground. So you can choose what type of player you want to be; and the category you will be in so your matched up against the same type player. It's all very user friendly.It's very easy to setup up. All very straight forward, all you need is a broadband connection. I have a 3meg down and 384k up connection(Although I only seem to get 2 meg down). (Boo windstream j/k) anyways, seems to work fine for the most part. Of course latency can be an issue, but this all depends on your ISP.Well worth the money. Also if your going to get this, you may as well get a router. Make sure you get one that is Xboxlive compliant, so you can plug and go, with no NAT problems.I have a router that is not friendly toward my Xbox360/live and causes some difficulties with the NAT no matter what I do. so to keep from having to switch your broadband connection back and fourth between your PC and Xbox 360 (It gets old) and you have no NAT problems, get an xboxlive compliant router. (There seems to be a lot, probably find a good deal here on amazon)
My subscription was about up for my live account and I saw this great deal on Amazon. Quick ship and now I'm ready to go for another 13 months. I've been with Live since the day it started and this is the best price I've received so far!!!
This is by far the cheapest 13 month sub to Xbox live, if you buy it off of your XBOX it's $50 for 12 months. I had found it for $40 from Costco for 13 months, but it would have to be shipped and if you don't get free shipping that will bring the price back up.  I have had an Xbox live account through Xbox for over 3 years and I told them I didn't want to renew this year because of seeing it cheaper elsewhere and they didn't care. Told me there were leaving my credit card on file in case I changed my mind. I got a little unhappy at that and demanded they remove my credit card from their file, I didn't need their help in reminding me of renewal in that way.  Bottom line, as long as Amazon keeps the price low they will always have my business!!!
A must have when you want to reach out and whoop up on someone on the XBox.
I would highly recommend this product to any Xbox Live gamer.  I have used them twice and it was flawless and fast.  I did the regular shipping and received in 2-3 days.  Best deal out there that I've found!
This is obviously the best bargain out there for a Live subscription. The only negatives I read about in these reviews was that shipping was slow and that to get at your subscription number you need to scratch off a coating which in turn can scratch off the actual subscription number as well.I received my card in two days, and MS has changed the card so that you now simply peel off the cover to your subscription number. No problems, no hassles. This is an easy decision to purchase.
This is the best price I could find for 13 months of LIVE service. Can't complain when others are paying more by buying directly through Microsoft.
When I shared the info about the price of these cards, I got a lot of static. They did not believe how great the deal was. They said "Oh'well they must be stolen or it will not work." However, I bet someone fifty bucks it would and they backed down and would not take the bet. Good thing I won.. Super Deal I am a penny pincher and find cheaper deals always on Amazon or E-bay. This was a graet deal... $42.00 with shipping.
Now this's a gpu!!! sure, it ain't a 9850gtx, but this card's a real performer. runs cool, an' overclocks nicely. (6800gt or better speeds).An' coupled with a 2.66/512/533 Northwood, Asus p4sd, an' 4x512mb mushkin enhanced performance ddr400, this card'll run circles around most OEM (hp, dell, compaq, Acer, etc.) machines. Get this, an' y'all'll be glad ya' did.(drop in a 3.2ghz northwood (3.2/512/800), an' it'll outperform the better oem machines.) This's a great GPU!!!(7600gt is better, but if y'all ain't got the $109+ t' spend fer a 7600gt, y'all cain't beat this fer a agp system.)
Well, it is a year subscription to the best gaming service in the world, it is certainly worth the $50...that is really all i can say. If you have a 360 and you don't have LIVE you are really missing out.
What else is there to say except that I accept? An extra month of Xbox Live Gold for free? Yes please!
The card came within 5 buiness days and all I had to do was peel off a peice of cardboard on the back to reveal the number. (i did not have to have a stupid penny to scratch off a number)Everything is awesome and xbox live live RULESAmazing Price on AMAZON  very vey worth it
I read all the reviews out there about these cards being faulty and the code being obscured when scratching off the card, so I was a little worried when I bought this that I might have the same problem.  After opening the incredibly annoying blister pack, I was relieved to see that the card NO LONGER REQUIRES SCRATCHING!  You just need to peel back perforated cover.  No more worries about ruining the code and being out $$$.  I bought my card at $30.  What a great deal.
I am new on xbox live, I played sometime in the PSN, but I don't like the PS3 and the PSN sucks when you compare it to Xbox live, believe me.This is the best gaming experience, you will find a lot of people online anytime.I bought this card from Amazon because it was the cheapest option and I don't live in USA, so I can't sign in with credit card. Everything is working fine. The card arrived in good package (too much plastic for a card!!) and the code worked fine (no scratch needed, just tear a part of the card)In my opinion, the card is a waste of time and money, the code can be send by email or other online option. Micro$oft should be reading all the suggestions and start thinking how to send the codes by email.
this is a great deal..you get the card for ten dollars cheaper than best buy or any other store and you get a free month..so in all you get 13 months for 40bucks.again great deal!!!!!!!!!!!!
Xbox Live is a great service, and its very fairly priced especially if you buy it for a year.  I would much rather pay for a service and have it work nicely than get a free online service which is laggy.
First, the price for this card was cheaper on Amazon compared to Walmart, Target, etc. Go Amazon!Second, you can get one month free as a trial as soon as you get your Xbox console. So, if you get an Xbox, use your free month before using this card and you end up with 14 months for the price of 12!
more fun then u could imagine. logging on and partying up with people from all over the nation to dust n00bs couldnt b better then with live!! seriously recommended for ne1 who isnt on live yet
What more is there to say about XBox Live?  Frag your friends, make new ones, play games online, and download demos and content exclusive to Live members.  Never leave home without one.  OK, well maybe that's pushing it, but it's a must have for any 360 owners.
I am adding this review to say - when we received the XBOX LIVE card there was no sratching involved, the code was visible. Also one reviewer said the card expired in a couple months - ours will expire in 18 months so we have no complaints. Seems like a great deal to me. It's 13 months as others have mentioned.
At the time it was the lowest price I could find on the net. Purchase was easy and received product on time. No complaints
Best price anywhere - code works fine.Amazon.com is the best for gaming gear.
If you can get this for under $49.99 then it is a great value.  You can't find this on sale much in the local store.  It is a better value than renewing online since you get the extra month free with the card code (13 months for the price of 12).  Make sure you put the code in online a little before your current subscription expires so that it will become effective on the day your subscription expires.  Great Value!!
13 months for less than the normal 12 month subscription.  My account was in suspension so I had to call up to get it activated and got 1,000 free xbox 360 points.
I purchased this card knowing that it's a 12 month gold access card. When I received the card and it's stamped with the 12 month gold logo.After I entered the keys and activated it, the membership read 12 + 1 month gold access. So there you go, you get a free month from Microsoft.
Xbox live has a lot of good games, they often run sales too.  These points won't go to waste if you get this.
This is a great value and one of the cheapest i can find.  will probably be buying from Amazon again if it stays this cheap.  item arrived quickly and had no issues.
Bought the subscription and adapter for my boyfriend as part of his Xmas gift and, I'll be honest, sometimes I do regret it lol.  At least I can hop on the computer, play with psp, or read a book while he's taking over the television haha.  It makes him happy and it was a great deal so that's always a plus!
Very good, had no problems got exactly what was promised. Would recomend and buy from them again.
If you buy this in the store or direct from Microsoft, it's normally $50 for a 12 month membership. By ordering here you get the extra month for a cheaper price. Seriously. Why would you go to the store?And as anyone who has an xbox360 knows, having a gold Live membership really amps up the experience. You get to play against friends and people across the world. Pretty cool stuff, my friends.
This is exactly the same as buying this through microsoft, except cheaper. Arrived in a (semi) timely fashion and ahs worked flawlessly for me since I've had it. The only difference between this and buying it online through microsoft is the extra cash in my pocket.
you dont know from where to buy a registeration key for xbox360? get this one, specially when i bought it and there was no registeration available for xbox360 for middle east. and also you get 1 month free so it is 13 month total.
If you have an Xbox 360 you need to have LIVE. Even if you are a casual gamer. LIVE brings so much more to your gaming experience. With the new Xbox experience update coming out in November and the ability to stream movies from Netflix on your TV, XboxLIVE will truly make your 360 the center piece of your home entertainment system.
A years worth of joy, plus a bonus month. A must have if you want to stay connected.
Xbox live is the best online service to date of any of the major systems. (Sorry playstation, I love you but you still have a few kinks to work out.) The service is well worth the $40 annual price-tag you can find on the internet ($50 retail I think) Playing your games online against other people adds such an incredible new dimension to your games and gaming experience, especially with games like the Call of Duty series and Halo.  Don't miss out!
it was a fair price with the extra month .... it was a good buy now the kid won't bother me.
This is for the xbox 360 xbox live Gold card.  Amazon had it for a reasonable price and was fast getting it to me.  I always trust Amazon for getting what I need.
If you want to have the best time playing xbox360 you gotta have one of these, best buy ever
This card is a full $10 cheaper for an annual XBox Live membership than if you buy direct from Microsoft. Plus you get one extra month, and you don't have to give your credit card number to Microsoft.Only downside is that the card arrived with less than 2 months left for me to activate. Also the membership is nonrefundable.
With the price that i got it for, i knew i couldn't pass up on the 13 months. For $35 thats equivalent to approx. $3 a month! I couldn't have made a better investment it was totally worth it!
Once you factor in the free month, you save about $10.00 over ordering directly on xbox live. ($44.00 with free shipping and 13 months compared to $49.99 on Live for 12 months.) Couldn't be easier to update, just enter the code on the back of the card and your done. Note: Microsoft seems to have fixed the code rubbing off problem some earlier reviewers were having. There is nothing to rub off.  Code is  printed on back of card. The only drawback I can see is if you renew on xbox live your account in updated instantly. If you order from amazon you have to wait until your card arrives to update your account so plan accordingly and order early, you'll save $$$$$ and get an extra month.
No complaints, started playing online about 10-15min after received the card. Easy to follow steps and the number on card was visible, the card is not a scratch off, you just remove a piece of it, and the number is there for you to use. Don't need to put your credit card information out there in Xbox World.
Being a member of the online community that is XBOX Live is an absolute necessity for all 360 owners.
I've been on live since day one, my kids love it and I love it, this is just too much fun.For those of you who don't know what this is, this membership allows you to play online against other people, you can add players to your friends list or if you have friends with a live account, you can add them too. This will make your gaming experience that much better since there's no A.I. that compares or even comes close to playing against real people.For those of you who have a Netflix account, now you can stream a good number of movies directly to your Xbox 360 and watch them on TV.If you like competitive gaming, this is a must have!
It is really great to be online on xbox live I love playing games with other people all over the world
ooooh, now i can have a life filled with putton pressing and go cross-eyedin the comfort of my own home, all while never knowing the warm company of a lithe, nubile female. and, with a tempting set of special attractions, such as a discounted price and an extra free month, who could possibly have the ball to say no?! THANK YOU, GODS OF THE SACRED VIRGINITY!!!
I purchases this card about 3 weeks ago. I was worried after reading a few reviews that the numbers would scratch off and I would be stuck with a 38.99 piece of plastic that I could scrape my windshield with if is snowed. The card came sealed in plastic packaging, that darn super plastic stuff, but at least I knew it was brand new and not used. The code on the back is revealed by tearing off a small strip so there is not a chance of eliminating one of the numbers. I entered in the code and it accepted it right away. I merely had to sign out of Xbox live and back in to credit the account.I would definitely recommend this card to anyone interested in Xbox Live or XBL as most say it. It is discounted plus it has a free month included. If you bought it from Microsofts Xbox website it would cost you 49.99 and not include the free month. This card comes out to 3 dollars a month. That deal is hard to beat.
Xbox live is a great service that no one with an Xbox 360 should go without.  IMO, its pointless to own an Xbox 360 if you can't play online because most games today put a heavy emphasis on online play.  As for buying the service, I would recommend buying it on Amazon instead of handing over your credit card number and buying it over Xbox live.  Depending on what type of deal you get on Amazon, it will always be cheaper and it is the safer method of purchase.  I paid $42, which translates to $3.50 a month.  To me that is a great deal.
Easily the best choice for any xbox live members.It give you a free month with, and it is cheaper than having to renew it every couple months.
since everyone pretty much listed the pro's and con's of this product i just want to warn you that be aware of who you are buying from on here for this product.  for example, the newly launched seller XBLIVE is selling this for the cheapest price of $39.99 and in his comments he states that he will "EMAIL" the code on the back to you upon receipt of payment...heres a couple problems with this: for one, he charges $4.49 for shipping (wtf, how can you charge nearly $5 for an email, because he wont send you the product he will just email you the product code from the back for you to enter in) emails are free buddy! secondly, he is a newly/recently launched seller with no feedback i would be very cautious with buying from someone who doesn't have feedback or ratings.  thirdly, beware of the other sellers here to they mark there product down tons and then charge you crazy shipping like $8 for something that simply as thick as a piece of paper...thats BS! and last but not least, if you pay more the $40.00 after tax and shipping for this then please hit me up because i can tell you where to get it for $40.00 out the door (and no i dont work for best buy, gamestop, gamecrazy, target, walmart and etc) im in the military and im just a concerned buyer like the rest
I am a die hard Xbox 360 fan.  I play an average of 20 hours a week.  And that is mostly weekend time.  I also work 40 hours a week and cook dinner every night for my wife.  So I'm not just some kid that stays home and plays video games all the time.  Amazon, like usual has the best prices anywhere.  Especially for the Gold Card subscription.  You get one month free so it's even a better deal.  And don't listen to the people that gave it a one star review because they scratched to hard and rubbed off the numbers.  On the card I received, it had a pull tab that was easy to use and I was clearly able to read the numbers without scratching anything off.  So until someone beats this price, which I doubt, I'm always going to renew my subscription by buying it from Amazon.
Product recieved in a timely manner and in the condition as expected.  The time cost benefits of buying through Amazon greately out weigh buying direct from Microsoft.
Xbox Live Gold is one of the greatest things to ever grace the online gaming scene. You won't find a better deal then 12+1 months for less than $40. That's close to $3 a month for unlimited online gaming and access to demos and Xbox Live Gold content/features before anyone with Silver access. Another reason I bought this is to get access to my Netflix Instant Play movie collection, which with the Xbox are played straight to your console onto your television for a flawless and a more natural viewing experience than it would ever be on your PC.
If you don't mind waiting for a few days (shipping) then this is a way better deal than buying a membership from the XBOX LIVE marketplace. [......]
I was stoked about this 10 bucks of. yeah its rad but i have to wait at least two weekes to get it. If your a non gamer than its no big deal. But im a gamer who playes almost every day, and im trying to scroung up 2 day cards from friends to stay alive. so dont buy if you need it right away.. if you do. you might as well buy it full price cause thats what shipping will cost.
This is the best price on a great service.  People complain that Live costs too much, but for less than $4 a month, I can't see any reason why anyone with an Xbox does not play online.
On a whim, I decided to look on Amazon for this, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was a few dollars cheaper on Amazon.  Granted, I would need to wait for it to arrive in the mail, but since Microsoft gives a one-month advance warning before one's Xbox Live membership expires, that was not an issue.
This gold membership is great. It gives you 13 months of xbox live and it's cheaper to buy it from amazon than from a retail store. You save about 8-10 bucks.
I, personally, am not a big fan of online gaming. It has nothing to do with the games themselves, it's just not my cup of tea. I'm the kind of person who, if a game has sub-par single player game play but excellent online multi-player, it will be a rental for me at best. If it weren't for the Xbox Live marketplace, my console would not even be connected to my home network. So you can imagine that someone like myself would be the last person to get a Gold account.I have a Gold account, and I enjoy every minute of it.In the old days, before Microsoft spruced up the user-interface of their console with the NXE update, I would have avoided gold membership, but nowadays Gold status comes with considerable benefits even if you never play a game online once. Here are some of the highlights.-Download game demos and other content a week in advance of silver members.-Weekly discounts on Marketplace content and Gold-exclusive promotions.And my favorite.-Instant access to your Netflix "watch it now" queue. Watch Netflix on your TV.Microsoft has been doing really good for sweetening the Gold membership deal for those customers who aren't online gaming enthusiasts. This, plus the increasing popularity of single-player add-on content downloads makes me excited to be an Xbox Live member.Now where's my "Broken Steel"! :)
Finally a price drop for xbox live subscription cards. Would have been better if they offered this for free, like the other consoles but Xbox live rocks! Cheaper would be better, although very worth it....
Xbox live service is a must is you are going to have a Xbox360 me and wife cannot live without it the only problem is that the illustration of the card shows that is the card for 12 month + 1 free month and the card that i received was only for 12 months only no free month.
Got this for $29 back in January when it was on sale. Very cheap, and does what it does for a little more than half the cost. They should have sales more often, since stores usually follow the same route. (i.e Bestbuy did the same thing)I would definitely still recommend the current price, since that's still cheaper than most stores and from Microsoft. But if you are usually patient, then you can nab deals from here or elsewhere.
This is a great deal for anyone wanting to use a Gold subscription. This is cheaper than any retail store and ships free! The Netflix support is very nice too since I have that as well.
Great price for this item, alot cheaper than stores. And you get an extra month. Would definately buy this again through Amazon.
