Xbox live is probably one of the sole reasons to purchase the Xbox at all.  Up until the Xbox and PS2, PC gaming was where the fun was to be had...I enjoyed playing games of DOOM and such across my local area network.With the introduction of Xbox Live - the gaming consoles are finally in a position to take over, and I hope they do - with faster load times.In any case, I was happy to find out that the XBox live communicator works with system link play when playing with friends through a network router!  An unadvertised benefit!  The communicator's voice scrambling feature doesn't work so hot, however.  You have to talk slowly and pronounce your words well.I have also had some difficulty inviting friends to play games with me.  They are met with the error - session is no longer available.  Once you are already playing a game, however, I don't notice any lag time.  So far, so good.If you would like more information on system link play through a router, please check out the linksys 4 port router that I wrote a review on...
Hear ye, hear ye!  Or, hear me, hear me, because that is the primary drive and function of Xbox LIVE! (or XBL for short.)  Instead of the usual "3y3 R l33t3R +|-|3|\| j00!!!!!~~" scrolling across your PC screen, you may verbally talk your smack and let your voice be heard by the competition, in real time.Likely a lot of PC gamer converts have already experienced some level of voice chat using Roger Wilco or a similar device, but this one really takes the cake.  The headset itself is comfortable, the controls are insanely easy and the clarity is comparable to a good cell-phone.  People tend to break up when everyone speaks at once, but generally it's extremely clear.  Set up is easy, and the Xbox sets most of its own requirements and IP codes.  If you have your own nets and IP however, advanced options allow you to code all that in yourself.  The beauty of the system is that the setup is such that you don't need a degree in Comp Sci to set up for XBL.  Just take your broadband cable and stick it in the back... and bang, you're done.  The disc will take you step by step through the set up process.  With all the accessories I've owned over the years, I can honestly say this was one of the most painless installations ever.A brief note to those who've read other reviews: As of this writing, XBL *does* accept debit cards.  It accepted mine; I decided to try it before I did anything else, and it went through perfectly.  I simply set my option to "VISA" and it worked.That's the good.  Now the bad.1) I do *not* currently know how billing is handled.  I would be wary before committing to buying anything on line.  I already downloaded the new Splinter Cell mission, Kola Cell and I'm eagerly awaiting my copy of MechAssault to play Capture the Flag, but on the flip side, "Phantasy Star Online" requires $8.95/month past the first two months.2) There's not a lot of content yet.  This year's E3 should change all of that drastically, including announcements for HALO 2, downloadable content for Brute Force, and so on.  Unreal Championship is only worth playing online, and they've already released a patch for it.  If you want to play football online, though, this is the system to own.Ultimately, Xbox is forging new ground and doing things with a console that have never been done before.  If you want to take your Black & Green goodness online, do not hesitate to get this accessory.  If you want lots of crazy content as soon as you pick it up, wait until the Q3/Christmas season for the next generation of online games.~DEM
I got it all hooked up on my xbox, tried some games and my headset wouldnt work. so i read the manual again, and noticed it say a green light shoould be on, and it wasnt. I had it plugged into my nyko controller that has a fan in it(great controller everyone should have). then i tried it in my xbox controller, it worked in that.after looking at both controllers i realized that it wouldnt go in all the way with my nyko controller, so i got my tools out and cut some pieces off the top of controller, it works great now.so if anyone cant get it to work with a aftermarket controller, you might want to see if its fitting in all the way
XBox live would get a 5-star from me if it weren't from the people on it.  Basically, if you're a female and you talk (which of course ya do--there's headsets for that), then you get accosted by the mindless hormone driven morons that play XBox.  So far, everytime I've played I was enjoying a great game until I was harassed by these cretins.So, if you're a chick, you may want to either not get it, or not talk.  I doubt a lot of these guys have ever talked to a girl before--it gets real ugly real quick.
I am a beta tester, so I am not speculatiing how things are going to go but actually know! Xbox Live ads a new demension to gaming. There are still some quirks that are being worked out, but that is to be expected with any new item such as this.Parents...if you are buing this for a child please beware that some people are ignorant and use foul language quite a bit. I'm sure as this product is released for public use this problem will be more profound. The only way not to have your children (or even you!) hear this is to unplug the headset.I would deff. reccommend this! For some reason there isn't much advertising out for it right now, but that doesn't mean its not good!XBOX kicks booty :- )
I am a beta tester for xbox live and i would recomend the xbox live service ecspecially if you like sports games. The service had some problems in the beginning but its has become alot better as of late...it's worth [it] in my opinion.
tHIS KIT IS A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR XBOX. sOME OF THE REASONS WHY ARE THE FACT THAT XBOX LIVE DOESN'T LAG MUCH BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT DOES BUT NOT TO THE POINT WHERE IT EFFECTS GAME PLAY. ALSO EVERY XBOX LIVE GAME SUPPORTS THE HEAD SET(ONLY SOCOM ON PS2 HAS ANY OTHER KIND OF HEAD SET AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE SQUARE BUTTON TO TALK.) I KNOW PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE FEES AND STUFF  BUT IT IS JUST A WAY TO MAKE MONEY (THE REAL REASON ONLNE PLAY ON THE CONSOLES NEVER CAME ABOUT UNTILL THE DREAM CAST)SO INSTEAD OF LOSING some money microsoft did what they do charge people for a service. look at it this way if you sold a game not nessecary a great game but you want some cash to spend on a rainy day should you give it away or sell it? most people would sell it,and so would i. Now i hope people on their STUPID PLAY STATION 2 WOULD REALLIZE THE FACT BROAD BAND GAMING WILL TAKE OVER (EVEN ON THE PLAY STATION TWO) SO PAY THE STUPID 30 BUCKS AND GET BROAD BAND INTERNET ACESS AND THEN GET GET A XBOX THEN THE STARTER KIT AND PLAY THE BEST ONLINE CONSOLE GAMING PERIOD!
I was a beta tester. I have been playing online for about 2 months. I have had a overall good experience. some on my games(MechAssault,Unreal,Ghost Recon,NFL fever 03)  have had lag, most of it was in NFL. But i have had an overall good experience with the system. On other problem i have is it has kicked me out of a session.
THis is a great package especially if you want to play games online. You can create a game and play it online right from your xbox. ALso the mic is great. However, if you dont feel like spending 50 dollars on this kit, you can play all the multiplayer games plus more games such as halo which is not supported by live, for free using gamespy arcade. however you must have a router or hub in order to do this. If you are looking for something very easy to use and dont mind spending 50 dollars, this is by far very good. I personally feel that this is worth it mainly because in order to use gamespy, you must be at your computer, and it is very annoying to have to run between your xbox and your computer.
I got it on the first official day. It took me about 20 minutes to get the thing configured -- you have to supply quite a lot of information, including a credit card. (The card will automatically be charged at the end of the year period for whatever the going rate is then.)The demo games were so-so at best. Whacked is mindless. MotoGT is better, but really doesn't turn my crank. The Communicator is nice, though.I bought Unreal Championship and got online with that rather easily. Unfortunately, I got bumped off the network about a half dozen times.Currently, the online game selection is rather small. I would seriously recommend waiting until after the holidays (or at least a month) to get this, so that the bugs are worked out, and so there is a better game selection.
Granted there are a few problems with X-Box Live! one of which being it's poor support of some routers. I suggest that if you plan on using a router you go to the X-Box site and make sure your router will work with Live.The only other problem I have with Live is a quite serious one that I hope Microsoft remedies quickly. In order to sign in you must first enter a credit card number, this isn't so bad, as they do not immediately charge the account, but you MUST enter a valid creditcard to be able to connect to Live, and they expect to be able to "Automatically renew" your subscription when your initial subscription runs out. This bothers me deeply, what if I move and don't use Live ever again and then simply forget about it? Is there a cutoff of inactivity? Or will they just expect me to cancel it if I see it on my bill? What is even worse than that though is the fact that they don't even tell you how much it is going to cost! That's right, Microsoft is going to automatically deduct an unspecified amount of money from your credit account... something smells funny to me there. I hope Microsoft updates their policy and gives it's users the OPTION to automatically renew our Live Subscription, or at least prompt us that our account has almost expired and asks us if we would like to renew.But now on to the goods:The only game system with it's own servers, and a single payment instead of a per-game (company) payment, Microsoft's XBox Live seems to be the best bet when it comes to console online gaming. You don't know what you are going to get from individual companies with the PS2 adaptor, and I for one don't really care, XBox has more games & better games for Live than PS2 has for it's nameless online adaptor.To be able to play Mech Assault online alone is well worth the price of Live, I can't get enough of the game.
Can't really say much about this, because it's basically a new subscription. It's good for the price because it's expired. The game itself, Bankshot Billiards I believe, is definitely not one the best but it's entertaining. The headset is brand new and the design's different than the one that came with my xbox.
This set is a great deal, I found it for around $30. The only way it could really be any better is if it were free. The included headset is not the newest version but it works great. The included game isn't very good(Bankshot Billiards), I didn't even bother downloading it. 200 points won't buy much on the Xbox Live market place either.If you want to play games online on a console this is a very necessary accessory to own.
Worked fine but it would have been nice if the offer for $20 dollars of an xbox 360 game was current .... the offer expired 6 - 7 months before I even bought the product.
The only reason I game this item a 4 star is because Microsoft still doesn't have a free service or at least lower the price a little. I am not a PS3 or Nintendo fan boy, I just feel that this system has been around for 3 years now and you should give your users a break. Amazon has got to be the best site ever. Of the games and PC stuff I have bought in the last year about 90% were purchased here.
Xbox live GOLD provides TONS of great content!  For the money, the year subscription is the best!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's just something else you have to pay for to fully appreciate your Xbox.
After ordering this online xbox card I waited 2-3 days patiently.  Upon arrival I giddily activated my xbox live gold account with the information found on the back of the card.  Simple enough right?  Well, that when everything went down hill.  I didn't stop playing Halo 3 online.  Then I got playing other games like Gears of War and Rainbow Six Las Vegas.  I go to work 8 hours a day and instead of socializing after work I immediately boot up the 360 and go to town on it.  It is now all I do and I have no friends.  It is all due to this product.  Purchase if you don't already have friends or are looking to rid yourself of others.
Amazon's review system considers this a 'game', so when ranking how fun this 'game' is, I kinda felt like 4 stars was the magic number.This membership card does exactly what it says.  It's a 12+1 month... that's 13 months if you've lost count already.  This card grants access to all the Xbox Live Gold content, which includes downloadable videos, demos, games, online multiplayer access, etc.Besides the numerous great games on Xbox 360, Xbox Live is really what makes the Xbox stand above the competition, so you might as well get it and enjoy your investment to the fullest.If you've never used Xbox Live, it does indeed need an internet connection to send and receive data across the internet.  If you are signing up for the service, you'll probably end up creating an online account and email or using one that you already have.
Gold has a few new things to offer that make it worth it to me now.  I like watching my netflix through the xbox, and my brother and I have a few games in common now so we now talk while we play together.  Amazon had the best deal on the card so its worth it to me.What gold doesn't give me that I think it should is discounts on downloads, or some other benefit considering that I am already paying the internet costs so the extra cost should provide more than just a few streaming services.
Not much to tell, it gives you 13 months of Xbox Live Gold.  Way better than entering your credit card into your Xbox and having to jump through their hoops to get it taken off.
This review is not about the service Microsoft offers for its Xbox 360 console, which is debatable, but about the card itself.Many negative reviews were due to the fact that there is a code you must scratch off with a coin and sometimes it scratches the code off as well.  Now, Microsoft has replaced the scratch-off surface of the card with a perforated strip of cardboard which peels off, so there is no risk of making the code illegible anymore.If you are getting Xbox Live, this is your cheapest payment option per month.  You'll get 13 months for [...] cheaper than 12 months would be at Microsoft's Xbox Marketplace.
This is one of the best values for a Live subscription, with the month bonus it ends up being about 3 dollars a month.
This suscription card is a great alternative for people without a credit card, or parents who doesn't want their credit card info on xbox live servers, kids and for gamers outside the U.S. whose countries aren't supported by xbox live. I also recommend the points cards for this matter if you wish to get stuff from live's marketplace. But, if you don't want to pay to play console online games get yourself a PS3 (which i also own), as of now, playstation online is completely free of charge.
Xbox LIVE is by far the best online gaming service available.  The interface is smooth, and hooking up with friends to play is a breeze.  My only real complaint is the number of 13 year old without a filter.It's the most annoying thing you can imagine.
If you have a x box get high speed and get on live, Alot of the games I have played lately have been a disapointment the campaing and story modes I found are just for warm ups get on live and see how fun those games can be.
excellent gaming for the xbox. I wish it was free with some advertisement but guess what you still get the advertisement on xbox. ridiculous
It was nice getting a years subscription for a few dollars less than they retail for in a brick and mother...
wel what can i say about a xbox360 live card i ws looking around for a better deal after this other company j deals didnt come thru on sending me the code with in 3 hours so i went to amazon.com and found a better deal it took me longer to get it , but the price was lower so if i need to renew my card ill look at amazon first
Great price for 13 months; only drawback is you need one card for each of your kids.  They can go on as a guest on many games but it doesn't enable them to interact using a headset.  Huge money maker for Microsoft,should be less expensive.
Good way to add to your xbox live subscription, plus it came with a free month. Only wish it did not cost money like PS3
This thing took a MONTH to get...Id go to the store and pay Extra...They said 3 days not 4 weeks!
I got this because it was a few dollars cheaper than what it normally costs but what can I say? It's Xbox Live, although I do wish it was cheaper.
My boys got XBOX for Christmas.  They each set up profiles with the 30 day free gold membership that came with.  Now it's expired and they want me to get them the yearly membership for $43-$50.  However, they think they need TWO memberships - one for each of them.  Can that be right? Can you have 2 profiles with one membership fee?
Xbox 360 without Live is like skiing on a concrete hill.  Sure, it's doable, but you're missing out on all the fun.Got a great price on a 13 month card.  Constant free "exclusive" demos, discounts, community game days/tournaments/prize giveaways, game days with developers/celebrities, netflix movies streaming straight to your XBox, multiplayer, leaderboards, added achievements, downloadable content, and micro games for sale cheap.Games now are being developed with Live 100% in mind, you'd be crazy to cripple you enjoyment of your system for less then $4 a month.
Decent price.  :)
This is the cheapest you can get the 13 month (12 + 1) xbox live subscription, against the regular price of $[...]. Absolutely worth it!It could've been a lot more efficient if Amazon provided me with the code, instead of shipping it to me.
Awesome online play. Wish it was free, but it really is worth the price you pay to be able to play online and beat the trash out of other players. If you are going to play something play Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and if not that then play Halo 3.
i got it for $38.96 plus free shipping include wat a deal....and it 13 month of xbox live membership better then buying it directly from  microsoft
You might need to increase your Internet speed.  But, if you have an Xbox 360 (I won mine by working overtime), then you go on an unlimited Netflix for $8.99 minimum, and you get streaming to your Hi-Def TV with this very best 13 month deal.  I cancelled my Hi-Def cable and DVR, so I am spending way less, for way more.  OH, I have no doubt that the prices will go up in the future, but right now this is such a deal.  Many of you will go air digital and this Netflix.  Road Warriors definitely want to do this Netflix bit.  I am not doing any online XBox Gold gaming...I am not doing any Xbox Credits purchases.  The entry level XBox Gold Live/Netflix Unlimited is absolutely the best value on the planet.  I will never again buy a DVD.
If you're playing some of the best Xbox 360 games, it most likely has multiplayer, which means it can be played online. You need to be a gold member if you want to play online, and so you pretty much need this if you want to fully enjoy your game.
yep, no problems. It came on time, it registered just fine, and it's good until next year. Go ahead and buy it.
This was much cheaper than it was from XBOX LIve.  Almost a point for  a penny.  Now I can get a cool XBLA Game.
What's there to say. Type in the code and go shopping online. Just that easy.
I am not a gamer and have no knowledge in these but since they were supposedly on sale at Target during black friday and my friend wanted it I got this with my points. Not sure how useful they are for xbobx but now my friend won't be leftout if one of them don't have an extra map/add-on? hahaha......
I took days and nights for the card arriving....I would like to buy online code.Damn Microsoft credit card system!!!
While nobody really likes Microsoft points and being forced to buy a set amount instead of the exact they need for a purchase, when the cards do go on sale, you effectively get more for less (in other words, you're not waiting for the game/content to go on sale itself but if the points you buy are cheaper then you get that content cheaper whether its on sale or not).  I bought 3 cards @ [...] each ([...] savings on each card) and it's money well spent and saved for me.
This opens the online game world to you!Be careful in online gaming! figure out how to turn the volume for voice down. Sadly there are lots of people online who can't control their tounges.
Hello, I am satisfied by service. Could you consider to ship thsi product overseas? For ex. I am living in Turkey. It would be nice if you send it via airmail this product also. Or can you sell only redeem code as software. This is the only valuable item on product...Thank you
Kinda silly that buying through xbox live should be more expensive than having this credit card shipped in a box across the country, but this will be added on th all my orders from now on to help qualify for free shipping. This one actually ended up as a birthday present in lieu of tickets to a canceled event. Will have to get another soon, as I'm down to only a few hundred ms points. ;)
They're xbox bucks, not much to review here.  I think it's silly that there isn't a 1:1 conversion for dollars to points, but oh well.  Some of the xbox live games are really good, so I try to rack up a lot of points so I can get games whenever I want.
What can be said about points?  It's virtual money.  It would be nice if you could get a price break when you buy lots of points.  But there is a 1:1 ratio no matter how many points you buy.
I really like points, but it seems like every card I get has some of them a little damaged.  About 300 give or take on this one had the edges all smoothed off instead of the nice knurl they're supposed to have.  Live still accepted them but you have to have standards, you know?
This is the third time i order this item , the first time it was very fast , i got the code in seconds. The second and third time it took me about 3 hours to receive my order other than that its amazing ...
It's 1600 MS points.  Spends the same as if you purchased them through XBL or Zune Marketplace.  Now at the time I ordered this the instant code was not available.  So I strongly urge you people to just purchase the instant redeemable code.  Unless this is a gift I can't see a reason not to.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the shipping.  Seriously Something the size of a credit card should not have to be packaged inside it's own blister pack and then again put into another box 4 times the size to be shipped out.  It's just wasteful.  That's really my only issue with Amazon's shipping.  But now since I can just purchase the code, I can save the time and S&H costs.
Better to purchase points then leaving my credit card on my xbox account.Have heard too many stories related to credit card #s being stolen off them.Wish the currency for Xbox was just dollars. The points system is just uneeded and tedious
This was awesome and super convinent I didn't even know they sold e cards like this I'm very satisfied with this, but I wish them email delivery was a bit faster but I guess it takes a bit I don't mind tho just wish it was faster.... Definetly faster than Walmart.com
If you need a live card right now, this is the way to do it. Now I rated it a 4 stars for a reason ("I like it" by amazon standards), I needed the card for a Rock Band party, and I thought this would be the best way to get songs instantly. It sadly wasn't the case, I wasn't given a code for 2 hours. Now the party did go on without it, but it was disappointing. The upside is there was no tax for the purchase, and I didn't have to hand over my credit card to microsoft. If you need a point card and live a distance from your nearest store and/or are willing to wait for your code to be generated, then go for this.
i would love to be able to buy points more often so i could get more xbox live downloadable content
It's simple, if you want something you buy it. MS points are just another way of buying stuff for the Xbox 360. My only issue with MS points is that, I feel, it should be a penny a point. 1600 points should be $16.00. Unfortunately Microsoft didn't decide to go this way and it makes it a little difficult to figure out how much you are spending on games, DLC or other items in the Marketplace.
800 pts for 10 bucks is an ok deal in my opinion, you get what you pay for. Good purchase.
Normally you have to pay 19.99 plus tax for one of these cards. I snagged one for under 17 bucks with no tax. You need these cards if you're buying DLC for your xbox games.
This a straight forward purchase.  Used my points to buy the season pass for Borderlands 2.  It is a little disappointing that Microsoft is now releasing every game with a season pass.
Yes, it is comparable. I've read other reviews. I always do before purchasing anything. Many of them say it is not comparable because it is not discounted enough to be sold on Amazon. I disagree I rather sit, order and print a code in seconds than go to my car waste gas to go to the store wait for a clerk in electronics to help me get a card to purchase and then have to go stand in line and drive home before I can use it. Convenience is great with on-line shopping and I think that makes it comparable even if you can find it for the same price in stores. I don't know how much gas and time equal to everyone but I know they are costly to me.
This item was very convenient, especially since i needed it right away. No issues whatsoever and most likely will get more soon.
I personally find it hilarious as to the amount of packaging used to contain this XBL point card.  I nearly cut my hand open even after using scissors on the this plastic packaging.  It amazes me that Amazon or Micro$oft doesn't offer digital code transactions for point cards.  Granted the deal of a 1600 point card for[...] is a great buy, but it just seems as though the code could have been emailed to me rather than shipped.  The other thing that was horrible about this offer is that I could only purchase one of these cards...that actually pissed me off a lot.  I couldn't even make multiple orders.  Oh well.  It was a good deal though.
Excellent and super fast way to get MP.However, amazon should decrease the price a little bit, because they do not have to mail the card.
I love that you can now order Microsoft points and receive it instantly from amazon. I don't have to waste my gas any longer or risk putting my CC information on my Xbox risking any sort of compromise. Better safe than sorry . Price is a little steep though but blame that on Microsoft
Thanks for the great service.. It worked great on my Xbox and got me what I wanted. No problems with any of the cards I Have gotten through this vendor
Honestly I only bought this on here because Xbox was being strange and not letting me order. No real issues or hassles. I wish there was a discount for buying on amazon but then again if wishes wee dishes we'd be in over our heads. 4/5 because of the lag between buying and the ability to access my code.

I won't bore you with what the Live Points are, since you probably know they can be used to purchase various types of Xbox downloads.  If you do want Live Points, my advice is to purchase them through Amazon.There are a few reasons to do so:* If you are an Amazon customer and have already given your credit card number to Amazon, why put it out one more place, such as giving it to Microsoft?  Especially in light of the recent hacking of personal information on the Playstation, it makes sense to limit distribution of your credit card info.* The Amazon price s typically a few cents less than buying the points elsewhere.  This card is not as good a value as the 4,000 point card, but obviously you might want to buy the lower point card for a variety of reasons.* You do not need to order this as a physical card, as an on-line code version is available.  Of course, if giving this as a gift, a physical card may be desirable.Again, the 4,000 point card is a better value "per point" but you may want to start with this card if you are a new user and want to see if you like what the points have to offer, or if you are giving someone a small gift, or if you just have less funds available or don't need more than 1,600 points.
In the past I had found some more sicounted prices on similar products on Amazon, but like everything else today.  No one is willing to give a better price than their competitors.  I would appreciate it if you could provide products and services at more than a 5% or 10 % discount.  Thanks,
I own a Wii, PS3, Xbox 360 and 3ds and Xbox live is the best online service. The xbox arcade is loaded with very good games that deserve attention and points are needed to purchases these. I would much rather use a points card rather then my credit card as it is just one more way to keep my info safe. The card is easy to put onto your account to use towards games and other items. The only reason I marked it down to 4 stars is because I wish they would go to an equal $ format rather then the point system.
I ordered this thinking that I can use for my xbox live account.  I was wrong.  I had to order xbox Live 12 month card.  As far as the 4000 points, it's nice to have when you order from the xbox store.
they were fine they did what the was supposed to do nothing more nothing less, I will continue to get this product from here
We don't like software cause it has made us loose time with our grandson but it but it sure does keep one occupied. That it does do.
This is a digital code for points. It does what it is meant to. I'd prefer a discount on higher volume purchases, but oh well.
I ordered two 1600 MSP cards and they delivered it a day early to me, leaving it at my doorstep. I was very satisfied with the product, it is a simple scratch-off card. HOWEVER, the case (shown in the product picture) is huge. It is the size of an iPad mini! So if you thinking about giving it as a gift, you may want to give just the card itself. Other than that, this is quick to be delivered and 100% accurate.
This is the easiest way to get points or anything else for that matter. I will be using Amazon for all future purchases pertaining microsoft.
This guy just totally bought Borderlands DLC.Seriously, can we skip the 25 word limit on some of these reviews?
easy to use, don't have to leave the comfort of my home, can do it all from the computer. I recommend this to my kids.
It's unfortunate to need to purchase a second, proprietary currency only to use it to purchase something ELSE. It serves it's purpose in the Microsoft ecosystem even though real money can be used for some other purchases.
400 microsoft points. I would prefer to use normal currency, but I guess these worked out fine. I'm not sure if it was cheaper through amazon, but XBL wasn't working at the time.
Not a bad deal. I always purchase them @ your website verus a store. And I trust your website over a .ot of others.
good i like by price cheap i like iti like by handy and comfort & card design nicethank
The points are the points.  We need them even if sometimes we would rather just be given a price in dollars to more easily say, "Thanks" or "No thanks," to.
easier than using a card. no problems encountered to present. don't have anything else to mention to use up the words required.
Yes, you're basically trading real-world currency for Microsoft currency.  If you keep the exchange rate in mind as you spend the MS Points, then you'll know how much you are spending.Many of the items you can purchase (XBL Arcade games) are worth the money, but try before you buy: all games have a trial version.
Code arrived super fast from Amazon. They charged no tax on this item. Entered the code on my XBOX 360 and everything worked great.
product good but needed 3 codes and 4 days to work as needed to go back through micro soft after the second code also failed
Great alternative to giving MS your credit card. I'm going to buy another, perhaps 40000, to get the Watchmen game. Great product from MS that us credit cardless kids can use!
The right price for the product and perfect if you don't want to link a credit card with your xbox live account.
Same as getting it from the store without the hassle of driving or standiing in line. And its a few cents cheaper not including saving on gas.
Purchase was easy to complete and loading the points is a snap.Personally, I think it's a lot of money to spend on "air", but my teenager is happy and he really likes getting these points for his games. From my side, it's great to come home from work to find out he's accomplished a really big job that I would have had to spend 1/2 a weekend doing and being able to say "Thanks" right away--without having to get back in my car to go buy a card with points on it. Because these points have a code that is immediately available he can get right to the gaming as soon as the points are purchased and I don't have to chase around trying to find a) an open store that b) sells the cards and c) has them in stock with d) the right number of points.If you're going to purchase points this is the way to go.
I needed points to rent a movie through xbox and this was a quick and easy way to do so.  Thank you amazon for providing a code instead of having to wait for a hard copy.  Also the price was good.
Just what i expected. Castle crashers is the bomb! I play that all the time with my siblings and it is sick.
The points do the job, I'm not sure there's another way to review them. I definitely wish they'd change the point-to-dollar ratio, though.
Great product once i got it, it worked fine. I thoroughly enjoyed it and yet the amount of time it took to get this took a bit too long, but all in all i had no problem with it.
Nice because it's cheaper than buying through MS, but what they DON'T tell you is that after purchase you may have to wait up to 4 hours before receiving the code. Took me 2 hours...
super easy - we didn't even have to leave the house or waste gas. my son needed it &#34;now&#34; and I got it right away
It's great and very easy to buy and use with no hassle, and getting the codes and using them piece of cake.
if you need microsoft points in a hurry this could be a must buy but i would like if you could get more things with it
The item is ok, I had no problem.I could get the points quickly and seamlessly activatesI approve the purchase
I don't get it buying this online is the same thing as it is on Xbox tax was still applied, i was hoping for no tax.
thank you verry much for selliing points on the internet othwise i would have to go to town and get a card. thank you
Microsoft points when you need them at a moments notice. I would recommend to anyone who is in need of microsoft points.
Product is now obsolete as MS doesn't use Points for the Xbox Live.  However, it was delivered as advertised and worth the amount specified.
Worked out well when I needed it. Definitely something to look into for all Xbox players around the world. You're going to enjoy ti
Like I Said In The Title, Not Enough Bang For Your Buck. But The Things You Can Do With These Points Is Amazing On Xbox Like Buying Extra Games, Game Add ons, Avatar Clothes ( I don't do Avatar armor though waste in my opinion).  Out Of All It's A Buy 4/5 Stars
Amazon is about as well as you can do buying these, much better than giving Microsoft your credit card info, once you do it's almost impossible to remove it from your account!
I needed some quick Microsoft points and I don't like to use my credit card on xbox cause i have been charged out of the blue for points or membership so i bought this instead of driving to the store to get it. It emailed in a couple of minutes and i applied it no problem to my account!
Xbox Live Mirosoft Point is great! If you are a game freak and need some amunition to equipt your game, just buy Microsoft Point from Amazon...It's very easy and secure!
If you need point 1600 is the way to go. I don't buy a lot of games so the point last awhile.
For the same reasons as in the previous review. Ask us to rate what we all used the points on.
I tried to enter the code and it did not take. Console said code was invalid. After three tries, still no luck. I waited about twenty minutes and re-entered it and it finally took. I don't know why there would be a delay between getting the code from Amazon and it being recognized by Microsoft but appears there is some. I never retyped the code just kept hitting &#34;done&#34; and going back and forth. Frustrating experience. Well it worked, so I guess in the end all is well.
Read up...This is way better than loading your credit card onto the xbox. Good luck removing it after you put it on...
I don't like the idea of being tempted to &#34;add more points&#34; constantly via the Xbox itself. So being able to buy the cards and enter the code in the dashboard, acts as a great sanity check for me.There's been more than a few times where I've paused and thought &#34;do i really want to rent that movie??&#34;. The extra effort required with buying the points outside of the system have kept from many many bad choices.
I have one question please someone answer!!!!!this codes i can use in mexico accounts????? i need buy one code but i need know the answer before... thanks for the attention...
bought the online code was all set in no time, i just wish there were other ways to acquire points other than purchasing them.
My son uses these so I'm not sure how it works but he seems to be happy with them so I guess that's good.
The online game code worked fine. After the major xboxlive update, the points transferred to $ on  with out a problem.
this item should me much more cheaper, other consoles like ps3 require the player no purchasing of internet based services like xbox does.
I hate buying Microsoft points and only do when i really want something like game add ons.. I usually use prize rebel and get free ones because i feel like for how expensive everything xbox has (and how often they break) i rather take stupid surveys then pay for points... llink btw  [...]I have also used it to earn xbox controllers and chargers.
Nothing special just XBox PointsI am not sure what they want me to review about this but I bought it for my son for his birthday. He wanted Xbox Live points and I got them. Instant delivery and no problems with the transactions.
Bought two of these online codes to gift to my friends during the holiday season sense you can't gift points through Xbox Live. Online makes it easier sense you get the code right there from amazon and don't have to wait for and pay for shipping. Somethings you can even get these on sale.
que llego al tiempo estimado  y un poco mas barato del precio en otros lugar buen vendedor  lo recomiendo  mucho
Brought this for a friend, she enjoyed it. I liked the various prices and point offered because I had a lot to choose from.
Good for what it costs and microsoft points can buy games on demand and xbox live gold. I wish 400 points was worth more though.
This is by far the best and easiest way to buy microsoft points for xbox.  yep, sure it, yep, meow
It's nice that I could buy only a small amount of points on amazon instead of getting a whole 1600.
Purchased for my husband for Father's Day. He loved it. The only complaint I have is this: I bought it so he could purchase a game he had been wanting on our XBox. Nowhere did it say the points could not be used for this. He ended up buying expansion packs for games he already had. I would have given this 5 stars but for that.
I ordered my code and dialed it into my xbox. It didn't immediately work, but after about a ten minute wait, it went through just fine. Xbox didn't want to take my credit card for some reason, but Amazon still will. ^_^
Not sure why this needs a review. They are exactly what you expect. They get you things on Xbox live.
It's great to get the cards for game add-ons and movie rentals. You can also buy game and even buy clothes for your avatar.
This was an easy way to add points to my account. It is a little expensive to add these &#34;points&#34;, but at least it was simple to do
It's slightly cheaper than buying points with a credit card, and it's much safer (especially after the whole hacker problem on the PS3). I love how I can just buy points, redeem them, and buy whatever I want on the spot. No wasted plastic, and one less place where my credit card info can get stolen.The only thing is, Amazon will ask you to confirm your purchase by entering your credit card number. I understand it's for safety reasons, but I'm very lazy, and I was hoping that purchasing through Amazon would save me a trip around the house to find my purse and enter my credit card number. Ah well, such is the life of a lazy person! Maybe I should just learn my credit card number by heart...
Lot of the good games are price this high in points so I use to buy those 80 points games and some shows that's not on demaned and don't show rerun till they're on break.
Wanted more Microsoft points. This was quick and easy to do getting the online code. Didn't have to go out and buy or wait for delivery. Wish there were pricing specials (these were same price as in store), but worth it for the convenience anyway.
I ordered this for my son to use on Xbox Live.  I was able to use it instantly after paying for it.  The great thing about this is that even if the person you're buying it for isn't right there with you, you can just send them the code via email, text, or over the phone.
Amazon occasionally discounts these cards to less than store price and way less than Microsoft Price, and it's great to see Microsoft point prices have not inflated like membership has.
This seems to be the easiest way to get Microsoft points. Mostly for the reason that you don't need to give Microsoft your account information. If you buy items on Xbox Live then I recommend this.
works good no problem every thoing workdwel wvery happy customer thnk again  and will b uy  again thnk you  sir
While this method of buying Xbox points does not net you much savings (no tax) it does give you the ability to use your amazon account to buy instead of giving Microsoft your payment information. The code is sent to you instantly if you choose the correct option and you can enter it into your Xbox.The whole process took me 2 minutes and I was happy with my tax savings.
Delivery was instant and the product was as described.  I only knock it down a star for the price being fully what microsoft charges on their website.
The only thing is that I would like to use it for downloading any content from my region if since I am paying for it.
this toy came quickly. allthough it was used, it came with batteries. my grandson could play with it right away.
I like to pick up indie games and such from time to time and points cards are the only way to do it wisely. Not putting my credit card on xbox live, and amazon is the best place to buy them. This card is usually a better value then other sizes (by a few cents) and amazon delivers the code in seconds. 4/5 is due to being unable to buy it while on my mobile device.
What is there to say on here, I got my points, got my add-on's with my points, still thought the point price was steep but still got the add on's anyway
Considering I can't purchase points on my console or the xbox website, your site is the last place I can get them without having to leave the house.
i loved it. it was fast and very easy used it in less then five min  on playing in no time : )
Don't know if this was just to me but I putted my gmail account for it to be delivered and it never came in. TAKE A SCREENSHOT OR PRINT IT.On the other hand other thing that some people don't know and that gave me some trouble is that TO MAKE THE REDEEM EFFECTIVE you live account has to be from US, if you got a Mexico or other region account you NEED TO MAKE ANOTHER US LIVE ACCOUNT
These are great for the kids to download games off Xbox for play.  They dont have to worry about the games scratching and there is a good selection.  Mostly, older games,to choose from and other things like maps, accessories, etc.  My children used them up as soon as they received them!
Although Microsoft Points are a tad expensive, they let you customize and enjoy your Xbox Live experience that much more. Gamerpics, themes, arcade games, even movies. Sure you can go sifting through the Marketplace for free items, but you need these MS points to get the good stuff. They could be cheaper, but it's a nice buy.
This product was great and easy because you didn't have to drive to the store.The only complaint I have is that it took awhile to download the code.
It worked as it was suppossed to.  Received at the time they promised.  Would buy it again from this vendor
Not too much to say.  I bought 2000 points.  Entered the code and 2000 points were added to my Live Account.Can't go wrong there.
It is what it is. Credit to play games, what is the world coming to? I got this for my son who loves his X-Box
This is a really convenient way to buy points. It's quick and painless through Amazon. Once everything is verified you can redeem the code right away. The only hiccup with this through Amazon is you have to manually put in your payment information when you buy a code. Even if you're already a member you still have to do it. It's kind of inconvenient to do this when you already have an account with the payment information already saved. Other than that it's really easy and it saves you a trip to the store and not to mention it saves you sales tax. Can't beat it.
I recently purchased this digital code.  It arrived within 1 minute, and I was instantly able to redeem it in the XBox Marketplace.  It also (at the time of this writing), is less expensive than buying it directly from Microsoft.What's not to love?Well, the fact that one has to buy in blocks of points is always a source of irritation to me, as you invariably wind up with some unusable number of points left over -- but I guess this system does mean that people who don't have credit cards can still engage in purchases of online content.Either way, the product is the same as you could get elsewhere, but you can instantly redeem it, and it's cheaper at the moment at Amazon, so I'll award it four stars.
theres not to much to say about this it is what it is. 800ms points to use towards games or other in game purchases for the xbox360
Easy, and it was a great way to reward my son. I am a single parent without a great deal of money so I do surveys and such for extra money for which many of the sites reward you with Amazon gift cards. It is a great way to be able to get things for your children without breaking your budget.
I bought a online code and it was fast to recieve it. But all i gotta say is 20 bucks for 1600 is too little, 20 bucks for 2000 MicPoints then its worth the MicPoints is a bigg ripp off everything is too expensive nowAdays
Was given as a gift.  The recipient is an avid game player and does enjoy using the points well enough.
Liked the ease of purchase but the online code is too long and a hassel to enter on xbox live
The best option for me to buy microsoft points! they last less than seconds to send  one simple code. And from just about seconds i got my game bought on my xbox !!!! This is great! y prefer this rather to wait which is useless for me, mentoning that I'm living out of US ... Would perfect if they just upload 400 and 800 mp codes!!
Good for when you only need points for small purchases and can't make it to the store before they close.  Quick, easy, and no scratching off that silver strip on the back.
The truth is there really isn't nothing inovating about this. I can tell you all though, that it's great to buy the card online and get the code almost instantly.
Although I had a problem with the first code, I was able to fix it through customer service right away and my son started playing in no time. I was pleased.
I wish MS was not getting rid of their point system.  Now I'll have to enter my credit card account information and hope it is not compromised.  The point system enabled me to purchase goods without sharing the information.
I bought this for my gamer son and I'm very happy with my purchase.  It was cheaper than I can buy it local, plus not having to go to the store and get the card was helpful.
QUICK EASY WAY TO PURCHASE MIROSOFT POINTS FOR MY SON , I PURCHASE THEM ON HERE KNOWING IT IS A SAFE QUICK WAY TO GET HIM POINTS
I recently had my live account broken into on my Xbox so I decided to stop linking my financial information with my Xbox.  This gives me the ability to instantly buy points without risking my security.
Yes, everything went well. Keep up the good work! And I recieved the code for the points just fine. Thanks
Watch out if you have an x-box not retailed in Usa, or the code will not work. But i contacted the support and the did an 'imm&eacute;diate' refund. Exellent service.
I bought this for my husband's cousin and he was happy. He can go now and buy whatever he needs to play with him and his son.
You can redeem the points. Only I cannot do it within the game. So I have to do it on the website of Microsoft. Log in, find the points redemption, and choose what I need, confirm, and down load it. So, four stars
Email prompted me to review this product. They're points, for less than face value. And you can get them online. What's not to like.
This is just what it says, 2400 Microsoft Points. It is delivered as an Online Game Code which is a complex set of numbers and letters that you enter into the XBOX. It gives you a credit that can be used for DLC (downloadable content).The thing is, you can do this same function from the XBOX itself by entering your credit card information and there is an option to save the CC info for future transactions. So, it is less work in the long run to do this direct from XBOX. The only advantage to buying this would be if it is on sale.
What's to review.  This is Microsoft money.  If you need it you must buy it and you can't seem to get a deal on it.  It is what it is I guess.
If you're wanting to get MS points that's what this is. Makes a great gift for any gamer and the price is on par with everywhere else.
A must have to use for online gaming addons.1600 points is more than sufficient to download many of the map packs and gaming add ons in most shooters.
I like the easy way I purchased the code card, the Xbox accepted it immediatelyI dislike that the price is very normal, no discount @ amazon at all!I dislike that no saving when I purchase 4000 point than the 1600 points, all the same.Thanks.
even though i like it i gave only 4 star because there was a problem at the transaction but still it's okay
Came as advertised, worked right out of the package. No issues with MS, son was able to purchase and download his game with no issue.
I purchased the Xbox Marketplace Points Card to get some game applications for various Xbox 360 games.  Amazon.com by far had the best price for Xbox Marketplace points and the only problem I had was that after purchasing the card it took up to an hour to receive my online points code.  If anything about this process can be sped up that would make purchasing the points easy and hassle free.  Thanks Amazon.com!
Purchased this online for my son to keep from having to drive to town and get him points. Once I purchased it, there was some kind of error and it could not give me the code to add the points. It said it would take about 4 hours, probably less. I checked my emails regularly, and finally about midnight, the email came in with the codes. I ordered it at noon.
Pretty much the same amount I'd have paid for the points through Xbox. Buying the card from Amazon means no tax for me as opposed to buying it in a store.I usually simply had a card on file but since the last one they had expired, I decided not to bother with going through the whole "Add a New Method of Payment" routine and went with the code. It's somewhat faster even though you have to type in a pretty long alphanumeric code.It took about 15 minutes from the moment I got the number from Amazon to Xbox accepting it. Not too bad, everything considering. Somehow, I'd better trust my card info to Amazon than to Microsoft, but perhaps that's just me.
The system works well, but I did not feel like my son played it as much as he thought he would because unless you open it up to play with any person, you have to be online at the exact same time.
Very fast and easy way to get points, live gold memberships and video games' downloads.  I strongly recommend this way of getting the mentioned if you're OK with paying some extra bucks.  Most of the times Amazon has cards on discount, but you need to wait to get them or go to a store to find one.  I give this product 4 stars.  Once they cost the same (as cards) I'll change to 5.
The points system has been replaced, but every once in awhile you can get a deal on Amazon where you get $ for a few $ less than what you get the actual $ value for.  Just be wary of any 'code' deals, as I have heard some bad stories of getting ripped, so pay attention to ratings.
It's easier to get your MS points without having to go to a store to get the code.  EASY getting it online.
Not much to say here. Buy points...get instant online code...enter code into Xbox live...points are added to your account and done.
convenient to purchase, no need to be mailed. Code available right away once purchased and ready to be used. Will buy again
They are MS points. You buy the code and it gives you points to buy games and such once you input the code. No complaints here.
i love it! i love the fact that you dont have to pay for the tax. Finally something without tax lol. I wish it was much cheaper tho. Looked around a lot but couldnt find anything beside those websites that gives them for free. I do have to say cards4xbox.com site was pretty impressive.. got my 1st free card there but then i wanted to buy one too. :)
The price of these Xbox points is pretty much the same everywhere, Amazon has the fastest digital delivery; immediately after you buy them. I've bought the same online game code at newegg.com, it took hours, if not a whole day to get them. You can drive down to the store and get the points faster than that.
If you want microsoft points then this is the item to buy.  The item works just as described to buy or rent items through xbox live.  I marked it down one star because I wish Microsoft didn't force you to buy points at certain point increments.  They should come out with a card where you can purchase however many points you want.
Microsoft 4k points, i see a few people crying they didn't get points but i can't say why. maybe there not reading the code right ? anyhow now what DLC to grab ?
I always bought my microsoft points from amazon, but Microsoft changed from points to Xbox money. Which is much better since it reflects actual money and not these points.
it took longer than usual for MS to send my code, but it worked. last time it took 20 second, but this time it took almost an hour. oh well. this has to be 20 words for some reason.
