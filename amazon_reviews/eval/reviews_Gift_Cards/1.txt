Well all the hype on the demo disks made me go out and buy this Xbox live.  It looks like a pretty good product, but when I went to set it up, nope, couldnt connect.  When I visited the Xbox Live website, I was informed that it will not work with AOL Broadband.  I thought since I could use my playstation network adapter that AOL had also allowed Xbox Live.  Guess I assumed incorrectly.  The headset is a little tricky to put together, but everything seems nice.  Playing the demos included with the Xbox Live disk are fun, but they are only demos.  I do wish that for the cost of this, you would have gotten a full version game with it.Unfortunately, I'll be taking this back or selling it, since my pleas to AOL to allow Xbox Live are answered with &quot;We're aware of this situation and are working on solutions to allow this&quot;
XBox Live sounds great on paper, unless you're a college student.  College students grew up with console games over the past two decades, and the online experience is one they have waited long for, but many colleges require all machines on their LAN networks to register the machine through an internet browser, which cannot be done with XBox, which has no browser.  Many campuses also disable internet access if they detect the device connection through a PC--by way of a router, HUB, ICS or other means.  This cuts out what should be a target audience for XBox, since our generation has supported and continues to build the console gaming industry.  We will be the next designers and continue to consume console products--despite common beleif, college students have the means and motivation to purchase more games at higher prices, also known as demand, than any other console game consumer group.  College students should check with their on-campus computing center before purchasing this product.
I ordered this on 4/1/07. this kit expired 3/31/07. I emailed amazon for a replacement and they sent another that was expired too.
If you want an actual starter kit......don't waste your time and money here.....All you get is 1600 XBox360 points (what ever the h@ll those are). I should have read previous reviews. False advertisement.
I was never sent what i ordered, they sent me 1600 xbox points instead of the xbox live.  when i notified them they sent me a replacement, 1600 xbox points.....again!!!!  their answer was sorry, we'll refund your money.  never got the correct item.  finally found it on ebay and they sent me the correct item!!
I should have read the other reviews before letting my 12yr old order this item for his xbox!!  The product you recieve is not the product advertised!  If you order this you will recieve (like everyone else that has written a review) a card, good for XBox 360 Live Arcade (3000 points)...it will not work with a regular XBox and you must have XBox Live!
I purchased this item thinking that I would get an Xbox Live Starter Kit, instead I received a card for 1600 Xbox Live points for use in the Live Marketplace. I tried returning it for an exchange twice and each time I received the card again. Amazon.com was very helpful during the ordeal, sending out a replacement as soon as I submitted an RMA online, even before I'd sent the card out. But I guess they have no control over what Target decides to send to its customers. Seems like theres an error in between Targets and Amazons inventory systems. I checked on the Target website and the Starter Kit was 39.99. Bottomline don't buy this expecting a Starter Kit.
Add my name to the list of people who were shipped the wrong item and can't do anything about it.  I ordered the Live Starter Kit for the original Xbox so I could create an account to play Phantasy Star Online.  I received a 1600 point card for Live for the 360.  I do not own an Xbox 360.  This item is useless to me.  I cannot return it to Amazon or a Target store.Stay away from this one.
I ordered this because it was listed under xbox 360, when it arrived my husband noticed that it was for xbox not 360 so I emailed the seller, the seller tried to tell me that it was compatible but the headset was not, which obviously I needed the headset if I ordered it for360 platform. When I called xbox 800 number they told me that its absolutely not compatible with 360. It also came in another language, I could not even read it and there was no game. All I got was some paper card in another language, a xbox headset that was put into a plastic bag and taped closed, and I dont know what the other thing is because I can not read Chinese. Please be careful if you ordering this for 360 because it is not what the listing says.
this was awful because I never received the product I thought I ordered.  They kept sending me a points card for XBox 360.  I wante the starter kit for XBox Live but never got it.  I finally had to go a different route to get what I needed for my son for Christmas.
Be warned that if you order this from Target you will not get the  3-month subscription to Xbox Live, a Communicator Headset and a full version of Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge as stated in their product description.  What you will get is a 1600 point Xbox 360 card.  We found this out the hard way because we ordered it as a Christmas present for a friend and did not have enough time to exchange it for what we really wanted.  You also cannot exchange this at a Target store -- only online returns/exchanges. Should have known something was up when it was the only one that came up for $25 when all the rest where $40.
Beware.  Everything in this pack is expired by over a year.  You are pretty much buying a headset and 200 points, THATS IT!As previous reviews said, the $20.00 off a game expired in in 2006 so I was expecting that...but the arcade game code is also expired and to top it off, the xbox live 12 month code expired as of 6/30/2007.The only good thing is the headset is the old style with the microphone switch near the controller.
The Gold kit is a must for X-BOX 360.  Just don't be fooled by the $20 off on the box; it expired over a year ago.  There may be a better deal elsewhere.
Playing online with the xbox 360 has been a blast for my son, but I have to let people know that this was a real disappointment for my son.  He had been checking all over for the best deal, and this one excited him the most for it promised $20 off a game on the cover.  The only problem is that when we got the box, the coupon was expired over a year ago, and no was was willing to follow through with giving us $20 off a game.  It was a real disappointment one that AMAZON should definetly stand up and take the blame for misleading advertising. What a disappointment for my boy.
Took 20 days to get here. Its easier to just pay 10 more dollars and get it at wal-mart.
There are other options than this where you are paying full price plus the price for a pro rated month...seems lame.
I bought and activated this card a few weeks before my account was hacked. I called Microsoft to complain about my account being hacked and they told me they would investigate. I get a call back 2 weeks later saying that while they confirmed it was hacked, since I signed up for an account with my initials as my name (aka D B, first name D, last name B) as opposed to David Berman, this was against microsoft guidelines and my account was disabled. Once it is disabled, it can never be re-enabled, no matter what. I lost my full year of xbox live, as well as every game and add-on I've ever purchased. Every CoD map pack, every arcade game, everything! My estimation was that it was somewhere around $300 total that is absolutely gone. Talked to every manager (I tried to stay calm through the whole thing) but they all had the same response and said there was nothing they can do.A week later, I bought a PS3 and I've been a Playstation guy ever since. Microsoft, (well, more specifically XBOX), you have officially lost a customer.
People keep saying this is $45. I'm seeing a price of $68. I can get a one year card for $46, why would I pay $22 for one "free" month? That makes no sense. If I'm missing something, please point it out and I will change the number of stars.
i received this card a couple of days ago and to activate you have to scratch off a bar code like thing to access the code underneath, so i did and also scratched off the code.  What this means is that just paid 50 bucks for a valueless piece off plastic.  xbox is a joke when i contact customer support they say "[duhhh] you shouldn't have scratched so hard".  At this point im planning on sticking with the ps3 for online play which doesn't set me back 50 dollars(enough to buy a new game).
First 5 digits of code scratched off when I removed the coating with a coin. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. The seller nor Microsoft would replace it, and I had to eat the $42. Microsoft live charges $45 to sign up for XBOX live through the console, so go that route.
I shouldn't have to pay for XBox Live. Nintendo and PS3 have free online services.
Waste of money these things are just a money pit, console gaming companies are just trying to get money out of people.
Yes, typical Microsoft support, as it is on everything they do. I had the same problem, where the activation code wore off when I scratched off the rubber coating. I tried to get assistance from XBOX as well as Microsoft, and several employees admitted this is a big problem that is happening a lot, but Microsoft says 'too bad' - if you can't read the code then there is no way to verify it, so bend over and take it. I am filing a grievance with my state's Attorney General, and I advise others to do the same. Most states Attorney Generals have websites where such complaints can be filed. Let's use Microsoft's internet against them and see how they like it.
my son used a coin to scratch the card and scratched off the code as well. microsoft support is useless in helping to recover the code and now we will see if amazon will replace the card.
Xbox Live is basically Microsoft's online store for Xbox products, games, and movies. That being said I have paid $300 for an Xbox, $50 a month for internet access and the USB input doesn't accept wireless router connections so another $50 for wireless connection in order to pay $50 a year for a shopping website membership? Why? Everything on Xbox Live costs money except for basic chat functions. Even downloading user created games costs money. Even if you have netflix and are paying a subscription for that you must also pay a monthly subscription to xbox to stream the movies via your OWN internet connection. Where is the justification?You may argue that World of Warcraft and other online gaming communities charge monthly fees, but at least you know your money is going to continued game development, etc. and you KNOW what it is going to cost you to play upfront.
We purchased a new Xbox with Konect for two reasons. My wife wanted to use the fitness programs, and I wanted to stream Netflix to my TV. OOPS, I messed up. To use Netflix, you have to purchase the XBox Live Gold Membership plus pay for Netflix. $100 per year for the Xbox Live membership and about the same for Netflix.Would someone tell me why I should pay twice what everyone else pays for Netflix, just to make Microsoft more profitable.Sorry, I'm buying a Roku box...One more reason to hate Microsoft.
Xbox 360 Live 12 Month Gold Card plus 1 Month BonusI was going to buy this subscription today but the price went up to $83.99. It was $59.99. I knew prices were going up but i thought that the Amazon price was somewhat realistic. Well it turns out they offer the card for 43.99 and the download is $59.99. What is up with that???I bought a subscription at Costco last month for 38.99 for the card including shipping but only one per household. Then the cards disappeared from the Costco.com site. I went back today and the offer was back. So I spent $38.99 for the one year subscription by mail from Costco.com. Not to date myself but I have been a member for over 20 years and I have no doubts that should the card code be unreadable I can resolve it at my local Costco warehouse.Sorry Amazon but this time you dropped the ball big time.
I was highly disappointed when the card wouldn't work on my GamerTag, I tried Microsoft email support 4 times, with no help but canned responses.  I called, and after an hour on the phone, they finally came up with, my GamerTag had been used for the free month when I bought the console, and when that expired, and I went back to Silver level, they CANCELLED that GamerTag from Xbox Live!!!!!  Never to be used again.  So all the points and things I built up on my account can never be used again.  I'd think this would be the common case that everyone come up against.  The only way I could use the card is to create a new GamerTag and start over.  They would not give me a refund.  Of course my inital free "month" was really only one day, as my 1st box got the 3 red lights of death and had to be returned, and it took several months before I could get another one.I'm going to stick with the PS3 from now on, free online gaming there, and a Blu-Ray DVD player included!
I've read reviews saying it's cheaper to order from amazon. That's true, but only by a few dollars, and the super saver shipping takes about a month (I am not exagerating; that was the estimate).  If you want it in "only" two weeks, you have to pay a few bucks and then it costs as much as it does in the store.  I cancelled my order after they fouled it up completely, and ordered from newegg instead.  It was considerably cheaper there, but I don't want to sound like I'm plugging newegg.  I'm really just recommending that, for the time being, you buy the card ANYWHERE but amazon.  They are inept at shipping a PIECE OF PLASTIC in a plastic container.  This is the first time I have been dissapointed with Amazon, and I'll continue buying most of my things here since the price is good and shipping is (normally) very good (and free).I just can't get over the fact that this little thing is so difficult for amazon to ship.
I have been using XBOX Live for 11 months. Online play usually works, but often lags and drops. I do not have similar problems on comparable PC games, so I doubt this is an issue with MY ISP. Since games are usually hosted by other XBOXs, your results will vary with every session.  I recently tried using a friend's console with my profile. I had to enter all my information twice because it timed out... not that big a deal. However, when I got home I was prompted to recover my profile online. So I entered my info... timed out. I entered it again... timed out. (Each time requiring the gamertag, email address and password. I repeated this 7 times and was unable to recover the profile. So I was unable to load any saved games for any games (to play locally or online). It has been three days now and I have tried to recover my profile countless times and still can't load any save games. I called XBOX support and their only suggestions was to.... keep trying.
it was a gift its a card not a game. I have no words it was a gift I guess she love it she hasn't said it didn't work or anything
The fact that we need to buy Xbox live points is stupid to begin with.  We buy the system the Xbox 360, and we pay 70 dollars for the games, and now we have to buy xbox live gold cards to play online and then on top of that we need to buy gay points cards to access content and new maps for our purchased games.....BS.  Expected from microsoft though.  When we buy a game it should include free updates, new maps etc.
I purchased this card, followed all instructions and carefully scratched off  the back to see the code. BUT the code scratched off with the grey stuff covering it. No i did not scratch hard and just from handling it while trying to make out the missing letters even more came off.So i call Microsoft support and they read me a script about how i have to take it to the place i bought it and ask for a new one. They can't even check if the card has been redeemed or not let alone help you in case something like this happens. I told the tech support that i would be unable to get a exchange on a already scratched off card and he said to tell them i'd already called microsoft and then they might give it to me.This is not the first time microsoft has screwed me over with my xbox, sadly i don't think it will be the last
I originally ordered a laser for the Xbox 360. Only to be sent a 1600 XBL points card. It took longer than expected to arrive and only when it did arrive did i see that it was not at all what i ordered. I tried to contact the supplier only to get no where and returns were not allowed. So I was stuck with an overprices XBL points card that I had no use for and wound up selling it to a friend for half of what i paid for it (sold to friend for $15. I paid $30 unknowingly) I do NOT suggest this supplier for anything. They pulled a bait and switch and I have stopped purchasing from Amazon since this poor purchasing experience.
1. Its not a game so I gave it one star!!2. I really don't think this needs a review!Edit... Msp is good for the different currency's!
Negative stars if possible for questionable advertising practices. I've gone so far as to say bait & switch in other discussions. Limited quantity never stated anywhere until your half way through check out. Single card plus S&H cost more than buying directly from XBL or at a local store giving me instant gratification instead of 4 to 7 business days which from the sounds of some is more like 14 to 30. If I'm wanting to buy and I see alternate offer of 4000 point card which is cheaper than XBL and has free shipping makes waiting the 4 to 30 days somewhat worth it right? Bait & switch I see.
Because Microsoft apparently hired the dumbest people on earth to create their xbox live account system, and man the online support phone numbers for it, I've got to rate this a 1.  If I could go negative I would.I purchased an xbox 360 2 weeks ago, and got it hooked up.  But there are some HUGE gotchas, amoung which is the customer support manned by people under the age of 20 it seems, cannot actually do anything, nor does Microsoft care that they would piss off an lose a customer for life and have an xbox returned rather than give someone the ability to fix a mangled account.So my gamer tag and xbox live account are fine.. I can log in and use them.But....To redeem microsoft points, xbox live subscriptions or other codes, and to use the messenger service, you MUST be able to log into your windows live.com account.But I bought an Xbox 360.... what does that have to do with windows live, you may ask.  Indeed, good question.Msft, on your behalf, creates a windows live account for you when you set up your xbox 360.EVERYTHING gets associated to that account.  Yes, you only want to play video games, but you will be forced to live with a windows live account.Ok, so beyond signing me up for something I don't want .... what the problem?Well, they ask you for a bunch of information that is none of their business and not anything they should have for you to operate your xbox 360 console and xbox live account:They want things like date of birth, physical address, phone number, credit card info.  None of that they need and none of it they have from me.But, and this is where it gets tricky, they have 3 or more ways of accessing an account password reset : either through xbox live.com, windows live.com, a phone call to xbox live support, etc, etc.And they all require that you provide a date of birth.  It matters not that you have your name, gamer tag, and the secret question answer you set up (3 things that should be enough).  Nope, they require you provide information they have no business having.  So if you don't remember what fake birthdate you gave them, you maybe screwed.I can only recommend you don't bother with XBox Live and Microsoft Points at all.  The xbox 360 may be a decent console, but the whole live/points infrastructure and idiotic management is beyond incompetent in design and quality of customer support.  It makes the horrid Dell customer support system look good by comparison.
I tried to place the order from my phone as a gift for my nephew but I couldn't get the online code through the phone and was forced to place an order for the card. When the order placed, my address was wrong but I couldn't go in and fix it to my new address so I attempted to cancel the order and received confirmation that my cancellation was received and I would receive an update when the order had been cancelled. I immediately went to a computer and changed my shipping address on my account so that this would not happen in the future. The next day I received confirmation that my order had shipped then I received a notice that the order had already shipped and was not able to be cancelled. Seriously??? Timing was obviously a problem. I had to wait until UPS tried to deliver my item and have them return it to Amazon as non-deliverable. I am supposed to get a credit back to my credit card however, I am not confident in that actually happening.
Apparently this is listed as a game.  1600 Xbox points are 1600 Xbox points. Worked just as expected. Good value. Paid extra for faster shipping, took longer than regular shipping usually takes.  Couldn't post this until I rated it as a game.  Since its not a game, I gave it the lowest game rating.
I bought this for my husband as a gift and was very unhappy when we discovered that he completely scratched off the code when he tried to get it.  There was pretty much nothing we could do, so we basically lost $20.  Be very careful when you scratch the code-use your nail or a coin and nothing else!
No where on the page does it say you can only buy one card at a time but just tried to purchase more than one and got a message saying there was a limit on how many you could purchase (I was trying to buy 2).  So if you buy this with the idea of saving a few bucks but then have to pay a few bucks to have it shipped to you it's rather pointless.  Might as well just buy it right off of Xbox Live!Yeah, I guess you can try and find something else to buy to add to the cart but that's Amazon's way of trying to force you to purchase something along with the card.  Which I don't need or want anything else right now.  Very annoying that this policy isn't stated anywhere on the product page and you only find out when you go to check out!Edited to add - you are only allowed to buy one card ever - once you've bought one that's it!  This should be clearly stated!  You only find this out after you've added the card to your cart, start the checkout process and then get a message saying "one per customer".
I ordered a total of 4 of these cards and not a single one of them could be activated on the XBOX 360 website. I called Microsoft and they told me that the problem had to be resolved with the company selling the cards. Don't purchase these prepaid points cards!
I didn't even receive the points that I paid for, extremely disappointed with this. They need to just give me a code instead of sending it to my email.
the  code  was  not  valid. I  was  never  able  to use  it.  was a waste  of  money I  was  very  disappointed.
I couldn't redeem it. Even Microsoft couldn't help me to redeem my code and use it in the store. .
when i typed in the code it did not work and i tried for several days and i still havent got it or a refund
This is the fourth or fifth code I have bought through Amazon's instant online delivery system, which has always been a flawless, 5 star experience. However, this is the first time, the code has been INVALID upon entering it on the Microsoft points redemption page. Upsetting that I will now have to sit and wait while this issue is sorted out and most likely miss out on the sale items I was purchasing the points for.With the changes to MS points getting very close, I am very reluctant to purchase another card to use in the meantime, while I wait for this to be resolved.I have submitted a general 'problem with my order' email, however, if anyone has experienced a similar issue, or knows a different department/division to contact, I would be very grateful.
it didnt work! So i wish i could have got a new card so i could get my moneys worth!
Can not get this to activate on my kids Samsung odyssey windows phone.. Really annoyed have tried all kids of stuff cannot get it to work.. Bought 2 gifts cards for my kids.. Wasted a lot of money.. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
Just downloaded this code but when I try to redeem it in the Xbox live page it says it is not valid
The only money I hhave on Amazon.com is on a gift card.. and I wanted to buy the online code so that I can use it right away but it says I need a credit card and I don't have one. You can't use a gift card to buy the code???? What's that about?!
I bought it with my credit card. I got the Code and it said it was already used so I bought another one with another code and it said its used again so there goes $100 down the drain.  Its just better if you buy it at the store!!
I just bought this today and looks like I just wasted $10 cause the code saids it doesnt work when I already double checked everything.
This was a purchase made by someone that hacked into my Amazon account.  I believe it was a &#34;test&#34; purchase to see if the card linked to the account was working.  I believe that more purchases would have been made had I not been alerted via email.
I tried paying for this instant access of microsoft points 3 times but after filling in all the details it required it kept saying this product can only be purchased in the US. I just don't know if it's my computer or if amazon doesn't like me.
The code didnt work and i didnt get a refund highly disapointed because it was a waste of money never again
Unable to use it for what it was purchased for.  You can no longer use points to extend gold membership
they discontinued the points and only gave me 5 dollars credit after i paid 10 dollars for it,thats not right
the code could not be used. is still preserved. please give a reason. could not be used sone latinoamerica country costa rica
I purchased the Microsoft 1600 ponts card for $60.00 on Dec. 18. I thought I was buying my son a deal, because it gave him 1600 points. It's only worth $20.00. Xbox does not go buy points anymore. They now offer gift cards you purchase. I should have purchased a $60.00 gift card instead. Now he's advertising it for $32.00. When I contacted the seller, He did offer me a refund for what he's selling it for,now. He said he's got no complaints on the card.I find that hared to believe. Who would purchase a card for $60.00 to get only $20.00 worth of credit on?  I guess I did. I'm sorry for being the only unhappy customer that this seller seems to say. He said he needs to make a profit. Why would anyone even pay $32.00 for a card worth $20.00. Doesnt make sence to me. I guess a lot of people dnt mind throwing they're money away. I could have bought him a game for $60.00. I'm glad I educated myself on the new xbox cards. Just don't want some other parent spending they're hard earned money on something they only believed was a good deal in good faith. It really makes me sad that this seller is profiting at the expence of the consumer. Taking advantage of the consumer. My advice, go the store and puchase a $60.00 card or $20.00 card. You get what you pay for. No shipping and handling cost. NO HEADACHES.
Thie item was listed as 20 dollars but you charged my credit card 35 dollars for 20 dollars. So it's basically like I gave u 35 dollars for a 20 dollar bill. I want a refund or my money back you stole from me.
Code did not work.  Was unable to use.  I want my money back..  Complete waste of my money..  Had to buy additional card since this one did not work..
I got 1600 MS points by pre-ordering GTA:V, but when I entered all the information, 1600 points got me a whopping $3.50.
The online code never worked n.Didnt get ny money bk.. not good at all!!!  Thank u for nothing. Jessica
the code did not work it was a total waste of my money don't think I will ever buy another code this way again
I have no idea what kind of rip off this is but it took hours upon hours to download.  WTF??
DO NOT ORDER POINT CARDS.  Microsoft no longer accepts the points.  AND... if you buy this YOU ARE GETTING CHARGED $35 FOR ONLY $20 WORTH OF POINTS... which you cannot use anyway.  Now I have to pay $5.00 to ship back a useless card they should not have sold in the first place.
I have paid $49.99 online to get 4000 xbox game points. But the code was incorrect. So do not trust to buy online codes.
I've been buying microsoft points from amazon for a while and they have all worked. When I bought this one, I went to go and download it and it wasn't valid. I'm very disappointed.
So I figured this would be an easy no brainer to use but what do we have here an error! Tried to enter the code it gave me and bam wont work. Now I have to wait to use it till its figured out... not cool.
Microsoft rips you off.
I dowloaded the code for my sons birthday so he could have a new &#34;mappack&#34; but received an error code that come to find out means points may never be redeemable due to microsoft xbox change from points to actual currency.I would advise to just use credit card for purchases directly on xbox and dont risk buying these points
When entered code on XBOX 360, the following message was shown: &#34;The code is invalid. Please enter a different code&#34;
The code Amazon sent me failed to work. Was told to call Microsoft. Called Microsoft, an hour on the phone and no result. Was told could take up to 2 weeks. After 2 weeks still have yet to hear anything. Last time I buy from Amazon!
The code provided did not work. I lost out on $9.99. I will not be re-purchasing in the future. Disappointed.
It appeared to have been credited to my XBOX after the code was used, however, there is no record ofthe credits downloaded onto the dashboard.  I have checked the XBOX for use and it appears, from  that I was cheated out of my money.  A code was downloaded and provided through AMAZON but there weren't any, credits or points issued or redeemed that I could use, so I chalked it up as a loss and will not purchase this particular card again.I would like to add that I don't think that this was a problem stemming from AMAZON, my experience over the years have been great.
it says it takes less then a minute but i still havent seen mine and i bought it 5 hours ago it might be a scan easier just to go to best buy or game stop
there is nothing wrong with my card so why I sitting here waiting for a download to take forever? very mad
Microsoft has switched to local currencies, which means this will not work.  Do not buy any points until Microsoft sorts this out (Sept 2013).
Pay $40 for a code, expect it to work. Did NOT work. Now I have to wait 5 days for microsoft to find out why. PITA.
Code didn't work when I got it, it said it was already redeemed. Unhappy with this in general, will definitely go to the store for my codes next time!
Recieved the code after paying and entered it in multiple times and by multiple i mean i quadruple checked the code every ime i put it in. The code was invalid, waste of my money
The code didn't work for me. I already made my complaint and you guys can not do anything for me.
if ok to use if you don't have a debit/credit card but is really time consuming to have to input all the numbers every single time.
On the Wii, you can use points to purchase games from their online store. One dollar buys you 2000 points. I wonder why anyone would want to spend an extra $5 for $20 worth of points. You cannot use these points unless your Wii is connected to the internet and if you are, you can buy the points directly from Nintendo. Save your money, buy your points online. The only excuse for buying this card is to give it as a gift. Even so, I think you are better off giving them the $20 bucks and letting them buy the points online.
At $24.99, Amazon is over charging by $4.99. At $19.99, you are saving a penny on the actual value of the card.  The only reason I could see for not buying direct from Nintendo on the the WII shopping channel is not having a credit card. There it's sold value for value.
The math of these cards on Amazon just doesn't make sense.  Sold directly by nintendo, 2000 wii points is the equal to 20 dollars.  While you must get on your Wii or DSI to purchase them that way, even these cards cannot be redeemed unless you can already access the wii/ds shop.  In a physical store you have the advantage of cash-only purchase, but not on amazon!  The fact that amazon charges an extra $2.00 to $4.00 dollars depending on the day is absurd.Even if you intend the points as a gift for someone else, if possible I recommend asking them to select a game ahead of time and using the Wii-Shop's built in "gift" feature to send it to them.
We called Nintendo trying to switch our games onto a new system.We have spent a bit of money on these cards over the past few years. Our Wii quit reading games and so the only thing we played was the downloaded games. We finally got another Wii box and found out you CANNOT take the games you purchase with Wii points with you! I have heard other systems allow you to. You can take your Miis, your unused points but you lose every game.Anyway, thought you should be aware. It is money you will eventually lose.[...]Here is a link that states you cannot take games from one console to another. Straight from Nintendo's website. Click on SD Cards and Can I transfer from SD Cards to another console?
You can buy this directly through the shop channel on your Wii for $20. Why in the world would you pay an extra $34 to get it from Amazon???
You would be paying $30 for $20 worth of Wii points. Just buy the normal $20 card, or purchase the same number of points with your credit card on the Wii shop channel.
For $20.00 you can get 200 points right on your Wii...  What a price gouge, I would NEVER buy this item from Amazon at that price!!  There normally priced at $19.99, even Wal-Mart has a better deal than amazon!Your not stealing my pocketbook sorry!
I don't know why all of these Nintendo points cards are more than the value plus shipping.  first of all, for a 2000 point card it is 20 dollars through the wii.  second of all, why is shipping 7.99 for a gift card?  anyone else think these prices are crazy.
The description says Nintendo Wii system required. Nowhere does it say that the internet is required as well!!! So imagine my suprise when I opened the package, went to the Wii Shop Channel and was told that I need to connect to the Internet to use this card. And I purchased 2 cards!!! I'm sure the cards are great but full details should be mentioned when selling items, especially when something like Internet is required!
This is available for $20 on amazon and almost any other place that sells Wii products. And using the WiiShop on the console, $20 gets you 2000 as well.Why pay more? (well, unless you don't want your money, in which case send the extra to me instead :-p)
2000 points is $20 worth of games. If this card is priced more than $20 then you are being ripped off.
Don't get ripped off - It's $20 direct thru the Wii or at any retail store.
This $20 valued Wii points card is selling for over $50!  Unbelievable.  Just get it direction from the Wii Store and pay $20.This review was written on Dec 27 2009 at 3:02am, when the price was over $50 for this $20 card.  If the price is $20 or less, go ahead and get it with free shipping, but if not, look elsewhere.
Don't buy this....somehow they are charging OVER $20 for a $20 points card!  Go through Nintendo directly and pay less.
It makes no sense to buy this piece of plastic inscribed with a code, accreting an unnecessary shipping charge. Buy it in a store, or buy Wii Shop points through your Wii itself. Why isn't the code itself downloadable, like digital music? Why pay a shipping charge for a piece of plastic on which this code is printed? You could spend that $5 on 500 more Wii Shop points if you did it online! It makes absolutely no sense to buy this through Amazon.com!
2000 Wii points should be $20, if you buy online on Wii Channel or even at Wal Mart you'll pay less - ?
The 3 months of XBOX Live is definitely a must have, though the headset is most definitely sub-par.  I ended up throwing it away after a few days as the volume level was unresponsive and the mute button remained constantly engaged, even when it was supposed to leave an open channel.  I would probably recommend biting the bullet and getting the wireless headset and getting a 1 year XBOX Live Gold separately for $49.99, that is a much better deal than this bundle.The only real bonus is the 400 points that comes with the package, I enjoyed being able to purchase some new downloads for Rock Band 2 without spending too much.
The only seller listed when I posted this wants $189 for this. That is crazy the game is only going for $15 now and you can get the same chat kit 12 gold for $75 minus the game. So $90 worth of stuff at $189? Nice markup. They also have another chat kit that comes Xbox Live points, which with the change in Xbox policy would get changed over to dollars for $89. Not matter, the way this is listed today it is a ripoff.
I just got this in the mail today, and the funny thing is that it didn't come with the 12 month xbox live card. So amazon told me to call microsoft. After talking with them for about 30 minutes i find out that they have nothing to do with these kit's. It seem's that eveyone want's to play the blame game. If someone is reading this, don't buy this product, it's just one big headache you don't want to have. If amazon doesn't fix this problem, i probally won't buy frome here again.
Email responses were good. I was missing the xbox live gold 12 month card so i was a bit dissapointed but overall great service, shipped in time.
I received four $50 gift cards as a present.  Two of the four cards did not work, and Amazon would not refund or replace them.  I otherwise love Amazon, but this experience was annoying and pathetic.If you plan on giving a gift, make it a check or cash.  Otherwise you run the risk of a total loss!
I do not recommend Amazon gift cards. They are poorly packaged, delivered slowly, and if you rub the silver away, be extremely careful or youll rub the numbers away and the card will be useless, this is unavoidable mainly, because the cards are probably very old and bulk produced. Disappointed and a loss of money...
Mailed to wrong address.Still have not received the cards. First time I havehad any problem getting an order from Amazon.
Buyer beware.  When you activate this card $4.97 will be deducted from the cards value to cover shipping and handling.  So much for free shipping and handling for prime customers.  This is an absolutely discusting charge.  It makes a fifteen dollar card a ten dollar card.  What a waste.
Please give me a refund for this, if you are not going to send it to Mr. Cabreras.Amazon.com $50 Gift Card (0109)
I bought gift cards worth $800 and one of the gift card with code AS3AHQFVGAKA9KQ has been sold to me and when I try to redeem the card, it says it's already been redeemed by another account.Could some one help me on  this.
So I'll order less gift cards, and as proof from this Christmas, a lot less merchandise. Brilliant, Amazon. A few more decisions like this and I'll be able to make a bundle on shorting your stock.
Poor, spent over 30 minutes on the phone to use the gift card.  Finally gave up It would not work. It woudn't activate. It also was tough to understand the person.  Need English speaking people answering the phone!!
Was going to order a gift card but I'm glad I read these reviews first.  Will not order!
I ordered a gift card on 12/12 for my nephew for Christmas and was told it would arrive by 12/17. By 12/24 it had not arrived so I called Amazon. Another card was issued and I received it on 12/28. I was tracking the original card and it apparently was held up somewhere in Kentucky. When I called Amazon with my complaint the woman I spoke with initially had some difficulty understanding my call. I was on the phone with her much longer than I would have anticipated. My new card did arrive in a timely manner. I am somewhat surprised that Amazon didn't offer me a credit for not sending the original card.
This item has not arrived. I checked tracking and said it was delivered. However it was not at my property. I have checked with neighbors and all around my property but it has not been located.Please advise.Thank you
good morning, the day December 30, 2010 I made a purchase of 3 gift card for a total of 380 dollars the problem is do not put my email address to receive the code, but instead put my address in Miami locker . my question is: I can reverse this purchase and it again? but this time I want the code of the gift card arrived in my email. please if you could do this operation today would greatly appreciate it since I live in Venezuela and is now due my share of dollars and do not want to lose them, thanks.
You should allow us to use these cards for the kindle account. I do not want to use my credit card or else my kids will use it and charge their games to it.
Good afternoon, I could tell where he was sent this item? I have not even received at the address indicated on the purchase
Unlike most of the other reviews here where people bought the cards & gave them as gifts, I'm one who was given one of these as a gift.  The person who gave me this card, like many people do today, don't want to give something someone can't use or don't want so they give a gift card.  And with all that considerateness, I've ended up with a worthless gift card that's not activated.  I like using Amazon, but my own experience here with these cards is extremely negative.  I can see from the reviews that this is a VERY common problem, and Amazon, you're ending up with customer's money without them getting a product in exchange.  I know that's good for the 'ol profit margin, but I can't believe you operate that way.  So... you'd better find out what the problem is and FIX IT. If you're an Amazon customer, DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE GIFT CARDS. Amazon took the $25.00 that was given to me as a gift.  Do I sound p****d off?  I am.  I don't like being ripped off.
I have not received this order. It was supposed to be here June 6, 2011.If it was delayed, I would appreciate being told about it! This was a Birthday present! Disappointed!Cheri Martin
I just tried to buy an iPod for my daughter with our gift cards from Christmas. It turns out you can only use one gift card per order. The call rep I spoke with acted like it was very generous that Amazon allows customers to combine both credit cards and gift cards in one order.  She repeatedly sited "security reasons" as why I could only use one gift card at a time.Considering Amazon issued the gift cards AND my credit card, I don't understand how they can't figure out security issues that would then allow me to actually use these things. I wouldn't have thought Amazon would be so petty as to cause customers to make multiple orders on low cost items and force cash or credit payments for higher cost ones, but that is obviously the case. It is even more irritating that they sell gift cards for $100 but I couldn't use two at $25. I will definitely NOT be buying any more gift cards from Amazon.
As soon as you order the gift card, you cannot return it.  If you really want to give someone a gift, just give real money.  I have buyers remorse because of Amazon's ridiculous gift card process and policies, and I can't do anything about it.
My nephew tried to use it and it states that it isn't activated.  I was so disappointed.  This should not have been an issue
I am a dedicated Amazon.com shopper, and, am almost always happy. That being said, please note the top of the page should you be an Amazon Prime member. I NEVER thought that Gift Cards from Amazon.com would be subject to additional shipping and handling... The charge to me for two cards? Over $13.
Gift card did NOT arrive. Tracking shows it arrived, but mailman agrees it did NOT. I was skeptical about buying after reading the reviews, that's why I only bought a $40 card.
Received this product as a gift. I rubbed off the film that covers the claim code and the claim code rubbed away with it. The card can't be used without the claim code. Make a better card, Amazon.I contacted customer service and I've basically been told that Amazon will have nothing to do with the card's replacement. I must contact the person who purchased it and that person must go back to he store that sold it to them. That person is 2 time zones away and we all live busy lives. The trouble it would take to make this happen is great and I'm sure Amazon knows it.I think the maker of the shoddy product should accept reponsibility for selling lemons. Own up Amazon. I have the card and receipt. Why can't I ship the card and receipt directly to Amazon and have Amazon credit my account? How many other Amazon gift card recipiants will share the same experience and not be able to spend their Christmas gifts?Shame on your response. The only way I can really protest is to do business elsewhere and spread word of your poor constomer service reponse.
Buenas Noches! compre un GC de 10$ y entendi que me la enviar&iacute;an por correo ahora resulta que me la enviaron a florida y el flete a venezuela es muchisimooo m&aacute;s caro que la tarjeta en si. me podria explicar que paso?
Amazon.com $50 Gift Card (0109)I was very disappointed with the Amazon gift card. This was a gift for my wife along with the kindle 2. I thought that since the kindle didn't come with any books I would include some via a gift card. My wife has gone through 4 books in the two weeks since I bought her the kindle, but we still haven't found a way to use the gift card at the Amazon Kindle store. I'm sure we'll use it somewhere else on Amazon but not for its intended purpose.
We intended to buy the gift card and turn around and use it to buy the last WII product we bought for $43.95. We didn't expect to be charged another $50 for the gift card, but did expect to have $6 or $7 left to spend on another gift through Amazon.
Never had a good experience with buying gift cards on Amazon.  I tried to send one to a friend by email.  I got confirmation stating that it had been sent, but when I called my friend a few weeks later, he said he never received it.  I double checked his email and made sure he didn't have a spam blocker.  If I hadn't called him, I never would have known.  I tried ordering another one today, but decided to print it out instead.  The receipt stated that it would take a few minutes for it to go through before I could print it out.  After an hour and a half of waiting, I finally called customer service, and was told that I had to wait up to 24 hrs!!!  I just don't understand why a company that does such a great job in most respects screws up something as easy as selling gift cards.  It's like a 4 star restaurant not knowing how to make ice.
according to UPS tracking the gift cards have been in coffeyville KS for a week now. so much for next day air. It was going to be part of a Valentines Present
The card I purchased was stolen before it even came to me.  First Amazon said that it hadn't left UPS, then they said it hadn't gotten to UPS, then they said someone else used the card.  The whole time I felt like I was being accused of running a scam.  After three days I got an e-mail telling me that I could get no refund.  I have to dispute the charge to my credit card, which is Amazon!  They either get to keep my money for awhile or collect interest if I don't pay.  That's the scam.  I have been a loyal customer since year 1.  That just changed.  BEWARE OF PURCHASING THIS ITEM.  IT IS NOT A SAFE PURCHASE.
Product took 2 weeks to arrive. How ridiculous it was just a gift card. Will NEVER order an Amazon gift card again.
My father just ordered for me an Amazon.com gift certificate (February 2010). He has not used Amazon.com gift certificates since 2008 because they screwed it up - sent a confirmation, never sent the certificate number, said they did, it was never received - this went on for two months until it was straightened out in October 2008. Well, what I am reviewing is the supposed gift certificate verification sent in February of 2010 - for the October 2008 gift certificate!! When he called, they had no record of this order on file. Several phone calls later, he got someone who was all apologetic, gave him a direct phone number, and said if I still want it, she will be sure it is done correctly. He gave me the option of his trying again - but I DON'T trust that it will work. After this last screw-up, I don't trust Amazon.com to get it right. And I don't want to waste any more of my father's time, so I think I'll go elsewhere.
Wanted 2 order 2 $50 gift cards was only allowed one on my order so I wasn't able to get super saving shipping.  Nice job Amazon-there are plenty of retailers who actually want my money this holiday season...
I'd buy these if I could set the demonination, rather than have them pre-set at $25, $50 or $100. Other stores let you choose the amount you want to give, why not Amazon?
The cafix ad pictured in it's label hot and iced cafix  with a brown lid,  What I got was cafix with a green lid which only makes only hot cafix  The brown lid cafix makes both hot and cold cafix which I had before and used for iced cafix.  Now I have to heat  the water  and put  in a container that has a teaspoon of cafix,
I ordered one $50 card to be sent directly to my sister-in-law for Christmas 3 weeks before Christmas.  I am amazon prime and the projected arrival date was the expected 2 days after purchase.  7 days later it had not shipped and I called about it.  Rep in India after much weavingf and ducking said it was delayed because it was Christmas Amazon Prime meant nothing to him but he assured me that it would ship the next day overnight to make up for it.  Two days later and no shipped notice - I called again who barely spoke English and who said they had shipped the card to me but it hand't shipped.  She hung up on me when I demanded a supervisor.  This run around continued for another 3 days when  card arrived at my house and I got a shipped notice that one was beinjg shipped to the intended by the US mail.  It arrived after Christmas and took several calls to figure out which one was the activated one.Totally Amazon's fault for not arriving on time.  Through this whole farce, the web site showed cutomers that it could arrive the next day even though they were taking 7-10 days just to process them.  Also showed all the different shipping options and 2 day for Prime members when in reality they were being sent by mail.I will never buy one again, request one as a gift or suggest one as a gift for anybody else. I'm doing less business here because I am sick to death of having to deal with customer service reps in India who just want to argue and have no idea of the concept of service.
How can I use $$on  card? Cannot find place to enter code. I WANT to buy Kindle books with it!!!!!!
I ordered a simple gift card on December 11 and received it after Christmas.  Not at all impressed with Amazon!!
Hi, I made the order on 12/12 for Itouch which said give discount add a 25$ gift card. I did receive the itouch but not this gift card.look back the invoice of Itouch. the price add this 25$ gift card  but also minus it at check out. I still paid 289$ for this I touch but did not get this 25$ gift card. is there something wrong in it? or I did not understand correctly when I did the purchasethanksgatormeng
Amazon.com attached the giftcard to the wrong account.  When I called them to check on it they said it was put on my daughters husbands account and even though there was 14.00 left they wouldn't transfer it to her account. This is so not right!
Ordered gift card on weekend in response to "receive by Tuesday, June 27."  Today is June 30, so far, no delivery, although tracking info suggested item would arrive by June 28.  G. Parker GraceEllen@aol.com
I could not cancel this order when I realized that I did not chose the right payment method and I tried to cancel this immediately. It is awful.
Nothing wrong with the gift card, just the delivery. It took over two weeks to arrive and had to make one trip to the post office to try to find out where it was. Postal service is better than that, but the method of tracking delayed it greatly. Never again!
Customer service at Amazon isn't what it was in the 1990's.  Amazon has too much going on now and isn't taking care of the basics.  Third time in five orders I've had a problem, and third time there's been no resolution.  Customer "Service" sound like people in call centers around the world reading off placards.  Their speeches include "I'm sorry" a lot, but, they never help you.
I had acquired an amazon gift card for 100. I redeemed it to my account during checkout of purchasing other gift cards from the amazon webpage and lo-and-behold gift card balance cant be used for other gift card purchases? Wtf if I knew this I wouldnt have redeemed it to the page. Now the money is bound to my account and I cant sell the gift card elsewhere. Dont gift this garbage gift card to people, just give them cash. Or a gift card to an actual store.
I got a $25 card and when I went to check out...I noticed that the whole amount wasn't there...somehow almost two dollars had been subtracted ....i was livid!
This is probably the one item on Amazon.com that should be shipped free, yet Amazon.com charges $3.99 to ship it. Odd and ridiculous. I'll never buy one again.
Be very careful with all of your Amazon gift card purchases!  Amazon is not up front in letting you know the card will not cover ALL of their merchants.  If a merchant falls into a certain category the card will not cover the purchase-even if you are directed to the merchant.  ALSO, I attempted to purchase an ITOUCH as a gift and in the promotion, I was given a $25 Amazon gift card.  I attempted to make the purchase with a $200 gift card I had previously purchased from Amazon.  Since the promotion forced me to take the $25 gift card, I was not allowed to use my $200 gift card for the purchase.  I was not aware of this until they billed my credit card company.  After 3 hours on the phone with people I had difficulty understanding, I was forced to send back the ITOUCH I originally purchased, turn in the $25 gift card and repurchase the ITOUCH with my $200 gift card.  I should also mention that when I repurchased the ITOUCH the price went up.  In short, the Amazon gift cards are only good for limited purchases and I will not be using them in the future.
After I ordered a gift card as a present for someone, it wasn't until after I had already given it to them that I found out the card was never activated.  I got a refund, but it was just an annoying situation.
Amazon does not mention that their cards can not be used for Kindle subscriptions.  After you buy a gift card, they tell you of extra subscriptions and then sit on the money.
Ordered 12/14,  website said should ship in time for Christmas, arrived day after.  was not good for me.  was a gift, a Christmas gift.
Ordered on Feb 13, arrived at Albany NY Postal Center Feb 18, did not arrive at our mailbox until after March 5th.  This is absurd, we purchased this card as a gift, will never do this again.Amazon.com $50 Gift Card (0109)
SRES. AMAZON BUY A GIFT CARD FOR USE UPON and I could not use it because it was redeemed in another account without my authorization. NO CLAIM Use code GIFT CARD IN THE AMOUNT OF $ 100. I need my money back or tell me who use my code gives card improperly, that is a crime. Thank you.
I ordered the item and the delivery date was December 14, 2012. This was ordered as a Christmas gift. It is now December 29th and there has been no sign of this item. Not only did it screw up my Christmas, I am now out the 25 dollars I pain for this gift card, and the $25 cash I had to give the person to make up for the fact that her gift never got here! I am very upset and disappointed in this terrible service.
I ordered the gift card for my daughter's birthday.  They tried to deliver it but as she was at work and not home, they returned the card to Amazon.  It is her birthday and I am trying to track down her gift...  They did not inform me that someone would have to be there to take delivery.  They did not leave instruction for the recipient that a delivery was attempted.  They did not inform me the card had been returned.  I had to contact Amazon customer service as even the tracking information made it look like it had been delivered (last entry was "arrival scan").  I will never order another Amazon gift card.  If they had simply mailed it, she would have her gift.
I ordered this gift card for my father for Christmas LAST WEEK MONDAY, December 16.  The one-day shipping made it seem like something I could do, being a week before Christmas.First, there was a &#34;processing error&#34; and Amazon had to re-send it on Wednesday, December 18.  Today is December 23, nearly 6:45pm and I have yet to receive it.  UPS has not had an updated scan for the package since December 19 7:56am when it supposedly was &#34;on the truck for delivery&#34;.&#34;One-day shipping&#34; is a total joke in my case.  Yes, I could have done the one where I email it to my dad or print it out, but I thought I'd do something nicer that I could put in the card I'm sending him.  That card has yet to go out.I get it.  UPS is busy.  But &#34;you are the company you keep&#34; ... I'm honestly very disappointed.Paying for Amazon Prime has been worth it overall, but I'm questioning whether I should renew next year.
After reading all the reviews, it's obvious most if not all purchased gift cards are worthless.  Amazon said they can't help me.  The cards are from another company and I have to contact them.  There's absolutely no information on the card of any help.  I just donated $15 to some unknown company.  Obviously I do not recommend Amazon gift cards.
I am a devoted Amazon shopper.  However, I received a $50 gift card in the mail from a family memeber, and to my horror, I had actually almost mistaken it for junkmail and thrown it out.  If you are giving a physical GC as a gift, consider having it sent to yourself first, and then re-sending to your intended recipient as the computer generated address and return address make the envelope look as if it contains unwanted junkmail (as it just appears as mail being sent from "Amazon.com"), and they may just toss it out before ever even opening it.  I have not tried to redeem it yet, and hope I am not further disappointed as others have been.
Gift card got &#34;stuck&#34; in their system somehow. Probably a high volume Xmas thing. Cust Svc Rep Ellen called me @ my request. I explained what happened. She apologized several times & explained, as much as she obviously could. She advised me she can't re-ship due to Amazon protocols but she would cancel the order, issue a refund & I could just re-order. She was very nice & professional & she gave me $10 promo/credit for my troubles since it was an Xmas gift. I have been using my credit on ebooks for my new Kindle Paperwhite & since so many of the books I'm looking @ are .99 or 1.99 it's going pretty good. I LOVE my Kindle, it's awesome!
Bought this gift card from Amazon for my daughter in law for Christmas.  When she tried to use it, the card did not work.  Amazon doesn't show any record of this gift card being issued.  Very disappointed that my daughter in law is having to wait to use it until this can be resolved.
Amazon are a bunch of theives. They make charges to your credit card and never give you the items that you have requested and not refunding you for the charges because of their policies. I would never do business with them again!!! They have ignore my emails to resolve this matter and I am going to do whatever it takes that no one else has to go through what I have gone through!Do not use them!! Do not purchase anything from them!! Do not give them your personal information or you will be very sorry that you did!!!Signed,A very disgruntled customer!!!Lany
On my last order I purchased a lot of things including these gift certificates, only after I recieved an email stating last chance for free shipping. After I hit confirm on the buying order I then realized I was charged shipping on everything. The best I could tell I could no longer stop the order. This is the second time I felt I was wronged by Amazon. I'm done now with Amazon unless these shipping charges are reversed. This is my second email and I probably won't be responded to this time either. Larry lardavwil@hotmail.com
Definitely read the reviews on this product before making a purchase. I purchased this as a gift and it was not delivered on time. This is also my third attempt at reviewing this product because my other reviews were deleted. Why? What is there to hide? Again, read the reviews before you purchase this item!
Amazon,I am shopping for Amazon.com gift cards for Christmas gifts and am really so disappointed that out of five choices there isn't one that says "Merry Christmas" or mentions Christmas at all!  I am sure I am not alone in wanting a card that reflects the actual "holiday" we are celebrating. On principle, I cannot send a Amazon gift card this Christmas.  What's up with all the Political Correctness?  Bad marketing decision.Lynn
This $50 gift was never received by the party I sent it to.  For some reason you split up a 4 cd with the gift certificate.  Sent three, then sent one with the certificate but it was not with the package.  I also read on my receipt that it was a paper certificate???? Why? I ordered a GIFT CARD and now I have to do it again and spend $100 for a $50 card!  I am not happy!  I am a good customer of Amazon, I spend lots of money with you, I believe you should honor this and sent the card without question.  These are honest people, I would make sure if they found it, the would not use it, but they have looked and looked, no card.  Anything you can do for me????Linda Grossmeyer
I had to have the gift card for a birthday party. I paid for 2 day delivery and thought it would be here on Monday at the latest. Imagine my chagrin when it came on WEDNESDAY. I was so embarrassed to try and explain at the birthday party for my best friend.
U.S.P.S delivery tracking claims that my gift card was delivered, but I never got it. This appears to be the first item ever stolen from my mailbox in 7 1/2 years. I suspect that Amazon puts "Amazon.com" as the return address, thereby alerting EVERYONE that it contains a gift card, which of couse ANYONE can use.The upshot is that I'm out the $25.00 I paid to Amazon, and Amazon provides no way for me to even inform them that the gift card was stolen/lost.My recommendation: Don't buy Amazon gift cards. They are sitting ducks.Instead, give a check or some other type of gift card for that you buy in person.
Received the card in a timely manner, but would not work.  Kept getting a very uninformative "We're working on the problem, try again in a few minutes" message from Amazon.  Two days later and two phone calls to barely understandable customer service I was told that it was active and applied to the account.  But it wasn't.  Guess it's time for call #3.
Bought three $50 gift cards as gifts, received them and mailed them out.  One week letter Amazon emailed me that the cards could not be activated and were no good and they were so sorry.  I contacted Amazon and they could not explain what happened but again they were "sorry".  So I had to contact recipients and explain their gift was worthless.  7 days later I'm still waiting for a refund to my credit card.Don't order these-the same thing could happen to you.  How embarrassing to give these as gifts.
I purchased this for a gift and had nothing but problems.  I received the gift card by mail with no problem on shipping; however, the gift card was not activated.  I got an email from Amazon saying so, but getting it activated was the hard part.  I had to email Amazon Costumer Service three times to get the card activated.  For the first email I received the shipping information, which I had already been following through my account.  The second email went unanswered and finally with the third, after I expressed my displeasure with the service I was receiving and the product, I got the card activated.  I will never order another Amazon gift card.  While I thought it would be a good gift, I have found it to be nothing but a hassle.  I do not recommend this product.  I read other reviews where the same thing happened, but decided to give it a chance anyway.  Big mistake.
I purchased a gift card, and accidently entered the wrong shipping address.  I noticed the error immediately however, the website would not let me change the address.  WITHIN SECONDS I NOTICED THE ERROR!  However when I tried to correct it, your website said something to the affect that there were technical difficulties and check back later.  Well I checked back later, only to find out that now I can't change the shipping address because its already shipped.  Nice.  Real nice.
I purchased a GC to be mailed on Dec 16th and it still has not be received by Dec 28th.  On Dec 28th, I called Amazon customer service and switched the GC to email and I received in less than 2 minutes.  As background, I sent this originally via regular mail so the person had something to open for Christmas.  As an fyi, the customer service people do not appear to have a clue, as they told me it will take 12 to 48 hours to receive an email gift certificate, but I had it in less than 2 minutes.  In short, I should have listened to the other negative feedback before ordering.
I wanted an item that was 300.00 after tax and shipping was free and was given 3 different gift cards for 100.00 each for the 300.00 item I wanted!I have my credit card on my account from a past order but wasn't prepared to use it for the item I wanted.... I checked the box saying I wanted to use the 300.00 gift card balance option it gave me  and since the gift cards were 100.00 each, they used 1 of the 100.00 cards and charged the rest to my unprepared cedit card... I was shocked!I wasnt prepared for that with my credit card especially after the holidays, so of course it declined the extra 200.00 I was expecting the gift cards to have covered....and I wanted to use the 300.00 in gift cards, not my credit card on my account from previous use of Amazon.I called customer service and kept getting a woman who I could not understand, telling me the same thing over and over as if she was reading from a script to me, telling me she couldnt help me and would forward my issue to another department and they would get back with me by email within 12 hours.I get an email later stating i need to choose another payment method, as my credit card delined! UM, DUH! I didnt wish to use my card, I wanted to use the gift card balance!!So, I wrote to explain this back to them and no answer, it has been a week, and my order was cancelled.I still have a 300.00 gift card balance but cant use it for the 300.00 item I wanted only can use 100.00 at a time! RETARDED!This is the 3rd issue with amazon gift cards I have encountered!
I LOVE AMAZON. I save up all my change and go to the market and trade the change in for an Amazon Redemption code, it is great for Christmas time, especially in this economy. Anyway. I have a redemption code with over $70.00 on it. So I figured I will buy a Amazon Gift Certificate with my redemption code. When I started the process online, there was no space for a Redemption Code, so I called Customer Service.The customer service representative was VERY VERY hard to understand and went off on a taget about redemption codes and how you get them. All I wanted to know is why I couldn't buy a gift certificate with this PREPAID redemption code. She said something that I didn't understand and I asked for the boss.. they kept trying to tell me that the redemption code was a gift certificate and you can't buy a gift certificate with a gift certificate. All and all I think that most companies would just taken the redemption code and given me the darn gift certificate. Needless to say I am not ever going to try that again :)
I thought the promotion was I get a free $75 gift card with the purchase of the hp dv4 laptop! Why was my account charged!!! A refund is requested.

I appreciate the assitance in advance and look forward to hearing from you and recieving my gift card.Laura Chuck
I got two different responses from Customer Service when inquiring whether Amazon gift cards could be used internationally. The chat associate (from whom I have a written transcript) gave me a clunky, hard-to-understand answer but after much probing back & forth, assured me that a card purchased in the US would work in Switzerland, UK and Canada. Just to get a second opinion before shelling out $2000, I CALLLED customer service and got an unequivocal &#34;NO&#34; to the same questions. In other words, two conflicting stories.I did not order these cards. I still don't really know whether they can be used overseas.
As a long time Amazon.com customer, a gift card seemed like a good purchase. I am just trying to purchase a card to have e-mailed. I basically wanted to convert a Visa debit gift card into an Amazon.com gift card. I put the amount of the card in, the number and expiration date. Amazon accepted it as payment, but after hours of not receiving a confirmation e-mail I checked the site to see what was going on. The site claimed they could not confirm the payment, yet they had already taken money off the Visa gift card. I contacted customer service who told me a Visa gift card is not the best way to purchase an Amazon gift card and they would refund the money to the Visa gift card. I then put in another order using my Amazon.com credit card. A card I have used thousands of times before and never had a problem. This time, I received the same message I got when using the Visa gift card. I contacted Customer Service again. The first person I spoke to told me I had a "Block" on the account. She could not tell me why that was there, and she informed me she could remove it immediately. This claim brought me some concern so I asked to speak with her manager to find out the reason  a "Block" had been placed. The manager claimed there was no "Block" on the card and the sale should have gone through fine. So, I again went back and checked on the sale. Again there was a message that it could not be paid using the payment option I had selected. I called back again and told them to cancel the sale. This is extremely disappointing to me, as I have felt for quite some time that Amazon was one of the last customer service oriented sellers around. I guess they too have been pushed to the "Make money, screw the customer" attitude this country has been forced into with our economic situation. A trusted company has gone down the drains. I hope to see you come back to your original ideals some day Amazon.
My son bought a gift card for my birthday but I never received it. I don't even have a way to reference the purchase because I never received an email or regular mail regarding this gift.
I thought I was buying iTune gift cards and was really disappointed to find out that they weren't.
I bought 8 gift cards to give out as presents.  I was totally surprised that they came sealed inside the Amazon envelopes.  I cannot sign the cards without opening therefore damaging the envelopes.  I asked Amazon to ship me replacement envelopes but they are not able to do that as in the following response."Thank you for contacting us at Amazon.com. I'm sorry to hear that the gift card envelopes were damaged when opening it. I do understand your concern in this regard. Unfortunately, we are unable to replace the envelopes only as we do not have any stock of additional gift card envelopes. Hope you can understand our limitations in this matter."Please do not buy these cards.
I ordered a gift card over 3 weeks ago and have never received it!  Shows in transit.  The birthday has long come and gone.  Where is my card!!
I bougt an amazon.com gift card for a friend living in Europe.He was unable to use it on amazon.co.uk, meaning he has to place the order on amazon.com and pay additional importing fees.
I received an Amazon Gift Card for $50.  I scratched off the code cover and now can't read all the numbers.  Apparently now I need to remember who gave it to me, get their order number, if they have one, then I can hopefully return the card.  Not worth the trouble.  Amazon makes out on this one.
I received a $50 gift card for my birthday. Two months after I got it I wanted to use it. I come to find out the card is usless. For whatever reason there is no record of card. After getting the run around from Amazon CS for close to a month I finally get it's worthless. Thanks Amazon for a $50 buck plastic card! It seems I'm not alone, many people have the same problem. Never again will I order from Amazon. Never again.
Do not bother with Amazon products. The process is horrible when the website is not working quite right. It will give the appearance of working, but doesn't! Do find another gift to give: avoid Amazon! Website (most of yesterday) gave the appearance of working but would not accept data. Purchase took 6 hours!! My time was totally wasted. Worse, when I tried to call Amazon (you know how you can never find their phone number??), I ended up calling somebody else who pretended to be Amazon!!! Thank god I never gave my credit card number!! This is another downside in dealing with Amazon. Beware!
I will keep the gift that was supposed to go to my daughter in Texas but this will be the last one &#34;I'll buy from you&#34;!! It's not only  going to be late but I'm having to resend it and explain why their BIRTHDAY GIFT CARD IS TO DAMN LATE!!!Signed,Very pissed off
I need to cancel this orden because i need a email gift card not a fisical gift card.. somebody can help me'?
Why take 50 dollars of good money with no limitations, and turn it into Amazon money that can only be used at their site? Where is the benefit?Also, you spend time and headache buying these types of cards, dealing with any activation issues risking expiration or delivery issues and then you have to keep up with them and keep track of how much you have remaining on the card....They should at least give a discount for committing your purchasing power to them...
I received one of these as a gift.  The number doesn't work.  Very disappointing and now I have to embarrass the gift giver.  If you're a procrastinator or just can't think of a gift, put a check in an envelope.
I have never received it.  Very unhappy.  It is suppose to be a birthday gift.  It is still a little early.  The post office maybe backed up.
If you look at amazon's policy on gift cards, they know that these are being stolen before they are ever shipped. And don't care.I order a physical card for a Christmas gift. It was not in the package, and absolutely no way to get a replacement or refund.  If you get a gift card from amazon make it electronic that you can print out immediately or expect to lose your money :(
I purchased 4 gift cards that were supposed to have a personalized gift message.  There was no gift message on any of the cards and the envelopes did not identify who the intended recepient was.  First item that I ever purchased from Amazon that I was not satisfied with.
I purchased a gift card for my husband for Christmas. After attempting to use it, we discovered Amazon never activated it. We contacted customer service through live chat only to be be led in circles for over an hour with silly suggestions instead of just activating the card. So, after spending an hour of my Christmas day in a chat with Amazon, instead of just activating the card, they sent the "issue" to the "gift card department" for me to wait 1-2 business days for a response. Never, ever again.
Hi,Its a cheap and dirty trick played by amazon with these gift cards. Amazon has a control over what products one can purchase using gift card balance. yes, you got me right, not all of the products can be bought using gift cards. So, you are kind of forced to chose product which are eligible to be purchased using gift card. I do not want this. Its my money, why the hell amazon tells me what I can or cannot. Crap service Crap products.
Received my $50 Amazon gift card as a gift, and of course, it doesn't work!  AND, there is NO ONE to complain to!!!  How convenient that there is NO 800 number to call to rectify this situation!  I will NEVER buy an AMAZON gift card for anybody!!!!
me gustar&iacute;a obtener informaci&oacute;n sobre una tarjeta de regalo que compre el 24 de diciembre por 200 $ los cuales todav&iacute;a no he recibido, a quien puedo ubicar para que me de informaci&oacute;n sobre la misma, compre varias tarjetas de regalo y no me ha llegado la de 200
The cards are worthless. The activation codes don't work, then "customer service" intentionally gives you the runaround. It's a total scam and Amazon should be embarrassed. I previously posted a 1 Star review about the gift cards and Amazon didn't post it. The positive reviews are posted by their own employees - don't believe them.
