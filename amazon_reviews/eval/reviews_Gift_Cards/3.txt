I've just started trying with the Xbox Live.  Its a decent starting point for Xbox online play; however, the Xbox Live has one *major* drawback in that it does not have backwards compatibility or support for Xbox games that were released prior to the Xbox Live's debut.  Games which would probably be perfect for Xbox Live such as Halo cannot at this time be played online.  Other games which would be perfect for Xbox live would be just about any hand-to-hand combat game or racing game (DOA3, WWE RAW, UFC, Burnout, Test Drive &amp; NFS: HP2 come to mind).  Lets face it, the Xbox Live would be well worth the money solely for Halo online play.  I'm just hoping for a backwards compatible patch disc and/or Halo Live game to be released.  If that ever happens, Xbox Live will likely be *the* best console online gaming solution to hit the market to date.
Okay, I admit that I wanted my gamer's tag the day this thing came out, but I didn't have the money then. Two months later I'm too late...someone else snagged it... oh well. Ultimately I got this because my GameCube had gotten me excited about online gaming, surprising huh? Amazing what a solid Massive Multiplayer Online RPG like Phantasy Star Online will do for you... Amazing how XBox live does not have, and will not have a MMORPG anytime soon. If I had known that, and I should have, but wasn't thinking about anything except getting my Gamer's Tag, I probably would have held off on this purchase.I'm pumped about XBox live. Between the three consoles XBox definitely has the best online plan, but the problem with it so far is that the games are all sport and shooter titles. I had hoped for a MMORPG, and while there is one that I am aware of in the works, it won't be out until toward the end of the year... meaning I just bought a year subscription to an online plan that I probably will not be using much this year at all.This also means that my review of this product is subject to change... Microsoft has had a problem with variety all along. XBox almost seems like nothing but sport titles and Sci-Fi based shooters. This lack of variety shows in my ever so slowly building of my XBox collection, where as GameCube is up to 14 titles, PS 2 still dwindles at 8, and XBox at 4, with this peripheral being purchased with the intention of building that collection. Thankfully Capcom will be releasing Capcom VS SNK 2 to XBox with Xbox Live support sometime next month... but aside from that there are simply no other games for XBox live that I'm interested in right now, so needless to say I'm disappointed, but I'm sure that True Fantasy Online will make me change my review for this product, but again that's not until toward the end of the year.
Well i havnt used it much. But I did use it a little bit and its really fun. The only problem is you get some people who like to start games then quit so every one is thrown out of the game. What i really like is that its easy to find a game with alot of people in it. I love playing games online. Its great i have to start useing it more now that i think about it
I suppose that this is good for what you want to do with it. The only things you're going to be able to do with this is play online...and download some small upgrades to existing games. The price you'll pay for the starter kit is a good value if you are gong to use it but be weary of upcoming bills next year when you subscription runs out. But the online service is good. There is hardly any lag and the menu is super easy. Some problems that are evident are the voice-overs, Brat is the most annoying voice on earth and should never been passed through checking. The device that hooks into your controller is a bit flimsy but not easily breakable. A good buy contrary to my previous review.
I opened my starter pack with glee it took me about an hour to fix it all up, and I was playing Ghost Recon and that took me thirty minutes to figure out how to talk. After that I had enjoyable thing for the next two weeks.But then I got discouraged, my mic had broken like the second day just broke for no reason which [was bad]. Then I started to notice all the lag and [bad] interfaces they give you. Sometimes it would take me 20-30 minutes to get into a Ghost Recon game because my con would mess up if I couldn't get in first try.You'll have fun at first for some it's fun longer than others. Then you'll notice the flaw I payed the [money] and haven't touched it in months....
Problems began when I tried to scratch off the card containing the required code needed to sign up with xbox live. After scratching off the grey material hiding the code using a quarter, fingernail, and then a knife blade the code was so obscured it was not legible. I returned the xbox live kit for a replacement and was able to scatch off the card (using a razor blade)enough to barely make out the code. Why do they make this so difficult? Could this be due to the age of the kit I purchased? It was the 2005 version. Of course this was not mentioned at the time of order. After finally getting the xbox live set up and now able to play online I began having disconnection problems as well as error messages. I followed all the applicable fixes from the microsoft and EA game websites and still was having issues especially while playing Madden 2007. These disconnect problems cause you to have a loss counted against you and there is no way to resolve this. The bottom line is this system needs a lot of work and I would not reccomend it unless you have a high frustration tolerance.
Target...I bought this from target. WHAT DID I GET? A *^&%ING XBOX 360(WHICH I DONT HAVE) POINTS CARD!!!!! I am very furious at the company for making that kind of mistake. I will not shop online with Target(R) again.
I believe Xbox Live is necessary to fully enjoy your Xbox.  I personally think the code redemption cards are the best way to get Live, rather than giving Microsoft your credit card number.  Free bonus month and they're usually discounted on Amazon.  Live is awesome lets you play your games online and gives you access to many features that your Xbox wouldn't have without Live.  I just wish it weren't so expensive.
PROPrice is awesomeOk, this is simple. You need this to play xbox live games with you friends, co-workers or any fool who challenges you. Its so addicting im willing to pay for it.I use it mainly for Halo 3, COD4, Bad Company, Rockband DLCCON: Shipping UGH*7-10 Business days OUCH!!! They mean it, USPS ,Yep Postal Service!!!If I could call and have the code read to me over the phone I would choose this option.I placed the order Sept 10th, (still not here took 3 whole days to move across town to springfield MA, if i knew i would have done a detour from Six flags there....)it is set to arrive Sept 22ndits also a dollar cheaper adding insult to injury, yes Whah...I need a whambulance!!!!
Since I used the Super Saver option, my shipping was free and I paid about ten dollars less than in-store. Be aware though when using Super Saver Shipping that your item will not be shipped right away. The delivery is quick but the actual shipping may not occur until a couple of days after you confirm your order. So, if you need it the next day, you may have to splurge on the shipping.
Xbox Live is necessary for the 360 since the system is solely an online only system.  I have tried the single player and you can tell developers are slacking on that element of the gameplay.Only real draw back is you pay $50 for the service, but you have to turn around and buy Microsoft Points for downloads.  Drop $60 on Oblivion.  Then drop another $60 on Microsoft Points for the rest of the content.This sadly is going to be a growing trend.  You will pay more for the games, but have more and more of the content be put up as marketplace downloads for an additional fee.  Don't like it.  Especially with the low quality of most of todays games, and the high price tags that go with them.Time for Microsoft to think of the gamers instead of making money.  I'll glady sacrifice the gamerscore (rather useless feature anyways), and my universal gamertag for some free content and free online play.
Just a quick question, because this is very cheap, does this card work in Europe??? I have tried it once with Xbox live points and it did not work.
The price is ridiculous, but I like the 1 month bonus.  I think they should always offer some bonus with these cards (whether it be microsoft points or just a free month).  Way too expensive for what it is.  Just buy off Ebay, Newegg, or somewhere else when there's a sale.
have not been able to use yet.  since my son wants it to be wireless, I need to purchase a network adaptor for add $70-100 dollars.  The wireless adapator we have is "not" compatible with xbox,  you can only use one made by microsoft, unless your are very technical and can rig something else up.  will update once we obtain network adaptor.
For anyone who has an xbox 360 the question isn't "if" you are going to connect to xbox live but when you do, how will you pay for the subscription? This is a good option and I prefer it to buying a subscription online, but it isn't the only option.Xbox 360 Live Camera BundleI recommend going with the camera bundle option currently. It gives you a 12 month membership to xbox live but also comes with the vision camera, two xbox live arcade games, a headset, and 200 Microsoft Points for not much more. I only paid $65 for the camera package and for what you get it makes the subscription by itself seem overpriced.
If you don't already know what you're going to spend your points on and you've never used them before, don't buy it. If you want to use them, do buy them...
y think all contents must be free, as we already have pay for the xbox and for the games, the extra cost i dont like it at all
This is OK in that I appreciate having the option to download content, like the Lost in Nightmares expansion to Resident Evil 5. However, I'm dissappointed with Microsoft's exchange rate gimmick. It would be more consumer friendly if they had a simple system with $1 = 100 points, instead of the current system where $1 = 80 points. It's annoying because it makes them look like they are trying to confuse users into thinking they are paying less than they really are; that was probably their intention as I can't find a better reason that they would do this. Of course, I could be a cynic and they could be trying to do their part and help Americans with their math skills, but I doubt that's the case. Unfortunately I can't say this really surprises me, as it's indicative of the spin-heavy, consumers-be-damned culture that afflicts Microsoft.
Microsoft "points" are essential to anybody using Xbox Live. Points are needed to download Xbox Live Arcade titles, Xbox Originals titles, add-on map packs, movies, videos, and music. Gamers connected to Xbox Live will eventually want to purchase additional content, so points will be required.The 1600 Points card makes it easy to add points to any Xbox Live Gamertag account. Simply enter the 25-digit code on the console or on the website, and the points are added to the user's account, ready for immediate use. No credit cards or other information is required.Points cards make excellent gifts for Xbox 360 gamers. They also make it easy for parents to budget points allocation and spending over a period of time. Points will also expand the functionality of the console, by allowing the gamer access to more content.Unlike the plastic cards of the past, the newer cards are completely cardboard, with a tear-away strip that exposes the 25-digit number. Once used, instead of tossing away the plastic card, the cardboard card can now be recycled. Unfortunately, the plastic packaging seems excessive, which is my only major citicism of this item.
Basic 1600 microsoft points... spend it wisely because they fly quickly... only bought a theme, a gamerpicture, an episode of family guy, and 2 xbox live arcade games with it, it needs to be able to buy more
Not for sure what I did wrong, but I purchased 800 points thinking this would buy my son some time on xbox live and thought it would alleviate me from having to enter my credit card onto his xbox live.  Well, I received the online code, my son entered it on his xbox and it still asked for a credit card # to verify.  I have no clue what I just did.  I feel like I've been charged for the 800 points and now I'm thinking Xbox has just charged me for something.
It's my nine year old's money that he either earned or received via a gift card.  Hard to watch him spend it on worthless garbage like this but can't argue with the convenience.
It is a point card. Not much to it and its better then risking you card with MS. I rather just real cash transactions.
from microsoft... nuff said?The price is about average which is to be expected... is anyone even reading a review for this....
Wish I didn't have to use points, but it's better than Microsoft taking my financial information and automatically renewing my xbox live membership or something ridiculous like that.
I decided to order this way in order to keep my credit card off of X-box live.  The message I got after ordering was that processing could take up to four hours and that they would send me a link to my redeem code.  Really?  I would be better off to get a Visa gift card to put on X-Box live.  I could recharge it when needed and would not have processing problems.  Not happy.
Xbox Live points are a great gift idea and should be a smooth buy on Amazon. But if you order them with the intent to use immediately, beware. I don't like having to enter my card number at each purchase but it's required. Then since I ordered them recently and chose to purchase again, it took 4+ hours to verify my information. Um, I'm ordering points to use now? Checking the site and email over several hours for my code was annoying. Yes, it's done for security reasons but that's why I enter my Amazon password. After the second 'delayed' purchase, I decided to use Paypal to buy points through my Xbox console.
Typical microsoft points- overpriced and monopolized.Wouldn't purchase other than to quiet screaming brat.What a waste of time and money.
It is what it is.  Best way to buy points, tax free.  Don't bother with in dashboard purchasing.  This is the way to go.
It's like buying online. It's like having some sweets in the pantry for kids who are going to deliver a controlled. To gift also good because children appreciate
Not much to say about t his.  Just look for a good price and buy it.  Can't really go wrong.
Order was just fine, the cost / value of item isn't what it should be. On top of that, the items for which the points are used are most often over priced/valued.These faults are with the manufacturer and not that of Amazon. Thanks
Don't spend money on this type of stuff it only hurts you in the long run. But it does work.
I think that what you  buy with these points are Very over priced for what you get out of them
How Will I Get My Redeem Codes....I have placed my order and got a message that its taking too long and that I would be contacted.
expensive but a must for dlc'sthat's itjust the sad truthMaybe one day, microsoft will make it cheaper, but for now buy it on amazon or not at all
Its great to have these points instantaneously but it really sucks that you have to pay tax, at least I did for 2400 Microsoft Points.I find it rather funny that you have to pay tax to convert your money into something that can only be used for certain items.
temoprary fix, while being deployed, due to the fact that i cant directly purchase them on xbox, because im in a country thats not compatible with xbox servers, other than that no complaints
Takes forever sometimes. It needs to verify faster. I think it is too long to wait 4 hours for some Microsoft points that I need now not later.
I ordered these so I could buy Nights on the Xbox market place. It's nice that they don't expire. but I would rather buy the disc.
Microsoft said they were discontinuing microsoft points. Sadly, they haven't yet. I have to buy 15 dollars worth of points for a 10 dollar item. Waste of money.
Still do not like the MS points system. Though is the standard for now. Waiting for MS to remove them from the marketplace.
Three stars because I tried to redeem the code on the internet thinking copy and paste was easier.  Did not work, Amazon couldn't help and told me to call Xbox.  Xbox suggested I redeem the code through the console and it worked.  Thought I'd save a dollar and buy here, but ended up wasting more time than worth the dollar saved.
Hate the fact that I have to buy MP just to get content from Microsoft but that's what I did, so I guess that just is what it is.
You love em or hate em' they are convenient if you don't want to put your bank card number in the xbox.
Xbox points are specific to regions. These are US points and will not work in Europe or other regions. I found that out the hard way. But I'm sure that they are exactly what they claim to be for Xbox in the US.
why cant you just email us the code??? like wouldn't that be easier for you and the customer??  i probably wouldnt do this again
I first ordered a 1600 point card online code, it worked fine. Then I ordered another one for 2400 points, online code again, and the code wasn't valid, luckily i got my money back but I'm not really pleased with that.
Works only for US accounts but are sold for people with accounts from all over the world....I Cant use it with the account that i already own
I ordered this for my son to be able to add points right away, but it has been over two hours and still no code.  I would have just taken him down the street to gamestop if i had known it was going to be this long.  the problem is you cant cancel your order.
Tis what it tis.
I believe they created there own currency to make the pricing more universal across regions but this just makes conversion annoying. not to mention tougher for a child to comprehend. I'm trying to eplain currency now i have to teach him about currency conversion? Microsoft. for your next console, stick to the nations currency.
They overprice everything unless you catch a sale. I find Sony to care more and treat their gamers better. Nuff said.
Had to use it to buy something on the dashboard. Better than going to the store to buy it. Downloaded fast.
Excellent buy, fast delivery through e-mail.The bad thing is that I didn't know that this points only works for USA accounts, so I still have the code and I can't use it...
This product works in exactly the way it is supposed to, of course.  However, I'm not much of a fan of the points system.  I got this for an extra map pack on gears of war.  Sometimes, it's better just to wait for the game of the year edition.
You can not purchase an online code if you currently live overseas. This is big suck for expats. No matter if you have a balance on Amazon, amazon will ask you for your credit card info "to verify your identity" (yeah right) and then will deny your purchase if your card is not from the US. -sigh-
If you want to rent a movie or buy a cheap game. It is easy to access and amazon does it best.
This item was good and everything worked out good it was really simple to use and a straight forward process
I think it's good if you want to buy a couple indie games, but otherwise, you really can't get anything with it! Microsoft Points are a ripoff!
It says it will take only a minute, then after 5 minutes it errors out and says it will take several hours. And calling the customer service center produces no real results. Just a hard to understand underpaid individual telling me the order will take a few hours, and will either fail or succeed. Well of course it will either fail or succeed, what other option is there...
Unfortunately, this seems to be the most convenient way to buy someone a game on Xbox live, as there is no gifting option from the Xbox.  I had to buy this and send the code to my friend so he could use the points to buy the game.  Kind of a pain but I am at least glad this method is available.  Now he and his sister are addicted to Minecraft.
Microsoft points.Received through e-mailI purchased something through the console.The Product is digital so theres not much to say.
I just hate that you need to pay for access to Xbox live gold and on top of that buying all these points to translate into Microsoft dollars is getting ridiculous. I think Playstation does is much better with free network access.
I had to wait hours before I received the Game Code.  I wouldn't have minded so much if at the time I was purchasing it, it would have notified me of this first.  I was left to worry on whether the purchase went through or not.
i bought it it took a long time to get it its not working right now it said it going to take 4 hours ;{
I like the product because I can play online games on XBOX. Specifically Call of Duty Black Ops II. Good entertainment.
They are points, you use them on Xbox live. You play games then.And best of all, Microsoft doesn't get your private info!
This was a good buy from Amazon. But I still can't believe how much money Microsoft is milking out of our economy. Send some money to my school Bill Gates!
I have purchased MS points from Amazon many times, and I love the convenience of buying just the code without the card. This, however, was the first time I purchased the card and didn't get the free standard shipping. Eight dollars is way too much for S&H on something so small and simple. Mine arrived with the top portion badly bent, so just a few words of advice: buy the code, not the card.
There is nothing special about it, its not even a great value.  On the other hand there is nothing bad about it.  It is the exact same price you can get it for at the store.  However the online code is very convenient, if only there was a way to copy and paste the code onto the XBox...
didnt like how it came in individual 400 points 10x it was really annoying how i had to put in 10 different codes into my xbox
Necessary but expensive.Arrived in time and worked without problem.But again... expensive! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
I'm not quite sure whether this was a good deal or not, I bought it a long while ago but I'm sure the order was fine. 3/5 because of money-grubbing DLC content.
The product, when it finally came was just points to add to Xbox live...no biggie.  However, what was supposed to be an instantaneous transaction online that would have saved me only a few bucks ended up taking 48 hours to process, download, and then subsequently upload to Xbox.Perhaps just buy them from xboxlive.com?  I wish I would have.
We can all be thankful that Microsoft chose to convert to actual currency. In either case, I never recommend people buying these things because 1) you'll inevitably end up not using all the points, or instead needing more than this and 2) the Xbox marketplace is entirely too overpriced. But if this is the only way you'll be able to get access to the content you want, so be it.
pricey but you cant find better anywhere else. its Microsoft, what do you expect? i just dont like that $20 wont get you 2k points
Price was right.  Had a hard time figuring out where to the put the code in on the Xbox.  word required
It's points so whatever, but it took twice as long to be deliver. I was not happy about that. I could see it move through the tracking system and was like "what?!?"
The only downside to buying points, is not they aren't worth it, as they are no longer being used. That and that there was never a discount for buying more points, which most services offer for point cards. it's unfortunate that Microsoft never offered this.
An over-priced money sink. You're better off going outside and interacting with real people.
The service is good.  You can get the code instantly by email.  The main problem is that you can NOT use Amazon gift cards to buy the code.  It requires you to have a credit card.  It's a shame that Amazon Digital does not accept Amazon Gift Cards.
I mean..there is rarely a difference in the price per point, for the most part. Amazon made it easy to get though!
I purchased this as a gift for my son. I don't play on the Xbox / Playstation so I can't really tell you if it's a good deal or. It probably is, but the card states $49.95 and I had to pay $10. more for it.
I managed to purchase this with a discount, so it was totally worth it, but in any other case, I would probably purchase it at gamestop or other gamestore because I can get it then and there and not be forced to wait or pay for fast shipping. You can also purchase microsoft points at the download screen at the xbox live market as long as you input your credit card number if you lack sufficient microsoft points in your account.There is NO need to buy microsoft points in bulk because the retail value of each point is equal in price (I see that amazon currently offers 4000 points for 48 dollars, so you save like 2 dollars), so I recommend buying only enough points to get what you want at the time and buy more if you need more later.I purchased this item for the Noble map pack in Halo Reach, but now I have an extra 800 microsoft points. I am hoping to save it for the next map pack in Halo, but cannot really see myself spending it on things like avatar items.So in sum, this is a great purchase if you can get it at a discounted price or have amazon credit that you wish to use, but would not recommend it at face value.
[...]What has changed?As part of the recent Xbox 360 system update, Microsoft Points are being retired, and transactions on Xbox 360 are taking place using your local currency instead of Microsoft Points - offering you a new, convenient way to purchase exciting Xbox content. This change allows you to use a single Microsoft account to purchase content from your Xbox 360, and apps from the Windows Phone Store for users with a Windows Phone 8!How does this change affect me?You'll use local currency or an Xbox Gift Card (denominated in your local currency), in addition to other current payment methods available in your region, to purchase your favourite content on your Xbox 360. The next time you initiate a purchase or redeem a Microsoft Points card or code on your console with your Microsoft account, we'll add to your account an amount of currency equal to or greater than the Marketplace value of your Microsoft Points, and your Microsoft Points will be retired. The currency we add to your account at the time of the transition will expire on 1 June 2015. However, the currency you purchase and add to your account after the transition will not expire.
I do not understand why Microsoft uses the &#34;point system&#34; instead of just telling the price outright. I mean, what's the point (pun intended), when if you know the price you are more likely to buy it.
when you buy this 'card' for 24.99 expect to pay 25.68....they don't tell you bout the tax.....watch those hidden fees
I bought money. I feel like an idiot, but I've bought more money. It's not even useful money. If I needed food for my family, it wouldn't be considered money.
I am trying to purchase 400 points online game code but it is asking me to use my credit card. I want to use my gift card balance. Any help please?
what more can i say ummmm.... points are points sure i gives you a bit more but yhea... there points
it is okay it did take the full 4 hours to get a code but its better than gamestop because gamestop takes days but other than that its good
Good,to buy some arcade games.... excellent price!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;Xbox LIVE 400 Microsoft Points [Online Game Code]!!!!Amazon congratulationsAtt. Vic H.
I just wish the the price was cheaper. Sometimes Amazon has a discount, but I would like it to be more often.
This is the worst idea ever!, i never now hoy much you are paying for a game/DLC/content since the price is never clear.
Never got it, I've brought it before and received it I've contacted about this but nothing so I didn't try anymore, next time ill buy somewhere else
So I just purchased a 2400 point online code, with my gift cards, everything went through properly I recieved my invoice, but I can't find the code. I've checked the Game library thing, and my email. And There is no code for me to redeem my points, What am I supposed to do?
It does what you need to do. What more could you ask and the price is good to and cool
I am dissapointed with the amount of games available to download thus far. I was hoping for more of the mario games (especially SMB3).
The wii pionts card is a good idea for a gift but if this is for you just order games through your wii. It saves lots of time and there is no point in having to wait for the card when you could get your games right away. Lots and lots of games that you can order, some good and some stupid.
Despite some other comments about this item being kind of expensive on Amazon (At least mine was), be aware that compared to other scratch type cards (ie: calling cards, lotto tickets, etc)this card is kind of difficult to scratch without risking to damage the written numbers underneath the protective coating.I started scratching with a coin as I normally do on this kind of cards and for my surprise it was almost not peeling off at all, so when I increased the strenght and speed I ended up rendering the code unreadable on some characters. I started trying to guess the missing numbers until I was able to redeem my points on the Wii shopping channel, but I was too close to ruining it completely and loose my money. I was lucky this time.Shouldn't be that difficult and complicated to scratch and peel it off.
You simply buy a card for wii points because outside USA you can not buy directly on store the wii points, it is'n allow.And in my country you pay almost 38 dolars for a 2000 wii point card.
Amazon sellers, including Target, are overcharging for this card.  Wiipoints can be bought via the Wii -- this card is not necessary.  That said, one American dollar should buy you one hundred wiipoints.  If you pay any more, you're being ripped off.... of course, at 500 points for even the most primitive NES game (the amazingly generic and unfun Pinball and Soccer, etc.) and 800 for the most rudimentary Genesis and SNES games (Altered Beast), you're already in danger of being ripped off.  So at least make sure not to get ripped off twice!
As long as Amazon keeps this under $20 (face value), and you were meaning to get some Wii points anyway, then this makes a perfect way for you to qualify for free super saver shipping.  In addition, residents in most states do not need to worry about paying for tax, making the few pennies under Amazon's $19.99 price pennies earned.
Buy at SAMS CLUB saw this for a discount price.  DONT PAY FULL PRICE.
After I bought this they raised the price of Xbox Live even more. I'm no longer a payer for that reason. PGR 4 is a solid game however.
would have a much better review if the 12 month gold membership was actually valid
im not big on the game but the deal its self is very awesome and well worth buying :D
Getting the live for 12 months is great but the headset broke in two weeks, this is the 4th headset, none last very long, microsoft should be warranteeing them or making them better.
It's the best deal for a gold membership and you get 2 aditional gadgets for your xbox and one game.
Great deal for everything a kid wants for the Xbox live, The game included wasnt a hit though.
For the price you can't beet it. Got it for $15 more than just 12months would cost. Also the keypad and headset both together are worth $15 alone. The game I couldn't care about as i already own a copy. Pick them up now while they still have them as once the price of live increases to $60 then you'll not get this at this price any more.
Two years ago I bought a $50 gift certificate to give my sister.  I figured on Amazon she could find something that she'd like and I would not make a bad purchase thus disappointing her.  My sister didn't have an Amazon account so had to open one before she tried to purchase something.  At that time everything that she added to her cart could not be purchased because it was either not offered directly through Amazon or it was not qualified for another reason.  My sister told me of her problems and I told her to not worry to just give me the code and I would give her $50 to use on whatever she wanted.  When I tried to apply the code to my account, I discovered it was already used.  I ended up having to use my sister's account to make a purchase for myself with the $50 gift certificate.  When you apply a gift certificate (even if you don't even use it because your order was not successful!) the gift certificate amount is *fixed* to your account.  Therefore, you cannot remove it and give it to someone else.  It created a big hassle for me.  Make sure that the person you are giving it to will be able to buy something s/he wants.  Troublesome.
Gave this puppy as a gift (surprise!). Only took 2 business days to arrive and my friend was able to use it immediately.
DID NOT GET TO USE GIFT CARD - IT WAS THROWN AWAY BY MISTAKE AT XMAS TIME WITH THE WRAPPINGS
I recall purchasing gift cards in the past which were e-mailed to the recipient.  Now you mail a actual plastic card and charge postage?  How 20th Century.
Gift Cards are the truly personal gift.  My only problem is after I received it and could have given it away as a gift I got an email from Amazon - whoops we forgot to activate your card.  Be sure your card is good before giving as a gift.  Amazon is very good about notifying and doing refunds but this could leave a procrastinator in the lurch with a bad gift which really will be good when Amazon knows the problem.  Kudos for the quick second card and I've checked it and it's fully loaded.  Thanks!
What to write about a gift card?Well only thing I would like to mention is that, when I buy a gift card, it would be great if in the order the gift card number is available and the shipping is made optional. I don't see why its necessary to waste the paper, resources to transmit a number to me. All I did was: wait for the card to arrive, scratch it and then enter the number on an Amazon order. Whats the point? If I could, I would have selected deliver code online option and that would be it.Of course: I think Amazon is also on the same bandwagon where vendors expect gift cards to get lost/forgotten about etc.
They are gift cards. They work. However I do not understand why they were shipped by private carrier and not through the Post Office.For me shipping was free but AMAZON had to pay extra meaning the price of something else will go up or a price reduction on other products will not be reduced.
If I won an Amazon gift card I would buy a Blendtec blender and use it to many healthy delicious smoothies!!!
I'm happy to get these for my two children who order from Amazon all the time...however, upon arrival they were very damp, to the point of being wet.  Since they are only cardboard cards so they don't look too presentable as a gift but knowing my children, they won't mind at all...
the card worked fine once i was able to add it to my kindle acct. it's not very intuitive at all thought. but once you are able to add it...it works the way any other card would.
Not much to review. It is simply a gift card. It arrived in the time indicated.
The gift card will be fine.... UPS MISS SHIPED AND AFTER 3 CALLS TO UPS NO HELP AND ON HOLD FOR EVER... THE LOST ONE WILL BE HERE IN 5 MORE DAYS, I JUST ORDERED ANOTHER ONE SO I WILL HAVE TOMORROW..... UPS SUCKS THESE DAYS!!!!
I love Amazon, and order from here all the time.  I was offered a $10 promotion if I purchased at least $50 in gift cards, but I have yet to receive the promotional code to use.
OK, so its a gift card.  There's not much to say about it, but it met my expectations.  So, I'd get it again if I needed one.
I intended giving my son a Kindle Fire for his birthday. I bought the Fire and created a seperate account for his Fire (I don't want him charging my credit card directly). I attached a gift card to the account and then registered the Kindle to that account. I verified that everything worked. I was able to get free books, and free music. Then I tried to get the daily free app and recieved an error message saying I needed to have a credit card attached to account to buy apps.Thinking that couldn't be true I contacted Amazon customer support. After 45 minutes on the phone they confirmed that you can not purchase Kindle Fire Apps (even free ones) using a gift card. You must have credit card attached to the account to purchase apps.In other words, gift cards can't be used like credit cards or cash. There are things you can't buy with them on Amazon.Other than this issue, I'm happy with the Kindle Fire. However, since apps are one of the key kid features on the Fire, I can't help but wonder if it makes sense to gift it to anyone who doesn't have a credit card.
I was orderring a birthday present that I wanted sent to another address via email.  That didn't work and the order was duplicated and MAILED TO ME!  Had to use the cerificates for others - gift certificates 10 - ease of use for website 2.  Highly disappointed in the way this worked particularly since I have been using amazon for over 10 years without this type of problem.And thank you for the invitation to review the purchase.
Gift card are great option, however I bought this for my wife to use with her Kindle. Amazon does not have any method for directing the use to the Kindle. So I have to order the card, then call and get it manually applied to my wife's Kindle account. Then I am told it can only be used on the computer to purchase books, not on the Kindle. There is no information to this affect available prior to purchase. Next time I will look for something else, so my wife can pruchase her books directly from the Kindle, thats why I bought the Kindle.
Gift cards can be lame, but there are so many items available on Amazon.com that the gift card had lots of options for the recipient.
If you receive a gift card, you must register it in the "Your Account" section of your online Amazon account before it can be used. There is nothing in the information that comes with your gift card to tell you this step. Once you have registered your gift card whatever you next purchase or purchases involve, the cost will be first deducted from your gift card balance including Kindle e-book purchases until the balance of the gift card is depleted. Too bad Amazon didn't think to include this information with the gift card.
When I purchased this, and other, gift cards, there was a promotion going that would give me a $5. gift card for items sold by the vender "Amazon".  The code was [[promo_ID]].  I tried copying and pasting it in and typing it in.  When I attempted to use that code on several occasions for items sold by Amazon the code was invalid.  I tried those purchases before the expiration date of 31 Dec. 2009.  This was VERY frustrating.
This was delivered promptly for a fee of $5.95, but I found out the followingday I could have purchased it at my local Stop & Shop without paying for delivery.
Well, everyone loves an Amazon gift card, but I sent it as an email and I'm not sure if the person got it.  How can I be sure?  I didn't want to come right out and say, hey, did you get that gift card I sent you?  Isn't that another way?  Otherwise, THANKS!
I was pleased with my $10 gift card purchase.  It had $10 on it.  Proceeded to buy $10 worth of stuff on amazon for it.  Overall it was $10
Lousy, lousy service. The item is what it is, and was SUPPOSED to have been here nearly a month ago. Unacceptably bad.
Received it expecting a message to accompany it as entered when ordered. Message was not included on card or packaging.
I ordered an Amazon gift card for a birthday present and it took over two weeks, so I canceled and got a credit  I have no idea how it could have possibly taken so long?  I actually thought that it had gotten lost in the mail.
The coffee maker is difficult to fill with water and almost impossible to empty the hot water dispener with out removing the plug from the outlet.
I find it funny that they let you rate a gift card in terms of satisfaction...
The gift cards are fine but I needed to purchase 4 boxes and were not told until much later that it was not possible to order more than 2 boxes with each order.  This delayed my purchase .  I wasn't told until a full day after the order was successfully submitted that it was not possible to process the order.  It should be stated in the details before an order is placed rather than finding out later.  It would have also been nice if we, as a business, could have personalized the cards with our logo as these were gifts to customers.
Don't be fooled.  There is no email delivery with these codes.  You can buy the card and that's nice, but it's not instant.  For instant delivery I bought instead of [...] they sent me the code instantly and I was able to use it right away.  There's also websites like thecardcloset as well, but gamecarddelivery seems good for nintendo points.
Well i got the points... now i just need to figure out how to get my DSI online lol
It came on time And was able to use the points to get a game from the Wii channel. I am quite happy with the card and the game.
You can buy some games, there is not a lot of variety, but they are cheap.Just I buy it to see if it could buy himself more interesting games, but it was not this way, I would not buy it again
Like other reviewers have written, I too have also experienced a delay in getting my code. Amazon seems to be hit or miss with their code distribution - when I purchased an XBL Arcade game-code from them weeks ago, I received the code immediately. 3 hours after purchasing this code, I still have not received it. I really like the idea behind this service that Amazon is offering, but it feels like the execution isn't quite there yet. Bottom line: anybody who reads this should be aware that while you may get your code immediately, there is a chance you will have to wait before getting it.
Well, I was worried on buying the "instant" 12 month + one month free" Online card.  I have never done this before and it really worried me.  And sure enough, as soon as I "Ordered" it and waited forever, I got a message saying that it was taking longer than expected and it would take up to 4 hrs. to process. WOW.Needless to say, I was NOT HAPPY.  After leaving the computer up and constantly checking my results, It finally went thru after almost 2 HOURS.  But, after I printed the information off, I had my son put the numbers in the x-box to make sure the numbers were good.  To my amazement, mu son said the number was good and he could now play!End Review? - I would buy again from Amazon!  It did take a little while, but it did come thru.  Thanks!!
Works like it should
May seem trivial, but I still can't see why I have to pay $50-60 per year to use a device and game I have already paid for.. This is one of the reason I switched to Sony.
the gold live is ok. I dont see much I can do here. Maybe my kids like it better than i do. I bought it for them after all
The 12 month Gold Membership card is the best value but still rather pricey for something that should be free! Microsoft needs some better competition to bring their prices back to earth/reasonable. I'm tired of the half-as s job they do on operating systems, products and services and premium price they charge. They are not nearly as good as they think they are.
I picked this subscription when amazon was having a sale. I got it about 50% off the normal price, so that is good.But I don't know why I keep subscribing to xbox live. Or more importantly why do they keep charging for it. I just feel it is about time that this service became free.*Full Disclosure* I don't game as much as I used to. And the little gaming I actually do isn't online multiplayer. I know I am not getting the most value out of the service I pay for, but it just doesn't fit my lifestlye anymore.So here are the things that Live does very well that I enjoy1) the BEST netflix streaming ui out there2) UFC without a cable subscriptions3) a watered down ESPN, but without a cable subscription.For now I'm in for another year, but we'll see about next year.
Good price... gets the job done. not much else to say. I'm about to sell my xbox, does that help? Ha.
Some of the console systems major titles bring me in but its the indie games that I often find most surprising and fun!
Bought this because it's needed to keep interest flowing to my Xbox which is used for more than gaming. A shame tho, most devices don't require you to buy access to an Internet service you already pay for.
Not your fault.Your just trying to do business.Prices are not that competitive.Hate having to search for these every year.Microsoft aught to make a lifetime membership!
If you want to watch Netflix, all you need is an internet connection, a netflix account and a device to run netflix software.  If you have a PC you are set.  I have a wii, and it works perfectly.  Microsoft, however, has locked the internet from everyone so that you have to pay them (buy this card, etc.) if you want to access netflix.So let's see, ONLY the XBOX 360 extorts you to use an internet connection you already have.  What a scam.So why did I give it three starts instead of 1?  MS now gives you 2 free games each month with your xbox live subscription, so that is pretty cool.  Finally you get something for your membership.As for live playing, I have heard the MS servers are just to match players up and that the player with the fastest internet connection hosts the game on their console, so again MS is charging a premium price for a sub-par service.  Contrast this with Sony who have huge powerful servers to host the games, which is why they are able to allow more players per match because the power is there.
I take my time a few months before last years Gold subscription will run out, and check Amazon's prices on the physical card every day. The price can even vary by the hour I've found. But I have gotten good prices, at least $10 or more below retail this way. It's a good value.
"Xbox Live" should be free, but since its not, you shouldn't ever pay full-price for it.  Grab these cards when they are on sale here for $34~$39.  Don't EVER pay any more than that.Buy your Live cards at Amazon for half the price of "retail."
There's nothing more fun than being able to go online everyday day and being able to talk to and play with friends around the world.  Xbox live is also a great way to meet new people and make new friends.  This can be hard because there are so many immature people on Xbox Live.  I would warn anyone with small children or those who do not like foul language to be careful because never in your life will you hear the F bomb or the N word as often as you do on Live.  Of course there are parental settings and you can keep communications just between friends but still this is one of the biggest downfalls to Live.  Another problem with Live is customer service.  Yes, you can e-mail them or call them at 1-800-4myxbox (good luck getting help there) but the service is terrible.  Even with these downfalls I still have to strongly recommend Live because being able to play videogames over the internet and keep up with friends and family that live far away is too much fun to pass up.
Considering that if you purchase memberships through XBOX online they have a rewards program that give you MS points back monthly this card is only worthwhile when it's on sale. Which was the reason I purchased one and am writing this review.
The service is cool I suppose. A little pricey for what it is though.  Microsoft needs to lower this! Isn't bill gates the richest dude around? Hmmm
I don't use XBL as much as I used to being married with a couple of kids... but it's there when I need it, so I buy 12 months so I only have to deal with it once a year.
i dont know what the differents is to xbox live [grey card] than the [gold card]
Not sure why I have been asked to review a pre-paid code for xbox live. The code worked, and we've extended our xbox live subscription. The product did what it's supposed to, but there nothing else to review.
Well it was a 12 month subscription card for xbox live. When I entered the code it worked, so I guess the product was good.
Wish it was free like PS3 is, I don't play online much so I don't think that people who don't play online much should have to pay as much as people who do.
I purchased this Item back in Feb 2013, and received the card on 2/28/13. I then entered the code on xbox live redeem code. It pulled up 12 month Gold mebership , I redeemed it promptly and thought all was fine. According to xbox live, they can find no record of the code being used. Xbox live suggest that account holders keep the code card the entire time as proof, because a receipt is not enough proof for Xbox Live to credit your account if a problem arises. Fortunately, one call to Amazon customer care representative Shannon, and Amazon is going to send me a code. Good customer serive Amazon... but not so much by Microsoft Xbox live Representitive Farley. Thanks again Amazon!!!
pretty good for the price
Did not want to spend 69.99 plus tax at Gamestop so I purchased here.  And the code that they sent me worked
This is the best price I've seen for 12 month XBox Live cards.  It arrived when it should, and though not quicker than just upgrading to Gold through Live, it didn't take long, and it cost less.  What else is there to say?
Bought it a few weeks ago so that I can access services I already pay for and can access free of charge on all other devices in my home. Then a couple weeks later MS decides to make the streaming service access free on the xbox. Oh well.
wish we could have paid the $36.00 you showed on a web when we were shopping. very upset we did not get it for that price
Xbox live is a smooth running service. This puppy gets 3 stars because of Microsofts dumb paywall that they put all their apps behind.
Xbox Live Gold should be free, we already pay more than enough for the console and games...That said, this is one of the cheapest places to get the Xbox Live Gold card.
Buy this, get 12 months of live gold.  Do I love it?  Nope.  Is it necessary for my gaming addiction?  Yup.  Much nicer than paying the monthly rate by cc, that's for sure.
Its the standard Xbox Live, you buy what you get; the service for a year. not much to say after that.
great game.  My order was processed and I received before the date that was predicted. I trust Amazon to stand behind their sales.
I don't mind paying for multiplayer but I think it's ridiculous so many features are locked behind a pay wall. These experiences are the same on other devices. Not worth the 60 dollars just because you can control netflix with your voice. I'd rather use my smart tv which is free to use with netflix.
I am a young father without much time for gaming. I am very reluctant to pay to use my gaming console which I own for simple &#34;media center&#34; things. HuluPLUS and Netflix are individually subscription based already, why should I pay to have the ability to pay for a subscription?That said, I am currently paying $4/mo for the luxury of less clutter by the TV and using a single interface. I could buy a $50 Roku, but that cramps my minimalist style ;)Pros:-Unlock usage of separate subscription based apps (Netflix, HuluPLUS, etc.)-Play Xbox online with friends (I do have friends on XBL)-Skype-like Video chat online via MS messengerCons:-Why should I pay for things that I pay for additionally? (Netflix, HuluPLUS, etc)Final:I get that the &#34;Xbox network&#34; needs maintained, but why not let Hulu and Netflix maintain that themselves? Wii has allowed them to do that effectively, as has [mostly] Sony.  Roku and all of the other smartTV oems make it free... Why should I pay extra for a paid subscription?Some things would be better with free access(READ: Playstation, Wii, Roku, etc.)
Didn't actually get to use it, there was a problem with registration, but Raul87 provided a refund right away. There was good communication.
Overall, the value of the XBox Live is pretty handy.We use our 360 for a PVR extender from our windows 7 HTPC.It extends Netflix & Pandora additionally into our bedroom.All in all, handy!
This was a great deal at the time, but normally i'd never pay the standard rate as Xbox Live doesn't seem to offer as much as it could these days.
I had a very hard time getting this membership card to work.  I was sent to many people until I finally gave up and bought another one.
Why do I keep paying for this? Every other system offers all this stuff for free... Is Halo really worth this?
I still think I overpay every time I shell more than $40 on XBox Live, but buying this from MS ($60) is never an option. Get if at this price point even if your membership has not expired yet.
You have to have this to do anything online on your xbox. An outdated way of doing things courtesy of Microsoft.
I bought this because it was on sale (at least the cheapest I could find at the time). I been a gold member for 6 years. Every year, I find online a different price for 12months. Last year, was $23 from Newegg. The year before, $33 from Newegg. I mainly use Gold to play multiplayer games with friends.Like:Access MP games.Discount sale to Gold members.Free Games on Demand (Fable 3 for instance).Dislike:Price.Recommend to friend? Yes.
The card worked fine arrived quickly.  I'm just tired of having to pay Xbox for everything. I have 2 kids so we need to order 2 cards its kind of a crock......  I can't even use Netflix on the Xbox without having to pay for Xbox live.  Probably shoudl have went with playstation and gotten a free netowrk to use for online gaming.
Well it is what it is a code card for Live, Amazon's alot cheaper then going through M$ directly. If you want to play your 360 games against other people or watch netflix you need it.
having xbox live is really fun and the product has its moments, but i wish it were less then 40...thats just me
It's pretty much a need for an xbox player, sadly.Gives you access to what really should be offered for free, but it is what it is.At least you can often times find deals on Amazon.
So I purchased a 12 month xbox live membership and received one with 500 Microsoft points on it. I entered the code to redeem the points and the code was invalid. The membership code was good so I guess that I should not complain. :)
You get a lot of great features with Xbox Live Gold, but I'm with a lot of people in saying a lot of those features should be free to use anyway.  So, I can't give this a 5 star rating for that reason.  Otherwise, it's awesome.
We had a hard time trying to figure out how to sign up.  Thought we could do it all on the Xbox, NOT!Went online and did the that way.  They could make it easier and it is IF YOU BUY FROM MICROSOFT using the build in online purchaseing using the Xbox.
I love xbox love i do its just has become expensive i liked it a lot more when it was 40 bucks but hey you gotta pay for whats good better then Playstation network
The price is good, but for the life of me I cannot understand why Xbox live is a paid service when the PSN network has so much more for so much less money.  Well, to each their own.
My kids love Xbox live, so the product is awesome.  But the shipping cost brought it up to the same price I would have paid at the store.  The only reason I got, was I was not planning to go to the store anytime soon, so it saved me a trip.
I'm still kicking myself for not doing more research on a better price!  Right Now, Best Buy has it for $34.99 & I can get 5% back through Discover.  Buy.com had it a few days ago for $36.00.  Guess I should have waited.Anyway,the kids love it, and that's what it's all about.
right now they have a promo on xbox dashboard, i was tempted to get this but i think ill deffenately go with the promo option. its i believe 20% off and u get 1600 microsoft points.  good deal since the prices will go up next year sadly
