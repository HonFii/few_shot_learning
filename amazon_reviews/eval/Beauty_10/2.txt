Great grey/black if that's what you're looking for but I thought it was going to be more of a navy.  My bad.
I really, really want that super-gross pore strip experience of pulling the most disgusting things ever from my nose, forehead, and chin. Alas, these pore strips just don't seem to work for me most of the time. I know I have clogged pores. I can see them mocking me in the mirror. So I cleanse, prep, wet and pray that pore strip onto my nose, wash the dishes and check out People.com, and then get ready for the halelluia moment when I see what gross havoc the pore strip will reveal, and--nothing. It's like I get a little plaster cast of every single blackhead on my nose, but it doesn't actually adhere to anything, maybe one or two. Forehead?--forget about it. China--nada. Every now and then, by the grace of the pore gods, I get a strip to work somewhat, and I feel so grateful to be a normal human being.I have a feeling these strips rely on a certain skin pH as well as proper skin preparation in order for the plaster to adhere to sebum, and pH is something that varies from person to person, and from day to day in the same person, so it might be that Biore and I just don't have chemistry that is making pore magic happen.After using four strips out of the box of 24, following instructions and with no success whatsoever, I contacted Biore to report my dissatisfaction with the product and get some advice on why they might not be working for me. I got a very nice letter thanking me for my helpful feedback and a $10 coupon for more Biore products. I guess they really believe in me and want me to practice.Bottom line: I will use the coupon for more pore strips (because it's the only Biore product I've seen that doesn't have parabens) but I won't actually spend money on them again unless I start getting super fantastic, consistently gross results.
This Dove "unscented" body wash replaces the former Dove Unscented Body Wash in their line.  I find that while this one is just as creamy and nourishing as the original, this one has a lot of fragrance in the product despite its claim of being unscented.  The old version was truly unscented.Comparing this to the new line of Dove body products, it seems that they have increased the amount of fragrance used in all their new products and this new body wash would seem "unscented" by comparison when in reality it should be described as moderately scented.I tried testing this product out on my hands before trying it on my body in case of an allergic reaction, but the scent of this "unscented" body wash was so strong that it gave me a headache from just from the residual perfumes on my hand.  However, my hands did feel soft and more moisturized.A big thumbs down to Dove for false advertising and for discontinuing their true "unscented" bodywash.  NOT recommended for those seeking a lightly-scented or fragrance-free product.
Until I did online research, I assumed that the FDA -- the Food & Drug Administration, which regulates food and medical industries for public health and safety -- would have standards for labeling a product "fragrance free" or "unscented." But, surprise! The FDA does NOT regulate those terms after all. "Fragrance-free" products can and do include fragrances to mask the smell of other nasty ingredients.Apparently, the convention is for manufacturers to claim a product is "unscented" if the manufacturer just covered up the scent of the stinky chemicals (as Dove did in this case). "Fragrance free" would further imply that no additional pleasant scent (like lemon or vanilla) was added on top. Still, by FDA rules, they do have to list "fragrance" in the ingredients if they used ANY fragrance.I myself am not environmentally sensitive, but I have friends who are. I stay far away fromTide HE Original Scent Liquid Laundry Detergent 2 X 50 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)and Bounce 80168BX - Fabric Softener Sheets, 160 Sheets/Box, but I don't expect this body wash to cause similar, dreadful problems for my friends, because the scent doesn't linger. (The scent is a pleasant, light, baby-powder smell.) So, while Dove is not breaking any regulations by labeling this body wash "unscented," even though there is fragrance added, they've let the marketing department mislead and betray their customer base, who has come to expect more transparency from the Dove brand.However, the body wash "stripped" my skin too much in the shower, so I used my trusty olive oil bar soap directly afterwards to help restore some of my skin oils.Not Dove's best effort.
For allergy suffers, like me, it is imperative that we purchase and use products sold as advertised. Based on the bottle label the Dove Sensitive Skin Nourishing Body Wash is unscented. It is not. If you read the fine print on the bottle label it contains the word Fragrance. To me this means the product contains a fragrance/perfume/scent which means the product is not unscented.As for use: The product smells like Dove soap and it does work. Albeit the product made my eyes water when I used it.If you are not sensitive to fragrances/perfumes/scents you might like this product. For me I will take a pass.I do recommend purchasing and using Cetaphil Restoraderm, Skin Restoring Body Wash, 10-ounce or any of the Cetaphil products. They are truly gentle on the skin.Do not recommend.
I am a big fan of Dove beauty bars.  Every (which is not that many) dermatologist that I've run across has suggested them for proper skin care, so there are always bars in our showers.If you used these bars too, you know that they are very mildly scented and generally mild and non-drying to skin.  So imagine my surprise when I tried this supposedly gentle wash for sensitive skin and found that it's not all that gentle.  I tried it on my wind-whipped winter skin and found that it made me itchy.  In fact, there was a slight burning sensation --although the burning was on my chapped cheeks.  Arms didn't burn, but were itchy.This left me wondering where the moisture was.But the real negative to me was the smell.  It wasn't mildly scented like the bars, and it certainly wasn't unscented.  To me it had a very strong, too strong, chemical smell.  It was strong enough that I feel compelled to warn people with the kind of asthma that can be 'set off' by chemical smells to avoid this product.I can't recommend it to anyone.
Even though this is a lower sulfate formula, it lathers quite nicely.  The fragrance is a pleasing apples & vanilla scent that is not very strong.  It rinses out easily.The problem I have with this shampoo, and some other shampoos for colored hair, is that it leaves my hair feeling dry right after the rinse, while the hair is still wet.  It's hard to explain, sort of like it's tangled and scratchy, not healthy feeling.  It makes it necessary to use more conditioner, just to get everything feeling smooth.  Over time, this eventually leads to my hair looking dull.So while I liked the lather and fragrance, I'll stick with the shampoos I've found that leave my hair smooth and feeling good before the conditioner step.
I'm prone to breakouts in the summer months so I gave this a try. My skin had the same reaction initially to it as when I used Retin-A in the past. It got a bit dry and itchy. But unlike with Retin-A, I didn't notice any clearing of the area from breakouts in the following days so I stopped using it. Can't say it was effective enough to want to try again at this point.
Well, I tried to give this product the full 6 weeks, but decided to abort the operation a bit early. I'm in my 40s, have had acne to some degree since I was 9 and have tried everything, including prescription meds. My acne isn't severe, just persistent. This product feels nice, although the toner burns a bit, and doesn't leave my face dry and flaky. The smell is odd, but not unpleasant. The drawback is that now I'm getting blemishes in places where I really never got them before! I've been using this for several weeks, long enough for whatever might be "lurking" under my skin to have arrived and disappeared, but am still getting at least as many blemishes as before starting this program. Back to the benzoyl peroxide!
Anyone fighting acne like I have for the past 2 years, theres a procedure called Levulan. It's worth it. It's like a peel, but not as harsh or drastic. My skin has cleared 98% after 1 treatment. I only purchase organic/animal cruelty free products and while natures gate is a great product, I didn't really care for all the steps to cleaning my skin.
Granted, not every product will work for every person, but 10 days into this and I notice no difference at all in my teen's skin.  She was really looking forward to seeing  the difference.  I can see by the other reviews that they have had success with the product, but we have not. I will give it a bit longer and update this review if needed.
"Natural" does not equal healthy or good for every person because each person is different.  This three step program from Nature's Gate is a great example of this fact.  The program is for 6 weeks but after 4 weeks I've learned enough.  Note: I used the product as directed for 2 weeks then needed to make adjustments because of reactions.The Corrective Cleanser is ok but never feels like it truly washes away from my skin.  It did seem to clear things well.The Calming Toner never really seemed to do much and this is partly because I found the instructions unclear.  How much should I put on the cotton ball?  Should it leave my face wet, dry, somewhere in between?  The imbalance in instructions equaled less toner than cleanser over all.Oddly the Controling Lotion was both a positive and a negative for me.  On my cheeks and forehead it worked great.  Good moisture with no feeling of greasiness.  But on my chin and the space between mouth and nose I saw increases in breakouts, in places I never have them.  When I stopped using the lotion, the breakouts lessened but didn't completely stop.That's a problem since this product is supposed to stop them.  Clearly for my skin this is not a very good product so I will now stop using it after this review.  The two stars is because I think the lotion was good for some parts of my face and over all the program was easy to follow.  Your own skin will react differently.
Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strips by Biore are supposed to remove the gunk that gets trapped in the pores around your nose.  It is a nice idea and I'm sure it does wonders for some people, but my experience was not very positive with the first 2 strips.  I followed the directions precisely and found that when I tried to remove the strip, I was only partly successful.  A significant portion of the strip stayed stuck to my nose and was difficult to remove.  Where the strip had not been torn, I noticed that it was able to grab some of the gunk from my nose, but on balance it removed less than it left.  I suppose I will try, try again.
This product works better than I expected, but not as well as I would like. It does remove some of the blackheads, but not all of them, and repeated usage doesn't improve on that. My nose does look clearer, but after a month of weekly use my pores are not any smaller. At $1.00 a strip, I'd rather invest my money in a good face wash.
First of all heat is not recommended for daily use on hair but because Remington claimed that "The Remington Style Therapy: Damage Therapy 1-Inch Flat Iron features plates covered with ceramic fabric for 50 percent less hair splitting and damage. Ceramic Fiber creates more styling surface than flat, slim plates. This added surface helps prevent hairs from rubbing against each other, thereby reducing a major cause of splitting and damage" we decided why not give it a shot.The flat iron does heat up pretty fast but did not straighten my daughters hair, so she was constantly trying to redo portions of her hair. With all that heat being constantly applied to her hair, her hair started looking crunchy and frizzy which is what this is not supposed to do. Because of all the constant retouching it takes a very long time to get her hair done as well. So not worth the time and effort.I'm really surprised at all the glowing 5 star ratings but this just isn't for everyone.
This flatiron is quite disappointing  i was trying to get rid of frizz. The hightest heat setting did not get hot enough to straighten my hair.
I tried this straightener and I found with my first use that it is not for me.  First off the control panel is right where you hold it, so I kept turning it off every time I lifted it up to straighten a piece of hair.  So I'd turn it back on again, go to straighten another piece and off it went again.  Once I made myself conscious of this and held it without pressing the buttons, I found that the plates were so slippery that it flew through my hair.  I'm guessing it is better for thinner, finer hair, not thick hair like I have and that is why it is so slippery.  If your hair is damaged, it won't stay on it for long, so I guess that is why it was made for damaged hair.
I chose this lotion for my daughter. I've used a variety of Eucerin products in the past and have been pleased with them. I had hopes that this one would work well for her as she has quite a bit of redness/irritation on her face at times. I also liked that it contains sunscreen.She was not happy with the lotion. She didn't like the smell- although I don't particularly notice it. And she was especially disturbed that it was green. Of course it is clear when rubbed on the skin. But she did drip some on her shirt, and it wasn't clear.Overall, I was pretty disappointed in this. I did see a slight reduction in redness in her face. But I'm not sure the benefit outweighs the negative things about this lotion.
I don't like this at all. It feels heavy, greasy, doesn't soak on for a long time (takes hours and I don't slather it on) and even then I can still feel it on my face. I like the feeling of "nothing" on my face, and I get that with other moisturizers, such as Olay Total Effects. The green color of the lotion does help to immediately tone down the redness, though. And it has licorice root for a cumulative effect on the redness. Made in Germany.
I loved the idea of Hydroxatone AM/PM anti-Wrinkle Complex - anytime a product can do double duty I'm all for it, particularly because apartment living limits the available medicine cabinet space.This cream did not live up to that all-in-one promise. It is a thick cream so it does feel suitable for nighttime use.  Day use, however, did not work for me.  The cream was thick enough to interfere with my foundation and my face looked greasy.  I had to dig out some pressed powder to cut out the shine which added time to my morning routine.I walk about a mile or so to the train and I don't know if it was because of the greasiness of the formula or because the sun screen is not adequate,or something in the product made my skin more sun sensitive, but on a day with strong winter sun I got a little pink in the cheeks - and I'm not that fair.  Reminded me more of tanning oil than sun screen.Can't comment yet on the anti-wrinkle aspect of this, but it is thick enough so it might work with twice daily use.  I'll be limiting my use to nighttime only.
The product is advertised as anti-wrinkle and is supposed to serve "as your daytime moisturizer, your nighttime moisturizer, your anti-aging treatment and SPF 15 sunscreen." I have not used it long enough to judge it's wrinkle-fighting properties but the box says it contains Argireline which was recently developed to combat wrinkles.Speaking of the box, the ingredients listed there are not identical to the list as it now appears on the Amazon description, so if your skin is sensitive, get out your reading glasses before you open the container and read over the long list on the box. Unfortunately the typeface is small and the pretty silver on blue color scheme does not offer much contrast. I'll mention a few of the ingredients below.Several ingredients are supposed to be sunscreens adding up to SPF 15.  However, some of these ingredients are controversial and may not protect that well. Octinoxate (which is misspelled on the Amazon description as of 1/10/2013) is considered fairly safe although EWG [Environmental Working Group] says "Estrogenic effects are noted in laboratory animals as well as disruption of thyroid hormone and brain signaling."Another sunscreen in this product, Oxybenzone, is considered somewhat risky by researchers. EWG's Skin Deep Cosmetic Database cautions that it may cause "Biochemical or cellular level changes" and is associated with photo allergic reactions. Furthermore, it contaminates the bodies of 97% of Americans according to the Centers for Disease Control research.Octocrylene is another sunscreen in this product that has dubious utility. Wikipedia says "This organic compound can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer. This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA damage and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-user." Whoa, that's alarming!Even the vitamin A in this product is controversial. Here's what I found: In the presence of sunlight Retinyl Palmitate (vitamin A) may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions. Also, the FDA (USA) has raised a concern that  daily skin application of vitamin A creams may be undesirable for women of child-bearing age.DMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative and sometimes causes an allergic reaction. As far as I could tell, most of the other ingredients in Hydroxatone seem to be safe. But I would not use it as a sunscreen due to the concerns mentioned above.I thought the cream felt smooth on my face although it did not comfort my winter-dried hands at all. I suppose that is because it is non-greasy. Anyway, now that I have read up on the ingredients I cannot recommend this product for daytime use.
It's rather cold out when I've been trying this making this more of a challenge, and I do have sensitive skin.  Been using it twice a day for weeks and am having to switch to a product that works better and costs a great deal less. Whether the issue is that it's not as good for sensitive skin as it claims, or if the moisturizer just can't keep up with the cold temps is a question I'm  unable to answer.Diminishes the look for fine lines and wrinkles?  Possibly, but if so, only a very small amount and not enough to replace a better working moisturizer.This isn't worth the price.
I found this cream to be heavy on my skin, and I have yet to notice any results, although I have not used it the full six weeks. The jar is small; 1 ounce.  The first ingredient in this product is water, the second is Sesame Oil.  I think I'll be sticking to my favorite of face creams, Olay Pro X.
I've been using this Hydroxatone for a few weeks and sadly I don't look any younger yet - in fact I look a few weeks older since I've been using this product.  In all seriousness, the metrosexual side of me does prompt me to use a face cream daily to at least attempt to slow down the relentless march of Father Time.For me the number one thing I look for in a face cream is SPF protection because the sun is the key ager...this cream has SPF which is good.  Then I look for retinol-type ingredients to hopefully give me some good old fashion bio-chemical skin cell regrowth (hopefully) - from what I can tell this Hydroxatone does not have retinol but more along the lines of organic all natural type ingredients probably derived from various wives tales passed down from the ages of man.  I like face creams that don't make my skin all greasy and oily and being a man I prefer low sheen - I found this Hydroxatone to be a bit on the oily side for my tastes and made my skin a bit too shiny.  Lastly, I like a good value price point since I use a face cream regularly - $40+ is a bit too pricey for me for a product unless it really is turning back the hands of time.So in consideration of above I rate this product 2 stars out of 5 in consideration of my usage needs and price/value.  I'll stick with my Neutrogena for Men at $15 with a nice non-oily, low sheen experience.
I won't be buying this for myself.I've tried several different wrinkle creams.  This one was slightly greasy and made my skin develop a lot of little pimples.Just to be fair, I'm going to try it again to make sure it was the cream that caused the pimples.  But I'm sure it was.  I don't have oily skin and rarely get pimples.I can't recommend it.
Ever been tempted to buy some really compelling 'new' product 'as seen on TV?  I have.  With two exceptions (very cheap $10 ones) they were fairly worthless.  Some years ago, I was sorely tempted to get something, and knew its purchase would make a major dent in my budget.  I googled it, and found, of course, some pithy critiques. After that, I never made a buying decision without researching a bit. More recently, however, the companies themselves have managed to make use of those websites.  Now if you google 'hydroxacut reviews' you will find links that suggest they include negative and positive reviews, but you won't find a negative review.  You'll find instead rousing testimonials that rival those of the infomercials.  Even Consumer Reports can be bought.Amazon, on the other hand, features most everything offered anywhere else, on television or off.  Its customers give you the real 'skinny' on whether the product is worth its costs or not.  It's a bit confusing that this particular product is offered at so many price points, but I do like the reviews, and I find Amazon's customers much more credible than tv actors or voice-overs. Thanks to all of you for your many considered opinions.  You've saved me thousands over the years! Amazon is an impressive vendor, and its customers are even moreso.
This is a pretty good moisturizer, but as far as an anti-wrinkle cream, I've noticed no difference at all. I was hoping it would lessen the crows feet around my eyes and I also have a some wrinkles on my forehead just above my nose, between my eyebrows and it hasn't done anything to make that less pronounced.  I have sensitive skin and this cream did not irritate my skin at all, so that was a plus, but since I got this cream through Vine for free, I thought it would be OK just as a moisturizer, and then I looked at the price-HOLY EXPENSIVE COW! I would say pass on this one if you're looking for real results, but if you have sensitive skin, want a moisturizer, and have money to burn, then, hey why not, I guess ?!
I'm not old, but my age is starting to show and why not nip it in the bud before it's too late, amirite?I ordered this anti-wrinkle complex with the hopes that it would prevent wrinkles from appearing in my skin. The more I used it, the more I began to notice the little wrinkles setting in. Not caused by the cream, surely, but the cream is definitely not doing anything to fight them off.The cost is just far too high for a simple moisturizer (I do like how it feels, thus the 2 star rating), but there are many other fine products out there who do the same for a much lesser cost.
Cons:Waxy textureNo difference in skin texture or fine lines after 2 weeks of consistent useThe first two ingredients are water and sesame oil-- no "magic" there!Feels slightly greasy when appliedCostPros:Did not irritate my sensitive skinI tried this product as an alternative to a similar drugstore brand I normally use. I will definitely go back to the drugstore brand, which is a fraction of the cost and feels much richer and creamy.
I waited with much anticipation and hope for this product to arrive from Amazon.  It's supposed to be for "mature" skin which I'm not sure if I have quite yet at the age of 44. What will my skin be considered when I'm 74?Anyway, the container is a very bright blue but that's the only positive thing about the container.  I detest containers that require me to stick my finger in the jar.  I'm always sure I must  be getting the rest of the product loaded (although my hands are always washed) with germs every time I stick my finger in the jar.  The consistency of the product is a bit weird.  It's a cross between a heavy cream and petroleum jelly.  For the consistency, I thought it would be more moisturizing and too heavy for  my oily complexion.  I found that it did not moisturize as well as i expected but it did feel weightless on my face which is good.  There is no fragrance to speak of either which is another positive.I ended up having to use this ( pricey) cream and then using another (not so pricey) moisturizer which i already had afterwards to make my face feel sufficiently moisturized.  It might match my face's moisture needs better in the spring or summer rather than now in winter when my skin tends to be driest.
I jumped at the chance to try Hydroxatone, without dealing with the parent company since I heard a lot of consumer reports on the free trial offer.  All in all, the product is greasy for those who have oily and combination skin. I used a tiny bit to get better less greasy results, but tiny bit will not help make this a sunscreen, and it does not even have and UVA sunscreen ingredients so it really isn't much of a sunscreen.  This product did not work for me.
I used to work as a stylist so I know a little about blow dryers.  Aside from the color, I was excited about trying this dryer out and liked the idea of a retractable cord.  Unfortunately, form does not follow function.The dryer is plenty hot, but airflow is very weak.  My old compact dryer blows more air and as a result, is easier to use and style with.  My guess is the retractable cord in this unit is the culprit.  The mechanism has to go somewhere and I think the power of the motor blowing the air suffered as a result.  I think if you have longer hair, this dryer with the included diffuser would yield ok results, but it's pretty much useless otherwise.*********UPDATE********I guess the other people who sang the praises of this 'foldng' blow dryer never actually tried it because it does NOT fold.  That's an error in Amazon's description and in those reviews.So again, very nice idea, but disappointing.  This should be a blow dryer first and a cord retractor second.  As it is, the dryer suffers.  Sounds good on paper, but...
While this product wasn't awful, it was rather disappointing. For $12, you get two exfoliating pads and two sets each of hand and foot treatments (consisting of gloves or socks with moisturizer inside). That's four treatments total (two for hands, two for feet), at a cost of $3 each.It would be a good deal if the exfoliant or the moisturizer were effective, but that wasn't what I found. The exfoliant seemed ineffective, and the moisturizer in this product was pretty minimal. Honestly, I would have had better results with a really good, thick hand or foot lotion -- and that's what I'd recommend you try, too.
This hand and foot treatment doesn't work well and is too much work to to. Having to apply these socks and gloves is just too much work. Too many steps. "Intensive 1-step moisturizing & Conditioning" I think not. You have to apply scrub you hands or feet and then apply the sock or glove. That is more than one step.For me this did exactly what apply Vaseline or lotion to my hands and feet twice a day did. This just reduced it into having to do it once. I didn't really care for this.
but THIS product wasn't it.I'm still getting over the "yuck" factor after taking the gloves off my hands. is that moisturizer in it? My hands are sticky, unlike any moisturizer I ever used!I started with the gloves. After reading some reviews, one of the complaints seemed to be that the hand moisturizer didn't really do much. I soaked my hands for a minute in warm water to open the pores and make it more ready for the glove treatment.The gloves are surprisingly well made (I'm amazed they're made to be thrown away. If you can stand the way they feel - which is utter yuck - they'd be great to keep and use for some other purpose.)You're supposed to leave the gloves on for 15 minutes. I never watched a clock so intently; the sensation was absolutely horrible. My fingers felt pruney, the way you get when you're in the bathtub too long. I can't express exactly how much I HATE that sensation! Utter ugh.I removed the gloves, and my hands just felt sticky, kind of waxy but without the wax. Once I let them "dry" off, so to speak, my skin did get very soft, which surprised me - I usually don't associate a good result with a horrible process. I'd recommend that if you use this, rub the "lotion" around on your hands a bit before you get the urge to wash the stuff off. Wait a few minutes. You WILL be surprised with the result.Onto the foot product. I wear a size 10 shoe, so I wasn't expecting that the booties would be an easy fit. I was not disappointed. Since this product is made in China, it seems as if they used foot-bound geishas as foot models. American girls have bigger tootsies than China dolls! How about a small-medium and medium-large size range for these booties?I actually liked the foot exfoliator. I used it after soaking my feet in a foot bath. I usually use a pumice stone afterward, but the exfoliator was a pleasant surprise. Now the booties were a different story. I had to snip the tops to get my foot in, and I had the same yucky sensation as the gloves. It's a little easier to take on the feet, though; I kept squishing my toes around.I have callouses on my feet from sandal wearing, so this stuff sorta, kinda worked. But since I'm pretty diligent with keeping up with the callouses via my trust pumice stone, I wasn't in the "cracked, dry" category.The result, after removing the socks, was the same as removing the gloves: if you can WAIT a few minutes, the stuff gets absorbed, the waxy, icky feeling goes away, and yes, your feet are smoother and softer. It's just having to endure how it...did I say "yuck"?...FEELS meanwhile.I just can't recommend this product, but that's because I absolutely loathe the pruney, dimpled feeling you get when you use them. The product does, after a fashion, work and the scent is nice, but a product that makes my skin crawl while using it, no matter how nice the result, is NOT indicative of any spa experience I ever had!
I received this mascara in brown, and I have mixed feelings.  On the one hand, it didn't flake one bit, which is wonderful.  I have a allergies and tend to rub my eyes, and it stayed on beautifully.  On the other hand, it didn't do what I expect a mascara to do.  It didn't thicken my lashes at all.  It lengthened them a little bit, but they still look very thin.  If you're looking for a natural look, or maybe you're a blonde who just wants some color to make your blonde lashes show up better, this would be okay.Footnote: After another full day of wearing this mascara, I'd like to up my rating to 3 stars, but the site's not letting me.  I'll just put it into words.  This mascara's staying power makes up for its lack of thickening.  It simply does not flake!  Maybe it's just fresher than other mascaras I've used, but it I don't think that's it.  No brand new mascara I've ever worn is this flake-resistant.
I was not the least bit impressed with this product. The first time I tried it, it was seemed to vanish within a couple hours, and barely put any color on my lower lashes. It never really lengthened or thickened my lashes. The scond time I tried it, it took about three coats to get the mascara to even color my lower lashes. I did get longer upper lashes as a result of putting a lot of it on, and while it did not clump, all it took was a little eye watering to make me resemble a raccoon.I'll stick to the cheap waterproof stuff.
I was really looking forward to trying this, but it unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations.It was easy to put together and worked fine. I didn't find it too harsh but I think I might be allergic to the soap as I got a rash after my second use.It would be nice if the puff were soap free and  you could use your cleanser of choice. Also the refills look really hard to get, Amazon has them on backorder as does other internet sites I checked.If I hadn't had a reaction to the cleanser I would have liked this, it's a good product for the price.
I'm a guy. So ladies, you can move on to another review of this product...because though we all have skin, the genders approach taking care of it in different ways, have different goals, and have different limits to what they'll put up with.Using this product for 1 to 2 minutes on each facial area is time consuming. It just doesn't fit into my morning or evening toilette. I chose to do it in the morning & was nearly late for work each time. The first time I used it, I thought my skin felt like it was a canvass ready for make-up. (So ladies, if you are still reading & that's what you want: buy!)After using it as instructed, I have to say I'm not impressed. I don't think my skin is rejuvenated or more radiant. Using it on my face was reminiscent of a ride on a wooden roller-coaster. It leaves you kind of dizzy & light headed (so two stars for the nice head-trip). It really just vibrates the little pad. So I'd say it's the perfect machine for anyone with a broken wrist or those with carpal tunnel syndrome so bad they can't rub a pad across their face.Katherine Helmond's character in the movie "Brazil" would probably use this and like it.
I've been using this product for over a week.  The idea of a foaming unit with a cleanser sounded good.  And it does get my face very clean - but that is a benefit of the cleanser on the pads, not this machine.  The name "Power Cleanser" is misleading.  I was disappointed the unit does not provide much foaming action.  I had to run it over my face many times before I saw any foam. So, I decided to test the results just using the pad without the unit.  Turns out my face is just as clean and I got just as much (or little) foam without it! Neutrogena is trying to jazz up foaming face cloths, like Olay's, with some battery power, but it just isn't needed. They'd be better off just offering their own version of Olay cloths.In addition, I used it every day as instructed, but found that my face got a little dry after a few days.  So, I wouldn't recommend using this more than a couple times a week.  Overall, it isn't any better than buying some of Neutrogena's high quality cleansers - no batteries needed.
You would think and electronic makeup remover and the brand name of Neutogena would be a top notch product. Well, this Wave Power Cleanser hardly does the job. The cleansing pads that come with this power tool are useless and overall there is not enough power to get the job done.I recommend you use the old fashion way of cleaning your face- with a bottle soap and a wash cloth. The product is not worth the price or the time.Katiebabs
my 14 year old daughter had high hopes for this product as it is endorsed by a popular actress these days. it felt as it the included cleanser pads would be gentle enough but it irritated her skin nonetheless. she also didn't like the smell of the cleanser. she didn't want to use it at all and wanted me to just send it back. it's not that it didn't work, it did. she just didn't like it.
I waited to write a review in order to give this product a fair trial. Did it impact stretch marks?  No.  Spots? Nope.  Dry skin? Well, maybe initially but nothing lasting.  I truly saw no difference at all with regard to skin spots or stretch marks or scarring.  I tried it out on my hands to alleviate dry skin.  I was surprised that it did not leave oily residue on my hands as I had expected it to.  The scent is very nice.  My hands seemed soft and smooth but this did not last more than about 5-10 minutes.  Perhaps this product works well with other types of application that I did not try but since the application mentioned above are those that interest me, the product did not prove to be of personal value.
Ihave some Aging Skin, and a Scar, too, so I was prepared to try this product and see how it works.They tell you right up front that it takes twice-daily applications for at least three months before you can expect the magic to take place. I will come back after three months and let you know how it worked.However, I can see some real problems immediately.This stuff is very oily, doesn't absorb nicely into the skin as a moisturizer would, and has a strong scent. The closest thing I can come up with for comparison is the old Bain de Soleil tanning oil, which explains why I have Aging Skin.It also stains fabric. So applying this morning and night is no picnic. If your Aging Skin or scar is on your face, you will have oily, glistening Aging Skin or scar, and if it is on your body, you can anticipate stains on your sheets and clothing. Hours after application, it continues to feel slick and oily. The smell lingers, too.The ingredients include vitamins and plant oils (lavender, chamomile, stuff like that)and a duck-gland oil which carries the active ingredients and keeps those vitamins perky. Clinical trials suggest that there may be some benefit, though the ones reported at the website are vague, relying on subjects having noticed some improvement.I think that walking around smelly and greasy for three months would induce a desire to believe that it had all been worth it, which might explain the positive responses.As I say, I will come back and let you know.
I have to admit I suffered from oily skin all through my youth and young adulthood so maybe I shouldn't be surprised that now that I'm in my forties a product with the word oil in it is still too greasy for my face.  I will say Bio-Oil works fine for me as a moisturizer for my hands, feet, elbows etc. but I all ready have body lotion products I like that work as well and with a more pleasant scent for less money though granted a little drop of this stuff does go a long way.  I also tried Bio-Oil on some stretch marks and saw no improvement after a couple of weeks.  Everyone is different so I'm willing to believe this product may do miraculous things for some people but I am not one of them.
This shampoo gets the job done but I found it pretty so-so. I prefer Suave or VO5, which has pleasant smells and I feel as if my hair is much cleaner. This shampoo is nice to the touch but other then that it's pretty bland. I wouldn't purchase it if I had the choice.Katiebabs
This shampoo was not a big hit in our home.It has an unusual smell.  It is not exactly flowery, but it has an almost chemical smell that is pretty strong.It leaves a greasy feeling residue.  Even after repeated rinsing, hair feels slick and greasy and just doesn't seem to come clean and rinsed.I usually like 2 in 1 shampoos because of the convenience and ease of using only one product.  However this shampoo just didn't work for us.
I was sold on the word 'lavish', but it was not the case for me, who does end up splashing out a little bit more for deeper and higher quality conditioner.  A great clean of a shampoo, for sure, but the conditioning aspect left me wanting.  If you have dry hair or even color your hair, dont rely on this product to provide the conditioner that you need, you will still need to add conditioner.  lost a few stars as the description was not totally true to form.
After towel drying my hair I applied about 3 tablespoons of this foaming wrap lotion to my long fine hair and then blow dried for a lightly curled look.What I like about this lotion is that it permits very light styling. However, this means that I cannot put a comb through my hair after styling if I want the style to stay.What I dislike is that the lotion has an awful smell that thankfully dissipates quickly.  I cannot describe the scent. Also, the lotion looks like soapy water when being dispensed.  I expected foam not a sudsy look.Overall, I feel I can get the same styling ability for my fine hair withSunsilk Anti-Flat Weightless Volumizing Creme with Collagen-C - 7 Ozwithout the negatives.  It's an okay product and although my hair smelled very clean and fresh after styling, the smell of the product and the liquid suds when dispensed really turned me off.  This is not a styling product I would buy for me.
I ordered several projects from the Motions hair line. Prior to the last order, I ordered their curl butter and another product and was totally dissatisfied. With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same. I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark. I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future. Not only did they do what they said they'd do, after the 1st hour or so, but the residue and build up in my hair, caused me to have to cut sections of my hair to get the residue and knots out of my hair. Out of the 9 products I tried there were only two that did anything for me and that was moisturizing cleanser and the deep conditioning hair masque. These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized. I can actually run a comb or brush through it without pulling out plugs. I only wished that Motions' other products worked as successfully as these two did.
I usually use a wrap my hair when I want t roll it up. I followed the directions and used the products mentioned. It did not work as good as my other product. This left my hair dry and needing moisturiser . I found this product dull and left my hair limp. Even with the rollers my hair just layed flat and half curled. Did not do much for my hair.
So far I am liking majority of the Motions hair line products. But this has got to be my least favorite. This product is so drying its ridiculous! That's because it contains alchohol which does not mix well with my hair. I have tried this on wet and damp hair but it's not for me. I give up.
I think they're trying to make a cirtus scent with this product, but it's way over done in my opinion. I have reviewed several of their other products as a top 1000 vine reviewer, but I haven't been pleased with any of them mainly because of scent.My other reviews are here:Motions Naturally You, Moisturizing Cleanser, 8 OunceMotions Naturally You, Deep Conditioning Masque, 8 OunceMotions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil, 8 OunceI can say this has an excellent pump. The formula is very liquid/ water like, but foams up really nicely with the pump. I won't use though afterall...
I did not like the results. My hair was sticky and hard. As if I put gel in it not a foaming lotion. The smell was pleasant however. I will try to see if using less makes any difference in the texture I get.
I used this product on my daughter who is African American/White mix.  Since she wears her hair in a pony tail almost all the time I thought this product could help control some of the frizz that we have in the morning.  I combed it in after shampoo and conditioner but this made her hair too sticky.  She was in tears by the time we were done.  This product did not work well for us.
Motions At Home Foaming Wrap Lotion didn't work very well for me. My hair is too fine for this. It left my hair a bit sticky and looking dull. People with heavier, courser hair seem to have better luck with this product.
The conditioner did seem to untangle somewhat.Unlike most conditioners, it did not feel creamy when applied to my hair.I found no shine and my hair was dull and a bit wild.My hair felt heavy as if the product left a residue.
Applied as directed and after towel drying and brushing it made my hair smooth and manageable, no flyaways.  My hair is medium, but remember this is designed to make medium-to-coarse textured hair soft, silky and manageable.I useD about a quater size squeeze and my hair is about 4 inches below shoulder.  I did not like the smell.
This conditioner did not leave the hair soft and silky but rather thick-feeling and heavy. There was no noticeable difference in the shine. A plus is that the scent is very neutral, neither perfumed nor chemical.Definitely disappointed in this conditioner and would not buy it.
My hair is damaged from coloring and I used this conditioner hoping for a miracle. Unfortunately, I did not get it. The conditioner is very thick, I have short hair which is chin length and I needed a palm size portion to cover all my hair. The smell reminds me a hair saloon when your hair is wet, but not when dry.  After my hair was dried and straight ironed, it was coarse and dry.Unfortunately this product did not work for me, but after reading the reviews this product does seem to work for a large percentage of users.
I was eager to try this as my somewhat wavy hair is super dry.  This is a leave in product, and when I tried it I was thrilled because I could easily detangle my hair with just my fingers (I have terrible tangles).  It felt really smooth and soft.  It dried feeling a bit heavy but I was okay with it...but by that evening, the weight of the product felt very heavy and almost oily.By the next morning, it was too oily to go without washing.  My hair still was tangle free, but at the cost of looking dull and dirty.But the weird thing is, even after I washed it with a different shampoo and conditioner, the tangles were still gone.  It's as if it detangled my hair for longer than I expected. To that end, I plan on using this at least once a week, even with the heaviness, because not fighting the tangles is worth it.  I just wish it was lighter on my hair so I could skip a wash.
Despite the target audience, I did not believe it would be a beneficial moisturizer or would effect a shining head of hair no matter its ethnic origin or condition.My hair simply felt heavier, looked somewhat darker and lifeless.Biosilk is an excellent product to try and use this one sparingly.
I have blond, curly hair (I'm causasian) and like to use hair lotions to smooth out my hair. I thought I would try this, but reconsidered when I saw the first two ingredients are water and mineral oil. On the bottle it say &#34;with Shea Butter and Five Vitamin Blend&#34; but after looking at the ingredient listing, Shea Butter is at the very bottom of the list after more than 20 other ingredients!!! You're really not getting much Shea Butter in this product.Also, if you are sensitive to Gluten or Wheat, be aware this product has wheat germ oil, so you will not want to get this near your skin, scalp, or hair.The fragrance in this product, like the other &#34;Motions&#34; hair products are way overdone and artificial smelling to me. EWG's Skin Deep Database (which you can google and find on-line) lists Motions fragrances in the High Hazard range. Quote: Ecotoxicology, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Miscellaneous, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive)If you want some good hair lotion, I would recommend pure Shea Butter. My favorite is available from &#34;Mountain Rose Herbs&#34; and is totally &#34;all natural&#34;, smells wonderful. It is used by women in Africa and in this natural form is the very best way to moisturize your hair!
While this product may be decent enough in its moisturizing ability, I won't be using it again because I just didn't care for the scent. It's hard to describe. I detect a bit of papaya (which I like) in it, but there  are some other scents I just cannot pinpoint. After putting it in my hair I just wanted to wash it out. This is purely a subjective matter and there may be others who like this scent.The other problem with this product is that the first 2 ingredients are water and mineral oil. The good ingredients, like Shea butter and jojoba oil, come way towards the end.
Motions at home Oil Moisturizer LotionThe bottle spilled some of the contents in the packaging, and I could smell the scent of the moisturizer. It is very overpowering and smells too sweet. The lotion is extremely greasy and oily. I found that it wasn't effective in keeping my hair soft and silky. I'd recommend L'Oreal's EverSleek leave-in conditioner which smells better and works longer.Overall: 2/5 stars, I found the scent to be overpowering and overly sweet. The greasy consistency didn't appeal to me.
I like the consistency (creamy) and scent of the product and that's about it.My hair is fine and dry due to the highlighting and I hoped this product would help. It doesn't matter how much I used (was trying to use just a bit) my hair looked greasy and wet. On top of that my straight hair started to look wavy soon after application.I checked the ingredients and second is mineral oil which obviously can not repair the damage but also doesn't moisturize well. Maybe it works better on African-American hair as it is more fragile than Caucasian and Asian hair due to less moisture. For me (Caucasian) a bit of Argan oil works better.
I have long, dry hair, especially this time of year (winter), so I thought this would be a great product for me, but it left me hair greasy. I followed the directions and tried it multiple times using varying amounts, just to make sure I wasn't using too much, buy each time, my hair always looked like it was wet/slimy no matter how much I dried it. Even when completely dry it looked like I could slick it back and go do a number with the cast of Grease! Overall, doesn't work well for a clean look.
My wife has long, dark, medium body hair. This was too heavy for her hair leaning towards the greasy side.
This is not an impressive product after several uses. I had expected something by now but the results are mediocre at best. I've had mixed results with the products from Motions at Home, some doing a great job and some not, and this one did not.
i have long hair that is thick (lots of it) and coarse (thick individual hairs) and slightly wavy.  most hair products will not weigh down may hair too much, but this product felt heavy, strangely, since it was actually very thin and gel-like. the texture of the product is not at all like what i think of a "pomade," such as Sebastian's molding mud, which i really like.Motions At Home Pomade did not really hold my hair too well in a style, and it felt like a film covering my hair.  Also, despite the added shiny sparklies in the gel (very fine, so not noticeable individually), the filmy aspect of the product made my hair look more dull than when i have nothing on it. maybe this product works for some types of hair, but it didn't work for mine, unfortunately. it does wash out very easily.
I have pretty long thing hair and this pomade worked with limited results. It definitely didn't do much to enhance the shine of my hair, though I did like that it wasn't that heavy. The results were mixed.It just doesn't work all that well. The pomade is too thin and likely won't hold many people's hair. This is not a product I would use again.I also wasn't impressed with how small the container was. At that kind of price, you'd expect a much bigger amount, especially since Motions at Home isn't a big name brand. This is a product I would caution everyone to avoid.
I've moved away from the gels of my youth and have pretty much used pastes in my hair since my late teen years.  I'm always looking for a strong hold and one that I can continue to style through the day.  The issue I have with Motions is that this is not a great pomade but far closer to a gel than anything else.  It is very wet and loose.  It has a decent enough hold, but the firmness of the hold loosens very quickly and it doesn't last the whole day.  It also has a somewhat oily texture, which I was not a fan of.  It bleeds into the feeling my hair possesses after using this product.  This claims to sport a grease free shine, but I bet to differ.  As a plus, it smells like alcohol (someone mentioned Pina Colada, and I can smell that, but it is almost more intense than that).  I really like the smell, but that is far from enough to validate the using of this product in my hair.
My menfolk use more hair product that the women around here.  They're always using gel or mousse or whatever they can get their hands on, even my hair spray but they turned up their noses at even trying this pomade.  It's for girls mom, for long hair, whatever excuses they could come up with.BTW this is a product for anyone.... anyone who can stand the smell.  Perhaps it's the shine that turned them off as I'm pretty sure they never cracked open the lid.  If they did I'd have had even more complaints.  The exotic Samba scent resembles plastic burning in the bottom of a dishwasher combined with coconutty.I tried it for the sake of punishment.  The smell was obnoxious and my stomach rolled pretty good a couple of times but held it all together.  I applied to my long bangs and the ends of my hair.  Shiny, stinky and not what I'd normally use. Maybe for crazy hair day or ??? I totally recommend passing on this product.
PROS: It does give a bit of shine and some manageability. It soothes split ends and frizz.CONS: It stinks and doesn't work as well as I could have hoped. The shine is not the best I've ever seen. Just about any product can produce this kind of shine. It does nothing to smooth the hair at the edges of your hairline.2 STARS: This may work for some, but I don't recommend it. There are better options out there.
Shine this will give you, not so sure I like the smell though. it smells plastic like and when I then applied heat onto it via my hair tongs: it smelled even worst.  but afterwards there were no smell on my hair afterwards.  for me it is about the whole experience: this lacks in the application department.texture: sticky-tacky; firm like vaseline.
This is a pretty looking gel. It is light yellow iridescent  color, so I get it does make your hair shiny, however it did not smell nice or sexy as described. Mine smelt like plastic and my son refused to even try it, he said it stank to bad.
While this product is meant for "Natural" hair, I thought that I could use it just on my ends to sculpt them after curling. I have straight, thin hair that I put into hot rollers and maybe instead of a gel I thought this Pomade would do the trick. It did not. Because its not meant for my type of hair. Lesson Learned!It does smell wonderful though, and its a top quality product.
I don't normally put any products on my hair except for shampoo. However, the hype said it was great for men so I, being a member of that category, decided to see what it is about. I went through the usual shower/shampoo routine and then got a gob of this stuf and applied it to my hair. Whoa! Now I know what a car feels like when it is getting a lube job. Back into the shower I went and loaded up with shampoo until I was nearly back to normal. For some reason I cannot explain I thought about what my drill instructor when i was back in Parris Island would think of my using a lube job on my hair. Needless to say, I kept this adventure to myself and discreetly disposed of the remainder of this slime maker.
I have fine thin hair so I thought this pomade may help it out a little bit, but all it did was leave my hair greasy.  The pomade does really look glittery and put a shine on my hair, but I couldn't take the greasiness of it.  It also had no holding power.  It was just shiny and greasy.  I don't think it should be considered a pomade.  I think of a pomade as having some holding power.  This is nice for shine but nothing else, at least not for my hair.
I used this specifically for the SHINE but wound up with a head full of grease!  Thought the first time around I may have used too much but... NO...!  Still the greasy look has plagued my head time and time again.  The smell is very appealing and was bummed at the end results.  Tried this also in my sons hair and same thing happened.  Not a fan of the product at all.
I don't feel like this holds your hair in place very well throughout the day.  Various pomades have different consistencies - this one is more gel-like and somewhat runny, yet very lightweight.  It does keep more of a wet look, but isn't all that great for separating hair for a messy/textured look.  Overall, I prefer using the Suave matte finish to this, which is a bit easier to apply and seemed to keep your hair looking more consistent throughout the day.
We have been using Motions products on my daughters wild curls. We have loved the Motions products for the most part. They have given her styling options, reduced breakage, and given her a really stunning head of curls.This product is not my favorite of the Motions line. It is lighter than a usual pomade but it is much stickier. It is runny so it is a mess to use. When I distributed it through the hair, it glued the hair together. There is glitter in the pomade but it doesn't add shine. When i was getting it off my hands I had to wash it a lot.So this is not my favorite product. But I will be using it. The weight and stickiness will be perfect for recitals. My daughter dances and keeping her hair in a ballerina perfect bun while she gets hot and sweat is a pain. I think this will be good for the fly aways.
I'm a little confused by this one. It says it's for at home, but the directions talk about getting best results by putting on a cap and putting the 'client' under a hot dryer.The results have been sort of mixed so far. It seems greasy and hard to get out, and I'm not sure if it's not offering the full conditioning benefit just because home equipment doesn't cover what it seems you're supposed to have to use it best.This doesn't seem like something that's meant to be used at home in the shower. It seems more like the sort of thing they expect to be used when someone's going to quickly cap your hair and keep the product away from the rest of you and have all the right tools to make it work great. It's probably perfectly fine as a product in general, but I don't see it as something that's suitable for use at home.
I tried using this on my thick, wavy hair, but it did not do a great job of detangling. It got some of the tangles out, but it did not come through smoothly. It felt sticky and gross. The scent is light but unpleasing. I gave my hair a good rinse but it left a residue on my hair. I used up about half of the tub, then gave up on it and threw it away. Not a good conditioner at all.
Motions brand products have been hit or miss for me.Motions Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotionis amazing; one of the best hair products that I have used but this hair treatment is a miss.The scent is not great but the main thing is just the way it feels on my hair. It's hard to describe because it's not exactly greasy or oily but just coated. It feels weird on your hair from the moment you put it on and that weird coating doesn't wash out. It lasted on my hair through several hair washings.After I blow dry my hair, my hair is left all bushy and yucky.I'm not impressed with it at all and won't be using again.
I used this product about 4 times before i was done with it. i do not like the way it leaves my hair feeling. it feels like my hair is coated in something thick or greasy and while it does seem fuller, i cannot stand the texture of my hair after using this. as far as deep conditioners go, i would recommendL Oreal Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme 16 oz. i have been using this for several years and i love it. leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth
I dye my fine-textured, easily broken red hair (to keep it at my "natural color", of course) and it's about collarbone length.I'm always looking for a great reconstructor or deep treatment--I use them on a regular basis, to keep my hair from becoming too brittle and breaking, which can happen very easily with my type of hair.I followed the directions to a T and this stuff left my hair feeling like barbie-doll hair.  It was stripped, stiff, and felt like plastic.  When dry, it had no life in it and felt heavy and not soft at all.  I was really disappointed.In fact, I was worried I'd damaged my hair permanently by testing this product!The next day, I used my regular deep conditioner-- the BEST-- Enjoy Color Holding Reconstructor ENJOY Color Holding Formula Instant Reconstructor 33oz  It took 3 uses of this over 3 days to bring it back to normal.  Thank goodness the damage was reversed, but that was really scary.For my type of hair, I cannot recommend this product.
I've found that many deep conditioners don't feel all that different from regular conditioners. This certainly wasn't the case with the Motions at Home Deep Conditioner. The product was significantly heavier than many other conditioners I've used. The heaviness didn't exactly appear to make a difference.The heaviness actually makes this product significantly more annoying than one would expect. If your shower lacks a powerful nozzle, you'll likely run into trouble getting this out of your hair. Conditioner should not be this tedious.The other problem is that this product doesn't necessarily work better than any other deep conditioner. If the product isn't better than other deep conditioners, I can't really justify putting up with the problems that it causes. It may not cost a lot of money, but its certainly a cheap product.
Neither my wife nor I loved this product. Does it moisturize? Yes it does. It's far thicker than most conditioners, making it slightly more difficult to work into your hair. Ideally, you're supposed to cover your hair and let this work for several minutes. Even after I rinsed the product out of my hair, I could feel some residue from the product in my hair, on my fingers, and on my face (I think this was the pumpkin, listed in the ingredients). The product did appear to provide deep, penetrating moisturization for my hair, but I prefer a product that's a little easier to work with.
The directions state putting this on, covering it with a cap, and sitting under a dryer. Well, that wasn't going to happen at home, but I did leave it on for an hour or so, covered by a shower cap, while I did some housework. After all that, I didn't really see a difference. In fact, after rinsing it out, I had some serious static electricity in my hair, which usually only happens if I wash my hair with shampoo only (not using any conditioner), and use a blow dryer -- and I didn't use a dryer, I just let it air dry.I have fine-textured hair (but I style it a lot using irons, rollers, etc., hence the need for a conditioning treatment), and I have a hard time believing this would work at all for people with thick hair.I have had much better results from usingAussie 3 Minute Miracle Conditioner, which is also far more convenient to use.
While the scent of this exfoiliant smells great, the feeling on my face after I've used it does not. I've tried this a few times before handing the remainder over to my sister. It feels great when I wash my face with it but it leaves my face feeling like a Trojan Condom. My face felt latexy (if that is even a word). This just isn't the right exfoiliant for my face.
I was so excited to get this product.  My husband has gout attacks quite often.  At the first sign he took this product and it did not seem to do anything.  Over the course of a few weeks we repeated this action, hoping for a different outcome, but it did not seem to do anything for him, so I am a bit disappointed.
I thought this product would be so much better than it was.  I bought it mostly to help with razor burns  but this did not help at all,  This is all over body wash.  It did not make my skin any softer or more moisturized than other products.  It produces good lather but I can get that with less expensive body washes.
Bad: Caused tenderness and itching both times I used it as a feminine wash. Bottle is designed so that you have to set it upright on the cap since the other end is tapered.Good: No scent, foams up enough when washing to let you know it is soap.Obviously, this did not work for me and I would not recommend it to others.
I don't think that I will use Very Private pH Balanced Body Wash in the future, due its ingredients and its affect on my skin. The product contains sodium hydroxide (lye), which I'm extremely sensitive too.  The cleanser was a little too harsh and caused my skin to itch.
It's obviously marketed toward a man but in an almost embarrassingly way.  More useful and less gaudy alternatives exist (like loofah sponges).
I'm always on the look out for a really exfoliating (but not painfully so)shower accessory so though marketed for men I thought I'd try this out too (and I knew my husband would give it a try if it was in the shower, he's a sucker for anything new)This is basically a buff puff in a masculine wrapper, I suppose it sort of looks like a tire with the black rubber edging and red extra scrubbing middle (reverse side of the buff puff side). I liked that it had a rope to hang in the shower, and that's about where my liking ended.The rubber portion is very large, I'm 5'7" so not that petite and had a hard time holding it comfortably, the rubber also gets very slippery when it gets wet making the problem even worse. Nothing special about either scrubbing surface, I ended up sort of turning the rubber portion inside out so I could get a better grip.My husband did also try it and reported back that he liked the simple other one in the shower better (which at this time happens to be a pink one, don't think guys really care what color it is) or a plain wash cloth.I did find a good use for it though. When using cleaners to scrub the tub I hate how most sponges/scrubbies allow the cleaning product to get all over your hands, forcing you to wear gloves etc... well the rubber "tire" on this keeps any cleaner (body or tub) on the one side, so it works great with scrubbing bubbles or soft scrub to clean the tub, and lets be honest here... guys your girlfriends/wives care a lot more that your tub is grime free then if you've exfoliated in the shower :)
Maybe I don't get the point with this. Okay, they use sex to sell it; I get that. It's supposed to create a situation in which women - I'm assuming really dumb ones - are made out of control in your presence after using it. Right. And Yaks fly.But is there anything truly unique about it?Well, it does have sandpaper sides, one of which would remove the face off a statue and other that buffs your flesh to a tender red. But other than that it's just sort of a sponge. The `directions' say it gets all those special places (if we all have them are they really so special?) but I think a washrag does a better job.So why am I even thinking about this thing this much? I'm done and I'm outta here - to find my washcloth.
Although this product does leave your skin a bit softer I did not have any instant gratification like the box promised.  No blackheads were 'instantly' erased.  I've used this for a few days and have noticed no change in my complexion.  I did however notice that it literally will rip apart any pimples on your face and make a bit of a mess of them.  2 stars b/c it did exfoliate but that's about all it does.
Since I have few of them, I had hoped Clean and Clear would erase my blackheads easily. Unfortunately, though it does work well as an exfoliant and leaves skin smooth, it did not budge a blackhead. Perhaps it is intended for younger skin (I am past middle age, with an oily complexion), but I also found that it tended to leave scaly patches.
The Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser is more of a gimmick than anything else.  Essentially it a salicylic acid pad attached to a vibrating face massager.  You wet the pad to activate it and turn on the little machine and move it around your face.  I can't see how this is any better than simply buying normal salicylic acid acne pads and just using your hand to move them around your face.  I used this for about 3 applications and noticed that the blackheads on my nose went away immediately after using this product, yet they returned within a matter of a few hours (just like they do with normal acne pads).*** Plus Points Include:***- Small Size- Battery is included- 20 Pads are included (1 pad per use up to 3-4 times per week)*** Negative Points ***- Not any better than normal acne pads- Blackheads return after just a few hours- Expensive compared to normal salicylic pads without the massager- The pads are thick and fuzzy so they won't work well for males with a  bit of stubble on their face.- Instructions should be located on 1 insert instead of spread out  between the package and the inside box.The Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser is a silly marketing ploy to try and lock people into buying Clean and Clear Acne Pads made for this machine.  It does not work any better than simply using normal acne pads alone.  It would be worth considering for a couple of dollars more than normal pads but at a retail of $19.99 it really does not do anything to make it worth the extra money.
Sure, it exfoliates, but as for the minimul blackheads I encounter, it did nothing.  I didn't experience that "clean" feeling afterwards, as I do with a certain mudmask.  A loofah and a good sudsy facial soap would probably be better, and would be cheaper.
As others have taken note, it exfoliates well enough, but just isn't very good at removing blackheads. Also true is that it does indeed leave scaly patches on mixed skin types (oily/dry).The price is right, but the product is an acceptable exfoliator, nothing more.
It left my skin a bit softer, but not for noticeably long.  I can feel the exfoliation, but it doesn't work for any blackheads.  Its not worth purchasing if you're looking for a quick, almost expensive, fix.  Not recommended.
As a teen, I looked forward to 'middle age' when pimples and blackheads would no longer be a problem.  Unfortunately, here I am at that point in my life and I've gained wrinkles without losing those darned blackheads!I've been using Neutrogena Blackhead Scrub, which is relatively effective for me, but I was looking forward to this blackhead 'eraser' that would take care of the problem completely.After 2 weeks of use, I see no difference in the results between the Neutrogena scrub, and this product.The major flaw with the Blackhead eraser is the product application.  The instructions don't say if the 'eraser' is waterproof, and there's no real o-ring around the battery compartment, so I believe it's not.  This means you can't use it in the shower - which is frustrating, because using it at your bathroom sink is a mess!If you wet the pad enough to create suds, the soap drips down your face and all over the 'eraser' and your hand.  If you don't wet the pad enough, then you create too much friction and can damage facial tissue - leaving flaky patches.I do think the pads alone are pretty nice.  Just wet and scrub, then rinse.  Quick and easy, and a good way to apply some blackhead fighting medicine before bed.I'll use the pads, but the 'eraser' is erased from my beauty regimen!
I'm a fan of most Johnson & Johnson products, but this one is pretty useless.  Save your money and instead get their Dual Action Moisturizer with salicylic acid- I'm a big fan of that item, works great on blackheads, pimples, etc...This item is essentially the salicylic moisturizer miniaturized and put on a disc with a velcro back.  This disc is attached to a battery powered-vibrator.Frankly, application of this device didn't do a thing for my blackheads that I couldn't do myself more effectively with a towel, soap, some scrubbing, and the moisturizer.PROS: I get a free AA battery.  Thanks!CONS: Doesn't fight blackheads effectively.  It's a fancy little kit that's not worth your time.Sorry J&J.;  You've had some good products, but this isn't one of them.
It certainly didn't make my skin super smooth, and I didn't see much of a change in my blackheads. I believe the vibrating part of this product is just a gimmick. This is basically a little pad with medicated acne/blackhead treatment in it, and when you get it wet it foams a little. The first time I used it it was new and fun, but after that it dried out my face. I would definitely recommend a light oil-free moisturizer to be used after this. I didn't see any change in my blackheads after a few weeks of using this. I recommend products with alpha hydroxy acid in them, that will for sure help with blackheads and pore size.Pros:Fun to use.It has Salicylic acid in it, so it can help with acne somewhat.Cons:It dries out my face.My face is always a little oiler the next day whenever I use this product.I didn't see any change in my skin for the better.It didn't exfoliate very well.The vibrations didn't do anything.
I was really excited to get ahold of this little doohickey, but in the end to say that I was underwhelmed would be an understatement.  I'll admit, I'm not the most zitty of guys around, but I still get my fair share & I can't remember a time that I've ever really welcomed one.  Now in this case I was hoping to just erupt with the explosive little goobers, but as is my wife & I could only come up with 2 :(.  Anyway, the 1st one we zapped (or "zitilated" as we like to say in our household) left us with an inconclusive result.  We used it one night before bed, & by morning the zit was still there though had come to a head.  This may've been a result of the machine, but may've just as easily been the human body doing it's thing.  Also, be fair warned that this thingy isn't the most comfortable experiance.  You're basically burning the boil from your body (supposedly destroying it from within), & having to apply this thing with pressure for 2 & 1/2 minutes isn't fun.  Also, know that using this thing leaves a red mark wherever you use it, so be sure not to use it before work (or school I guess for the younger crowd out there), better to use it at night when you're in for the evening.  The next thing about the item is the battery life of the product.  We were going to use it for the 2nd time & the battery was dead.  This pretty well discouraged us from really caring to mess with the stupid thing anymore.So there you go, that's our experiance with this thingy.  To me... I don't know, it seems pretty gimmiky &[...] it's kind of an expensive gamble for nothing more than a novelty item.  Buyer beware
I want to like this little device so much! I've probably not had enough of the precise type of blemish to give it a solid review, but I'm noticing that instead of them going away after treatment, it seems to cause them to come to a head more quickly. I'm not sure if that's good or bad, but I'd certainly rather they just go away! I don't find the heat to be too uncomfortable, but it is certainly hot. For the price of the unit and the necessity for and price of replacement heads, I'm just not sure it's worth it!
This was a great idea, but poor product. It only worked after about a dozen uses and then worked no more. It was pretty disapointing. I would not recommend it to anyone that is looking for serious help for acne cause you won't get it with this. I guess it's back to the doctor.
After reading everyone's reviews, I kind of feel bad that we did not have the same results. I have used it and I let my teen daughter use it with my supervision.  Nothing dramatic happened to report.  However, with that said, I am now letting my 21 year old son give it a whirl and I will report back my findings and edit my review!!!
This thing gets really, really hot, and when used as directed, tangles and knots my hair and leaves it frizzed out.  I went back to my old hair dryer after two days.
i had an older model of this and thought perhaps it had been improved. it was too heavy to use on my long hair. my arms got tired. i'd just rather use a flat iron. on the upside, my daughter has curly hair and when she wears it curly, she likes the diffuser part of it. it works though, just too clunky.
The majority of criticisms I have concern "ease of use." While this is a full size hair-dryer, it feels overly weighty. After several minutes of use my arms ached. Moreover, ergonomically speaking, the handle is not ideal. It does not have finger grooves, it does not have a rubber overlay, and its tapered design coupled with the glossy-plastic makes maneuvering a little less comfortable than some comparably priced hair-dryers. It's just a bit unwieldy.Another point that concerns me is the method of cleaning. While many newer dryers have vents which flip-open or unscrew, this one does not. At first I thought I must be mistaken, so I consulted the manual ... it suggests that the owner use a vacuum to clean the product. Uggg. Not only is that inconvenient, but it's not the most effective way to care for an electronic item.Yes, the TRESemme Thermal Creations does its job. Yes, it skips the "bells and whistles" that no one really uses anyway. But, my advice is to invest a little more and buy a lighter, more ergonomic, easier to clean, and much more aesthetically pleasing appliance (this one is shiny, black, plastic ... definitely something you would hide in your linen closet).
Wahl makes good/excellent products. My husband is a slave to their clippers. But I hated this dryer the moment I turned it on. The button placement is awful and it is way too easy to blast your hair with an unwanted dose of heat. Not only is that damaging but um, it frickin' hurts! Also, there are no attachments included besides the lovely condition cartridge and it brings with it such a heavy smell that it soon sat unused as I finished drying my hair without it.The only time the dryer performed as asked was with the help of a round brush and my own products to prevent heat damage. Not recommended at all.
UPDATE 10/5/08 -- After a couple of weeks of using this dryer (without the cartridge) I can't stand it anymore.  It's really loud and not built to withstand its own power, so the vibration is horribly uncomfortable.  I've broken down and bought another Elchim dryer (non-ionic, old-fashioned variety).  I had one for six years or so before it broke and it's gotten nothing but five-star reviews on Amazon.  It got my hair dry quickly and smoothly, and it was quiet.  Skip this one and spend the extra thirty or so to get a good dryer.--------------------------------------------------------------------There's nothing wrong with the basic functions of this unit, although it's heavy and doesn't come with any normal attachments for directing airflow.  The power is good and strong and it has the usual complement of settings -- two speed settings and three temperature settings, plus a cool shot button.  You can get these for half the price, or spend more than this one costs to get a dryer that is lighter and more powerful.  Either of these would be better options, because what you pay for with this unit is the conditioner dispensing cartridge, which contains a conditioner that is solid when cool but liquifies when wet.  What the manufacturer doesn't tell you upfront is what is in the conditioner, and it isn't anything I would ever put on my head.CETEARETH-30, the main ingredient after water, has moderate high to high toxicity per the Environmental Working Group's Cosmetic Safety Database (the exact risk depends on how much is in the product).  The cartridge also contains squalane, which is derived from shark livers, collagen (which comes from young cows and is a common allergen), chitosan (which is derived from the shells of shrimp and other sea crustaceans), paraffin (i.e., mineral oil, a petroleum by-product), keratin (derived from wool) and fragrance, among other ingredients.  Why any of these ingredients are supposed to be an advantage isn't clear, nor can I find any suggestion anywhere that dispensing conditioner in this way has any advantage over conditioning your hair normally before blow-drying or using a product made for styling.  And with either of the latter, you would be able to use your own brush or comb rather than the comb attachment for this dryer which isn't close-toothed enough to hold fine hair anyway.Two stars because the dryer works, but a cheaper tourmaline dryer would work just as well and a more expensive one would be lighter and have more bells and whistles that actually do something.
When did blow-drying hair become so difficult?  The Healthy Infusions Pro by Wahl turns the simple act of drying your hair into a difficult chore.  Where do I start?The hair dryer itself is nice.  It has what you need in a hand-held hair dryer - medium and high programs, and a cool shot to "set the style".  It looks good and has a lot of power, too.Then I put on the comb and conditioner attachment. The instructions say twist and turn and the thing goes on, but it is actually more difficult than that.  I had really expected this part to be a no-brainer.  Anyway, after a few minutes of twisting and turning I finally got the comb attachment on and tried to use it.The comb attachment is basically just some short plastic tines that stick straight out.  Not easy to use, not especially helpful in styling my hair at all.  I would have thought an angled comb design would have been better, but this comb is short and straight.After several minutes of trying to do something with this awkward, useless comb attachment, I was still waiting for the smell the informational booklet said to expect, so that I would know the conditioner was being released.  Nope.  No smell.  Nothing dripping either.  Whatever.  I knew I had removed the cover from the conditioner, and put it in comb attachment correctly.  But no signs of conditioner on my hair, or on the comb, or anyplace.Oh well.  I decided to try and remove the comb attachment all together and finish drying my hair, using a round brush instead.  What?  The comb attachment isn't easily removed either?  I cannot get it off the dryer.Look, it doesn't have to be this hard.  A hair dryer with a couple of power settings that's easy to hold and not too heavy.  Put a straightening comb on the end, and I'm set.  If I want conditioner on my hair - I'll put conditioner on my hair!  I don't need my hair dryer arbitrarily dumping its product on me, too!I think the conditioning idea is a bad one.  Why can't a hair dryer just be something that dries my hair?
I expected great results from the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener. The blue-glow of the LCD screen said, "high-tech" ... which I associated with "superior product." Unfortunately, I found the straightener awkward and ineffective.I have medium thickness, long (mid-back) hair. Since it is wavy, I either play-up the waves or straighten them (depending on my mood). I usually use theT3 Tourmaline Straightenerbecause it is highly recommended by stylists for its protective properties. And though a serious investment, it was worth every cent. I picked up this Wahl straightener for travel purposes and gave it a test run before packing it away in my luggage. The results were, unfortunately, disappointing.The product itself was a little cumbersome ... with the comb attachment adding extra thickness and heft. Worse still, the comb attachment pulled my hair (though I had thoroughly brushed it before I even began). When I finished straightening, hair was stuck in the comb area and in the seams of the straightener ... hair that had been pulled out. Since I aspire to a pin-straight look (which is why I straighten rarely), I took my time with the Wahl ... but it simply could not manage the job. The unwieldiness of the instrument made it difficult to get close to the roots. Overall, most of my hair was "kind of straight" except for the root area which was still a little unkempt.The conditioning strip is an odd add-on. It gave my hair more weight than I care for. Moreover, I question how for how long these strips will be available ... a year? Then what? Even still, I wish that the ingredients were more environmentally-friendly/healthy for hair.Finally, the Wahl does not come with a protective bag/travel bag (unlike similar brands) ... so take that into consideration when purchasing (you may want to put a protective bag in your cart).The Wahl straightener did not fulfill my personal needs. Maybe I'm just spoiled by my T3, but my vote is that since you are already paying a hefty price for this product why not invest a little more and get the T3 or a similar high-end, healthy-hair straightener.
I think the WAHL Healthy Infusion Pro Straightener will find a place in my closet and stay there most of the time.  In my opinion, it's just not as convenient to straighten hair with a second appliance, when you can use a hair dryer with a straightening attachment, and get better results.OK, I like the unit's design and the concept is relatively easy to understand.  The instruction booklet is short and sweet and to the point.  With 90 seconds to heat up, I certainly can't complain about the wait!  The temperature adjustment is pretty cool, too.  But inconvenience of using a second appliance aside, I really could live without the heat activated conditioning strip that very inconveniently needs to be replaced at least after every 20 uses.  (The styling guide says, "The number of applications of a moisture strip varies with individuals depending on the frequency of use."  Not sure what that means exactly).Oh, and that strip cover that I threw in the trash? It needs to be put back on for storage or longer use.  Oops!I straightened my daughters long, fine hair with this appliance and while it started out looking shiny, a few strokes too many and her hair started to look "greasy."  Sorry, but one of the fun things about testing new gadgets is playing around with it.  This unit doesn't give you much play-around time between "shiny" and "greasy."And so much for the gift-giving aspect of this product.  Can you imagine giving this to someone, and having them chase down conditioning strips?  No.  Overall, this is a product I can and will easily live without.
I love hand lotions - just love them. I use them all the time and have dozens of high quality varieties. My favorites are made by Perlier and Elaria. However, this brand is nothing special, and I would not purchase it at any price. The scent is fruity, almost floral, which does not fit the Pressed Olive Avocado name. The scent is actually somewhat offensive to me, leaving my hands smelling more like a tour through a cheap candle shop than after one applied a quality hand cream.The consistency is very thick, which I initially attributed to the shea butter content; however, the thick goop is greasy instead of nourishing, lingering like an uncomfortable layer on top of my skin instead of being absorbed like quality shea butter should. Also, there is no cumulative effect of repeated use as I would expect a repairing cream to produce. No repair, all grease.The product gets 2 stars only because it is "Free of parabens, mineral oils and synthetic dyes." Otherwise, I would give only one.
Over the years I have used Vaseline Intensive Care lotions with great results.  This lotion however doesn't live up to the Vaseline reputation.  I have severely dry skin on my hands in the winter caused most likely from washing my hands too often.  When I put this lotion on it looks and feels as if it absorbs into the skin but if I have to put my hands into water a greasy feeling film forms on my skin and washes off.  It doesn't matter how long I wait, a few minutes or hours later, that same film forms after my hands get wet.As for it helping the dry skin, it doesn't.  I have applied as many as three-four coats of this lotion, allowing each coat to dry before applying another, and my skin is still dry and scaly.  The scent is nice but the lotion just doesn't work for me.
Pleasant light fragrance, thick consistency that I expected to smooth and soothe my wintered, dry skin. Although it's quickly absorbed, it does leave a sticky residue that dries down into feeling like you need MORE lotion to counter the dry feeling you used the lotion for in the first place. THAT definitely bothers me somewhat.It ultimately didn't soften my skin as expected but did leave me wanting to wash it off. This definitely isn't what I've come to expect from a lotion or the Vaseline brand. Although nicely packaged with a sturdy pump to deliver the product, I don't find the product satisfactory.
The lotion is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. Unfortunately after absorption what remains is an odd waxy, almost powdery feel that then makes, in this case, my hands, feel dry like they need more lotion. The morphing from liquid to powder happened within ten minutes of application. I expected a sticky or slimy feeling, but this dry waxy powdery residue is decidedly weird, and not in a good way.That alone would stop me from using this product, but the scent is quite strong, pointedly floral and has heavy fabric softener fragrance undertones. I state this because more and more workplaces are adopting a fragrance-free policy to accommodate employees (prevent lawsuits) with extreme sensitivity to scents. I know this because my partner works in a place with one of these policies. Like it or not, the policy is enforced like any other employment rule so continued violation, after a couple of warnings, leads to termination.So, when a no-fragrance policy is being enforced the choice of scent is no longer a personal option. It ceases to be about what someone likes or dislikes because no scent is acceptable. Switching to fragrance-free toiletries is where this will end, but to ensure compliance I've begun evaluating which personal care products we use have scents that dissipate quickly and which ones linger. Obviously, this lotion has a scent that lingers.Conclusion -- although the lotion absorbs quickly it leaves behind a very strange waxy powdery feel so within ten minutes the skin feels dry and in need of lotion. And, the fragrance is over-powering so the user needs to really like wearing it all day. And, because the scent lingers, it is an unacceptable product if attempting to remain fragrance neutral.
I tried this body wash and my first impression to the nose was mmm smells peachy but after using it I was disappointed there was little lather, this makes it hard to keep it on your body while in the shower. The consistency is very slick and I found most of it slides off onto the shower floor when it touches wet skin. It just seems to rinse away before you've had a chance to wash with it even using a wash cloth or scrubber, I had to use twice as much as my Olay to get through a shower and shaving with it, forget it, it's gone before the first stroke of the shaver on the leg.  It smells pretty good at first but I liked it better initially, after several uses it started to smell more artificial and almost nauseating. Not my personal favorite body wash but thats just me, you might like it.
REVISED after several days use (3/31/13)...that "manly scent" is a bit strong.  It didn't bother me on my husband at first but now it's noticeably too much.  Just too much fragrance.  I'm demoting it.  Sorry!-----------------------Men's lotion? Really?  Not sure the marketing plan behind that, because I believe this is exactly like the regular Vaseline lotion (a great product in itself) with a slightly manly scent added.  Do they think men want only navy colored products in their bathroom and it's a decor thing? Is it too girly too use the plain white or cream colored "regular" lotions? What's next? Men's toothpaste? Men's toilet paper?This is a great lotion, simple as that.  But upon comparison, there's no difference unless you need some sort of manly affirmation.
This is a confused product. It is both a moisturizing lotion and a fragrance! But nothing on the box and packaging and product name suggests that the lotion is also a fragrance. An annoying one at that. And it has staying power. For example, I put it on my elbows in the morning, and the smell is still there in the late afternoon!Granted smell is subjective, but the smell is at the "quality level" of things like Axe and other over-saturated "extreeeeme man" colognes. Annoying smell!The lotion is good, it gets absorbed quickly without leaving grease or leftovers behind. The package is around 20 ounces, that's good quantity. The head of the pump is practical, you can get a fairly small amount with a gentle pump and you can rotate the head to fit whatever angle works best for you.Since you can't remove the scent from the lotion, I would recommend first testing it out before buying it! Because even if you like the smell, it may annoy other people around you.
I received a sample of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion and didn't really care for it.I thought that the scent was was too strong.  Not only is it objectionably strong, but it's also quite feminine-smelling.  Come on, we're guys!  Most of us don't want to smell like girls!Also didn't care for the way it burns my face.  After shaving, I'd expect a lotion designed for the face and body of a man not to burn his face.  But that's exactly what it does and it's a pretty unpleasant burn at that.  I want a product that moisturizes and nourishes my skin, not one that burns it.The lotion is also too watery and doesn't seem to be absorbed deeply into the skin.I'm not a fan and would never buy it.  2 stars.
This lotion is marketed as a multi-use lotion that a man can use both on his face or on his body. I got it from Amazon Vine, and neither my husband nor my teenaged son want to use it because they do not like the fragrance. It has what I would describe as a generic after-shave type scent. It definitely smells like a product for men with no hint of flowers or fruit. But it does have that artificial after-shave smell that I remember from my dad's aftershaves in the 70s. It's not too overpowering of a scent, but it might clash with a cologne or scented body spray. The lotion is light and quickly absorbed, so it might be suitable for someone looking to simplify their bathroom counter by having only one lotion for both face and body, but my family found that the fragrance of the lotion left nobody wanting to ever use it.
I realize that manly men do not want to use flowery smelling lotion.  Thus the advent of "men's" lotion. This has a very strong musk like (strong men's cologne).  So strong that I had to tell my family to stop using it, the smell was simply annoying and actually making me sneeze (when I used it myself) Reminds me of walking down the hallway of a middle school, where you are assaulted by the odor of perfume that the kids have bathed in.  However, I am sensitive to scent and if you are not, perhaps this will be fine for you.The lotion itself not super moisturizing, really for not too dry skin.  If you want a light lotion with a strong manly smell, this is for you.  If not, look elsewhere.
This has to be one of the stickiest moisturizing lotions available. I tried it on dry hands first and it was intolerable, I had to wash it off. I then tried using it like you would a body butter, on wet skin. That helped a little but 40 minutes later, as I am typing this, my fingers are sticking to the keys. You can probably use it for arms and legs but whatever you do, wash it off our hands or you'll feel like a dust magnet. I wouldn't recommend, there are much better products out there than this.
I love using cocoa butter lotion.  It's one of the best lotions for my regularly dry skin, and it has a side effect of supposedly blending stretch marks over time.This Vaseline product...despite it feeling like it's mostly made of grease (weird greasy feeling after you rub it in), it's actually not mostly grease - it's water!  Actual cocoa butter is way down the list...and it's weird because this stuff, all decked out in a brownish container to make you truly understand the gravity of the cocoa ingredient that's been thrust upon you - doesn't smell like cocoa butter.  Cocoa butter kind of smells like cocoa - chocolate.  This smells like a coconut sunscreen.  It's faint, but it's there.If you're looking for a REAL cocoa butter, getPalmer's Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E, 13.5 fl oz (400 ml)instead.  This Vaseline product is likely their same old cheap recipe for lotion with a drop of cocoa butter, and then some concoction they've trademarked and sounds like it's something special - you know, something that "Stratys-3 multi-layer moisture" that will INFUSE your skin.Not recommended.
I am a makeup artist who experiments with an uses many different makeup products.  I like to discover the special uses and qualities of every makeup wherever and whenever I can.When I received a tube of ALMAY SMART SHADE BLUSH, I was excited at the prospect of trying out a new blush.FRAGRANCE?Upon opening the tube, I noticed that there is no fragrance in this blush.  That is a good quality of this blush.WHAT IS THIS LIKE?The contents of the tube is a runny light mauve colored base with warm light red pearlescence to it.  It is the consistency of glaze you would put on a cake or so.  Not so runny that it will not stay put, but not so thick that it won't spread out a bit on its own.HOW DOES IT LOOK ON SKIN?When it is smeared lightly onto the skin, the light red pearlescence diffuses the light from the mauve base making it look like a light warm pink instead of light red pearl in a light mauve base.On fair to medium caucasian skin the effect is a light warm pink shimmering coverage that sits on top of the skin.  It leaves a very light pink cast on the skin, with the shimmer diffusing it a bit.IS THIS BLUSH SMART?I don't see where this color adapts magically to any skintone.  In fact, I find that it sits so much on top of the skin that it does not meld well in a way that makes it look like I am blushing.  It makes it look like I smeared some warm pink colored cream on my face.So far I have tested this blush on various ages of skin and colors from Porcelain fair to medium beige.WHO IS THIS BLUSH BEST SUITED FOR?Here is what I have come to the conclusion of about this SMART SHADE BLUSH:This blush is best on young fair skin- it is wonderful for the tween or teen girl who wants a little bit of blush look on their face for that *just pinched* look on their cheeks.  On older skin it sits on the surface and makes it look dry.  It does not blend with the skin well at all in texture.This blush does not show up well on skin that is darker than fair.  Three coats were necessary to show up at all on anything beyond that, and it still was not satisfactory to me.  Too much product needed for anything beyond light/fair complexions.For any dark complexions, I can not see this blush showing up well at all, but I have not tested it yet on dark complexions, and I will edit when I do.WHAT I THINK OF THIS BLUSHI like the fact that it is non-scented.This is not very pigmented and I found that I had to use about 3 times more product than other brands to get a decent blush color on the skin.  Very fair skin only needed one layer, however.HOW TO BEST USE THIS BLUSHWhat you want to do if you are applying this blush is:Put three tiny drops of blush in a diagonal line up the cheek bone.Blend carefully with fingers.Dampen a cosmetic sponge or makeup brush you use with cream blush and blend the edges well into the skin- do not blend the blush area itself or you will remove the blush and won't be able to see it.IN SUMMARYThis blush would be an excellent blush to purchase for a fair skinned tween or young teen girl who wants to wear just a touch of makeup but not look like they wear makeup.  A great beginner's blush for a young girl, but not so great for older women (over 20).
I liked the natural blush color that appeared when I applied this product. It didn't look at all like I used any blush, and the color produced was very close to my natural blush. I have a very light skinned asian complexion.However, I noticed that about 1.5 hours later, the color disappeared and I wasn't even out in the sun.It was nice while it lasted, but I wouldn't recommend it.
Nope, Almay Smart Shade Blush isn't so smart and it barely changed color for me. When it first comes out of the tube, it does come out white and creamy (almost like a very light moisturizer). As you blend it in, it begins to change color...kind of.The pink shade barely changed color on my medium/tanned skin. If anything, it actually made my cheeks look a bit pasty. Don't waste your money. I realize that sounds way harsh, so I'll give Almay some credit. There are products from this brand that I actually really like: the Almay 16-Hour Eyeliner and Waterproof One Coat Nourishing Mascara, spring to mind.The ironically named Smart Shade Blush, however, simply fails to make the grade for me so it's not recommended.
The packaging effectively communicates the novelty of the product, that being a blush that transforms to match your skin tone and the packaging is aesthetically pleasing.  The bottle is equally effective at communicating this concept and aesthetically pleasing.  It is also small and slender would fit well in a small purse.The product has a similar consistency to an opaque lip gloss.  Because the blush is a paste, it feels like you are applying paint to your face, instead of blush, and it does not blend-in well.  The demarcation lines are visible.  Additionally, because the blush is a paste that you have to rub in, the application could potentially mess up any foundation or make-up underneath, especially if the make-up is a powder.The instructions lack to inform the user to apply the tiniest dab, as more than that looks like clown paint.  The product appears to have a similar color on a fair skin tone and an olive skin tone. It is difficult to tell if the blush indeed posses skin tone matching properties.
Unfortunately this product is so subtle I'm not sure if it is effective. When you first apply it you do see some pink colors, but it rubs into your skin to match, and it isn't noticable enough to really feel you've applied any blush. If you are looking for a very light hint of color, this one is for you. Or, if you like the very natural look.
It's a pretty lightweight lotion with a very strong scent. The scent is perfumey strong, and not all that pleasant. I haven't noticed any "firming" of my skin at all, and made sure to use it daily anywhere that I felt is a "problem" area. Also, this lotion is way too lightweight for me, the moisturizing doesn't seem to be enough, even initially upon application, let alone after an hour or two. This product does not seem to be up to normal Nivea standards, very disappointing.
I bought this at a local warehouse store a few days ago; however, I used it only twice and had to return it since the smell was so strong! I can usually handle fairly strong smells, but this one was incredibly strong -- in a bad way! Usually the scent of most lotions will also dissipate after the lotion sinks in, but this one lasted for about eight hours, and interfered with my perfume.Since I only used it twice, I can't speak to its skin-tightening abilities. I really did like how light-feeling it was, and it also adds a nice glean to your skin. If you don't mind the smell, it seems like a nice lotion, but just be warned that it may be too strong! If you are at all sensitive to smells, I definitely recommend smelling this before you purchase it.I feel bad giving this a low review since I wasn't able to use it long enough to see if it really does firm the skin, but, in my mind, a product needs to excel in all areas to be a winner, and this one falls short because the smell is much too strong and noxious.  I ended up buying Alba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion, Daily Shade Formula, SPF 16, from Amazon after returning the Nivea lotion, and have been very pleased with that one.  While the Alba doesn't have the skin-firming features, it contains SPF and has as very subtle scent, so I consider it a good trade-off.
I have never used a Nivea lotion before so I was happy to give this one a try. I normally like lotions that are kind of thick so as soon as I pumped this into my hand I wasn't impressed. It is a pretty runny product and has a very strong floral scent (another turn off for me, I usually lean towards the fruity smelling lotions). This is something they should put on the bottle, I had assumed it was unscented. The scent lingered on my body for several hours after putting it on. The lotion does a great job of moisturizing, almost too good because it left my skin feeling damp and greasy for about an hour. In the winter time this would be a plus but with the heat and the humidity of the summer it is no good.
I really hate it when a product doesnt work as the ads intend it to. Great smell?? I am not really sure about that. You have to technically stick your nose inside the shampoo bottle to smell the fragrance.On the bright side, the shampoo is pretty thick, so a dime sized application was enough for my short hair. And it will last you a long time. I agree with the other reviews though. The shampoo does intend to dry your hair.
I honestly had high hopes with this so-called gel replacement, but it ended up with a bitter disappointment.You will want to work the paste onto your hands before applying it because you don't want to end up with "chunks" of the paste on your hair. And it seems that it makes your hands too "oily" or "greasy" after applying it. Basically, with a gel, you can just flush your hands with water after application, but you will end up using a hand soap with this one. The scent isn't too exciting either. Oh, cross that, it smells bad. I just couldn't bring myself to apply something whose scent I don't even like after a couple of times. Try it at your own risk.
This is not a product for us... my boys are 7 years old and I'm trying to teach them to do their own hair in the morning before school.  This product is way to thick and sticky... they can barley get it out of the container by themselves, let alone rub it together and then get it into their hair without creating a very sticky mess.  We were hoping for more of a gel than a thick cream.  When I say "thick", I really mean thick.
I love Axe products.  I usually find them high quality and smartly packaged. But . . . I'm going to have to take a pass on this "Axe Whatever Messy Look Paste".The upside is that it maintained may hair style throughout a long day with lots of wind and moisture exposure.  And true to Axe tradition, it comes in a nice looking container with a nifty snap off lid.The downside is that it deposits a repulsive residue on hair, that even seems to linger after shampooing.  This product is marketed on the proposition that women don't like to touch hard, stiff hair.  I would pose that neither do they like to touch sticky greasy hair that tranfers a residue over onto their hand.I would describe the experience as being akin to massaging a dab of wheel bearing grease into your hair (although I haven't really decided if the product is a grease or more of a wax).  Anyway, notwithstanding my frugal nature -- I used this product one time and threw the rest of it away.
These "silk-type" flowers are really cute.  Many of them have a "jewel" glued in the center, which makes them extra special.  The maker took the extra precaution of covering the metal part of the clip in ribbon, which is nice, but may have affected the performance by making the spring on the end, rather weak.Unfortunately, the springs are way too weak on this.  Since this barrette has a spring clip (like a clothespin,) it is essential that the barrette portion be firmly grasping the hair or else the barrette will slip out and be lost, along with the glued-on flower and nobody wants that.  As an adult woman with coarse hair, I cannot get it to grasp on to my hair, even with force, so I can guarantee that these clips won't hold a young girl's fine hair for a second.  Many of the clips won't grasp any hair, at all, so what is the point?  I wish they would have used a barrette with "teeth" or a locking spring clip.  Spring clips have to really snap tight to be effective and these won't even snap at all, even with nothing in them.The only reason I'm not giving these 1 star is that I like the flowers and plan to remove them and hot glue them onto my own barrettes.  Given that these were meant to be hair clips, two stars is rather generous because they aren't "clipping" at all.
I guess this product might be okay if you have very dry skin, want a high SPF, and don't mind the fact that the zinc oxide isn't micronized and leaves your skin with a chalky appearance.  For me though the deal breaker was how slimy I felt after putting it on.  I don't even want this on my body.
I didn't really care for this product.  The idea of having a moisturizing lotion for your face while at the same time it protects you from the sun, sounded good on paper.  But unfortunately, I found that the lotion didn't absorb well into my skin causing my skin to feel and look dry. I regularly use a different product and it works well, so I know that the problem is not with my skin, but with the lotion. I'm giving this product 2 stars instead of 1 since it has a dual purpose.
I've used Cetaphil products in the past (a big fan of their soaps and body washes), but I have to say I'm not surprised that the majority of the reviews for this particular product hover around the 3 to 4 star range.  The truth is I found this cr&egrave;me to be a big eye-irritant. I'm very cautious to the types of cr&egrave;mes I use on my face and so when the opportunity presented itself to try something new that may help me prevent damage to my skin from the sun, I took it thinking this may be it. But now I am disappointed. True, SPF 50 is better than say SPF30, but the regular sport-spray lotions are much better on my eyes than this product.Another issue with the cr&egrave;me is its heavy-duty-ness. I takes a considerable effort to rub it into the skin as its consistency is quite tick. Then at the end of the day, it take quite a bit of scrubbing to wash it off. Overall, I'd stay away from this product. Instead, try Coppertone line of sunscreen products.
I have always had sensitive skin, which has made using new products tricky. I loved the clean fragrance of the soap, and hoped I'd found a new product to use. Unfortunately, this soap has an ingredient that irritates my skin. Not the right product for my skin.
I AM A LOTION JUNKIE AND HAVE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS SO I THOUGHT I WOULD BE IN MY GLORY WHEN I ORDERED THIS.  FIRST, IT CAME WRAPPED IN PLASTIC AND THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE BOTTLE.  THERE WAS LOTION COVERING THE BOTTLE UNDER THE PLASTIC.  I TRIED IT IMMEDIATELY AND AT FIRST, I THOUGHT THE SCENT WAS VERY NICE...BUT...AFTER IT WAS RUBBED, THE SMELL WAS HORRIBLE.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT BUT IT SMELLED LIKE SOMETHING BAD OR ROTTEN.  I ASKED MY MOM TO SMELL IT AND SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS SAYING, I GUESS SHE THINKS I AM CRAZY.  I TRIED IT 3 MORES TIMES DURING THAT DAY AND I JSUT DON'T LIKE THE AFTER SMELL.  TO ME, IT SMELLS LIKE A DULL, ROTTEN OR LIKE OLD WATER THAT YOU MOP UP THE FLOORS WITH.  MAYBE ITS THE ORGANIC THING BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME. IT'S SUPPOSED TO CREAMSICLE SCENTED, I WOULDN'T EAT THAT CREAMSICLE !!  IT DID MAKE MY SKIN SOFT BUT I HAD TO SHOWER IT OFF BECAUSE OF THE STENCH.
I did not like the aroma.  I know (and love) orange and I know (and love) creamsicles but this is no creamsicle.  Scent is such an objective thing.  I reviewed a skin cream called Just Carrots and I love the aroma but other reviewers didn't.  Go figure!  I was so distracted by the scent of this Ilumina body lotion that I did not give it much of a chance on the moisturizing side of things.  I couldn't give it away fast enough.  (Sorry, Ilumina!  You can't please everybody!)
Ilumina Organics Soothing Body Lotion is indeed organic but comes up on the short end when it comes to soothing and moisturizing.  I have written nary a negative review but this product just isn'tup to stuff".  I have used many different organic body products and Ilumina's body lotion just doesn't match up neither in price nor performance. The lotion is a bit thin, watery and greasy all at the same time and the smell leaves something to be desired. It lists the lotion as "creamsicle scented" but it smells nothing like the orange and vanilla combination that I was expecting.  Instead, it smells of the essential oils that are in the ingredient list which are lemon, bergamot, grapefruit and rosemary. When mixed together with the vanilla they do not make a very pleasant scent. I would think a nice lavender/chamomile or rosemary/calendula mix would have been a better choice for this lotion's signature and only scent that you can purchase this product in.The full list of ingredients are: Distilled Water, Organic Cocos Nucifera Oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Macadamia Ternifolia Nut Oil, Organic Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe Vera Gel), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Organic Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Flower, Organic Extra Virgin Olea Europaea (olive) Fruit Oil, Emulsifying Wax, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Vanilla Planifolia Extract, Citrus Medica (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Granis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Mixed Tocopherols (Vitamin E) and Organic Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract.All told, there are better and cheaper organic products to be had and used.  This lotion was quite disappointing...  :>(
First, the good news:  It goes on well, with minimal greasiness, and it sinks in quickly.  Actually, I like the texture quite well.But the smell. . .I don't know what it's supposed to smell like, but it smells to me like really, really, cheap lemon perfume.  Like, not like a ammonia exactly, but. .just very chemical.  The smell fades fast enough, though, so if you really just have to have an organic body lotion, this will do. . .but there's got to be better-smelling options out there.
I've been happy with various Venus shaving cartridges since they were first introduced.  I've kept the original handle, but always tried out the new cartridges when they were released.  Now, this one has a solid soap on top and bottom of the razor blades, to take the place of your shaving cream.  I thought this would be good.I haven't cut my legs while shaving for probably 10 years...until today, when I used this razor.  Because the head is very wide (to contain the soap strips), it is difficult to see if you're actually cutting the hairs short enough, or maybe you're just cutting them "shorter" but not shaving them down to the skin.  I found myself pressing very hard to make sure the razor blades would reach the skin, and unfortunately, four times they not only reached the skin but went below it.I won't be using the Spa Breeze again.  But maybe this is just me.
My husband got this product for me and I wasn't sure about the 'shimmer' it was supposed to have.  I thought it would be too glittery and come off on cloths and such but it actually was pretty subtle.  It has a nice cocoa butter like smell, and lathers well, but I did not find it very moisturizing for a product labeled 'deep moisture'.
so far as I can tell, This stuff does no better a job than other creams that are cheaper and more easisly available in the supermarket.
I'm a 47 year-old guy with decent skin for my age.  Still, I do have some wrinkles, along with some minor and small discolored areas here and there.  I used this product exactly as per the directions for 2 weeks and frankly I felt as if it was mostly a waste of time.While I don't have side-by-side photos to compare, my feeling is that it did little to nothing to improve wrinkles and little to nothing to decrease discolorations.  I do feel that it may have made my skin a bit softer and the mask that you use on day 14 actually feels kind of nice.  My Cockatoo was actually utterly fascinated by the mask, so wearing it was kind of interesting.  Nonetheless, I am sorry to report that I cannot recommend this product.
Olay as introduced their Olay Definity 14-Day Skin Rehabilitation advertising " a total anti-aging skin immersion that detoxifies, recovers, and revives skin's appearance in just 14 days".The Claim:The 14-Day system works in three phases: phase 1, detoxify; phase 2, deep recovery; phase 3, revive.The first phase is 7 tubes that are specially formulated to ignite skin's exfoliation, aiding skin's natural detoxification.The second phase is 6 more tubes that contain Olay's most potent formulation of Glucosamine Complex and hydrate to help skin's natural recovery from the appearance of past skin stresses.The third phase is a reviving mask saturated with 5x the conditioners of a typical lotion application to give skin a boost of rehabilitating moisture and complete your treatment.The Directions:Use nightly replacing your current nighttime moisturizer.Nights 1-13: Use one tube of the intensive treatment each consecutive night.Night 14: Use mask for at least 15 minutes or longer.Use this rehabilitating treatment at least once every three months.My 14-Day Experience:The phase 1 lotion has a light, pleasant scent with a powdery, almost gritty feel. It made my skin feel drier and broke my skin out with little pimples. I think that's the detoxification process, it is clearing out the pores.The phase 2 lotion is more like a traditional lotion. It wasn't gritty nor did it break my face out.Phase 3 is the mask, it is heavily saturated with moisturizers. It clings to your face from the wetness. Afterwards my face felt stiff and sticky.The tubes come in a plastic container with slots that hold the tubes and a clip that clips on the back to hold the mask. The packaging is very nice and makes it easy to keep up with your nighttime routine with everything organized and easy to reach and see.Each tube contains a lot of moisturizer, at least double what I would ever use if I was just using out of a bottle.The Results:I cannot really say that I had a visible improvement in my skin. I was pretty aggravated with the product breaking my face out. I don't usually don't have breakouts so having a few pimples leftover after the 14 days with no other improvements visible was not what I was expecting.Let me say, I usually love Olay products. I really like the Regenerist line but I will not be purchasing the Olay Definity Rehabilitation kit in the future.
Going into this product test my skin was well nourished and looked wonderful. The Olay Skin Rehab kit undid everything that I had previously accomplished.The first week my skin did look brighter in the morning. The second week dried my skin out so badly that it looked like I aged years in just one week. It was terrible.The mask did nothing to repair the damage the rest of the treatment caused.My face brokeout throughout the entire two weeks. In odd spots too. Not in any of the normal spots I've ever broken out in.I know Olay has a great reputation but this product is terrible. I would not recommend it. I would not buy it. I wouldn't even use it for free again.Two stars is the best I can offer this kit.
First, I have to say I've been blessed with good skin.  So when this came up as an offering in the Vine Program I thought, "Why not?"  Here are my conclusions:pluses:  it did not break my skin out; it had an okay scent; the packaging was cleverminuses:  each tube contained more than I could easily spread on my face and neck, so it felt a bit wasteful; it took a while for the contents to be totally absorbed into my skin, so I needed to make sure I allowed enough time before going to bed to apply it; I really didn't see any great improvement; since I have never used this type of product before, it seemed pretty pricey to me for 2 weeks worth of treatment.I'll stick with my tried and true moisturizers.
Procter and Gamble has always been honest about their Olay line: it doesn't provide surgical results and it doesn't even take the place of a visit to the dermatologist ... but it does allow for small, positive changes.Though this product is inexpensive, I agree with the opinion of some other reviewers ... it's a little gimmicky. You would be better off to invest in theOlay Anti-Aging Starter Protocol Pro-X Kitwhich is a bit more intensive and offers better results. This will make your skin softer, but there were no other noticeable results (for me). (But I also do not smoke, do not drink, have a strict diet, and wear SPF every day ... someone who needs genuine repair may see other results).My personal opinion is that instead of experimenting with the product du jour, men/women interested in skincare should book an appointment with the dermatologist and get a professional opinion. My dermatologist customizes programs for her clients' specific needs ... you simply cannot do this in the aisles of Wal-Mart. The bad part is that the expense doesn't stop here. You'll probably be given a prescription for Renova (which is about $200.00) and be told to invest in a moisturizer (about $15.00-$35.00) and an SPF lotion/foundation (price varies). So, if you are always experimenting with  the newest product and dropping $30 here, $40 there ... then just see a dermatologist. If you do not expect significant results and will be pleased with small changes, then try some of the Pro-X or Regenerist products.Bottom line: While Olay's Skin Rehab isn't going to inspire drastic changes, it will leave your skin feeling softer. The price is appealing, but there are only two weeks worth of product included.
Other than my skin being softer, I really did not notice any change from using this product.  I am certainly glad I did not have to pay for it!
Olay Definity 14 Day Skin Rehab consists of 7 ampoules of "detoxifying" treatment, 6 ampoules and 1 mask of "rehabilitating" treatment.  The packaging is excellent - airtight and opaque, which preserves the integrity of the anti-oxidant ingredients.  Otherwise, there is very little about this product that is special.The first phase contains salicylic acid (BHA) and vitamin E.  The second phase includes niacinamide and acetyl glucosamine.  The mask is pretty much the same as the second phase, but contains a greater amount of humectant ingredients.  I was unable to determine if the salicylic acid product is an effective formulation.  It should be 1-2% and with a pH of 3-4.  I don't know the percentage, and don't have a pH test kit.The products also contain mica and titanium dioxide, which leave a nice glow to the skin, but that is only a cosmetic affect.I had no adverse effects from this product.  I use BHA products because they are good exfoliators and also help keep blackheads under control.  If you like the concept of this product, you can maintain an everyday protocol of exfoliation plus niacinamide by using Clearasil Acne Fighting Cleansing Wipes 32 wipes orNeutrogena Acne Stress Control, 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment,  2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)(keep both of these products away from the eye area), plusOlay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl oz, orOlay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion with UV protection. Packaging May Vary,  -2.5 fl ozfor daytime.  Please note that both AHA and BHA can cause temporary skin irritation.  You may wish to start using these types of products every other day.
I tried this Olay program during the winter and my skin became irritated, so I thought I'd wait until some time had passed and my the cold winter winds and icy temps were making my skin more sensitive than normal.No go.  I tried it again and my skin felt itchy and uncomfortable.  But to be entirely fair, I have quite a few allergies and have very sensitive skin.  I can't even use baby oil on my face.
Tried this product in order to get rid of some large brown "age" spots on cheeks near outer corner of eyes.  It lightened the age spots some, in that it made my skin peel a little the first week. In no way did it make them disappear. The second week skin "rejuvenator" (part 3 of the three-step process) really did nothing.Could have used any exfoliator and it would have done about the same job.  Just more snake oil to add to the medicine cabinet. At least it smells nice.
All in all, this didn't help with wrinkles. I did notice a positive change in discoloration. It made my skin soft and moisturized it well. It has a lovely scent. It does two-thirds what it says it is supposed to do. I will say that I am blessed in the genes department and look a lot younger than I am. Maybe others will get better results? So I give it 2 out of 5 stars.
This hairdryer has a powerful cyclone type effect and will take your hair into the airwave and curl it. I have long hair and had no issue getting my hair into the "tunnel". Unfortunately however, the curl result was quite limp and looked perhaps like after you braid your hair and then take it out. Perhaps this might work for people with thick hair but for my hair, which is very thin, the cyclone effect was wasted. I ended up removing the attachment which easily comes off and using the hair dryer just as you would any other average hair dryer.
When I try out a new straightener or dryer, I test with hair shampooed and conditioned. No special hair products.The results with this straightener was no surprise to me. Nothing special.Heat up at 390 degrees took about 3 minutes. A bit too long, in my opinion.It has swivel cord. That's a plus.The handles on the outside of the plate got real hot. It's not possible to handle it there. This isn't uncommon amongst the straighteners, though. The placements of the buttons made me push them by accident very often. There are button lock options, though.On the other hand, there are no temperature lock features. It didn't seem like a problem when I straighten, though.I don't like that it's only ceramic coated, rather than real solid ceramic plates. I don't know anything about Titanium, but I don't trust metals, personally.The iron caught my hair a few times and broke a couple.My hair still feels frizzy and dry, not silky.If you really care about the health of your hair, I'd buy those with solid ceramic plates. If you only do this once in a while and you don't care, or it's for a teen who doesn't care, then I'd consider this at less than $30.It is a pretty unit, though.
My wife was really excited to try this, to have an alternate/travel version of her $200 bespoke tourmaline wet/dry straightener that she bought at Sephora.  However, she found that it caused her hair to get all frizzy.  It went straight into the trash.
I got this straightener for my wife. Here's what she had to say about it:Overall, this straightener is just OK. I mean, it does the job...my hair is straight now, but not without some struggle. I have very fine, basically straight hair, but I have a short haircut that tends to get frizzy if I don't use the straightener.Pros: It's small (only 1 inch), so you can get pretty close to the root. Also, it has an auto off feature, which is huge for me as I've definitely left the house with my straighteners plugged in. The last pro is that it has a locking feature so it's easier to store.Cons: The temperature control is on the front of the straightener. I kept hitting it with my thumb and changing the temperature while using it. I also felt like it left my hair unbelievably hot to the touch, to the point where I burned my hand when touching my hair (and this was on the lowest setting). Now I know this is a hot iron, but all the straighteners I've used in the past never actually burned me. You also have to clamp the straightener down really hard as just closing it around your hair doesn't quite do the trick. And with using this extra pressure caused my hair to get extremely static-y, where I had to use static guard just to tame it. I read other reviews where people noted a smell coming off the straightener, but I didn't notice any smell.Overall, I'm happier with my old hunk-a-junk straightener that I've had for 5 years. It's bigger, doesn't burn my hair and gets the job done much quicker with less stress.
I always look at the first several ingredients in cosmetics since they are listed in order of predominance, with the ingredients used in the greatest amount first, followed in descending order by those in smaller amounts. I want to know what I'm using on my body (and absorbing into my body).Also, the ingredients I always look for are methylparaben and propylparaben.These parabens are anti-fungal agents that are often used in hair-care products. These parabens are readily absorbed through the skin and scalp, they are estrogenic, and build up in breast tissue. I truly believe we should not be using these in cosmetics and they have a direct correlation to the increase of breast cancer throughout our world. As a estrogen-positive breast cancer survivor I am particularly focused on eliminating all products from my beauty regime that include parabens. This product contains methylparaben as the 6th ingredient (high amounts since it's early in the list of ingredients).So, here's the first several ingredients:I'm not real thrilled with the first two ingredients:1st ingredient is corn oil. Do I really want to use this on my hair? Maybe in a small amount to help with shine, but as the first ingredient, I'm leery.2nd ingredient is isododecane which is hydrocarbon/solvent that helps prevent evaporation of liquid from the hair. I don't think hydrocarbons are all that good for the human body.The next 2 ingredients look promising and after some googling around I think these are actually safe. They are: Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil and Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil (also known as Marula Oil). Both are from Africa and extremely moisturizing for your hairThe next ingredient is fragrance. All of the Motions haircare products are quite fragrant, pleasant to me, but a little on the heavy side. They all smell fairly similar, flowery, sweet, but somewhat artificial. EWG's Skin Deep Database (which you can google and find on-line) lists Motions fragrances in the High Hazard range. Quote: Ecotoxicology, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Miscellaneous, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive)So, overall I'm not all that thrilled with this product just based on ingredients. They are focused on dark-skinned, kinky hair men and women, work on my blond curly hair too. For health reasons I would never use this product on a daily basis, but a nice options every once in a while.My rating: I initially was rating this as a 3-star since it is a good price and average product, but reconsidered to a 2-star. On the front of the bottle they list &#34;with 100% Pure Marula Oil&#34; which I think is a little misleading. The main ingredient is Corn Oil, not Marula Oil and the product really isn't all that pure since it has a high level of fragrance and parbens.
No wonder this leaves the hair shiny...it is terribly greasy.  I got my Motions Salon Haircare for hair and scalp from Amazon and was hopeful for healthier hair and scalp from using this product.  Unfortunately, I found the product too greasy and messy to use more than a few time so cannot truthfully recommend this to anyone else.  Although it may be jsut what someone else is looking for.  I do not like that slick feel to my hair from products.  I decided to use it on my dry skin and love the product on my legs and arms this winter.Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil, 8 Ounce
This is good in theory if you need such a product. I consider myself having dry hair but I don't have a lot of scalp trouble. I applied just a little to the ends of my hair and it still worked it's way to my scalp which is what it is for but it makes my scalp feel so dirty and greasy and my hair heavy and weighted down. The last time I used it, I ended up buying a hat that day (and I'm not a hat person) and wearing it because I felt like my hair looked dirty.
There is actually nothing natural about this oil except for the fact that if you use it you naturally will look like a greaseball. Regardless of the quantity that you apply to your hair you will be able to achieve the look of a genuine greaser. Obviously, some people like the greasy look so this is an ideal product for them and worthy of 5 stars. However, it has been my experience that most people with whom I come in contact with do not relish the lubricated look. I tried to squirt just a tiny amount on my hair to see if there was any benefit to be derived. The odor was a bit on the strong side but not really offensive, IMHO. When my wife spotted me after I had oiled myself she strongly suggested that I hit the shower and handed me my shampoo. I can take a hint.
Unfortunately this hair & scalp oil didn't work well for me.  My hair is color treated and rather dry and frizzy especially during the winter months.  This oil left my hair looking like I hadn't washed it for days.The smell is a pleasant clean scent, hence the 2 stars.I'm usingSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil, 3 Ounceand absolutely love it.  It conditions my hair without leaving it greasy or oily.
I wanted to try this scalp oil in order to make my hair look and feel softer. I'm not sure I'd call my scalp dry, but there's definitely room for improvement in that regard. With this Motions Oil, I don't think I got what I was looking for.What you do get is a sort of greasy like feel that isn't very pleasant at all. You're not advised to put much in, but that doesn't really seem to matter as the oil doesn't really do its job. I can't really say that my hair looks or feels better after using this product.I suppose some people with coarser hair might feel differently. But this scalp oil really didn't do it for me. If you're looking for scalp oil. you should probably look elsewhere.
As other reviewers have noted, this product makes the hair take on a rather greasy look. I personally dislike that and it really doesn't make me want to use it.
Way too greasy for our taste.  I used the same hair brush I used to brush this into my daughter's hair and had to wash my hair again quickly.  Don't experiment with this right before some important event or you'll be sorry.
My original review follows but after reading some of my fellow Vine reviewers comments I decided to take another look at this product.Please someone correct me if you would, the label says  " With 100% Pure Marula Oil"  I would like someone to show me where there is any Marula Oil in this blend.My previous comments stand but after reading the label that was covered by a Vine sticker I checked out the ingredients and I personally cannot find anything that comes close to Marula Oil.  It has many fragrance oils and some anti cancer products but what I do not understand is why the Honey and Sorbitol?  I do not think I want to spread sweeteners on my hair and attract bees... also since it says it is 100% Marula oil I am upset that they lied.My original take on this product before I realized they lied.I applied this in a soft spray all over my hair, it made it shine and smell nice.  I rubbed it in and if I were the kind to like that  greasy wet look this would be perfect.In fact the next time I cut my hair short I will use it to give it the wet look that I like in the summer.  So there is not need for hairspray.  It shampoos out clean and leaves a nice soft effect to my hair.I would buy this again as it does do what it promises.
The title almost says it all - this facial cleanser has the texture of glue coming out of the tube, and it took quite a bit of mixing with warm water to get the lather necessary to wash my face. Scrubbing is an unpleasant experience because the cleanser has an odd smell; something like rancid bubble gum.  Rinsing was somewhat difficult, it took a lot of water to rinse my face.Still, all this would have been fine if the cleanser cleared up my slight acne.  (a few zits a month in the "T" zone)  However, a week after starting to use this cleanser (twice a day as the label directed), I began to see several zits two weeks before they were expected. I thought that the cleanser was not to blame so I kept using it. Each day I used the face wash, I saw more pimples emerge.So I quit using the face wash.  Within days, my face began to clear.  I'm blaming allergies to one or more of the ingredients, as Clearasil has always had high quality products and I've never had any trouble before.Obviously, this is only my experience, and probably won't be yours.
I received this complimentary product from the Amazon Vine program.  I was very excited for my 15 and 16 year old kids to try this product out.  My son has worse skin than my daughter, but neither one of them saw any benefits, and they used the product faithfully for at least two weeks.It seems to be a little 'goopy' and doesn't seem to do much more for their skin than a simple bar of soap.  I would not buy this product again, I know it works for others, so maybe it really depends on your skin type and what is causing your acne breakouts, but for us it's a no.I would like to add that the Clearasil Face Wash does not have a strong smell, it's rather gently, I know that strong smelling face products can be a turn off.
This product promises much but in my opinion delivers little.  My skin is very fair, sensitive, and it has been subject to acne and rosacea for 50 years.  At 65, my face still breaks out, so it was with high hopes that I tried the cream for two weeks, following the directions carefully.  The two positives are that the cream does work into the skin well and does dry out the affected areas and thereby takes down much of the swelling associated with acne.  However, there was absolutely no difference, rapid or otherwise, that I could see in the amount of redness in areas caused by pimples.  Over some days the redness eventually subsides, but in my case that is due to normal healing versus anything special by this cream.  The other thing I noticed is that this cream caused a fair amount of itching in the places where it was applied.  Unfortunately, on the basis of my experience, I cannot recommend this product.
I have oily, break-out prone, adult skin and this product did not help me in any way. After about a month of use, the only thing I saw was more redness and irritation.
If we knew what we put on our kids would we really be ok with it? This product has:Sodium Laureth Sulfate - tied to cancerCocamidopropyl Betaine - a skin irritantTetrasodium EDTA - a known toxinDMDM Hydantoin Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Titanium Dioxide - carcinogens and neurotoxinsHow is it that organic and all natural makers of beauty products can do so without all this stuff if it's so necessary? (The answer is that it is cheaper to go with chemicals and rely on rules that say it's "probably" safe in moderation.)To be fair (and why I went with two stars) this doesn't have parabens and doesn't have any dyes associated with problems or toxins. So it's not as bad as most, but it could be much better.I recommend that you go withRenpure Organics My Pretty Hair is Parched! Moisturizing Shampoo, 13.5-OunceorBurt's Bees Baby Bee Natural Baby Care Shampoo, Lotion Setand keep your children safe of these kinds of chemicals.
This smells good, but after trying numerous Suave products I've decided, no more. I tried Suave years ago, I didn't like it then and I don't like it now. They keep coming out with new products, that have pretty much the same results. This is not a good 2 in 1, I've used other products that are a 2 in 1 that work better than this. It's cheap for a reason...
...This Lotion Gave Me A Headache!I admit to being sensitive to smells.  Walking into a department store with a perfume counter or into candle shops where the scents are many and they mingle, makes me a little sick.  I get a headache and then I get queasy.  This lotion had that same effect, it's very florally and that is one of the scents that I have the hardest time with.The lotion itself is supple and it went on so smooth and light, I loved the texture.  It didn't leave my skin feeling caked or oily, just soft and silky.  Because of the quality of the lotion itself I tried to use it 2 more times, unfortunately the smell still gave me a headache.I would definitely try this product in an unscented version as I do think the lotion was great. If it was for the lotion alone, I probably would have rated it a 4.Cherise Everhard, October 2009
Similar to the other Vaseline lotion w/ the Vitamin blend, the after effects of this product work reasonably well. I've been using this product for roughly 2 weeks on my 5 year old, and her skin is very silky smooth.It doesn't absorb as fast some of the other leading lotion brands, but it works well in leaving the skin soft.However, since the beginning I had a lot of problems w/ the scent of the botanical blend. It constantly wanted to make me gag or stay away from my daughter's scent. I really found nothing attractive or pleasant about the scent.
As a moisturizer, I'd give this lotion decent marks... it moisturizes the skin and I like that it rubs in easily and a few minutes later there is no perceptible residue.  But holy smokes - the smell!  With a name like "botanical blend" I had expected a subtle, somewhat natural aromatherapy-type smell.  Instead, it's like a combination cleaning solvent and car air freshener.  AS I type this, my partner, who just applied some about 10 minutes ago, is standing 10 feet away from me.  I can smell it.  And I'm getting a headache.  I don't like writing negative reviews and I don't like reading them, but I also don't like wasting money on products I'm going to throw away, so I hope this helps.  The reason for the two stars (vs less) is that I think the product does a good job moisturizing if you can somehow get over the smell.If you're looking for an excellent moisturizer on Amazon, tryAveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 8-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)Aveeno daily moisturizer... wonderful scent, great moisturizer, can't rave enough about that product.Hope this helps!
I think the second you pour this into your hand, you'll be able to tell by the scent that it's a women's lotion. It smells like cheap imitation brand perfume.I get dry itchy skin, so I am willing to try anything, even if it's meant for women. I find one product that works and stick with it, even if it's meant for the opposite sex. But when Something's free - I'll try anything ButVaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burstisn't all that great. I mean it moisturizes okay, despite it's hideous scent. BUT It works the same as all the other lotions I've used. So It's not that terrific.I'm sorry but this "Vitamin Burst" Didn't improve anything. Vaseline is making it seem like the Burst of vitamins will improve my skin but I don't see a difference between this and the other Vaseline lotions I've used. Which also don't work that well for me.This may sound weird coming from a guy, but the only thing I've found to work right isBath & Body Works Body CreamVaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion, Vitamin Burstwas worth trying. But for me, it smelled terrible and didn't work that well
I had high hopes for this lotion based on other reviews and yes the commercial as well as checking out their website for information about this lotion.We have a child who is allergic to many foods and other things and as a result often breaks out in rashes and we have to keep her skin moisturized in the winter to make sure it stay under control. I have a hard time finding a lotion for her that does not make her itches worse or burn her.  This lotion did not pass her test.First off the smell is way too strong for her as well as myself. We tried a small amount on her skin as soon as we got it and we had to take it off shortly after because it was hurting her skin. So back to the Aveeno we will go for her.Now for myself. I have some skin condition that honestly i do not recall what they told me the name of it it but basically there are times when if i have my  hands in water too much or too hot of water the skin bubbles up and breaks open and then i have to use this steroid cream to get it back under control.I have found that there are a couple lotions i can use to help so it does not get too bad.So i thought maybe I could add this lotion to the list of others that will help my hands even though i know it is more a body lotion I had hoped it would help. I was wrong.I opened it up and tried it right away. Right now my hands are fine so thought perfect time to put it to the test.Right away the smell nearly knocked me over even the kids who were upstairs away from me came down to ask me what was that smell.  It is very much like perfume yes it is a "light" perfume scent but for those with allergiesto many perfumes and colones i would say stay away from this lotion.I had to wash it off right away because having it on my hands gave me a headache.Now I decided to give it another try the next day because our house is honestly not the norm that most people will experience with this lotion so I wanted to see how it would do on other parts of the body.I used it on skin on bottom of one foot and did like the result but i just can not handle the smell and was silly because i have to keep washing it off my hands and in the process my hands are getting bad again.In fact when I was out and about my friends asked me what PERFUME I was wearing. Even after i washed it off my hands. Explained to them it was not perfume but this lotion instead.Did give the lotion away because it is just too strong smelling and irritating to the highly sensitive skin in this family.Aside from that I do think it works ok as far as mosturizing the skin. I did also notice that you do not need as much as you might be used to when using other lotions. It does have a different feel to it than other lotions we have used so that takes some getting used to.I am going to see if they make an unscented version to try that instead..So if you have any kind of allergies or sensitivity to scents I would be careful with this one might not be the right lotion for you. Cost vale of the lotion seem a little high but does seem like you will use less lotion than you would normally so possible this lotion will last longer than your normal lotion.I am a little hesitant about some of the ingredients as i look into them
When I selected Vaseline Sheer Infusion Body Lotion thru the Vine Program, I was really excited. After all, I never select the products to review, I usually select books, but this time, this product/lotion sounded worth trying, especially since it offered moisture and hydration to all layers of the skin (the top, core and deep), while leaving your skin feeling soft and silky. I was also motivated to order this product because I live in a house of people with very sensitive skin. Usually we use Eucerin and Aveeno products, and practically own stock in the companies. My youngest son has to use Aquaphor because of his sensitive/dry skin, which is pricey...so a nice, somewhat cheaper alternative would be nice.First, I will discuss the scent. While I will say that I thought that the scent was nice (it didn't linger all day...just a bit in the nose), I am not sure how a man would respond. My two young sons (11 and 8) didn't care about the scent just enjoying squirting it whenever they could,, and I am awaiting my husband's opinion who usually prefers lotions with no scent (Aveeno) because he complains that they make his eyes water (other Vaseline products have).  So if I were reviewing for scent only, this product would probably get a 3 (pleasant, not overwhelming).Second, I didn't necessarily feel the deep "hydrating effects" that were promised or implied in the advertisement.  I could tell that I had a layer of something on my hands, but did it feel hydrating or silky, "no". However, the lotion did dry up well, with a pleasant scent, but did not make my hands feel moist like Eucerin or Aveeno products.  I definitely found myself constantly adding product following each bathroom visit, or just occasionally during the day when my hands felt dry, which was often. Compared to other products that I normally use, I would not say that the product made my hands "feel" any better than using some other products that I normally use, probably worse. Even the scent did not really make a difference because when I want a nice scent, I can use Bath & Body works (shea butter products) or Neutrogena hand cr&egrave;me, which leaves my hands moist and sweet smelling. And as for feel, I think good old fashion Vaseline Petroleum Jelly corrects the roughness on my heels and hands better, than this product even without the pleasant smell. I have even used Vaseline Petroleum Jelly cream in the past, and liked it better.  So for hydrating and moisturizing properties, I would probably give this product a 2.Third, the packaging is slender and attractive. Once primed, the pump worked well and dispensed product easily, meaning I could just walk by and squirt a little without any trouble (however, I am not sure how it will work once there is very little in the bottle). Attractive bottle easy to use, 4 to 5.So I guess the big question remains, would I purchase this product when faced with other products? Probably not, although historically I have used certain Vaseline products, this one does not offer anything that I believe is better than what I am presently using. While I could probably get this product for around $9, I could put $5 more and get Aquaphor, a product that I know works well for my family. Overall I give this product a 2.5, considering price, scent, feel and packaging. And while I don't think it is perfect for my family, leaving it on my desk for co-workers is fine. So, if you do not necessarily have extremely dry/sensitive skin, and want something pleasant smelling, you could use this product, but if your skin is really dry, and you are looking for something to make your skin feel moist and hydrated, this might not be the product for you.
Olay Regenerist products use methylparaben and other ingredients that the Environmental Working Group, on its site the Cosmetic Safety Database, has identified as toxic.  So while this product works okay and is reasonably priced, it really isn't a bargain.  If money is an issue and you aren't worried about putting these chemicals on your skin, you will probably like this product, but I'd rather spend more money and buy something more natural, or at least less toxic, that works just as well or better.
I've been using Oil of Olay SPF15 for sensitive skin for over 20 years and I still do, it works great. I gave this new product a try but it is definitely not for me. I worked out in my garden in the hot florida sun while trying this product and when I sweat it instantly ran into my eyes and started burning. After 4 hours my face felt flushed and irritated. I didn't get sunburn but I did get burned. My face turned splotchy red and felt very irritated from this product and lasted several hours after I showered and cooled off. This may be OK for someone with skin that is not sensitive but if you are fair complected and have sensitive skin like me you may want to stick to their regular sensitive skin SPF15 formula, it's a great product and doesn't irritate at all.
I've been using this cream daily for around 2 months and I haven't noticed any changes in my skin, although I certainly don't expect my fairly young-looking skin to transform magically back to skin like a 20 year old. I have sensitive, normal-to-dry skin and this moisturizes well enough for the summer, but I doubt if it will be enough to keep me hydrated when the furnace kicks on.  It goes on smoothly due to it having some silicone added, soaks in quickly, and doesn't dry sticky at all.However, I really hate the scent.  Maybe I'm a little more sensitive to fragrances in my skincare products than the average person.  The scent of this is herbal/medicinal, and it lingers way longer than I like it to.  And yes, it has SPF 25, I do applaud Olay for upping the SPF in this product over most of their others which have an SPF 15.This product has some parabens in it as preservatives, but I don't worry much about those.  I've been using skincare with parabens for 20 or so years, and they haven't hurt me yet.  What I don't like and it really upsets me is Olay still tests on animals when there is no reason to do this - there are plenty of other ways to test without having to dab this in the rabbits' eyes.
I am 30 years old and have just a few very minor wrinkles. I was hoping that his set of products would make them at least less noticeable, as I don't believe that any cream or serum will totally vanish wrinkles. I did not have visible results. The trio seems heavy on my face and makes my skin shiny/oily. I do not like that at all. The heavy, greasiness is expected in a night cream or even an eye cream sometimes, but all 3 of these had the same feel to them. I have been using them as directed for almost an entire month now. I am not noticing any difference in my skin, either by look or feel. I did not have the problem that others have mentioned with breaking out with whiteheads, so that was nice. I really would have liked to see some sort or results though. I would not purchase this item again, nor would I recommend it. Everyone is different though and reacts differently to a product. While this may be a good price for a 3 piece set in general, it does not seem to be a good value for me since I did not see any visible results.
I'm in my early thirties, so I don't have a lot of problems with wrinkles.  I have a crease between my eyes from squinting, and mild ruching around my eyes when I smile.  I do think using anti-aging products is a good way to keep from going downhill fast.  I'm a bit self-conscious about the crease on my forehead, so I was hopeful that this would give me results.  I use other Olay products with good success, and am especially fond of the Regenerist line, so I had high expectations.  Unfortunately, this product did not work out well for me at all.Within a couple of hours of applying the deep wrinkle treatment and SPF 30 moisturizer I got red bumps all over my cheeks and chin.  The next day the red bumps and turned into little whiteheads.  I hoped that I just needed to push through the reaction so I continued to use it for a couple of more days.  After about 4 days of using it am and pm as directed my skin was in such bad condition that it looked like I had impetigo.  My skin actually hurt.  At that point I decided I couldn't use it anymore.After stopping use my skin was almost back to normal with a couple of days.  I can't say whether this product gets rid of wrinkles.  I can say that it is not for someone with sensitive skin.  I also didn't care for the way it felt on my skin.  It was really greasy.  Even after a couple of hours if I touched my face it felt moist and sticky.  This was true of both the SPF moisturizer and the night cream.  I don't really want to go to bed with my face feeling sticky.
Sorry to be blunt, but all this product does is spread a layer of sticky, shiny residue under your eyes, which is supposed to give the illusion of "smoothness." Unfortunately, if you rub or touch under your eyes at any point afterwards, the "smoothness" rubs off and collects in little residual pieces that get in your eyes and all over your face. Not pretty.It gets two stars for the ease of application. The roller is convenient and easy to use. But it doesn't make you look younger or less puffy.
I gave this product over a month of use before writing this review as well as giving it the benefit of the doubt.  Unfortunately, I saw no noticable results.  The product packaging claimed I would be able to notice reduced eye puffiness as well as fine line reduction, but none of this was even remotely visible on my skin.  The only reason I am giving this two stars instead of one is because it does feel somewhat soothing to use because of the roller balls so even though I did not see any results it did feel relaxing to apply.I caution anyone who is interested in the product to try a sample before purchasing.  My experience is that the (lack of) results just do not justify the costs.
I'm a long term Olay Pro-X and Regenerist user but I am unimpressed by the ingredients in this product.  Most of the ingredients are found in other skin care preparations and squalane (sometimes from shark's oil) has been around for a long time.  I have used pure squalane on my eyes for weeks with no noticeable difference.Although this product goes on fine and I'll finish using the container, I recommend Olay Pro-X Eye Restoration Complex or the less expensive version, Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum both of which contain niacidamide.
I love Olay products, I converted 6 yrs ago when my first pregnancy left my skin dry and breaking out at the same time and have stuck with them since. I even buy them for my husband to use and will give them to my daughter when she's older. That said I had higher hopes for this cute little tube. I'm in my mid 30's now and often could use a boost to the puffiness and undereye circle area. Immediate results had my attention so I was hopeful this would be a product I could use on days I needed a little extra something.The first application was slightly painful and messy, the balls didn't roll well and to much product was applied. I washed it off and decided to try again. This time with slight pressure the balls were lubricated and rolled smoothly, not a painful experience but not a great one either. I managed to apply a thin layer of product under my eyes and waited for it to absorb. And waited. And waited. Eventually it dried to a slightly shiny (is this supposed to be age minimizing?) slightly filmy feeling layer. I went ahead and applied my makeup and was happy it didn't seem to affect the finish but it also did almost nothing to improve it either. Possibly slightly less puffiness but some white liner along my inner lashes and my regular under eye concealer work better and don't leave me with a weird filmy feeling under my eyes. I've tried this several times now and I'm just not impressed.
Well, I've not noticed a huge difference in eye puffiness when I use this product. My eye puffiness decreases the longer I'm out of bed, anyway, so I attributed the easing of the puffiness to being out of bed and upright! The days I use this I notice no difference in how long it takes the puffiness to go away. However, it's a nice moisturizer. Clicking the button produces too much product for me, as I actually have oily skin and don't need a huge amount, just a little very close to the eyes. Perhaps those with drier skin will see more effect. I personally can't see paying 22 bucks for this product.
