I have tried so many products to just be totally disappointed. But this one does work. The lines under my eys are my problem area and this has helped to make them much less noticeable..Manufactures take note-- I am tired of the false claims and when I find something that actually works I will buy it. Most I have tried before do not work and should not be advertised as such.
The Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum is sort of a mixed-use cream. On one hand, it's not the super-expensive use-by-the-drop eye cream that is typically sold in the tiniest bottle on the planet. On the other hand, it's not a more casual face cream that you would slather on your entire face, at least not at the prices they ask for it. This falls somewhere in the middle. It's not meant for near-eye use - Olay has a Regenerist eye lifting serum for that task. Rather, this regenerating serum is meant to be used at other wrinkle spots that don't require the super-special eye cream. Eye skin tissue is VERY delicate - where the wrinkles on your forehead and mouth are not quite so delicate.I use the fragrance free variety, because I don't want anything that near to my nose to be putting off aromas all day long. It is indeed fragrance free, which is nice. I use the serum on my forehead, and under my chin. Those are where, for me, I need the most help keeping my skin in its best shape.The price is of course a down side, but again it's meant for special care; it's not meant to be a full body lotion. You use this where your skin is in need of some TLC and attention. However, having said that, I find that it's just a little too greasy for me. Where the eye serum is wonderfully light and goes great with the delicate eye skin, this serum should have been slightly more thick but with the same grease-free feeling. Instead, I find the greasiness to be uncomfortable on my face. It makes me feel like I need to go wash my face to get the "slime" off. I therefore only use this at night, when I fall asleep soon afterwards and let the serum nourish my skin until I wake up again.Well recommended, although I'll keep testing lotions in this price range to see if I find something else of similar quality but with a less greasy feel to it.
I purchased this because it was fragrance free - I hate having my face smelling after using a product.  It goes on easily and the pump dispenses at the right amount - not too much or too little.  It fades in nicely and I can put makeup on fairly soon afterwards.  My face doesn't feel stiff as it does when I don't use product after shower.  So in all, I'm pleased with this purchase.
I  use light, delicate nail colors & prefer natural tan tones with a hint of peach or pink.  It's becoming increasingly difficult to find the shades I prefer especially colors that have the right amount of pearl in them. In the container, O.P.I. Hawaiian Orchid. looks like the exact color I want.  It looks like pink, with a hint of tan, maybe a light mauve, and has a slight shimmery iridescence to it...no pearl & not exactly a matte finish either. However, when I apply it, it is a very, very sheer pink, looks like it has a matte finish with a tiny bit of  iridescence. I apply at least 3 coats to get the coverage I prefer. I like the fact that there's no pearl in it, but wish the iridescence showed up more than it does. However, the pink is a nice shade, not bright, but an elegant, medium pink color with no pearl in it.  I always useNail Life Revitalizer Treatment Original Formulaas both an undercoat & overcoat.
I am an Opi nail lacquer fan and have not been disappointed with any of the colors. I have 10-15 colors and think each one is the best.This rich wine color is perfect for Fall. It is a color that mixes well with any of the color spectrum. This year wine, merlot, and burgundy are the really big fashion colors.. For the nail polish, the best accessory for fall is lacquer. "So what shades arevthe best for Fall, think deep, dark variations of red and navy offset by cool tones of minimalist white and beige." , according to Harper's Bazaar.This 'Louvre Me Louvre Me Not', is the essential color to head this trend. Opi has the reputation for one of the best nail lacquers, and with a base undercoat and quick dry coat to seal in the color, this lacquer is good for at least a week.Highly Recommended.  prisrob 09-24-12OPI Nail Lacquer, I'm Really Not a Waitress, 0.5-Fluid OunceO.P.I Limited Edition Germany Collection Nail Lacquer, German Icure by Opi, 0.5 Fluid Ounce
Here's a review coming from a guy who cares about hygiene. I remember using these strips when they first came out over 10 years ago, and they worked great- almost half of my blackheads would get removed each time I'd use one of these! Over the last couple of years though, something's happened to the strips, and while they still work well, only about a third of my blackheads get removed with one strip.These strips are easy to use, and as long as you -follow the directions-, you shouldn't be having any problems. Get your nose wet, and with dry hands, place the strip on your nose, covering the area where most of the problem blackheads are. Leave it on there for 10-15 minutes (when the strip has hardened), and then peel it at the sides. Examine it closely, and you're sure to see a bunch of junk that it sucked out of your pores. It's actually fascinating to look at, and beats pinching your nose, getting one blackhead out at a time.But like I mentioned, these won't completely get rid of them, and I've always had a hard time getting the blackheads on the sides of my nose, so you might want to look into other products or ask a specialist. But for a casual person who just wants their nose to look a little better, I highly recommend these. 'not a bad price either on here!
I haven't tried these in many many years so I had forgotten how great these work. They work best when you get out of a hot shower since your pores will be more open. I applied to my wet nose and 15 minutes later removed tons of pore clogging oil. I am only rating it 4 stars since I had to use another strip, cut it in two, and apply on my cheeks just where the original strip ends. It works great but the strips need to be a little longer. After using, apply moisturizer.
Biore strips work well if your nose pores are really clogged. Like if you haven't used strips or mask or exfoliant in a long time. You can actually see the dirt and gunk from inside your pores get stuck on the strip when you remove it. It's kind of gross but also satisfying to know that all of that is not in your pores anymore.However, I feel like they aren't as satisfying if you use them regularly, or if you regularly use another pore-cleansing product (like a clay mask). If your pores aren't really clogged up, the strips don't do very much.They also leave my nose a tad sensitive, and leave a residue on my nose that I have to wash off afterwards.Definitely worth trying once... but I don't use them as part of my regular routine.
When it does come down to beauty, we often are looking for the best product to get rid of lifes, little facial escapes. For most of us, the hardest things to take out of our face, are nasty little blackheads, which mostly get caught up in our nose, and clog up in our pores. But, most facial products don't show how good they can deliver. For Biore', they have delivered very well at getting rid of our blackheads from our face, and that has continued to show with their Picture Perfect Pore Strips. I really was impressed at how much it got rid of after my first use. You simply wet your face, and put the pore strip on your nose, and let it set after around a half hour. Then take it off, and you'll see fewer blackheads on your nose. I absolutely recommend these Biore' Pore Perfect Strips as a great buy for a picture pefect way at getting rid of your blackheads.Price: B 1/2-Convience: B+Overall: B 1/2+
These are a nice solution for in between facials. They definitely clear up my nose a little, but not all the way.
These won't turn your skin into porcelain perfection. But they WILL get out studdborn blackheads better than squeezing. I used to do a routine of steaming my face and then scrubbing and masking, which did work but I hardly have time for that any more. With these strips you can use them right after a shower, and the results last about a week, which is okay because they're supposed to be used weekly. They do not hurt coming off; pull slowly. Not like wax for hair, which you need to yank off. I use mind only on the end of my nose and not up near delicate eye skin.Bottom line: They do work, make sure not to pull quickly and use after a shower.
Dove's products, as we all know, are products that contain a large amount of moisturizing agents.  This body wash is no different.The cream feels like lotion and the scent is barely noticeable.People who frequently use Dove will definitely love this product.
I like the scent of this body wash.  It seems to moisturize my skin better than my regular brand, Ivory Aloe.  I can see where acne prone or otherwise troublesome skin might react adversely to this product because it does contain a couple of types of oil but I haven't had any issues like that.  My only gripe is that there was a thin clear plastic seal over the lid that I did not notice before the bottle was in the shower and wet.  I coukd not remove the seal and ended up having to bust the lid/spout assembly off the bottle to get at the contents.  I don't know if the seal is only on shipped bottles or if its on all bottles, even those on store shelves.  And maybe if I had seen the seal before it got wet it would have been easily removed.  All I know is that using different blades of my small pocket knife I was unable to remove the seal and because of that aggravation I would not buy this product.
Dove body was with Nutrium Moisture washed and rinsed well with a nice texture and body feel. I liked how the Dove felt smooth and I felt clean without feeling greasy. The NuriumMoisture has a faint palm oil odor. I like dove and usually don't find their scents overwhelming, but this one was a little odd smelling to me. Stepping out of the shower I could no longer smell it, so it doesn't linger at all. Dove just left me feeling clean and soft.
Maybe I scrub too hard when showering, but most soaps and body washes tend to leave my skin feeling too dry which also leaves it itchy. I experienced neither problem after using Dove Sensitive Skin Nourishing Body Wash. Like Dove's bar soap, it really does seem to nourish the skin as well as clean it. I don't want to sound like I'm trying to write advertising copy, but this product did leave me feeling refreshed. Some other reviewers have complained that it is not unscented as the product description claims, but I did not detect any scent, certainly nothing strong or perfumy.Dove costs a little more than I think I would normally spend for body wash, but this is a quality product that I wholeheartedly recommend.
I don't usually keep bubble bath around, so when the mood hits me for a bubble bath I like to be able to use whatever body wash I'm using at the time. This particular body wash does not work well as a bubble bath. Although, it's hard to knock points off of a product when it doesn't work great for a use it's not intended for. There isn't really a scent to this product, which is exactly what you look for in a non-scented product. I find that my skin feels ever so slightly greasy when I'm in the tub and even a little so when I have dried off. The greasy feeling does go away once I've been out of the tub and dry for a few minutes. I guess that's the nutrium moisture.
Thisis a nice body wash for sensitive skin, and doesn't seem to promote any irritation or itching following your shower.  That is a great find, as I have dry skin; and many products tend to cause irritation.
This body wash comes in a 24 oz. bottle that is about twice the size of most body washes. The price is higher than many similar products but you are getting more product in exchange. This body wash has the traditional Dove soap smell along with a strong lotion smell. It has a very clean and soapy smell and makes you feel very clean and refreshed. It's very rich and full of moisture, probably more than any previous body washes that I have tried. I like the scent but it's very strong and it's almost made be gag in the shower because the smell was just so strong. I have learned to use a little less of this body wash at a time.
I expected this body wash to lather up a little more, but in a super moist kind of way (thus the "Deep Moisture Nourishing" part of the name...). It doesn't though.The fragrance is nice and it is good for washing, but since it doesn't make much of a lather, it takes a lot of the product to wash all over.My wife reminded me that I probably missed the intended use: shaving my legs. Very funny, dear. But she's right. This would be fine for shaving.
So this product did pretty much as it advertises. It cleaned me gently - it did not leave my skin dry like some soaps do.Whatever moisturizers it has must have absorbed into my skin, because I didn't feel greasy. It had a nice clean fragrance. This is important to me because I don't want anything that either interferes with my perfume or is so annoyingly strong that it gives me a headache. The price seems to be right in line with other like products.I think my skin is just too old to feel soft and smooth just from using a particular type of soap.BUT, I will keep buying this soap for all the other positives it has behind it.
If you need a body wash for sensitive skin, this may fill the bill for you. I ordered it primarily because it was unscented. That means, essentially that no fragrance has been added. For those that are sensitive to fragrance, this is a good thing. However everything has a smell. Because no scent has been added, you have the scent of the ingredients themselves which wasn't awful, but slightly unpleasant to me. This body wash also did not work up a good lather as well as other brands I have used. This may be due to the mild cleanser in this formula. For these reasons, I probably won't buy this again, but the consumer with sensitive skin may find this just what they need.
I can't say it "nourishes skin deep down", I use a more expensive and concentrated creme for that. However the mild cleanser and clean rinse does make my skin soft and smooth. While in the shower I wash my hair first, rinse, than apply conditioner. Before I rinse the conditioner out I use a small amount of the Sensitive Skin Nourishing Body Wash on a washcloth to bathe. I feel clean and the product leaves my skin softer than a regular soap. A noticable improvement since I started using.
Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture, Deep Moisture Nourishing, 24 Ounce, is quite the name. Since the last few years I have noticed the need to hydrate, moisturize, and all the good stuff during a shower. Dry skin is a little pain in the arse, and I am always on the look out for the most advanced, highly concentrated product in the free world that may keep the body from dry spells. I do not like the signs of dry skin. In some severe cases you can see the skin shedding this powder like form when scratching, which always seems that itching and dry skins are like best friends, or part of the same obnoxious gang. It is nice to jump, or better still, step into the shower and have the proper line of products to combat all that is needed. From Plax before brushing the teeth, a great toothpaste, an even better mouthwash to absolutely obliterate the great concentration of bacteria that is rumored to multiply by the hour (wipe them all out, is what I say!), and then pick the best possible soap that will wash that ass but at the same time it will deliver hydration, nutrition? (what in the world is NutriumMoisture, otherwise?) and allow you to walk out of the shower a renewed man, ready to take on the world without any fear of unwanted claims of improper hygiene.I have been using this product with a very efficient japanese wash towel (if one could call it that), that allows for the foam to multiply and since it is very long, to be able to wash your own back to one's hear content. This Dove Body Wash, once it has covered all areas (and I do mean all, for the most secret ones are definitely the most essential), and properly rinsed does leave you feeling a bit more optimistic even to the point than an operetta might be attempted, feeling fresh and for the day officially acknowledge to be part of the elite that just got out of a thorough shower. I am sure this is something that most people take for granted, but I have stood in line with some smelly characters, or pushed in an elevator, and let me assure you: I take the well washed crowd any day over the soap deficient one! Be that girl or boy, to put it mildly.Cleanliness is one step in the right direction, and If the resources are available, I would encourage everyone to take a shower once in a while, and this Dove Body Wash may not be the top dog but it certainly performs well if used with diligence. Shower Time! 4 Stars!
Although this is a great bodywash, and it does everything that the Dove bodywashes do, like making your skin really soft, I didn't much care for the smell. I also received theDove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning, 18 Ounce, and I liked the smell of that one a lot better.If your skin is really dry though, I would recommend the Nutrium. It definitely seems to have more moisturizers, and if your skin is dry, it will help that in a hurry. It's a great extra layer of moisturizer, and again, you can use it to shave your legs and under arms.
I've always felt that Dove is a reputable brand.  I've never disliked any Dove product I've used such as soaps and deodorants. I'm also happy to know that Dove is not only made right here in the United States, but also in my home state of Connecticut!  All great reasons to try this new product - the Dove Deep Moisture Nourishing Body Wash.I love body washes, and although I don't use them constantly, I do enjoy treating myself from time to time. This new one by Dove does indeed give one a very good feeling of deep moisturizing - you can feel it upon the skin while washing, therefore, I know I'm giving my skin not only a good cleansing but also a nourishing moisturizing treat. Another great thing is that it rinses clean and clear with no remaining "filmy" feeling as with some other brands. I get out of the shower feeling soft and clean-feeling skin.
My normal family body wash isSimple Clean Simply Ivory Original Scent Body Wash, 24-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)which does a great job of moisturizing, cleaning, and providing excellent value.  We buy it with Subscribe and Save.  However, I got the Dove Body Wash to compare it and see what we were missing over the more expensive Dove Brand.  To start, it is certainly a different formula than the Ivory, with a creamy feeling that is certainly different than the Dove.  It didn't lather quite as well, but did do a good job cleaning.  To be frank, the best word I could use to describe it would be "slimy", but perhaps that is because I am used to the more traditional Ivory soap rather than a super-moisturizer like Dove.The scent is pleasant - not unscented, but true to Dove products, it is a gentle scent that didn't bother anybody's skin.  Overall, it felt like it was moisturizing, but it's really hard to tell the difference between the Dove and the less expensive Ivory, or even the store brands which promise to be moisturizing.  Different feel in the bath, but the same feel afterwards.  I don't personally see the value, but it's a fine soap and if you like the creamier consistency of the more moisturizing body washes, then it's a fine choice for you as well.
Dove for Sensitive skin body wash fills my loofah sponge on a regular basis. When I read about the extra moisturizing of this one I switched.  How can you not give it a try when you have dry skin and its in the middle of a Midwest winter?  I certainly was not disappointed.  It will be my new shower wash.  Suds nicely.  Does not leave a residue.  Will recommend it to other Midwesterners.Happy sudsing!UPDATE:  I just ordered another Dove with Nutrium I am so pleased with it.  Consistently leaves my skin.feeling soft and clean.
This body wash has a light sweet smell. It creates a rich, creamy medium lather.It is very moisturizing. My skin feels very soft when I get out of the shower. However, you will need to continue using lotion. I liked it and would probably buy it as an alternative to my favorite Oil of Olay body wash.
Indoor heating and dry winter air turn my usually oily skin into the Sahara. I am pretty rushed for time most of the time, so I don't always bother with body lotion. I loved this body wash. While it's not a substitute for regular body lotion, it does leave my skin hydrated. Also, the lather is very rich and luxurious. One caveat, though, even though there is no added scent, it does have smell. It actually smells like the Dove body bar. I happen to like the scent so for me it was not a problem, but those looking for no scent at al my be disappointed.
Okay, so you know how in the winter you need extra moisturizing? Well I now believe that if you use this product a few times a week you will no longer need multiple layers of lotion before going outside, lol.I liked the lather, the feel, the scent and as I mentioned the way it left my skin feeling afterwards. My daughter who suffers from extremely dry skin especially this time of the year also had nothing but good things to say about this product.Now I am a believer in soap buildup so I would switch up soap agents (body wash included) to exfoliate but I think this could become one of my primary body washes.
Review is based on a one time use.This body was very good. It has the texture of lotion and, while it didn't lather very well (I used it with a wash cloth and saw the "idea" of the body wash wanting to lather), it felt great on my skin. It rinsed off well, I didn't feel tightness on my skin like I do with some bar soaps, and my skin actually feels softer after a single use.It says the product is unscented, but when I used it I smelled a faint aroma. I don't mind this, but as one review said, if it's being advertised as unscented, better not say it is and then scent it.Very good product aside from no lather. I'll stock up on this one.
I have been usingOlay Quench Body Wash, 12 oz.  I like it quite well, but I was running low and got the opportunity to try this product.The Dove body wash is slightly thicker than the Olay, but it lathers just as well.  It is unscented, like it says on the bottle.  (I've had trouble with buying unscented products that smelled in the past.)  My skin isn't super sensitive - I get hives sometimes, but no eczema - so I can't comment much on that aspect of the product, but it hasn't irritated my skin.  I do feel nicely moisturized after using the product.This is your standard body wash.  Nothing sticks out to me about the product, but there are no drawbacks either.
Like many people, my skin tends to get dry and itchy during the winter. This condition is probably a combination of the dry environment indoors due to central heating and the fact that scrubbing ourselves with soap in the shower every day is not kind to our skin in the first place. Could the right soap improve matters? Well, the wrong soap can certainly make things worse.I've found that the "Men" line of Dove products are just horrible at drying out my skin. They leave me in a condition slightly akin to whole-body dandruff. The "Go Fresh" line of Dove products, however, are much, much better in this respect. On the basis of those experiences, I thought I'd give Dove's "Deep Moisture" body wash a try.The verdict? I like it, but I'm not sure it's much better than the Go Fresh washes. Looking at the bottle, I have no idea what makes Deep Moisture different from Go Fresh. They both have "Nutrium Moisture"--whatever that is... they aren't exactly clear on that point. It's probably more trademarkable jargon than trade craft. I'm not a fan of gimmicks, but they are unavoidable in personal care products for some reason. Nevertheless, I can't say anything bad about this product. It does seem like it moisturizes better (although it probably just de-moisturizes less) than other washes I've tried. It feels a tad like washing with moisturizer when I'm using it. But I'm not sure the end results are that much better (or better at all, it's hard to say) compared to the Go Fresh washes I've used.As far as aesthetics go, the scent is a fresh, neutral smell that smells a lot like your average bottle of lotion. It fits the theme, I guess, and it's fine, but you don't get any options if you like to mix it up.
If you are looking for a luxurious, silky great smelling body wash move on.  You will not find it with this.  If you are looking for an economical and basic clean smelling body wash then this is for you.I am one of those people who have at least 3 different body washes in the shower at any given time.  Overall, my skin has different needs at different times and different parts of my skin have different needs most of the time (sorry, the last part of that sentence might have been TMI).  What I mean is sometimes I want a really nice fruity or exotic body wash to feel pampered.  Sometimes I want a nice exfoliating body wash.  What I get with Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture is a nice, creamy, medium weight body wash.While there is some lather to it I wouldn't say it is sudsy.  I normally squeeze my body wash onto a synthetic scrubby I keep in the shower but that didn't seem to be the best application for this product.  I found that applying it out of the stream of the shower directly to my skin was the best approach.  Just like you are applying lotion.  I let it all soak in for a bit and then I washed it off with the scrubby.There didn't seem to be any type of obvious coating on my skin after rinsing.  My skin felt nice and smooth so I skipped the usual after shower lotion and/or oil application.  The next morning I did feel a bit dry and did end up moisturizing after showering with the Dove.Overall I think it is a good product that does the job.  Good value for the money.
I really do like the feel of this body wash. It lathers well and one generous dollop is enough for my whole body in the shower -- with the exception of my face, on which I use a facial wash. I'm not too crazy about the smell, though, and I understand that perfumes can cause problems. I would just like to have the option to buy other fragrances. The bottle is very hard and thick and it does get difficult to squeeze out the product. It helps to reform the bottle and make sure it has air in it. It will not stand on its top and, since the tip is so small, it doesn't even lean well. That being said, the top is easy to open in the shower.My skin does feel smoother and less dry when I use the product.It's a pretty good price compared to other body washes.
My skin is fairly normal, not overly dry, but it is really sensitive and can easily become red, itchy and tight. (Especially in the winter months!) This body wash is amazing, it's rich and thick, you can see it's not your normal thin gel body wash. It lathers up into a lovely foam that feels soft. The smell is really nice, not fruity, not flowery, not green, but clean and fresh. It does take me a little extra time to rinse, because I feel its a little heavy, but thats a good thing, since I'm pretty sure that's what it's supposed to do. And, as a time saving bonus, I have used this as a face wash, no breakouts, no tight drawn skin. I actually loved how soft and smooth my face was after. (I wouldn't use it as a face wash all the time, because I worry long term it would be too heavy, but in a pinch it was perfect.)After drying my skin feels comfortable! Yay!
I've been using this body wash for almost a week and am very pleased with the result. It's the dead of winter here, and this season is brutal in my part of the country, not just cold but the air is very dry. Chapped skin is almost a given, moisturizers and lotions a necessity.One of the reasons this product appealed to me was because it is a moisturizing body wash. So, while exfoliation is also desired, the standard net poof I use to apply all body washes accomplishes that goal. My hope was that this product, while cleansing, would not leave my skin feeling dry, and it didn't. The feeling left on my skin from the Dove is soft and smooth. I still use body lotion but my skin seems to be slightly more moisturized before applying my usual cream. I am attributing this change to the body wash.I do not have extremely sensitive skin, but whenever possible, like to avoid unnecessary ingredients which is another reason why I wanted to try this product. This brings me to my only complaint - it isn't unscented.I choose unscented products because layering perfumes from deodorants, soaps, and various creams, one on top of another, is offensive to me and I assume to a large portion of the people around me. If I wish to wear a fragrance, I will, but I would prefer all basic toiletry items remain unscented. So, the fact that this body wash has a definite scent when it claims to be unscented is unfortunate and disappointing. With that one caveat, I liked the product itself, just not its smell.
This is a creamy product and does the job without a soapy feeling.This is the first dove liquid bath product we purchased.For the price it is a good deal but most of all it does not leave a chemical feel nor corrosive slidy surface after use.
Dove is my soap of choice, so I was eager to see how this body wash would measure up to other products I've used. I'm glad to report it's very good. It's mild, and it has a light, refreshing scent.
This Dove Body Wash with Nutrium Moisture is a lovely body wash, probably my favorite ever. It is not drying, and leaves my skin smooth but not tight. Also, unlike some other super-moisturizing body washes that don't suds up, when used on a body puff this makes lots of frothy creamy bubbles even in our hard well water! It has a wonderful fresh soapy smell, not a fake chemical/perfume smell other body washes have. Very nice product.Recommendation: Yes, very nice product, well worth buying the name brand in this case. Love it.
I liked this body wash because it cleansed my skin without drying it out. It lathered nicely and had a pleasant scent. After I dried off, my skin was very soft, which made me happy considering the air is so cold and dry. I would definitely recommend this body wash and will most likely purchase it in the future.
I like the lather and the clean, fresh light scent of this body wash ... My skin feels smooth and nourished afterward ... not dry.  I like dove products and this is no exception ... another very good body wash that does as stated ... deep moisture nourishing. Recommended.
I have horrible allergies to certain soaps and after showering generally break out in hives.  Then I discovered Tree Hut's Hawaiian Kuku Body wash and it was solved http://www.amazon.com/Tree-Hut-Moisturizing-Shower-Hawaiian/dp/B004XHX1PW/  So I was curious... for a cheaper price, would the Dove sensitive skin work as well?  Well, it does work, but I admit it doesn't compare AT ALL to Tree Hut. Yes, I didn't break out in hives, so that's definitely good.  But it wasn't particularly moisturizing or as luxurious as Tree Hut.So if you don't mind paying the same price for 8 ounces less; go for the Tree Hut. If you want something cheaper and are desperate for something to stop the itchy craziness after a shower, then go for the Dove.  It works, it smells good and your skin will thank you for it!
This is more fluid than the other Dove body washes I have tried. I use it for my little kids whose skin are a bit more sensitive than mine. It is very gentle and almost devoid of any fragrance smell. You will also notice that it produce hardly any suds.
I have used Dove products for years. Everyone in my family has sensitive skin, and Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash does not cause any irritation. It is creamy and makes a rich, bubbly lather that leaves you feeling clean and fresh. I have tried other products to try to save a little money, but keep coming back to Dove. Nothing else comes close!I do agree that there is a very light (and pleasant) scent to this product, which is why I have rated this product with 4 stars instead of 5, but no one in our family has been adversely affected. If you are sensitive to scented bath products, you might want to try something else.
After using bar soap for a few months, I'd forgotten how nice a creamy bodywash could feel in comparison!  I think I'm firmly vowing never to go back to bar soap again if I can help it!This Dove Body Wash is nicely creamy, with an easy lather for the shower.  It doesn't feel excessively greasy or chalky and there's no strongly perfumed scents to the liquid.  Given that I have very sensitive skin, every soap is a new chance for itching and irritation.  Strong scents can give me a headache and many soaps leave me  uncomfortable for hours after showering.  After using Dove's soap for two weeks, my skin feels remarkably better, less prone to itching even in the dryness of the winter, and without any residue left over.I'd happily buy this particular product and use it regularly in the shower.  But, there is one slight problem.  This twenty four ounce container is big, and it's heavy!  It's very awkward to grip it well in the shower--particularly with wet hands.  I'd recommend anyone who buys this consider putting the soap in a smaller dispenser to actually use in the shower--this container is a tad too unwieldy to make it really work well.  Other than that--no complaints!Happy bathing! ^_^ Shanshad
I ordered this because Dove says it's unscented, so I was disappointed that it does have a scent, and, indeed, "Fragrance" is in the list of ingredients. It's not a heavy scent, and I don't find it objectionable, but all the same, I'd rather there was no scent. It's very thick and does lather up quite a bit, so a little goes a long way. It rinses off easily with no residue left behind, and my skin feels clean and smooth. I don't feel that my skin is particularly moisturized, but it's not dried out either, so that's a plus over bar soap. With the size of the bottle, the fact that a little goes a long way, and the price, this is a real bargain. Considering that the scent is very light, I would probably buy this again.
I have very sensitive and dry skin - if I don't moisturize at least twice a day, some patches will start cracking.  I have to give Dove credit for this body wash - the NutriumMoisture or whatever magical proprietary ingredient they've got in here did a great job of keeping my skin moist and smooth post-shower.  It lathered decently (not nearly as much as some other body washes of a similar price point, but enough that I felt clean) and was thick and creamy on application.The only real problem that I had with the body was the "unscented" product actually had a fairly strong smell coming out of the bottle.  I can't quite put my finger on it - it's that generic sort of clean, powdery soap smell you often get in body products and laundry soap.  It washes away, so when I got out of the shower I couldn't smell it on my skin.  But when something claims to be unscented, well - I don't want to smell anything at all!
This definitely fulfills the promise of clean skin that feels soft and without that after-soap roughness.  It dispenses in an opaque cream that feels like moisturizing lotion but lathers up easily.  If the scent was better (smelled very old fashioned and chemical-like - a 'granny scent' to me), I would have really liked this a lot.  But in the end, scent aside, this is a large size and works as promised.
This body wash is very good for dry skin.Does what it says, with deep moisturizing.Very little foaming or suds, but great for shaving legs etc.Rinses off easily but I'm not impressed with the scent.The scent is very weak and mild, but smells almost like baby powder.Good product for dry skin but I'd prefer a better smelling body wash.
I routinely buy unscented products because I am hypersensitive to the icky, perfume-y scents that get added to so many personal and household products. (They give me blinding headaches.)  Dove body wash does a good job of keeping my now-dry skin from turning to dust, so when I saw that this particular version of it was unscented, for sensitive skin, I jumped at the chance to try it.Unscented?  Not so much.  Granted, the scent is mild, and fairly unobjectionable, but it has a distinct scent unlike a great many other personal care products which promise that they're unscented and actually mean it.  No, I'm not saying that unscented means scent-free.  I'm saying that when unscented Dove body wash smells exactly like scented Dove body wash, albeit to a lesser degree, then the product isn't actually unscented.That said, let me go on to point out that it really does clean without drying.  I won't say that I notice my skin is markedly nicer after using it, but it's not itchy and flaking, which is a blessing during a Chicago winter.  I can't speak to the hypo-allergenic quality since my skin isn't what's sensitive to additives.
Dove's color repair shampoo is a gentle formula designed primarily for people who color their hair.  My wife and I don't do so, but I use these shampoos because they don't leave my hair feeling stripped, like some other formulas.The shampoo itself is a milky white with a soft fragrance.  It lathers well and rinses easily.  I find it leaves my hair feeling soft.  All in all, not a bad choice, although I cannot comment about whether it is gentle on dye jobs.
Some shampoos feel too rough, like you are using dish detergent on them.  Which would stink if you have colored hair. This is a very gentle, soft lathering shampoo that rinses simply and reminds me of Redken's Avocado oil shampoo.  When used with the corresponding conditioner, it makes for a light and soft finish that is silky and moves swingy.The scent of this is nice (as is all Dove products) and I only needed a drop to lather my shoulder length hair.It's too soon to say if my color has been protected, but the soft lather and easy rinse tells me it's not stripping my hair of every bit of moisture. Also, the shine that I had when I used both Shampoo and Conditioner feels like my hair has a light veil of moisture and softness.  Some shampoos feel like straw when you use them, this is not like that. Soft and silky.My mom used it on her shorter hair too, and it didn't weigh it down at all. We both love this product.
Maintaining vibrancy is a challenge with color treated hair. Dove's entry into the crowded field of specialty shampoos is both affordable and effective.The bottle has a modern slightly pyramid shape and is easy to handle. The shampooo itself has a pleasant, slightly fruity aroma. A little bit provides an adequate lather and rinses cleanly. It did leave me with fresh, clean hair that felt smooth and soft. The lower sulfate formula promises to keep color vibrant for up to eight weeks.Time will tell whether that is accurate. But this shampoo holds it own against pricier brands and is certainly an option for color treated hair. Recommended.
This is a very average shampoo.  Not that it claims to be anything more.  It is marketed as shampoo for color-treated hair, nourishing hair to keep color vibrant for up to eight weeks.  It is gentle on hair and does not make color fade any faster than anything else.  It also is well priced.The ingredients are very typical of a shampoo:Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Dimethiconol, Glycol Distearate, Carbomer, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Citric Acid, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Gluconolactone, PEG-45M, Benzophenone-4, Adipic Acid, Trehalose, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, PPG-9, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide, (CI 77891).The shampoo lathers nicely, has a nice scent, not too flowery, and rinses well.  We have some color-treated in the house.  Some dark hair, some blonde, both color treated to their natural shades.  We've used it on some fine hair, and thicker, dark hair.My hair feels clean after using the shampoo and is manageable, no frizz, not dried out, nor greasy.After using this for the past two weeks, I like it, but actually think the new Suave Professional Moroccan line is better.  This Dove shampoo is sold at an excellent price, yet teh Suave product is actually a few cents less per ounce.  I happen to like the scent of the Suave product more, and the oils in it make my hair feel and look better.There is nothing bad about this shampoo.  Nothing extraordinary either, except the price...The present price is exceptional - at less than 20 cents an ounce!
I have dyed my hair for years. My hair is straight, in layers, and on the fine side and I wash it every day. I used this shampoo every day for over 2 weeks and it worked well. I thought it didn't lather as much as some other shampoos that I've tried (however, we do have hard water so that may have been part of the reason). I didn't use any conditioner and it didn't weigh my hair down or leave it limp. It is advertised as having a lower sulfate content, however, you'll see in the fine print on the bottle, that it's considered lower than other Dove shampoos. Who know how that compares to other shampoos of other brands - sulfates are listed as the second ingredient for this shampoo (right after water), just like all of my other shampoos.Overall, it does a nice job with my hair.
I do not color my hair, but I prefer to use non-sulfate shampoos as I wash my hair daily. This shampoo is pretty gentle, yet effective.  My hair is thick, long and kind of dry.  I tend to oil my hair once a week either with coconut or jojoba oil, and this shampoo washed it all out without having to use a second time. I am using this along with Dove Hair Therapy Color Care conditioner. They seem to tame frizziness and leave my hair soft. The scent is just okay. Not great, but not overpowering either. I don't know if it was the way it shipped or a flaw in the design, but the top cracked a little bit when I opened it. Overall, Dove shampoos seem to be working pretty well for me without the high cost of some of the other non-sls shampoos out there.
I get my hair highlighted about every 6-8 weeks. Since what is used on my hair is pure bleach and a developer even in small doses can wreck havoc on my hair. To combat dry hair i use a variety of mousturizing shampoos and conditioners.This new line of products offered by Dove caters to both sexes and some very targeted needs. I like this shampoo for color treated hair because it is very mild, does a nice job of cleansing my hair, and doesn't strip my hair in the process. My own natural blonde hair and my highlighted blonde hair blends in nicely together and maintains my many wonderful shades of blonde while keepng the hair soft, silky, and manageable. Used with or the corresponding conditioner, my hair looks nice and (surprise) natural.
For a reasonably priced shampoo, Dove Color Repair is nice. The shampoo has a mild smell, with a hint of vanilla. The lather is nice, not thick and rich like more expensive shampoos, but nice all the same. It leaves my hair soft. It seems to dry out my hair a little bit. This is a nice reasonably priced shampoo.
My retired parents color their gray hair frequently but were frustrated that most shampoos were washing out their hair color in less than a month.  They were happy to give this Dove Color Care Shampoo a try.LIkes:>My parents' freshly colored hair appeared to wash out less after using this shampoo for one month.>Nice, fresh, refreshing, appley scent.>Gentle formula enriched with hair nutrients to revitalize frequently dyed hair.>Seems more effective in retaining hair color thanSuave Professionals Shampoo, Color Care - 14.5oz.that my parents had used before.Dislike:>Priced much higher than competing products such as the Suave Color Care Shampoo.* As of Apr. 25, 2013, the price for this Dove product has been lowered to be competitive with the Suave product.Overall:An effective shampoo for maintaining and extending the duration of hair color.  I will certainly buy this product again for family members who frequently dye their hair.
"Dove Hair Shampoo, Color Care" is a very reasonably priced shampoo that promises to deliver vibrant, healthy-looking hair; preserve vibrant color; and result in advanced care and repair for your hair.My color; the shine; and the condition of my hair were no different than with other products when I used "Dove Hair Shampoo, Color Care" and its companion conditioner.  The protection of color "Dove Hair Shampoo, Color Care" promises will depend on whether you use permanent or semi-permanent color as well as how frequently you shampoo.  After using "Dove Hair Shampoo, Color Care" and its companion conditioner, fly-away and broken hairs were still noticeable.  That is consistent with the results most over-the-counter products produce.A small amount of "Dove Hair Shampoo, Color Care" was all that was needed; I used less than a tablespoon worth and should have used less.  The shampoo suds up quite nicely - a little will go a long way.  My hair felt light and very soft after using this shampoo; there was no indication that it would quickly become "greasy" in appearance.  This product has a light, sweet fragrance which rinsed out well and was not evident once my hair had been styled.  The fragrance should not conflict with other scented products you may use."Dove Hair Shampoo, Color Care" is packaged in a uniquely shaped container.  It fits nicely in one's hand; is easy to hold, even with wet hands; and is easy to control with respect to dispensing the shampoo.I liked "Dove Hair Shampoo, Color Care" as a reasonably priced everyday shampoo.  I am awarding it 4 stars.
I dye my hair a color that is known for rapid fading and I havent found a shampoo that seems to help much with this issue. Until now. After 2 weeks I havent noticed any fading or loss of vibrancy. The shampoo leaves my hair clean and moisturized. I am using it in conjunction with the conditioner, but even when I skipped the conditioner my hair was soft and manageable. And the scent is pleaant but not cloying.
Another good product from Dove will use again as it seems to work great and has a very pleasent smell.  It applies very easily and leaves hair feeling very soft and manageable after use.  It also seems to be very reasonably priced with other product and seems to work okay about keeping your hair from fading while being in the sun and such.  It also works well when paired with the conditioner and does a great job of getting your hair clean.
The shampoo is thick and sudsy, and it feels like a moisturizing shampoo. I used it in conjunction with the Color Care conditioner and it left my hair feeling soft and detangled, but not too weighed down.I'm prone to migraines that are triggered by fragrance-- particularly floral scents-- and this shampoo does have a floral scent. It's very light and pleasant, but it lingered after my hair was dry, which would probably be a benefit to most people, but not for me. I can't keep using it, but I'm still giving it four stars because I think most people without sensitivities to fragrance would like this shampoo a lot.
I'm on the hunt for a good drugstore color-care shampoo, and I like this one. Time will tell how well it holds on to my highlights, but so far I like it much better than Garnier's color-care shampoo. Dove's is much creamier and I feel like it coats my hair better. My hair would feel kind of dry and stripped right after I rinsed out the Garnier, but it feels silky and strong after using Dove. (I use another brand's leave-in conditioner after shampooing.) I have long, thick, medium-coarse hair, and it seems drugstore products either leave it too soft and prone to static and flyaways, or they weigh my hair down. So far I'm seeing a happy medium with this shampoo. I don't know if it's the best out there, but I'm pretty happy with it.
Glad to get the opportunity to try Dove's color safe shampoo because on a typical store shelf only about 10% of the shampoos are color safe.First thing I noticed is that the bottle lists sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) as one of its ingredients but the product description above on the website doesn't. I'm going to go with the bottle and assume that it contains SLES. The good thing is that though SLES is a cheap foaming agent at least it isn't its cousin SLS, the even cheaper and more irritating foaming agent.The shampoo itself is creamy white and lathers easily, only a medium sized dab was enough for my short hair. Its fragrance is pretty mild and inoffensive. It leaves my hair nice, soft and oil free. Time will tell how effective its color safeness is. It is however a very good deal at its current price and I have no problem recommending it.
Our family was glad to get a chance to try this shampoo and its matching conditioner.  It's a solid shampoo that gets good reviews from the whole family, plus it's color-safe, which is great.It's basically just a good shampoo, especially when used with the matching conditioner.  Our family's hair is good looking and manageable, and the product has a pleasant but mild coconut fragrance.  Recommended, particularly if other shampoos are damaging your color.
This shampoo lathers well, gives off a pleasant, neutral scent, and rinses clean.  It's also gentle enough for everyday use, even for color-treated hair.  While it's difficult to differentiate between most shampoo products to any tremendous degree, this is one that I could see myself buying in the future.
This shampoo cleans my hair nicely.  It left it feeling both clean and soft, which is nice.  The scent is decent- it's a sort of coconut scent, one I'd describe as soft.  The packaging indicates that this is a "lower sulfate" shampoo, and that is evident.  This shampoo does not lather as much as others.  I'm not sure who the "lower sulfate" bit is meant to attract.  I've found that either people don't care or they don't want sulfates, period.  Still, if you're looking for a good value drugstore shampoo, this is a good choice.
I am an older woman with color treated hair, so I always look for products that help keep color in hair as long as possible.  Dove Hair shampoo, color care is a very good shampoo if you are on a budget for color care hair products.  It has very light lather-other reviewers seemed to really like this, I don't mind if my hair lathers a lot or a little because I wash all of it out anyway.  The scent is alright-I have never been wild about coconut.  That is why I can't give this product 5 stars. However, once you have dried your hair, there is not a noticable smell left over from this shampoo.  After using this shampoo once, combined with the conditioner, my hair was shiny and looked good.This is a shampoo that I would buy.  This was a vine review product sample, and I was not paid to endorse this product in any way.
This is my first time using Dove shampoo and I really like it! I use it in combination with the matching conditioner and I love the way it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. It lathers really well and leaves my hair smelling fresh in clean. I will be buying this again!
I'm a big fan of the Dove products and while I did like this shampoo I didn't feel like I received the same amount of clean and shine as I do with some of their other products.
Normally I don't love Dove products. This one, though, works fine. It smells wonderful, does a very good job of cleaning my hair, and doesn't seem to be stripping my color!! Sometimes I use a new shampoo and my color seems affected by it on the first use. I dare say my color, not just my hair, looks cleaner after using Dove.Sheri Gill - Writer, Mom, Mage!
This shampoo left my hair so silky and smooth (I used it with the matching conditioner as recommended).  It smells clean and fresh, but isn't overpowering.  It lathers well and rinses off cleanly and easily.  I blow dried my hair after using this and it still left me smooth, shiny, and silky.
This shampoo works great on my color treated hair and gives it a nice soft feel. Great with the color protection, but it isn't a super strong shampoo. If you have very greasy hair or scalp issues I don't think you would like this shampoo at all.
Dove Color Care shampoo is a safe choice in general.  It has little scent and is very gentle while doing a good job of cleaning.  My only concern is that, like many creamy shampoos, it tends to weigh the hair down.  It might be perfect for someone look for serious moisturizing, such as during Winter.
I've been using Head&shoulders for years and I really like it. So far, no shampoo delivers the same quality for the cost. However, this Dove Shampoo is also pretty good. The scent is girly but the quality is the same as Head&shoulders. After the shower, my hair is smooth and soft and no itchy feeling at all. It's also easy to wash off the shampoo. Overall, good product. Buy it if you're a girl (since the Head&shoulders scent is kind of manly).
Dying your hair is not an easy task, what with all the mess and the time you spend in the bathroom making sure all the roots covered.  That is why prolonging the interval between applications is important.  The Dove shampoo seems gentle enough to protect the color every time it is shampoo time.  The fragrance is also very subtle.  So, far it seems to work what it has promised for.  Hair also looks great, shiny and easily manageable.
I have regular thick asian black brown hair. I didn't color it. I just used it. I have 5 shampoos. I just use this for wednesdays after shampoo. When midweek, I know I could use a shampoo and conditioner.
This was the first time I've tried Dove shampoo.  While I am familiar with their unique facial soaps I wasn't very aware that they made other products.  Here are a few observations:- It is creamy, however it does not lather as much as other shampoos I have used- The fragrance is very subtle, though pleasant- The sculpted bottle is easy to hold with wet hands- The cap is a little difficult to open and it cracked the first time I used it- It leaves the hair clean with no noticeable residue
This product seems to work well. I'm not sure how effective it is in relation to color, but I don't have artificially colored hair. In terms of the fact that it's a shampoo, though, it works well. It has a nice scent and seems to be a high-quality product. Recommended.
I use Dove products regularly and have had very good results overall.  This shampoo helps my highlights get some shine and life even after a while of having them done.  My hair is on the fine side and can get too dry with highlights, this shampoo brings back some of the moisture making my hair look healthy.  I can't use it by itself I must use conditioner with it, my hair tangles easily if I don't.  It has a nice scent that doesn't overpower any other perfume I use.  I will keep using this shampoo.
My daughter and I have been using this and theDove Hair Therapy Conditionertogether for about two weeks. My daughter colors her hair so the "Vibrant Color Lock" is supposed to help the coloring last.  The milky texture of the shampoo is a little strange. Probably this biggest comment either of us have is that together the shampoo and this conditional make you hair feel extremely soft. Some hair products in the past have caused skin irritation for us but this one was fine.  We may try the Dove conditioner with other shampoos after this bottle runs out.
It's a good product that makes my hair soft and shiny.  I feel it brings the color out in my hair when I use it with the conditioner.
This Dove shampoo smells of sweet coconut. It is gentle on my hair and works well even without conditioner. I really have not noticed much difference between how my hair looks - colour-wise after using it as compared to other gentle shampoos. So my only minor complaint is the bottle. I really like to leave my shampoo bottle upside down in the basket in our shower, so that as they get to a lower volume level it is easy and quick to get the shampoo out, and of course with a tilted cap they won't do that.Still the shampoo inside is good.
two days in and my excema is already disappearing. the soap smells fantastic and didnt leave black scum or residue on my shower. the soap has gentle exfoliating in it that was not too harsh. such a win!
This soap smells nice and lathers quite nicely.  I was able to use it on my face and it did not break me out.  My only complaint is that this soap leaves that draggy tight feeling on my skin, therefore, I would prefer a face wash or body wash over this soap.
If you are looking for a good soap to really remove dirt and cleanse your skin, you need to think about this Adovia natural mineral soap. My skin feels really but it still feels hydrated and moisturized. I like that it is made with Dead Sea mud.  My skin feels so good..not dry but healthy and clean. It gets all my makeup off so I feel like my skin can breathe.  I love that it is 100% all natural too. I don't like using skin care that has chemicals these days.  I was noticing a little bit of a breakout on my chin right before I started with the Adovia but it cleared up pretty fast after I started using it. My skin has been very clear for the last week or two.  I wish I had known about this when I was in my teens with acne popping up so often. I also find this soap works great to use after my workouts to make sure my skin is clean and fresh.
I love Dead Sea products! They leave your skin so smooth and refreshed. Great to have during those pesky breakouts. I only gave it a four star because I would love to see the bar a different color than brown!
I was given the opportunity to try this product directly from the manufacturer, and have personally tested the product for three weeks. Since I was a teen, Dead Sea products have been all of the rage, and so I jumped at the chance to try this soap out first hand! Why was I so excited? For Dead Sea mud is infused with over 35 different types of minerals, and though this region is considered by biologists to be biologically dead, its muddy shorelines are densely packed, low-pollen, oxygen-dense which can clinically been proven to cure or alleviate the symptoms of ailments ranging from skin problems such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne,  rheumatic diseases, and fibromyalgia.With all of this said, here is what I liked about the product:Great for Eczema, Psoriasis or Acne! I have acne-prone skin, and this soap, and its exfoliating properties left my skin smooth and clean.The product had a pleasant lemongrass smell.The soap lathers well.The soap rinsed cleanly.The soap is made in Israel, and is guaranteed to be comprised of authentic Dead Sea Mud.Overall, I have enjoyed the soap, and can also vouch for its longevity, as I have 3/4 of a bar left, after nearly a month of use. I would give the caveat that a rich moisturiser should be used after this treatment, as it is not a moisturizing face bar; but this is a common practice with most bar-type soaps.  I also liked that the soap did not leave any residue or film on my skin, nor did my face feel overly tight from the product either. I have been very pleasantly surprised by this product!I would highly recommend this soap!
I have just completed the third week of using the NATURE'S GATE ORGANICS ACNE TREATMENT SYSTEM and going into the fourth. So far I've been very impressed with the results. And I figure that being at the half way point of the regiment, the box claims "clearer skin in 6-weeks," that if results aren't at least noticeable--another 3 weeks won't help.The three-step system is likeProactiv Solution 3 Step System Kit, 2 Month Supplywhere you use a cleanser, toner and a correcting lotion everyday to clear up acne. But instead of Benzoyl Peroxide as the active ingredient, NATURE'S GATE... uses 1% Salicylic Acid.I suffer from mild to moderate adult acne, with the occasional eruption of boils that I have to use a prescription topical solution to clear up, and I've found that the NATURE'S GATE... has help arrest the development of pimples and clear them up within 2-days. Also, my skin condition is pretty constant and does NOT get better or worse with changes in the weather (besides I'm in Los Angeles, CA and we pretty much have constant weather patterns anyway).A pimple would begin to form, tenderness and redness along with the bump, on my face and the system would keep it from becoming a full blown zit. It would only stay red with slight swelling and then it would clear up. I also noticed that I was getting a boil, which is an extreme case of a pimple for those who don't know, and NATURE'S GATE... kept that from forming as well.The reason I give only 4-Stars is because I'm running out of the toner and the cleanser, so I don't know if there's enough to make it to the end of 6-weeks. Also, I've noticed that my skin has a dewy/clammy feel to it after a couple of hours from using the toner and I'm not sure if I like that and there's no sun-screen in it so you must use a separate product if you plan on going out. But using the cleanser and toner twice a day and using the lotion only at night before bed, I've experienced no drying or irritation and that's a plus.Another good thing is that even though each product has tea tree oil in it, it doesn't have that strong herbal odor associated with the oil nor does it have a strong perfume scent of any kind.=============================CLEANSER--Light, clean scent (reminded me of candles) and clear. Light lather and rinses away easily.TONER/ASTRINGENT--Clear with a very light citrus scent. I experienced no burning and the toner does not contain alcohol, which can dry and irritate the skin and turn it red (for those like me who are sensitive to alcohol).LOTION--Light and creamy white, smells like the toner, goes on smooth and easy and absorbs quickly.============================I'll update at the end of six-weeks.UPDATE 01/02/09:I am two days short of 6 weeks and I've just run out of the cleanser.  The product has kept my face pretty clear but there were a couple of resistant pimples that took longer than the 2-3 days to heal. All in all a very satisfactory experience.
It's a good kit, but it seems that you can get just as much from Oxy Ten at the local grocery store for a fraction of the price. The only advantage may be, as others have mentioned, that it doesn't bleach your towels.
Nature's Gate Organics Advanced Care Natural Results Acne Treatment System is a three part acne treatment that provides pretty decent results. You start with the corrective cleanser, follow it with the calming toner that can also serve as a sun screen when you head out into the sunshine, and finish off with the controlling lotion. The first application cleans your skin, the second apparently helps soothe it, and, finally, the latter works to prevent further breakouts.Frankly, other than the promises made on the label, I can't say with any certainty exactly what each treatment accomplishes, but the corrective cleanser does seem to do the trick. It helps to clear up nasty blemishes and leaves the skin feeling smooth and clean. I don't battle acne as much as I did in my youth, but I still get the occasional zit, usually on the nose where it attracts the most attention. After using this product, I haven't had a single breakout. I take that as a sign that this product works. Therefore, it's recommended.Brian W. Fairbanks
The Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System works really well. It cleared up my sons face within a couple of weeks. The only down side is it takes persistence and using it everyday. So unless I am reminding my son every night to use it he forgets. So if you are going to use this product, to get results you need to use it consitently like other acne products.
I am a 38 year old women with adult acne and I have used EVERY product and they are not magic potions that work over night and I have never found one that took all my acne away forever.  I do like this product it's nature which means that I can use the toner around my eyes and I don't scream with pain.  The lotion is quick drying so I can add my make-up with in seconds of applying the lotion. I noticed some improvement with decrease in whiteheads but it did nothing for my blackheads.  I think if you are wanting to try something new this one is some merits.I am still waiting for the magic potion!!!
I have oily skin and this product makes my skin feel balanced and clean. I have seen a great improvement on my skin within a week. My skin just feels really great now after using this. I try to be consistent of using it daily for better results. I really like the fact that this product is natural and organic without harsh chemicals and ingredients found on other products.
This product was given to my 15yr. old niece due to her moderate acne problems (inherited from my older brother).  She gave me feedbacks after using "Natural Results Acne Treatment System" for 5 weeks."There are three bottles inside the box:  One 4oz. Salicylic Acid Cleanser, one 4oz. Calming Toner with Oligopeptide-10, and one 2oz. Salicylic Acid Lotion."  My niece has been using natural soaps and benozoyl peroxide based products in conjunction with a dermatologist prescribed tetracycline regimen which has been effective but she was interested in trying out a "natural acne treatment" product.Even though labeled as "Natural Results", this product also contains a long list of not so natural ingredients such as dimethicone, potassium sorbate, disodium EDTA, butylene glycol, etc.  The product was found to  be "a gentle cleanser not as harsh as other cleansers with higher alcohol contents". The toner and lotion helped to "decrease the amount of drying"  However, overall, the product did not seem to "work as fast" as the benzol peroxide based products.Overall, different individuals with varying degrees of acne problems usually find the best types of OTC treatments that work best for them either through recommendations or trial-and-error.  Any severe acne cases should always consult a board-certified dermatologist.
I've been using this cleansing system for 4 weeks now, and even tho' the box says to expect results within 6 weeks, I have found the last 3 weeks to be consistent enough to feel confident in my review of this product.First of all I have very dry, sensitive skin. Ex: Olay products leave me looking like a burn victim. I've also tried products with salicylic acid before and the results were painful. So I was hopeful, but leary to try this product. Most facial products containing salicylic acid are at 10%, The Nature's Gate Organics only contains 1% in both the cleanser & the controlling lotion. For those like myself this is just enough to clean the skin effectively without drying/scalding your flesh. It is also important to follow use of this product with a moisturizer.Since using the product my skin has been noticably clearer in the black/white head dept. which is great, even if they don't go away altogether. However this product will NOT put a dent in cystic acne, if you feel one of those coming on this product won't even slow it down.Overall, I really liked this product. It appears to have no added scents to pretty it up or cause possible allergic reactions. What you smell is evidently the actual ingredients and these might seem unfamiliar but they are not unpleasant. It cleans & exfoliates w/o drying your skin, and is even reasonably priced compared to most face cleansing systems.
Many times facial deep cleansers have the same ingredients as acne treatments, and this is the case with this.  While not suffering from acne, this treatment excels as a deep cleanser for the face.  It seems to make the skin smoother and softer.As far as acne goes - I don't think there will ever be a single solution for everyone.  The likely cause of acne is infection of the sebaceous glands and effects, most often, adolescents as their hormones may be imbalanced more frequently.  Any type of medication may help deep cleanse the pores (and kill bacteria), but as long as the glands are conductive for the growth of bacteria (imbalance), the acne will return.At any rate, this truly is a "full treatment," as the box has a cleanser, a toner, and a lotion.  This is not just an organic version of some Oxy or Stridex pad.I did have to take one star away because, while none of the description or text on the box says so, there was a sticker put on the box that says something along the lines of "Clinically proven to have less acne is 6 weeks."  Six weeks?  That seems like a tremendous amount of time to not include in any sales literature.As for the product itself - would definitely recommend.
We've only been using this for the last two weeks and it works well. The weather is a cooler this time of year and the "system" is not drying out my skin. I'll be interested to see how it works during the summer.
Our 11-year old daughter has been trying the product for about 2 weeks. It seems to be helping some, but the product says it takes six weeks to really work. We may see in the future that it's wonderful, but alas, we can't wait that long to write our review. So, for now, it isn't great, but it's not bad.
This is good it's all natural. It's nice to have all natural ingrediants for better, clearer skin. The system is easy to use and it doesn't sting like some products that have too much drying alcohol it it. The skin is not tight or dry. The really rough part of the month hasn't hit yet, so it hasn't been put to the real test yet-anxious to see how it fares on that stretch of the road. But so far I'd recommed it.
I was skeptical to try the Nature's Gate Organic Acne Regimen at first.  I have very sensitive skin that turns red/gets acne at anything and typically use Cetaphil.  I tried all 3 products for the first few days but the toner was extremely harsh, making my skin turn a bright shade of red, so I continued to use only the cleanser and lotion for the next 3 weeks. I can definitely see improvement in my skin!  I have less acne and a few old red marks cleared up. I think the lotion is one of the mildest I have used and makes my skin very soft.  The only other negative I would have is the smell, it's not very pleasant but if this means no fragrances were added then I am pleased (I did not verify this).I hope you have the same luck if you try this!
I have always wanted to try one of these systems. I thought: Hey, it's only a few minutes a day, and my skin will be clear.Well, that was right and wrong.I wash my face daily. I have a routine I follow. The 'simple' three steps aren't that bad, but they mess up the other things I do for my skin. This is a great product for folks with no other issues with their skin.It was not over-drying. It worked to clarify my skin.My blemishes on my neck even cleared up. But to do this daily, I'm not sure I would ever manange it.Overall, a good product.
It's been a few weeks now with the Nature's Gate Organics acne treatment system.  The three step process is pretty quick and straightforward to follow every day and it has kept any unwanted blemishes away.  I did limit use to once a day (at bedtime) because it was drying the skin (mostly around my nose) a lot.  I haven't really tried any other "systems" to compare this against, but it is certainly a few steps up from just a facial scrub.  You really feel clean and like it's doing something to clear your skin.  And a nice-to-have topper is - it actually smells kind of good!
I ordered this for my 13 and 12 year old daughters to try.  They have very mild acne, the 13 year old having some more sever fare ups.  They both loved this product.  It was a little drying on my red head's more sensitive skin, but generally the product worked well and smelled good, as well.  I would not recommend using it more than once a day--too drying.
Natural Results Acne Treatment System is a 3 step treatment system.  The Corrective Cleanser had a fresh scent, produced a good lather that felt fine on the skin, and was moisturizing instead of drying (drying tends to be a problem with a lot of other acne treatments.)  The Calming Toner also had a fresh scent and made my skin feel refreshed and cleansed but not oily.  Lastly, I really liked the Controlling Lotion.  This lotion had a different scent--almost like cinnamon--that I like. My only regret is that the Controlling Lotion does not contain an SPF.My skin appears to be reacting favorably toward these products so far.
This product works. I can see a visible difference in 2 weeks. It does decrease oiliness and yet doesn't dry the skin too much. It has salicylate in it which is the most effective agent for acne. Recommended.
I have very sensitive skin, and when I use a product my skin doesn't like, it gets a pimply-like rash.  Until I tried Nature's Gate Organics, even the acne treatments for sensitive skin caused allergic reactions.  Nature's Gate is the one product that actually makes my skin look better after using it.  It doesn't dry out my skin, doesn't make it itchy or red, and it doesn't give me a rash.  I found a winner with this one!
Since we're trying to get pregnant, my wife switched off Retin-A, internal antibiotics, and other prescription stuff that can be harmful to babies.  In that vein, she had already made the decision to try a natural product when we got the opportunity to try this out.There are a lot of good things about this product.  The smell is pleasant and mild, and the product spreads over the skin quite easily.  It doesn't feel harsh, nor does it leave your face feeling overdried.  One of the really great things about this product is that it does not contain benzoyl peroxide: she happens to be allergic!In terms of how effective it is, we're still only about 10 days into it, but it looks to work decently well.  One thing to note (and this is true about any change in skin care) is that the transition was very hard.  Switching to a new skin regimen is tough on the skin to begin with, and because those previous medications were very harsh, it amplified the effect.  Plus, quite frankly, her acne was somewhat severe.During the first week, in addition to a few big painful cystic acne blemishes that came to the surface, she developed these little tiny bumpy zits on the side of her face.  These were especially distressing to her.A week into it, the tiny zits have, for the most part, gone away.  The cystic acne blemishes have retreated, for the most part.  She's quite pleased with the product, and would probably buy it again!
The product itself is really good. It works well on the skin, doesn't smell, and is boosted by its Oligopeptide booster to Salicylic acid. But if you are pregnant you should consider that S.Acid is an Aspirin derivative that you use topically. Aspirin is typically not OK to use if you are pregnant. There have been no studies to show if this is an issue topically. Most likely it isn't."Salicylic acid is used to treat acne, warts and other dermatological problems. There are no studies specifically looking at topical salicylic acid in pregnancy. Oral salicylic acid (aspirin) has not been associated with an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but use in late in pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding (Rumack et al., 1981). The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents, and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential."This came from fetal-exposure'dot'org / acne'dot'htmlI personally don't think it will be an issue - but you have to balance out your own desire to handle acne (the mental stress) with the physical stress that you may be placing on a child.Again - product is great, does what it needs to and does it with proven medicine. But be informed about S.Acid and pregnancy.
This is a three-part system like the ones popular in TV commercials, but it's milder and made of organic ingredients. If you try to use only organic products, it's a workable alternative. It's mild on the skin, and somewhat effective. It can't compare to the other, less "natural," kits on the market, though, and it's approximately the same price. I have skin that's moderately sensitive, oily and prone to breakouts. It seemed to help healing somewhat, and my face certainly felt clean, but it didn't have the stronger healing action or drying action that one of the major brands gives me. The best part of it was that it never caused any excess dryness, and it would be great for someone with very sensitive skin.
This worked great on my daughter's back. There was a noticable change quickly. It was gentle and effective.  I would buy this product for acne.
Never one to have a lot of acne, the times of the month I tend to become more prone to blemishes changes with the moon and so I never really know when I am going to be clear faced or hiding my face.  So, to be honest, Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System with Oligopeptide-10 is a complete surprise to me.Looking at the package and ingredients, the treatment comes with a corrective cleanser, calming toner, and controlling lotion.  Each separate step of the cleaning process is easy to do.  The acne treatment corrective cleanser contains Salicylic Acid and tea tree oil that exfoliates and opens pores.  Step 2, the toner, gets rid of pore impurities, ie the 'bad' stuff, and soothes any skin irritation.  The third step is used to prohibit further acne growth.A disbeliever of most acne products, Nature's Gate has made me a believer.  Not only is my skin clearer, but those unsightly blackheads that plague my cheeks and nose are less noticable.  I experienced no skin irritation and felt like the treatment works.  I am anxious to continue using this product just to see long term results.For the price, I would definately invest in this treatment.  I was just that astounded at the results.***Natalie S. for Amazon Vine***
My teenaged daughter has been using this for several weeks and it really seems to be clearing up her acne.  We had been considering something harsher like accutane -- which is what I used when I was fourteen and pimply, but that was extremely embarrassing for a a few months since it made me break out even worse before it got better.  As long as this seems to work, she and I are happy to stick with it.What's more, she enjoys the smell and the feel of Nature's Gate on her face when she is done applying it -- what I think she is detecting is the tea tree oil, which has a very distinctive minty smell and tingle.  I was pleased to notice that the product is paraben free, as my other daughter is allergic to parabens.  This product uses organic and natural but apparently effective ingredients, and I would definitely buy it again -- I know my daughter plans to keep using it.  There are three different applications, and the instructions are very clear about how to use them.
First, let me state that the term "organics" needs to be taken with a grain of salt here.  This is not an all-natural organic product.  I as a little disappointed to find that out.  That being said, I have found it to be surprisingly effective, and not as harsh as some other products.For a while I successfully used ProActive to treat my adult acne.  ProActive worked very well for me until I became sensitive to it.  I don't know if they changed their formula or if I just developed an allergy to one of the ingredients.  After that, even years later, I couldn't use the product without getting a painful rash.I was very concerned that I would have a similar reaction to this product, especially after I read the ingredients.  Much to my surprise, I have not had any such reaction.  After using the cleanser my skin feels soft and smooth.  The results aren't as dramatic as the ProActive was before I became sensitive to it, but they are still pretty good.  My acne is very challenging and this has definitely improved it a lot.  With continued use I think this should take care of it altogether.It is also an excellent value.  This kit is at least a full month's treatment, for about half the cost of ProActive or Murad.  I actually think there is enough here for six weeks of regular use, if you are conservative.I would recommend anyone with sensitive skin who has had problems with the harsher treatments to give this a try.
Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System really does work if you have mild to moderate acne but there is a caveat - it will dry out your skin if you are prone to such and it does require more effort then I am accustomed to for a daily type treatment.  This kit includes 3 different products that is recommended for twice a day application.  The first product is a basic facewash, lather up and scrub down.  The second step is to grab a cotton ball and squeeze out a dab of a facial toner that you then apply.  If you are prone to dry skin this second step may not be ideal but all's fair in love and war right?  The third product is more of a cream based application that seems mild and relatively pleasant enough.  The whole process will take approximately 5 minutes to go through.  If you feel up to this task, 2x a day then by all means I highly recommend it - the price is reasonable and it is effective.
This system is comparable to other 3-part products on the market, but at a much lower price point. I just began using and will update with results in a week or two. Thanks.
Our family has used the Cotz sunblock a few times in the past week.  It does a good job on ears, nose, neck and arms.  The product itself is a tan color when it comes out of the tube, and it's supposed to disappear as it's rubbed onto the skin.  That mainly was the case, but it left our hands a bit messy and didn't "disappear" there.  It also left some chalky residue on things I touched after applying it.  We didn't get any sunburn where we applied it, and we spent a lot of time outside last weekend.  That aside, this product blocks the sun physically, not chemically, so this is a good product generally for people who might have allergies or other problems with the run-of-the-mill chemical sunblocks.
When I first went to use this product and saw the vaguely skin-covered tint, I thought, "Oh no ..." Shades of that awful "acne treatment" I used to use in sixth grade that was the approximate color of a Band-Aid!But after I rubbed in the sunscreen, the tint disappeared completely, even on my whiter-than-white skin. It did leave my face looking a tiny bit greasy -- though I have oily skin, so most sunscreens do -- but nothing a little powder didn't take care of.There seems to be only a very mild scent -- I don't know that I could identify it, but I guess it seems sort of minerally to me. (Is that a word?) Definitely not offensive, and I appreciate not having to smell like a coconut every time I wear sunscreen.As others have mentioned, the protection seems very good. I haven't had a chance to test out its water resistant properties yet, but will definitely bring this along next time I'm at the lake or pool and report back!One minor complaint: I wouldn't wear this with light or white clothing. The tint does seem to rub off on them.
I was satisfied with the job this product did with regard to protection.  While fragrance is not added, it is not without a scent/odor, though it was a light odor.  I think the product is rather expensive given that there is no way to assess how well it works against UVA rays.  My skin is not extremely sensitive so I can only say that I did not have any reactions--probably because fragrance was not added.  For those with extreme sensitivities it is probably worth the cost.  It did leave some dicoloration on my white shirt which I was not pleased about but it did come out after laundering.  I would not want to use this other than for the beach or swimming as I don't care to wear stained clothing.
I burn pretty easy and I also have many tattoos that I don't want fading, so a good sunblock is important to me.  This block work very well and is not greasy, it is almost like calamine lotion or something that you would put on a bug bite.  It is not clear when it goes on, I noticed especially over the darker areas of my tattoos where it made them look old and faded which is what I'm trying to avoid so I thought that was somewhat ironic.  I like that it has very few ingredients, less to cause irritation or who knows what else.  It also seems to stay on pretty well although I have not actually tried going in the water yet with it, so I'm not sure about that one yet.  But if you are looking for a simple, high SPF sun block and don't mind it looking a little white when it is on, this is a good choice.
I was very excited to receive this product. My son is extremely sensitive to most sunscreens. I've tried almost everything on the market. Everything claiming extra gentle, for faces, for tender places, oil free, and all the various claims but with everyone but one other product that I've tried, my son's face has ended up with red welts all over.This product did not irritate his skin in any way. I put it on my 2 year old and my 15 month old. No irritation. They were swimming and it stayed on. Note: the product claims "water resistant" not water proof. The directions state to reapply every 2-3 hours of swimming.I also wanted to mention that the cover states "Contains Only Titanium and Zinc" and that isn't completely true. Those are the active ingredients, there is a whole long list of inactive ingredients, if that matters to anyone.My only complaint is that it is tinted beige. It states that it dries clear but did not. I didn't mind the beige tint on my boys because I could see the places that I had missed and reapplied but they ended up with beige all over their clothes too. I didn't think most people in day to day wear would want the beige tint on their clothes or skin.
This sunscreen works very well.  I am very photo sensitive, and it kept me from burning while I was in the direct sun for several hours.  The lotion is not fragrance-free as it claims, but the smell is not offensive.It covers well, stays on even if you go in the water, and keeps you from getting fried.  It's a little pricey, but it definitely feels like a more high-end product.  I would recommend it to those who are willing to pay a premium for a top notch product.
My name is Jarucia and I'm a sunscreen-aholic.Admittedly I'm not as pale as the fresh driven snow, but my skin is still as light as a white flesh nectarine.More than 10 minutes in the sun and I feel as if I'm roasting.  All that sunscreens do for me is ensure that I don't burn.As a purveyor of all things SPF over 25 AND organic, I can't say I'd turn my nose up to Cotz.  It rubs on smooth (though don't be too liberal), I like the tint (which stayed put on me), and left my skin feel comfortably cool the direct sunlight (which is always an added treat).  I left some skin uncoated next to the Cotz coated skin and it was roasting.I live in the PNW so the weather isn't muggy enough to interfere with absorption and drying, but in all fairness few if any sunscreens I've used in muggy climates ever get past being sticky.As an alternative to many mainstream commercial brands, I liked the ingredient list for Cotz but wasn't crazy about it.  This point is simply a personal choice for the skin guardian in each of us.Also, as with most general sunscreens, I did not and would not apply this to my face.  Face specific lotions should be used for that.Overall, I liked this product and feel it delivers as promises.  It is a tad on the pricey side, but with the way it spreads a little does go a long way.
I cannot use chemical sunscreens and therefore must use a high SPF sunblock and most of those are very drying. Fallene's SPF 58 is the perfect mixture of sunblock and moisture for my skin. I liked the ingredient list for Cotz but wasn't crazy about it. This point is simply a personal choice for the skin guardian in each of us.Also, as with most general sunscreens, I did not and would not apply this to my face. Face specific lotions should be used for that. I love the slight tint, so you don't look like a ghost. Might not be okay for darker complexions, though. I'm caramel. It is lightweight too, my only wish is that they would leave out the parabens.Overall, I liked this product and feel it delivers as promises. Melts in high humidity, but excellent in drier climate. I agree with others that say it's a tad on the pricey side, but with the way it spreads a little does go a long way.
I like that this sunscreen is rated one of the least toxic by the Cosmetic Safety Database.  Zinc oxide and titanium oxide are considered the safest, most effective materials available for sun protection and this combination of the two, by Fallene Cotz, has the advantage of feeling less slimy than most sunscreens containing these two minerals.I was somewhat dismayed by the fact that the product has a tint to it and my skin is quite fair, but it wasn't noticeable even on my face.  The box says that it "dries clear," but that is only partially true.  While I couldn't see any visible change in my skin color with it on, the tint did come off onto a white napkin when I wiped my mouth.  But the product did a good job protecting my face and neck from tanning and burning for an hour in the summer sun, and even after a full day of wearing it, my skin never felt greasy.I would definitely order this product again, although I wouldn't use it on my body if I were wearing light colored clothing.
This is not as greasy as other mineral based sunscreens, yet it spread evenly. It didn't irritate my sensitive face either, but it looked very metallic on my medium fair face--not so much so on my body. It did collect in my elbow creases a bit after very heavy sweat (the air is practically liquid with humidity down here right now). It didn't sting my eyes,either. It doesn't smell, also a plus, but it did leave some dust marks on my dark brown shorts. It is the best high SPF sunscreen I've tried so far, and that's saying something.It does have parabens--wish they'd get rid of them.
I am fair-skinned and burn instantly. I was skeptical about trying an "all natural" sunscreen because I have come to depend on the routine chemicals that protect me from burning so I did a test. I put Cotz SPF 58 on one arm and Neutrogena 55 on the other. After several hours in the sun neither arm was burned. Bottom line: it worked.The Cotz has no scent. That is a huge plus for me. But like every other cream sunscreen out there, it has a greasy feel no matter what they claim. I'm not sure I would want it on my face on a daily basis. It is also a lot  more expensive than regular sunscreen, BUT doesn't have the chemicals that are harmful to the environments/coral reefs, so it's a trade-off.I give it four stars because it worked, it doesn't smell like anything, and because it protects the environment. It lost a star for cost and greasy feel.
Given that I have extremely fair skin (my standard joke is that my melanin count is measured in negative integers), I rarely head outdoors without at least an SPF 15 on board (this is pretty safe because I'm indoors most of the time anyway). So even though I'm pretty happy with my current protection, given that my skin is quite sensitive, I was glad to have the opportunity to give this a try. It turned out to have its pluses and minuses.My primary concern is protection for my face and it turns out that this really isn't appropriate. On the plus side, it didn't irritate my skin at all--a minor miracle, especially during the sweaty dog-days of July (this could be due to its being PABA-free). But not only is it too heavy to function as a moisturizer that can be worn under my light base, it's occlusive as well (translation: guaranteed clogged pores). So I'm afraid this will never find its way onto my face again.On the plus side, I liked it fine for the rest of the exposed me. It worked well on my hands, chest, and neck and even though I still found it somewhat sticky, I guess this is to be expected with heavy-duty sunscreens. To be honest, I don't spend enough time in the sun to know if this would protect me from burning over a long period of time, but it's fine at least for the short term (did I mention how easily I burn?). All in all, it seems to be an effective product; however, the lab that develops a lightweight, high-SPF sunscreen that's non-occlusive, appropriate for sensitive skin, and can double as a facial moisturizer is going to attract a VERY sizable customer base.
I ordered this because it is advertised for sensitive skin -- and my daughter gets rashes with most sunscreens.  There are only a couple of brands I've found that work for her; unfortunately, this is not one of them.  It is oil, fragrance and PABA free -- but is not paraben free.Having said that, it worked great on the rest of us -- my children and I were at the beach in the hot Florida sun in July for about 5 hours and none of us got anything close to a sunburn.  It is smooth, skin-toned, and goes on easily -- doesn't smell, and seems to work just fine.  Of course, most sunscreens work well for us, so that is not a big surprise.  It did seem to be a bit more effective than some brands we've tried.  I can't say for sure whether it works for those with sensitive skin but no paraben allergies -- but can say we probably will stick with less expensive brands for the rest of us, and with paraben-free brands (like Burt's Bees) for my daughter.
We're on Maui and I tried this product.  It comes on slightly tinted and thick, but if what you want is protection from those rays, this is it.  On a day we were out a few hours in the hot sun, I didn't get burnt, or even tan.  The next day,  I decided to forgo the lotion, and came back with a slightly burned neck.It's a good product.  some may find it a bit too thick if they are used to brands such as coppertone.
Update:  March 1, 2010Five stars.Having tried too many sunscreens that burned my eyes, either by way of an inadvertent splash of lotion on the eyelid, or by way of sweat running down my face and into my eyes, I am re-evaluating my view of Cotz.  I have not been able to find another sunscreen that works as well, and that does not sting my eyes.I am switching back to the Cotz for my full-time sun protection, as I am so tired of the eye irritation that comes with the use of other sunscreens.  Cotz does not sting the eyes, and I am finding that fact to be of more importance that I realized when I wrote the original review.I have also discovered that I was applying it more heavily than is necessary, hence the chalky look.----I have to say that I was a bit dismayed when I first opened the tube and saw that the product looked like liquid makeup.  It is a pale beige-pink color right out of the tube.  However, the label cheerfully reassured me that the product "dries clear."  I was a bit doubtful about that claim, as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and iron oxide are all quite distinctly opaque substances, but whatever...  To paraphrase Bill Clinton, I guess it depends on what your definition of "clear" is."  Just the appearance alone was immediately making me think of negative things to say in a review.Sure enough, when applied, it does leave a very slightly chalky-looking film on the skin.  On light-skinned people, it's probably not going to be too obvious.  On people with darker skin, well, I think it will be pretty noticeable.  My skin is definitely on the light pink side.  When I applied it to my face and then looked in the mirror, my first reaction was to grab the blush and lipstick, because I sure looked washed out. (Might be good for convincing someone that you don't feel too well....)So, just in terms of appearance, it might be great for kids that are too young to care about looking good, and adults who are so adverse to getting burned, or to using a sunscreen with chemicals in it, that they also don't care that much about looking good either.  If you are trying to be a gorgeous gleaming beach god or goddess, look elsewhere for skin protection.I used the product when working in the yard for several hours on more than one sunny day.  It does work!  My skin burns very easily, and Cotz protected it quite well. I also liked the fact that it was not greasy, dried rapidly, did not sting my eyes, and did not feel slick or unpleasant at all. I gave it four stars because it protects quite well, and is PABA-free.  If it hadn't been for the slightly chalky look, I would have given it five stars.  I would not hesitate to recommend this to others.
Well, it's fragrance free and isn't greasy for one. I used this while working a commercial shoot out in the sun all day and by the end of the shoot I didn't feel like I was coated in baby oil, which is a plus. It does the job it's meant to and I have no problems recommending this to anyone looking for a new brand of sunscreen.
My first experience with this product was at the beach.  I first applied it to my skin before leaving the house.  This would ensure that it would work into my skin before going into the water.  As I squeezed the tube, I noticed that there was a tint of color in the lotion.  A "flesh" tone.  Problem with this is that if you get it on your clothes, you'll see the streaks.  I was wearing a white T-shirt so I had tan color streaks on my shirt.  This product says it dries clear.  However, as you rub it into your skin, it's almost a white, ashy color instead of the flesh tone from the tube.  But eventually it goes away and does dry clear.  I've used many different sun protection lotion at the beach.  I still come back a bit burned.  However, this product didn't seem to have that problem.  The best way to tell if you are burned is when you enter the shower.  That's where you'll feel whether you are burned or not.  When I got home and showered, I didn't feel that hot burning feeling.I recommend this product as a great alternative to the leading brands of sun protection.
I've noticed that with this product, the strips tend to take a while to harden compared to other brands, which is a really good thing in my opinion. The other brands' strips would act like those Screen Protectors for your phones, where you would get air vacuum on some spots. But, not with this one.
For some reason, I thought the Ultra pore strips were just a slightly larger version of the originals. I know as soon as I opened them this was not the case. While they are VERY SLIGHTLY bigger, they also have a totally different smell. Personally, I couldn't really tell a difference between the normal strips and these.
I didn't feel any invigorating effect which is advertised and expected with ingredients like tea tree oil and witch hazel but the strips worked really well.I've used Biore's regular nose pore strips for years and the Ultra did seem to unclog a little more. The box says the Ultra strips target more pores than the original strips because they are longer. They were just a tad longer, just enough to wrap a little more around the bottom edge of your nose so if the regular ones are a little short for you then you may want to try the Ultra ones.You stick the strip to your wet nose, it dries for about 10 - 15 minutes then you slowly pull the strip back off and there is gunk all over the strip from your nose; it's quite gross and yet amusing in a weird way.They really work and if you've never tried them, you should.
When I get pore cleansing strips, I always get Biore Ultra Deep. The Ultra Deep do a better job than the regular, though they are a bit harsher. They are easy to use: Get them wet, put them carefully on your nose -- make sure you press down into the seam between your nose and cheek -- then wait until they dry. When you pull them off, do so somewhat slowly. You can see all the blackheads and clogged pores you pulled out, they will be stuck to the strip.My nose has always had enlarged, often clogged pores, and all over the nose. Pretty much every pore is a problem. These strips have been tremendous in helping me control that. My only quibble is that they are not always effective. Sometimes I will see entire spots on the strip which pulled out nothing, yet you can see on my nose that the strip should have grabbed onto something and removed it. But sometimes I use a strip and it gets literally everything. Every so often, some of the sticky side of the strip is left behind on my skin, so I have to get some astringent to wipe it off because it's quite difficult to remove.I also don't recommend using these more than once a week, because they can be harsh. Overall, I will keep using these, but do wish they were just a little more consistent.
I love using these strips! They are a lot of fun to use and they really do leave my skin feeling clean and fresh. I love the new cut lines in the nose strip to help with contouring and find that this strip fits much better than the older original strip. Using these once a week my nose looks clean, fresh and spot free. I think they are worth every penny!
I decided to compare three different pore strips, Biore Original, Biore Ultra and Kose, a Japanese brand that I can't remember whether I got on ebay or at Daiso. I chose to use the Kose strip first because I really wanted to compare the two versions of Biore, and I figured it would be a more fair comparison if I used the Kose first and ripped out the tiny little hairs on my nose as well as making an original pass at my clogged pores. The Kose strips don't work quite as well as Biore, but pretty close and they are less expensive. Plus, they are BLACK so if you want to be like that woman in the commercial who is examining her pore strip and going "oh gross, it looks like a porcupine!" (and isn't that half the point of using pore strips?) the black makes it very easy to see all the gross stuff you get out of your nose. Fun, fun!Anyway, after the Kose strips I waited about five days and then tried the Biore "Original". I like to use pore strips right out of a long, steamy shower. I then remove the sides of the pore strip pouch, loosen the slits on the actual strip and set it aside while I take a cotton ball and thoroughly wet it with warm water. I squeeze most of the water out of the cotton ball and then wet my nose and the area on either side. After peeling the strip from its backing and forming the strip around my nose, I wring even more water out of the cotton ball and then use it on top to complete the formation of the strip around my nose. I find it is then important to not doing anything to move my face. No talking or chewing. Only very careful sipping of liquids. A little fanning with a piece of paper or a paper fan is helpful to get the strip to dry faster but not too fast.After peeling the "original" strip from my face, I found a fair amount of pore gunk, and also plenty of tiny fine hairs. I was a bit surprised to see so many just five days after the Kose strip. Finally, about five days after that, I used the "ULTRA" strip. It vexes me that there are two types of Biore strips and at the store it is necessary to choose - do I want a few more strips for the price or do I want the promise of an even stronger unclogging of clogged pores? What I found was that the ULTRA seemed to work slightly better, seemingly by having a stronger adhesive. It was a bit more painful to rip from the nose and arguably had a bit more pore gunk (and still more tiny, fine hairs. Where do they all come from?) The ULTRA basically costs 33% more and is maybe 33% more effective - but if you use the entire package then I guess they come out about the same in the end. The ULTRA strips made my nose feel a bit sore and raw after using. In the end I think I'd choose Original over ULTRA because I feel it's less damaging to the skin, but if I had younger (maybe teenage) skin I might be more likely to go for the ULTRA.
"Blackheads" are small black dots that form when dead skin cells and other crud covers open pores.  The long term treatment for them is exfoliating scrubs, acne washes, or other face washes designed to clean pores, or to see a dermatologist.  In the short term, one good solution is deep cleaning pore strips like these.  You stick them on, ideally after a shower, let the glue set, then pull them off, removing the blackheads in the process.These are quite a bit more expensive than Biore's regular strips.  I didn't notice a difference, but apparently, what you get for your extra money is more glue.  No complaints, but I'd recommend trying the less expensive first, then upgrading if you think it's necessary.
I've been amazed at the little spikes on a Biore strip when you pull it off your nose since they were introduced.  What is that stuff anyway?  Blackheads and sweat and lotions and gunk?  All that was in my pores!??  These Ultra Deep Cleansing strips take things to another level.  And it feels like, in order to do that, they had to add more of whatever it is that hardens (cement?! :) ) to the strip.  These things harden TIGHT and you need to remove them slowly to avoid losing a layer of skin.  But what is on that strip will fascinate (or perhaps nauseate?) you!  I don't feel like these strips are an overall solution and I'm not sure they're even necessary, but they do serve as a sort of "cleanse".  If you've let your facial routine lag, get a good start to clear the pores with one of these, then get back on the daily routine.
I am a huge fan of Biore products and use several of them.A couple things surprised me about this one.First, I found it somewhat painful when taking the strip off my nose. I'm not the biggest baby out there, but I did feel some genuine discomfort when I removed the strip.Second, after removing the strip I saw virtually nothing on the strip. I do use facial scrubs and other cleansers, so my skin might not be too dirty to begin with. Still, I do have to say that the area where the strip was removed did feel smoother.Ultimately, I don't feel a real need for this product.
I like how effective they are at getting the minute black-heads off your nose. Not to be gross, but I still remember the first time I used them - the strip looked like it had a forest of little spiky black specks. All of my black-heads were gone.Though there are other brands out there now, I still gravitate back to the Bior&eacute; strips.
When I use my 66-year-old eyes to look at myself in a regular mirror, I'm not too horrified, but, holy heck, that 8X mirror is enough to give me a heart attack.  Wrinkles aside, I thought I was too old for blackheads, but there they were in what I now realize is a really ugly nose.The blackheads are small and I thought I'd try these strips to clean out the pores.  If nothing else, maybe the strips could pull the whole ugly nose off.  Well, I'm pretty sure these would be effective for most people.  As they dry, they tighten nicely and feel refreshing and when pulling them off you really should expect some results from all that ouchiness.Unfortunately for me, I've been using microdermabrasion scrubs too regularly for some years and I think that has cleaned my pores well on the surface.  These imperfections I was trying to remove with the strips are too deep to be picked up.  I'm still giving the product 4 stars.  Although not successful for me at this stage in my life, I suspect I would have loved to use them when I was 16.
I have used theBiore Deep Cleansing Pore Stripsand these strips, and honestly except for the mintiness I can't tell the difference.  Both worked well, removing nastiness from my nose, and both were easy to use.Given that they are essentially the same -- ie., I couldn't tell that one removed blackheads more effectively than the other -- I would purchase the one with the best price per unit.  There are 6 in this box (the Ultra Deep cleaning) and 8 in the regular old Deep Cleansing.  Do the math and shop accordingly.
I do have a few straighteners so I jumped at the chance to try a new one.This one is a little different.  My hair felt healthy after I used it.  It has a nice feel to it, not too heavy, not cumbersome.  It really does a good job straightening.However, the one drawback is the my finger was constantly hitting the setting buttons and changing the temps.  I even tried to switch it around and my palm hit the buttons.If they would move the controls to inside the handles, this would be perfect.
This is a fine flat iron.  The plates have some kind of special fabric covering to minimize damage.  It seems less smooth than other plates, but it glides over my hair just fine.  This iron is lighter weight than other I've tried.  I like the variable temperature, that it heats up quickly, and seems to have even heat.  I don't like the button placement.  It's very easy to accidentally press buttons when in use.  There is a feature to "lock" the buttons, but it seems like it should've been better designed in the first place.  All in all, a nice little flat iron at a great price.
Great for straightening hair. Perfect size for short or long hair. I think it's great for everyday use. Recommend this if you are looking for a good hair straightener.
I like the high temp of this iron. It does a great job, my only complaint is that the buttons to turn it on/off, and to change the temp are right where I put my hands to hold the iron closed. It's minor, and I would still buy it, because it seems like every flat iron or curling iron put their on/off buttons in the same place.
I have been using straightening irons for several years, so I have had the opportunity to try many! I have been using this one for several weeks now and am very satisfied with the results.Here are the features I like:It's lightweight.Has a comfortable grip.There is a digital temperature gauge, with a choice of 3 settings.Has an auto-off feature.Does a great job straightening hair.There isn't any burning smell or other odors (a lot of others give off an unpleasant odor).It heats up quickly, and has a low sound-alert feature to notify you when it reaches temperature.There are a few features that I feel could have been improved:Almost the entire iron gets extremely hot to the touch. This makes it hard to grip for long periods, unless you hold it at the very bottom, which does not give you a good grip for straightening.The buttons are easily pressed when gripping the iron - I have changed the temperature and turned it off numerous times.However, just to be fair, I have had this problem with every single iron I have purchased.Overall, I am happy with this straightening iron, and like it much better than the last few I have purchased.
Over the years I have tried different hair styling irons and I would say that this one works pretty well. Some of the positive features are temeperature control, you can set the temperature from 300F for thin fine hair to a maximum of 430F for thick curly hair. It heats up pretty fast and it has a hinge lock so you can lock it when you're not using it, that's especially a good feature when you travel. The negative features are the iron is a little heavy and the the cord is a little stiff, but these last two features are comparable to other irons in this price range.I have another iron of better qualify in which I prefer to use, but in all fairness, my other iron is more expensive. I think this is a good product if you don't want to spend too much money.
I didn't think I would like this iron as much as I do. After my first use I wasn't impressed and wondered if this was a keeper. Then the second time I used it I realized how nicely it slides over my hair shaft and how lightweight it is. I use my straightening iron on occasion to curl my hair (see you tube for curling with a straightening iron) and this does an absolutely fabulous job. I've used it two days in a row to do this, and my hair looked really good and it was so easy to do since this is lightweight. I love the digital display (most straighteners have this). My only complaint is the lock, it's absolutely awful. I've had other Remington straighteners with this same lock, and to be honest, I wouldn't pay $$ for straightener without a good lock. If they could improve this one thing, this would be a top recommendation by me,
This flat iron heats up quickly and works really well according to my wife. She has a CHI and says this one works just as well. As for the Damaged hair repair claim, who knows.. but as a low price straightener, this works well.
This unit was easy to use and did what was advertised: straightened my hair. I liked that it had a fast heat up time and the digital temp gauge was a welcome change to the turn dial of my old straightener. Turn dials can be moved more easily when styling so the digital gauge with buttons worked out better for me. The cord swivel made it easy to use without the cord getting in the way. All in all, I would use this again to straighten my hair. It was lightweight enough to use without getting yoru arm tired halfway through. I would recommend using small sections of hair or you will have to go over the same spots again and again (leading to damage).
I liked this flat iron as I find that most do not stay hot enough after running it through my long hair repeatedly, most seem to cool off quite a bit. I also used this to try out curls on my hair and won't be using it again to do that, as the curls were to small for my taste. My hair is a little below my mid back and although I don't use a flat iron everyday, I have 4 of them. 2 being from the Vine and I really liked this one better as it stayed hot.
Just a pea size of this green perfecting lotion is all you need per day. It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel silky. So far, it seems to be reducing the redness I have with rosacea. I gave it 4 stars because the smell is medicinal-which I don't care for, but the results are worth the smell.
This green-blue colored lotion requires very, very little to spread on skin area.  It's amazingly efficient, as it spreads thinly and one doesn't need to use much at all.It's strength is it's weakness though, like many things.  It spreads so much because the skin can't absorb any of it.  And when I sweat, which is what I do a lot, it trickles down and reminds me it's there.  The trickles show the color again, at least on me.
This product works amazingly well covering red areas of the skin due to sun damage, etc. The redness just vanishes - the product is pale green and this cancels out the red somehow. Once it went into the skin, the green color was gone and did not rub off.Felt like a conventional, light moisturizer when rubbing it into the skin - it is supposed to moisturize.Haven't used it long enough to see any long term improvements though. I think it is supposed to lessen redness over time beyond the color cancellation.The one thing I didn't like was the smell. It has sun screen in it and has that odd smell that sunscreens often have. Fine for the beach, but this is meant for everyday use. Some people don't mind this smell, but I don't care for it very much.But, it does make the red spots vanish, so maybe the smell isn't so bad considering.
Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion is a great all-purpose SPF facial lotion.  I like the Eucerin brand and their products have always been good for my skin.  The only downside to this lotion is the green tint - don't overdo it or you'll have a green face.  If you only have a slight redness then it's helpful, but super red areas aren't going to be affected by this product.  Overall, it works fine and does what it says.
This product worked great towards the end of summer. My skin is very fair and before it would commonly be red and blotchy and although I use sunscreen my normal face products don't cover up the redness at all. This goes on thick, and is mild green color to cut down the redness. After a few min, when it has absorbed my face is noticeably less red and back to my normal pigment. Not sure if I would use year around, as the thickness cuts down on my morning makeup routine but it does work great, would probably use again in the summer!
No matter what high-end moisturizer I try, they always seem to work the same way for me no matter what the price, so I went into this one with my sceptical hat on. Thumbs up on the packaging, even the box had a white background so I could actually read the writing on it, and two thumbs up for the pump dispenser and a product that's thick enough it doesn't run all over my fingers before I can get it to my face.The greenish tint in the moisturizer is a bit off-putting at first, but you do need to use it sparingly or you'll get a greenish cast to your face. Take the time to rub it in thoroughly. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now, and do notice a difference with less redness all around. The product has an SPF OF 15 according to the manufacturer, but I haven't been out in the sun enough to see how well it protects. This is a lighter moisturizer, so if you're looking for something heavy to gloop on your face at night, this likely won't fit, but I do see there is a nighttime moisturizer available in this product line. I plan on picking it up and giving it a whirl.
I waited eagerly for a chance to use this product. Being fair skinned, I hoped that this might alleviate some problems when they aroused. I'm not a huge fan of sunscreen especially at this time of the year so I had an opportunity to put this to work.The lotion kind of works. It definitely covers up the problem a bit when you first apply it. I didn't notice much of a difference the next day though or the day after while I maintained use of this product.It's hard to say how effective this is. Part of me thinks it employs a "sweep under the rug approach." At any rate, it's not very expensive and is worth a try if you're looking for a product like this to solve your redness problems.
Right now I'm suffering with hives on my face resulting from a bug bite.  The welts are quite red, so I thought I would try this to suppress their appearance.  It does a nice job of toning it down, and like another reviewer commented, this would work well under your foundation.  I like the design of the glass bottle, and the dispenser spits out just the right amount.  The lotion is very mild and causes no irritation, which I was skeptical about.  Some complain about the green being visible, and I really can't say that was my experience.  This lotion also has a SPF 15.
A light, delicate lotion with a subtle, light scent that is barely noticeable.Good are reducing redness and easy to apply, with no greasy residue left on skin.Guys be warned, my son used this lotion and had to wash his goatee, as the lotion got into his beard and left a blue coating.We had a joke about blue beard but apart from that it did work for him too.For anyone with a flare up due to soap or a chronic redness I'd recommend this product.
Just a bit of background on my skin:  I'm middle-aged, fair skinned and have rosacea.  My rosacea is pretty mild most of the time but this spring I had to take prednisone for a few weeks for hives (another long and tedious story) and when I finished the course of prednisone I found out that steroids exacerbate rosacea, so every since April I've been slapping on the rosacea cream twice a day and trying to cover the redness.  Fortunately, the redness has faded a good deal, but I need some help to counteract the red.  I have always used Eucerin products, so was psyched to see that the good people at Eucerin had come up with a good product to use on my somewhat red face.  The cream is made to be used under makeup, not by itself -- it is really green.  You don't need to use a lot of it at a time -- I used about a dime size for my face and neck.  Then I apply a BB cream with a sunscreen (rosacea really doesn't do well with sun) and make up on the really ugly spots.  I've been happy with the cream, but it took a couple of applications to get the right amount, so not as to look green.  I would purchase this product -- the 1.7 ounce bottle looks like it will get me through at least the fall, so it is a good size and really does the job.
Yes this lotion is mint green.  It is mint green because green is opposite red on the color spectrum.  The key is to use the amount of green you need to counteract the redness,  and for very red skin you will probably need to apply a concealer over the lotion.  I tried it on several friends, and it works best on slightly darker skin tones .  For my friend with milky white skin with freckles it defiantly left a greenish tinge no matter how hard she rubbed it in.It is not oily at all and does not leave your face feeling sticky or greasy.  It also does not have a scent.  It provides SPF 15 protection.You need to use a very small amount, or you will get the Hulk look.
I have hair that does NOT like to hold a curl, and conventional curling methods (iron, regular hot rollers) don't work well for me -- or they work, but an hour later, my hair looks like I never did a thing to it!Well, the Remington rollers with the heated clips definitely give me a lasting curl! My hair after using them can only be dubbed "Texas-sized." I thought maybe it would settle down a bit in an hour or two, but no ... it remained HUGE! So definitely believe the instructions when they tell you to only leave them in for a couple of minutes!I found the rollers easy to use, once I got the hang of putting them in without burning my fingers. They were somewhat heavy, but they aren't meant to be left in for long. (Incidentally, I think it's great that this set has so many rollers! I have really thick hair, and most sets have nowhere near enough for my hair.)The only problem I had was one other reviewers have mentioned -- that the clip left a slight "crimp" at the top of my hair afterward. I did have to touch those parts up slightly with a curling iron. It wasn't a huge deal, but it did keep this from being a fie-star product.
Well, they aren't the most prettily packaged hot rollers I've ever owned but they do a great job. They take up a lot more counter space than the traditional vertically heated rollers do as each curler is heated on a horizontal bar. The case they come in is shaped like a small typewriter (remember those?) and takes up about the same amount of space. Since the case is taller on one end I think it would be hard to find a drawer large enough to shove it away in.They do their job as advertised though. My other rollers took at least 10 minutes to heat up, then had to be in my hair for about 20 minutes- and they didn't come with clips, I had to purchase those separately. These new curlers heat up in under two minutes- as long as you remember to flip the ON switch, very important- are easy to twist your hair into since the surface helps grab on to your locks. The heated clip isn't uncomfortably warm, and in just 5 minutes I had long wearing curls that bounced and stayed even on a rainy evening with my long, fine hair. I was impressed.One thing to remember: pay attention as you grab each curler! Because once those metal bars they warm up on are exposed you can easily burn yourself on them if you reach into the case blindly. Trust me. Oh, and as a side benefit there's a little cord keeper niche in the back of the case. Hope this helps you purchase the right rollers for you!
This heated curler set is simple and it works wonderfully. Even if you are a beginner, this product is quite fun and easy to use. Its a very nice-looking set too, by the way.Once you turn on the switch, the set heats up very quickly. The velvet on the surface of the curlers coax the hair around the roll nicely and the clips grab without pulling, even if you are clumsy like me. I find that my curls hold beautifully after only 10 minutes and my hair looks shinier, and they last.The case itself is large, with a translucent plastic hinged lid that has no latch. At first I thought the clips felt hot but its managable. It heats up in less than two minutes so I would recommend that you do not leave it unattended for a long time while pre-heating to be safe. I think its a very well-made and fun set, and I would highy recommend it.
The first thing I noticed when I took this set out of the box was how BIG the set is.  I own two other heated roller sets which use metal pins to hold the rollers in place.  Both those sets are about half the size of this set, so if you don't have a lot of storage space, I'd probably look at another set.  This takes up about 1/4 of the space in my under-sink cabinets in the bathroom.The set heats up quickly - faster than my other curler sets.  This was also my first set which had velvet-flocked rollers, which I very much preferred to the plain plastic type (tough to get the roll started sometimes) and the rubber type (which tends to snag my hair) that I have on my other two sets.  The material grabbed my hair and made it very easy to start a good roll without crunching up the ends.Having an on-off switch is also something that seems to be lacking on so many of my other curler sets, so that was a nice addition as well as having a nook in the back of the set to wrap up the cord so it's not bulky or in the way.What many may consider a downside to this set is the clamp-type clips that this set utilizes to hold the rollers into place.  The clamps have a metal interior which heats up and helps to create a nice curl, but they do not have teeth and do not hold the rollers exactly where you might want them. These clips also prevent you from being able to spray your hair while they sit in curls (something I like to do with my other sets for a light hold) since the clips cover your hair totally.  If not placed just right, the clips also leave a tell-tale crimp at the top of the curler placement which is a pain. There is NO way for you to hold a super tight roll with those clamps. You will not have Shirley Temple like locks after letting these rollers cool. Because I already own two sets which do very tight rolls, this was a pleasant alternative as it automatically gave very natural, soft waves instead of bouncy curls.Despite all these issues, I really liked this set.  I would definitely not make it my only hot curler set, but I would recommend it to someone who already has a hot curler set and might be looking for more natural-looking waves instead of tight bouncy curls.
These are essentially curlers, but instead of just normal plastic clips, they have wide clips with metal that also heats up.  Allowing in theory a faster curl, and potentially a better curl.In practice it somewhat holds up.  The biggest downside being that they seem to get hotter than normal curlers.  Handling the rollers/clips can be difficult since they are extremely hot.  Others have mentioned the clips crimping the hair, which I can confirm it also slightly does.Essentially this is a new innovation in the 'curler market' (if there is such a thing).  Slightly better than a gimmick, but still room for improvement and refinement.
These aren't the easiest to use, but once you get a hang of it they work very well.  They get hot fast and do make great curls.  Now I need to find a way to keep the curl in my thin hair.
I was concerned because some reviewers remarked about the impression left in their hair by these Remington H-2050 Heated Clip Hair Setter rollers.  That was not the case for me.  Removing the case from the box, I was surprised at the size of the case, but then, there was little space wasted on any outer edge since the rollers are housed on metal rods, abutting one another and packed very tightly.  Two sizes are included and neither is huge.  I think it's a rather average sized roller, not like the juice cans which were used in the '60's.  The cord is well hidden in the rear of the case, there is an easy to identify On/Off switch, and the dusty pink of the clips and roller ends is lovely.  It's a solid package that looks good.Directions state that these heat in 90 seconds and they do.  It says your hair can be curled in 5 minutes and it can.  I had no problem with ridges, but am really careful in placement.  I also figured that the metal interior of the rollers would be hot, so I DID NOT TOUCH the metal parts.All in all, I think this is a really nice set and expect it will not need servicing before the 4 year warranty expires.  I'd recommend it too those who have a head of hair longer than a few inches.
When I recieved this item, I was a little nervous about using it. But, as part of my obligation for getting it is reviewing it, I had to give it a try. When I tried to find the cord for it, I was a little confused because it was nowhere to be found. After investigating further, I found it in the back, tucked neatly away. I found this to be a great plus!Tucking this item in an unused drawer or sitting it in a permanent place on your counter is easy since you don't have to worry about the cord dropping into the sink or becoming tangled with anything else.Using this item is a little tricky. After plugging it in, I found another great detail. As I was waiting for them to heat up, I figured it would take the same amount of time as my curling item because this was basically a set of curling irons in a box. Now, on average, my curling iron take anywhere from 2 to 4 minutes to heat up but ninety seconds after plugging these in, they were ready to go. This is great for those days when you are crunched for time.While the clips get hot instead of the curlers themself (like older versions), the outside of the clip only heats up slightly. I didn't burn myself once while using this.The best part? The rods come in three different sizes so you can get differentiating sizes that look natural and stay all day (a little hairspray or gel required).All in all, I love this item!
This is a fantastic set of hot rollers if you are looking for long, loose curls that are quick and easy to set.The soft velvet flocking on the rollers made it so easy to curl my hair around the rollers tightly. The rollers themselves heated up very quickly. Although they only take 90 seconds to heat up, I found I had a better curl when heating them up for five minutes before rolling. The clips helped to keep the heat in while securely holding the rollers.I prefer a tighter curl so I hope that Remington comes out with a smaller set of these since I prefer these to any other set of rollers I've ever used.
I love this!  Works great and is so easy to use.The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST!  My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up.  I just can't wait that long in the AM so I haven't used it for a long time.  This heats up in less than 2 minutes.There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them.  My hair doesn't snag on these rollers at all.  The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.And this thing is going to last for a long time as it's very well made and high quality.But, there's no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter.  It takes up a bit more space than I have free.  So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug.  No more dangling cords!I'm really happy with this.
The good, the bad, the beautiful: Let me start by saying I keep trying to use hot rollers, never with much success unless I use them on someone other than myself. These were no different. They are a bit cumbersome due to the way they use a clip. It takes a bit of dexterity to open and clip them while juggling a hank of unruly hair, unlike slide-on types. And I agree that one should be careful reaching for one lest you burn yourself on an unoccupied slot. I also could not get the clips just right, I was unable to clip it tight to the scalp. Now keep in mind that all the above could be the USER and not the PRODUCT.On the good side, my hair seemed silkier and way less 'fried' using these. The unit is all pro, and quite large, which means it will delight any woman who is a salon-owner-wanna-be. If you use them every day, make sure you have the counter space. These aren't the little pack and go types. If you take your hair seriously, and already do well with rollers, these are GREAT. If you are a bit of a hair-challenged dork like me, stick with a cheap set.
PROS:*My hair looks great when I use this! I have a thick head of fine hair  and it is difficult for me to get a good curl that will last without a ton of hairspray.*It does work as fast as they say it does. It only takes me a few minutes to put the curlers in and then five minutes on my head and I'm done. A quick brush through my hair and it looks fabulous.*The material around the curler is soft and there aren't any jagged pieces to hold your hair in place so I don't tear my hair when pulling the curlers out.CONS:*It's big. If you don't have a lot of bathroom space, it's going to be a problem. I have to use this at the kitchen table because there is no place in my bathroom large enough to set it.*It's hot. They warn you on the front of the case when you open it that the rods and interior are hot. But I'd like to add an additional warning to keep the clip away from your ears because that is pretty hot too. Hotter than I am used to in hot curlers. Though to be fair, that is probably why it works so well.CONCLUSION:I would buy this again and I would recommend it to my friends, already have as a matter of fact, particularly if you have a thick head of fine hair (since I can't really speak to other hair types.) It's fast, easy to use, and leaves my hair looking beautiful. But keep in mind it is a space hog and you have to be careful of the heating elements.
This is perhaps the 5th set of electric style rollers that I have owned.  It's probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product.  It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair.  This product has a squeeze clip that fastens over the roller, once it is wrapped with your hair.  It also heats up, to transfer heat to the hair from both the inside and the out.  It also will leave a "crease" in the lock of hair, from where is clips on.  No way to avoid it.  I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me.  Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.
I was quite doubtful at getting nice curls from this as I have been so disappointed with other brands.  I was very wrong in my assumption.  I have stick straight hair and the curlers from this gave me wonderfully beautiful curls that lasted quite a bit longer than I could have possibly hoped for.  The curlers are a bit on the warm side when handling but other than that I am more than satisfied.  I would recommend this for any of you out there that long for curls and have been let down from so many other devises.  A great product that will pay for itself in no time.  A+++ in my book for something that I will treasure for quite some time to come.  Now I have wonderus hair.
If you can get past the oatmeal smell (my husband says it smells like spackling paste), it works pretty well.  Clearly, it is hard to judge whether a wrinkle cream is working after a month or so but my skin is definitely softer and smoother after using it.  I use it morning and night and it does not make my foundation peel up like a lot of creams do.  It also contains SPF 15 which is great for the winter sun.
Truely nothing is going to fix the wrinkles.  But this goes on very lightly and keeps skin moisturized and soft all day. It does not bother my eyes at all which is a first. It doesn't take much and there is no greasy feel.  One star off because I am not at all sure it is worth the posted price.  It is one ounce of product, that is two tablespoons, IOW the size of a serving of salad dressing.It did not come with an ingredient list so I'm not sure if it contains precious metals or what but I would be afraid to pay so much for something a child could smear on the mirror in 5 seconds flat.
Review of Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex, Sensitive:The manufacturer advertises Hydroxatone as "a multi functional anti-aging powerhouse and moisturizer for those with sensitive skin that softens the appearance of visible lines, wrinkles and crow's feet by helping the skin stimulate the production of collagen. This one product serves as your daytime moisturizer, your nighttime moisturizer and your anti-aging treatment all in one."  Bold promises that do deliver.  However, although the moisturizing effects of the creme do reduce wrinkle lines (crow's feet), it is a temporary effect lasting approximately 4-6 hours.  It will take more than one jar to experience the long term longitudinal effects.  In short, my wife likes it!  Will purchase more in future.
My mom is a type of person who don't mine going store to store , surfing through the website, and ordering through TV ads to fine the best cream minimizers. She's 56 and is trying to minimize her fine lines and wrinkles. I'm over 35 and have never even touched a wrinkle cream. So I handed this cream to her to fine out what she thinks.  My mom tried Hydroxatone to get rid of her wrinkles and it actually ended up clearing up her dark aging spots after a month, so she recommended that I try it when I feel its ready! Amazing! She's very satisfied with this product so I'll make sure to hold on to this brand. Recommended.
I usually use Olay products (Regenerist) and have found that I really like how they work on my skin. But the idea of trying a product for three times the price to see if it makes a three times difference was too good to pass up.The product goes on easy and disappears fairly quickly. I often have trouble with creams burning my eyes, no matter how careful I am about applying them nearby. I had no trouble with this cream at all. It never bothered my eyes.I can say that I feel some of my finer wrinkles have softened but I also think that the skin on my face has plumped ever so slightly which is what has decreased the appearance of wrinkles. I guess that's what this is supposed to do though - add enough long lasting moisture to make the wrinkles fill in a bit.But no matter what, I can't get past the price. It's a lot of money to spend on a deceivingly small container. If you look at it carefully, the only part that has the cream is a small section in the middle. The outer blue flare of the jar is just for show and the lid is meant to look really thick but the amount of cream is one ounce.So while I think the product has done a good job, I think there are other products that do a close enough or similar job for a more affordable price.
This review is for the AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex for sensitive skin.  I'm not sure why all the Hydroxatone reviews are being lumped together as the different formulations vary significantly.This is a very nice lightweight moisturizer with a non-greasy feel.  It absorbs into the skin within seconds and leaves my face feeling moisturized but without any kind of "sticky" feel to it.  I can apply make-up almost immediately after using this moisturizer in the morning and it does not affect how well my make-up wears throughout the day.  This provides the perfect amount of moisture for my combination skin (mostly normal with a tendency to get oily in the t-zone).  With that in mind, I doubt this would be rich enough for dry/very dry skins.Some things to consider:*Sensitive formula does not contain sunscreen*non-scented*may not provide enough moisture for dry/very dry skinHere's the product claim that's printed on the side of the box:  "...help reduce the appearance of a wide range of wrinkles and improve the overall appearance of the skin".  That's a pretty modest claim, which I actually appreciate.  No miracle anti-aging claims here.  Wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable when the skin is temporarily "plumped up" by moisturizers, and this one does contain Hyaluronic Acid (a known plumping ingredient).Overall I was very pleased with this product.  It's convenient to have one moisturizer that can be used for both AM and PM, and I prefer my skin care products without sunscreen - who needs a night cream that contains sunblock?  My one complaint:  I really don't care for the `jar' packaging.  I'm sure it's used because it makes it seem like you're getting far more than just 1 oz. of product, but I don't like having to stick my fingers into the jar to scoop out the product; it's easy to spread bacteria that way.  I would definitely purchase this again.
Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Cream is a fairly heavy moisturizing day and night cream that contains SPF 15 sunscreen.  It did sting a bit when applied near my eyes. It did not irritate my skin, and it did not cause any breakouts. The cream absorbs quickly and is not too heavy to be worn under foundation.  I found the cream to be about the same as most good moisturizers.  I did not see any big difference in my skin, but it did do a good job of softening my skin.
. . . After using this for a short time, it's hard to tell if it works or not, but I was eager to try this product.  I'd seen it advertised on TV and it sounds good.  It is light and nongreasy - I like it for those attributes.  Whether or not it will improve my skin probably won't be known for a time, but I'm willing to give it a try.  It does have an SPF of 15 and that's always good.
My regular facial moisturizer isOlay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging DNA Superstructure UV Cream SPF 30, 1.7 Ounceand have been happy with it but I was curious to try something different. I got this because I liked the SPF coverage and liked that it was unscented.Now others have noted that they couldn't stand the smell, which admittedly is very different. I think people get accustomed to fragrance being in beauty products that when they finally encounter something without fragrance and the natural smells come through, it turns them off. But in my case, I was not turned off. I actually liked that it had no fragrance added.My first impressions were: The bottle was small. So very small. For so much money you get 1 oz of product. Comparable creams, such as Avon's Anew and my Olay Regenerist give you 1.7 oz. So you're getting quite a bit less here. Upon opening the jar, the cream turned out to be thick and goes on easily. You need very little to moisturize your entire face.After two weeks of use, I've been pleased. I'm Asian and my facial coloring is not even. I've noticed that this has evened out my skin tone and makes my face look more.... luminescent? Radiant? Maybe those aren't the right words. My face doesn't actually glow but my features do look brighter. I feel more fresh-faced. My skin is also incredibly soft and I just love how it feels. In regards to wrinkles, I am not sure. My problem area is my forehead where I have fine lines. Those lines are still there and I don't think they've changed. To be fair, I have only been using it for two weeks so maybe it takes more time.The bottom line is that this cream is hands down better than the one I was using before. But I don't know if I could justify shelling out big bucks for it.
Last year, I had a violent allergic reaction to a MAC foundation, and had to stop using anything on my face that was `anti-aging' in nature. Anything with actives, fragrance, etc. all caused my face to redden, sting, burn, swell up. I had to give up my beloved Avon ANEW skincare (one of the best, most effective ones I have ever tried) and this really bummed me out. I could not use anything stronger than coconut oil on my face, it was that bad.  Slowly I've braved a few products since then, with mixed results. I was a little hesitant to try the Hydroxatone since it is an anti-aging product and I feared irritation, but tried it anyway.Well, this does just what it says it will! It hydrates nicely, and it causes ZERO irritation on my face or neck. I'm a little on the fence about the anti-aging effects; I can see that my skin is being hydrated well as I don't have as many dry patches as before. It doesn't sting or burn or itch when applied, so I've been able to use it awhile now and like it. I haven't noticed a reduction of lines in areas where I have them, but they also don't appear to be more noticeable. Just the fact that this doesn't cause me any allergic reactions was impressive.  I will say that areas tending to have a roughness some mornings, are smooth after using this.The only thing I really didn't like about it, was the texture. It has a gel-cream consistency, which takes a little effort to scoop out. I also feel that gel-cream formulations make me use more. I've had this about a month and a half and I like to see at least 2 months or more out of a pricey night cream. (Just my personal budgetary and usage preference) I've had other products last that long and it's something I have come to expect from night creams. I realize for some people this may not be realistic, it's just my preference.*Even though I was satisfied that this cream is nice, this price point of over $50 is not of interest to me. It would have to work as well as the Avon ANEW that I loved, to justify that price for me.UPDATE: I've been using various acid peels (mandelic, glycolic, TCA) on my face and neck. This Hydroxatone product is good at keeping my face hydrated, but it just can't keep up with my neck now that I'm using acid peel products. My neck will sometimes look like it's 70 as the skin turnover takes place in the days after a peel; this moisturizer simply can't keep up.
I like this moisturizer/anti-aging cream. I have sensitive skin, and can usually only use fragrance-free, natural products, but my skin has not broken out with daily use of this for several months.  I have not noticed fine lines on my 50-year-old face anyway, so I cannot tell if this works for that. My skin feels smooth with this cream. I do notice some age/sun damage spots that appear lighter. That may be from it being winter and no sun exposure OR some other products I have been using (Clinique Repairwear Intensive Night Cream and Skinceuticals Overnight Dry, which I alternate). However, regardless, it makes my skin feel smooth and doesn't break it out, so I'll keep using it. It has an attractive jar, if keeping it out on your vanity table as an eye-pleaser matters to you. It does seem a little spendy for the amount you get, so I  took off a star.
This seems to really work well on firming my skin.  I've been using it under my chin and neck area and I can see a difference, mostly around the bottom area of my chin.  My skin seems less wobbly to me.I like how smoothly it goes on my skin, it glides on, so I don't need to pull at my skin while applying it.  It doesn't have a noticeable scent to me, which I also like.  It's a nice cream and doesn't feel greasy at all.  A little goes a long way so I just dip the very tip of one finger into the cream.  I like this this cream and will keep using it.
Moisturizing is such a critical part of the daily skin care.  I found the cream very light and when you really just need to lightly glean the top: plenty.  When applied, you can feel a light coolness to your skin.  The best time is too use any moisturizing cream before sleep.One star off for the interior packaging meant that the cream container was not securely held in the box, for the price.
I really like this moisturizer.My skin is VERY sensitive, extra-dry and prone to breaking out when it disagrees on something.  I generally lean towards Caudalie as my preferred brand, but I think I will happily use this, and buy it, because it just feels SO nice.It goes on easily, without a greasy feeling at all.  Has ZERO smell, and instantly absorbs.  I have super dry skin, and always feel nervous when trying a new product but the first morning I woke up I just couldn't get over how great and smooth my skin felt.  No irritation, no breaking out.  It has a nice thick consistency in the jar that does not feel thick on your face.  My skin feels smooth, and hydrated.A few weeks in, and I'm still using this 2x a day (at least) and loving it.*I'm not really sure how well it helps wrinkles, I'm in my mid-20's and this is more preventive then needed.*Definitely a winner, and I'll be buying more when this jar is out.
I don't think this is meant to be a miracle cream. I ordered this product because I had seen it advertized and read some promising reviews. I didn't expect an air-brushed look. I live in Colorado, and the air here is so dry. In short, moisturizer matters. I use the sensitive formula in the morning and at night. In the morning I used it under sunscreen (SPF 50). At night I mix it with a retinol cream before I apply it. It has a great texture and scent, and I am very happy with the way it makes my face soft and not oily. I am only 33, so I don't have deep wrinkles anyway. I also had to put off using this product until I was done nursing my baby due to the ingredients. I would use it again.
As a person with very sensitive skin it is always a risk when I agree to test out a skin care product.  This particular product is made for sensitive skin and it had no negative effects on my skin over the course of the month that I tried it out.I applied it to the tiny wrinkles near my eyes as well as the more intense wrinkles on my frown head (my "I'm annoyed/angry" lines as I call them).  I frankly expected very little if anything to happen, perhaps some moisturizing of my skin but no true erasing of "time" on my skin.I was wrong.  The tiny lines under my eyes disappeared within four uses and the deeper lines above lessened visibly.However, and this is a big however, if I did not apply it every day the lines came back. They were not worse but they were there as before.  So the product works but you must keep using it.
Compared with T3 Tourmaline Hair DryerProsLower Price - 1/3 the current cost (T3 (originally cost $300, now $95).Faster Drying Speed - 2/3 the drying time.Better Controls - more options, less likely to unintentially change.Retractable Cord - retracts easily (but mine is still new).Easier Cleaning - easier to clean filter.ConsHeavier Weight - 3x heavier than T3.Short Cord - 6' shorter than T3.Static Electricity - more than with T3.Longevity - unknown.  I've been using the T3 with no problems for 3 years but just got the Infinity.Claims - neither one gives my hair more sheen or softness than any other hair dryer.Winner - T3.  The weight and cord length are deal breakers.  The Infiniti will be my backup dryer.
Overall, I like this hairdryer a lot.  The thing that first drew me to this hairdryer?  The color.  It's a bright, shiny, fushia color.  The make is very sleek and stylish.  Infiniti, by Conair, is light and easy to handle, even when you're using a brush with your other hand!  The best part of this hairdryer is, by far, the retractable cord, which makes it very easy to store.  The filter is removable, making the life of your hairdryer longer!Your hairdryer comes with a concentrator to help straighten your wavy or curly hair and a diffuser to give it body and life.  It also is equipped with Tourmaline Ceramic technology which, according to the box, "generates ions that work hair molecules to help dry them inside and out... Ions smooth the cuticle layer... creating a silky, shiny look".I found the Infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer.  With heat options 'hot', 'warm', and 'cool', and power levels 'high' and 'low', there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair.  'Hot' never got too hot and 'warm' was perfect for my use.  Some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards, but I am happy to report that the Infiniti cooled off quite quickly.  The retractable cord is also very handy.  One quick word of warning about the cord, it retracts VERY fast.  Be careful of fingers or retract it little by little and not all at once.From my experience, my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual, which might be due to the 'Tourmaline Ceramic technology'.  As mentioned before, I really do like this hairdryer.
