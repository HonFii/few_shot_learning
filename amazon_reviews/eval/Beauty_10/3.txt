Having found some Olay products that I thought were excellent I gave this one a whirl.  After 6 weeks of use I don't notice a decrease in lines.  My skin is extremely dry, flaky with uneven skin tones and I have noticed improvement in these areas.  Is it from this product or one of the others it is impossible to tell.  I do like that it is fragrance free.
This shade is no longer available, so I was very pleased to see it on Amazon. Although the seller is wonderful, there is a slight difference in color from my old bottle. It is slight, so it is probably the dye lot, but with OPI being such a well known trusted brand, I would have thought quality control would be better.
These seem more of a novelty than anything. Each time I use them they pull more tiny hairs than blackhead gunk. They are easy to use and the slits help the to adjust to any nose. They are a bit painful to remove but it's not intolerable. I will us these up for my "spa days" but they aren't life changing or very effective at all. In reality my chemical peels are more effective at doing what these are supposed to do. On the plus side, they haven't caused any breakouts thus far.
I've always used Dove soap bars, they have a beautiful look and ergonomic feel. My skin tends to dryness, so I steer clear of fragrance. I thought I'd try this sensitive skin formula in a liquid form. It's okay, I didn't notice anything remarkably different about my skin. The bottle is almost too large for a standard shower, and heavy, so when your hands are wet, be careful not to drop it which is easy to do given the smooth shape of the bottle, there's no way to grip it firmly. Most annoyingly, you can never get the last bit of soap out of this style bottle and wrestling the cap off is nearly impossible.
I love Dove products. I've used their soap, body wash and deodorant for years. I've always loved that their soaps helped keep my skin moisturized rather than drying it out.  However, this body wash didn't seem to do that. When I used it I was surprised to find that it felt waxy and left a residue (like some other brands).  My favorite Dove body wash is the Visible care line.Dove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning, 18 Ounceand I'll stick with it.  I wouldn't buy this one again.
This is a BIG bottle of body wash by Dove. It lathers great, cleans great, smells...ugh. I was surprised to see that it is actually unscented, because it smelled slightly medicinal to me. It did make my skin soft & great for sensitive skin. I'm sure it's unscented because it is for sensitive skin. Overall, it's ok, but other body washes I like much better.
The Dove body wash for sensitive skin is a very good product. It lathered nicely in hard water. It is very moisturizing. I was surprised at how nicely moisturized my skin was after I dried off. It really is great on sensitive skin. It did not irritate  freshly shaved legs.The only downsides are the scent. It is supposedly unscented but definitely has a scent. It is not a particularly appealing one. At the risk of being indelicate, it takes a bit of extra washing to get rid of smelly armpits.
In my opinion there is nothing "stand out" about this body wash. Will it get you clean? Yes, will it make you smell? Yes, there is a scent in the body wash but it isn't over powering. I won't be buying this one again and will instead be sticking with theDove Men + Care Body and Face Wash, Fresh Awake, 18 Ounce (Pack of 2).
I like the Dove body wash, since it lathers up nicely, and it is soothingly refreshing while its nutrium moisture provides a pleasant shower experience. However, an hour afterward, and though not visible, my skin feels as if it has a bit of a dry, soap-like, Dove-scented film on it - perhaps the feel of clean?It does its job, but I just feel a little dry is all. This could be a good thing for the upcoming Summer heat we'll be having - if so I'll come back to boost its rating by one more star.
I love bath and body products and enjoy trying different soaps, washes, etc.This one was mediocre. The scent was very soapy and unremarkable. If you're just looking for a basic body wash for sensitive skin, you might be happy with this one. But if you're into exotic, luxurious bath products, this one will disappoint.
This is your standard body wash. It is supposed to moisturize your skin as you wash. I did not notice any deep moisturizing when I used it. It actually made me itch and gave me drier skin.
I have used many different Dove products for years, and I've always been very pleased with them, but this isn't my favorite product.  First, although I am not sensitive to fragrance, I should point out that this product does contain fragrance, despite the bottle claiming that it is "unscented."  I will say that the fragrance is not very strong, and I don't find it overwhelming, but overly sensitive people may.  This shower gel is supposed to offer "Deep Moisture" and while my dry, "winter" skin did feel moisturized when I got out of the shower, that feeling didn't last long, and I was going back to apply lotion.  The gel did lather well, and I do feel "clean" after using it.  Overall, for a product that is labeled as "unscented" and having "deep moisture," I feel that Dove fell short with this product.  I believe that it is a good shower gel, but it is not outstanding as far as moisturizing is concerned, and the "unscented" labeling may mislead consumers.  I think in the future I will stick to other Dove products that I have liked better.
I like Dove, I really do. I've always associated with it something pure and gentle. I was excited about Dove Nutrium Moisture body wash; but this time, it missed the mark.I know Nutrium Moisture is unscented for the sensitive folks, but unscented means no added scents. That doesn't mean I can't smell what's left. I wouldn't call it odoriferous, it's just not pleasant. After many years of bombardment by advertisements, I have come the conclusion that body washes are supposed to be pleasant.Other than that, I do feel clean afterward, even if I don't smell like wildflowers or strawberry banana.
For those who only care about the practical aspects of a product,  there is nothing wrong with the Dove Body Wash.  I use the citrus scented one and I love it. Unfortunately,  I have gotten used to using body washes that smell great, and this one is not it.  I am going to guess that this is the Dove Body Wash that is marketed towards those who want something plain, but the problem is the "plain scent" to me is actually almost nauseating.  A lightly scented soap may still have a hint of vanilla, perhaps.  I'd rather use a bar of soap, I think, than to use this specific non-scented version.  I am going to guess this is something my husband would be fine showering with, because body washes with fruity scents annoy him...
Held in a tall, oval-shaped bottle, this Dove Body Wash with nutrium moisture could best be described as utilitarian but solid soap, an economical cleansing product for the masses. That classic, sweetish smell that comes from Dove's bars of soap is just as pleasant in liquid form; it's a refreshing scent that never goes out of style.Overall, this is a no-frills, thick white moisturizing soap that smells great and gets the job done.
Having used Dove soap for years, I was a little disappointed with the body wash. It doesn't have quite the same fresh scent, which I love so much about Dove soap. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the body wash for fans of the soap.
I used this shampoo for a month and still had to color my hair about the same time I usually do. It's a nice shampoo with a good smell and good lather, but nothing special. I use all these kinds of products now because they are just better for colored hair.
I know why shampoo manufacturers put sulfates (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate) in their products: they produce a lot of lather, which people want even though lather makes no difference in getting your hair clean. But when those ingredients are known to cause hair color to fade, why would they ever put them in a product that claims to be for "color care"?Other than that, this is a perfectly fine, perfectly standard shampoo. It smells nice and it gets your hair clean. Just don't expect it to repair damage (no product can do that), and definitely don't expect it to be particularly color-friendly.
This white-gelled, ultra-creamy Dove shampoo is extremely sudsy when you rub it in your hair, and the scent is vaguely coconut, though that fragrance isn't listed on the stylish white bottle.The shampoo's lower sulfate content supposedly means it's better for color-treated hair. My wife didn't notice that feature so much on her hair, but lower sulfate in any product sounds like a good thing to me.Overall, this is good shampoo that gets the job done.
I didn't have high hopes for this but I have to say that not only does this smell good, it did a decent job of conditioning. I could run my fingers through with no problems BUT I used this with the shampoo and it weighs down my hair and a film develops on my scalp. No not dandruff, it's product build up. I know it's this as I don't use hair products as of lately. I don't recommend this as an every day thing. I needed to use a really good shampoo to make my hair and scalp feel ultra clean mid week with this. While it's not bad it's just not for me.
I have other dove shampoos and I love them, but this one not as much.  It seemed like I had to use more product to build up a lather.  It also just didn't seem to have the same texture as the other ones that I have used.  It still did a good job cleaning my hair though.  It will go easy on color treated hair.
I picked this product up a few weeks ago for two of my teens to try out.  Neither of them has a bad case of acne, but they do have mild cases of acne going (resulting mostly from stage make-up they used during a recent HS play they were in).First, success:My daughter (just turned 18) has been using this treatment for about 2 weeks now.  She reported that it did a good job of clearing up the acne on her forehead.  She did not report any excessively dry or peeling skin, and she is continuing to use it.Second - well, less than success:My son (16 yrs old) has some acne mostly on his cheeks, and he also started using this product a couple of weeks ago.  He reported that early on it looked like it was helping, but in less than a week he was suffering extremely dry and flaking skin, even after cutting the recommended number of treatments per day in half (as directed if excessive dry skin resulted).  He therefore stopped using it all together in just over a week.So, what's my overall conclusion?This product MAY do an excellent job of clearing up your acne, but the only way to tell is to get the product and try it out.My guess is that if you have skin that is already fairly dry that you may experience the same result as my son, but it you have skin that is more moist or somewhat oily, this may be a great product for you.Well, there you have it!  I hope this was helpful.Good luck!
I've been dealing with acne for some time, trying a variety of creams, astringents, masques, face washes, etc. I've used proactiv and Acne Free systems for several months now. I usually prefer acne treatment products that don't contain Salicylic acid, instead getting better results with benzoyl peroxide products. Both have their drawbacks and you should try both to see which works better for you then others.I'm going to focus on the second step as representative of the system in general. While these systems are designed to be all in one, which seems convenient initially, what happens to me anyway, is that the three products run out at different times. You can find some kind of balance by buying new kits or if the manufacturer is kind, separately, but it is still annoying to run out of a step  out of sync before the others. Typically I run out the second step in these kits, usually a kind of astringent to remove dead skin cells and other contaminants. This has been my experience so far using Nature's Gate.It also has a fairly strong smell, that smell odorous at first, but eventually something to get used to. Each container contains a flip top, similar to what you might find on some brands of hair products. It works fine with step 1 and 3 liquids, but works poorly in step two. Perhaps mine is defective, but it leaks a small amount of liquid after dispensing. The only solution is to unscrew the entire cap and carefully dab some on a cotton pad.Also be careful not to use too much of step one, it is highly concentrated, so only a few drops will clean your face well. Too much and it will be difficult rinse off entirely.Overall I think Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment system has been useful, but will go back to using Acne Free Products. The Salicylic Acid and other ingredients doesn't keep my skin as clear as Benzoyl peroxide products.
I am a 41 year old woman who has had acne on and off since I was 12.  It seems I am always on the lookout for a new acne-fighting product.  This product is nice in that it is not harsh on the skin.  I have used this product for about a month, and my skin did not flake or get red because of it. I do have sensitive skin and usually start having problems w/ the dryness.However, I don't think the 1% salicylic acid is enough for me because I still got a few new zits.  Personally I need a product in addition to the cleanser, calming toner and controlling lotion, I need an exfoliator.  This is easily done w/ simple baking soda or granulated sugar, if I can remember to bring it into the shower with me.  I would mix it with the cleanser, and it would probably be helpful.So if you are looking for an organic, gentle solution to your not seriously severe acne, I would say give this system a try.  It is relatively inexpensive.  If it does not do the trick, go visit your dermatologist for some advice.
Even though I'm out of my teens, I still have problems with blemishes appearing so I'm willing to try anything to completely clear my skin. The Nature's Gate Organic Acne Treatment is a three step process of cleanser, toner and lotion. The box says for morning and night use and I've been using it everyday without a problem so it should be okay for twice a day, everyday use.I've been doing the three step process everyday for almost two weeks and I can't really see a difference in my skin. It doesn't really take care of blackheads and it has not stopped a new zit from forming on my forehead. The three step process is a bit tedious and if you do not have the patience to perform the regime, it can probably be easy to stop because you just don't feel like keeping up the process.On the plus side, it's great to find an organic product. Especially because it doesn't have any harsh or strong smells to it as some acne treatments can have. It also has cut down on my forehead getting too oily during the day which is a great thing.So even though it hasn't really made too much on my skin yet, I'm planning to keep using the product in hope that it can change my skin some. And even though it hasn't totally worked with me, doesn't mean that it can't work for some people.
This product worked great on my face but on my neck line I still have break outs. I have tried the product for a little over two weeks and have not had any new breakouts on my face. But my jaw and neck are still very bad. I am glad I tried it but I don't think I will be buying it in the future.
Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System with Oligopeptide-10I have used this kit for the past week or so and did not detect any reduction in acne. Granted the instructions say to give it 6 weeks, my prescription acne medication (benzoyl peroxide) works within 1-2 days and I can't wait 6 weeks for my face to clear up. Overall, the Nature's Gate kit was not effective. There are 3 components to this system. Step 1 involves the use of a foaming face wash containing tea tree oil and salicylic acid, not unlike the St Ives face wash I buy at the local store. Step 2 requires the use of a calming toner that contains Oligopeptide-10, tea tree oil, sage, and alpha hydroxyl acids derived from lemon, apple, and orange extracts. The last stage, Step 3, requires the use of a controlling lotion that contains Oligopeptide-10 and salicylic acid. The instructions warn about your face getting too dry, but I found the lotion to be too greasy. I did like the toner and wash since it is similar to what I normally use but it just wasn't terribly effective as a replacement for prescription medication. However, every person is different so there are those with skin pH's and textures that may benefit from this system.
I'm a little like some of the others who have reviewed.  Though I rarely have problems with lotions, this isn't the first time this happened to me.  With an ingredient list a mile long, I'm not surprised that it burned! ;-)  Just because something is "natural" or "organic" doesn't mean it still can't be toxic.I'm still giving this item three-stars simply because it might very well work for some people.  I just wish there were a way to send-off for a sample of the lotion first, to see if it's going to irritate your skin before you purchase the kit.
I'm middle-aged and have never had serious acne, but I've had mild acne since I was a teenager.  I have been using salicylic acid (BHA) products and benzoyl peroxide with good results.I'm rating this system as OK, pinging it one star because of the fragrance and one because of the toner.  All of the products contain plant and essential oils that can be fragrant, and fragrance is added to each.  The toner leaves my eyes watering for a while.The cleanser works very well, and will even remove makeup, but you'll have to use eye makeup remover.  Be careful not to get this in your eyes.  I did, accidentally, and it really burned.  But I like the cleanser.  It works.The toner is downright harsh.  I don't know why it makes my eyes water, but it does.  A menthol or camphor smell seems to waft from it, but they aren't listed in the ingredients.  It also leaves my skin feeling stripped.The lotion is anything but greasy.  My skin feels smooth and soft, and clean.  It would be terrific if the lotion was two products - one as is, and the other with sunscreen.  You absolutely must use a sunscreen during the day.The system is keeping my blackheads and pimples under control, and even though I have complaints about it, I do think it's worth trying because it's the best system I've used.  My personal regime has been cobbled together from different brands.  Every other acne system (products sold together) I've tried has been horrible.  This is definitely a step up.  And the packaging is very good, airtight and opaque.I hope they make another version, with the 1% BHA, and a bit gentler.
This wouldn't work for me. I barely have any acne, but I thought I'd try this and see if it improved things.I should have known better, but salicylic acid products don't work on my face. I gave it 3 stars because I do appreciate that the product is a natuaral product. But, this product didn't really work for me. It actually made my skin worse, which is regular for me when I use salicylic acid. If salicylic acid works for you though, by all means give this product a try.
I really did enjoy the face wash portion of the kit but found the toner to be lacking and the moisturizer too oily. The whole kit lasted about 2 weeks.Overall it is an okay product but I rather stick with other face care products.Katiebabs
Growing up, I dealt with what most would consider normal teenage acne.  As I have matured, the acne has slowly gone away, with only a blemish or two popping up here or there.  My wife also tackled the average teen's acne, but after the birth of our second child, her breakouts increased.  Granted, she doesn't suffer from severe acne, but she does have a higher degree of breakouts than before she had our second child.  With that in mind, I decided to pick up Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System for her.The system is very simple to use.  So simple, in fact, that the bottles are numbered one, two, and three.  The first bottle, the Corrective Cleanser, attacks acne with good ol' fashioned salicylic acid.  Fans of Oxy and other cleansers will recognize this stuff.  Coupled with it is encapsulated tea tree oil, which helps unclog pores.  The second step in the process involves the Calming Toner, which contains Oligopeptide-10, more of the aforementioned tree oil and "botanical extracts" which together supposedly control the amount of oil on the skin and further clean out those pores.  The last bottle is the Controlling Lotion, which uses the Oligopeptide-10 and our old friend salicylic acid to maintain a clear complexion.When my wife tried this product, she did mention a slight burning sensation.  However, this was expected thanks to the salicylic acid and the tree oil.  I can see where those with sensitive skin could experience an adverse reaction to this, so use this product at your own risk if your skin is sensitive.After using the product a few days, she did notice a slight reduction in acne, but nothing more or less than the results when using Oxy products.  While she liked the Nature's Gate Organics system, she saw no reason to abandon her other cleanser.The product is certified organic, which is a plus, but in this day and age the almighty dollar is what speaks the loudest.  In my opinion, if you get similar or better results using a cheaper product, use it instead of Nature's Gate Organics Acne Treatment System.  The system works fairly well, but nothing makes it stand out from any of the other systems on the market other than its eco-friendliness.Recommended to anyone with moderate acne problems who prefers to use organic brands.
I've tried a variety of products for acne, and was anxious to give this product a try to see if it offered any better results.I'm regret to say that this product didn't produce the results as quickly as other products and, in turn, left me with excessively dry skin in the T-zone.The advantage to this particular acne treatment system is that it has a much better smell than other treatments.
While I am sure SOME people are getting good results from this product (as I have seen in other reviews) my 20 year old daughter unfortunately falls into the other category that I have seen in previous reviews....those who CAN'T tolerate it. The product was just TOO harsh and left her with a rash on her face and throat. Therefore she had to discontinue use before she really got to see any sort of tangible results.It could be that this product is simply highly allergenic to some, irritating to others and then may be the perfect product for those with less sensitive skin. However, my daughter has never had a reaction like this before to numerous products (some containing very similar ingredients) so I would not classify her as someone with highly reactive skin.All this said, I rated this item a 3* because it would seem to have effective ingredients and I am always in favor of organic alternatives. I assume that it is effective for some based on what I have read. My advice would be to consider it with caution. It may be just the thing for YOU, but beware that it appears to also be just the thing others have had POOR reactions to.
I have not been a teenager for a while now but still suffer from occasional oubreaks of acne.  This is a 2 product system.  i've been using everyday.  My skin feels clean but there is little change in my acne or black heads. It does not ruin the towels which is a benifit.  If I had to choose between products that contain peroxide or this product I would choose this product.
Ok I suffer from adult acne. Tried this for three days it cleared up my acne after two days, but bare in mind it was just a few bumps, afterwards I realized how dry my skin is to where as it is ashy. this worked just as well as the over the counter stuff. it does not smell bad that was a plus. overall if you have serious acne I do not know how well it will work, but a few bumps it worked,
I don't really have any complaints about this product.  It seemed to do a decent job as a facial cleanser.  It did make my face feel clean, and it didn't break out my skin, which tends to be a problem for me and acne products.  I was hoping it would take care of a few trouble spots for me, and overall it seems like it does a decent job.Pros:One of the biggests pros is that I can say is that it didn't dry out my skin like some acne treatments seem to.  Step 1 is basically a face wash and step 2 is a toner you apply with a cotton ball.  The lotion is step 3 and can be used more frequently if you have more oily skin and on specific trouble spots, but I used it once a day, and I didn't have any problem with dry skin.  The main ingredient is salicylic acid, which doesn't bleach your towels or clothes, so I think that is a big plus for this product.  I also like that this product uses organic ingredients.  In a world with so many chemicals, more natural products are a plus.  Although salicylic acid can be a little harsh on the system, over all I think it is a good balance of stronger products and natural remedies.Cons:My main complaint with this system is that contains 3 products that are intended to be used twice a day for full effect.  I prefer a face wash and go routine to a complicated system, but if you don't mind the system, it would be a good fit for you.Overall my opinion is positive.  If you are looking for a more organic alternative to a acne system, then you might want to give this a try.
If you cannot use any form of benzoyl peroxide and have MILD acne, this system will work for you.  If you have severe acne, don't waste your time.  If you CAN use peroxide in small doses, but have redness from the 10% solution, read this:This product has only 1% acid. Not very effective. For the brief period of time this in on your face it cannot exfoliate thoroughly.  It was about the worst I've used for exfoliating. I had visible flaking on my nose area after using for a week, twice daily.It does NOT clear up black heads. I've used many treatments that do a far better job on black heads. This reduces them, but not greatly.It doesn't smell good. The citrus based ingredients, along with some other pleasant sounding ones made me think it was going to smell good. It didn't. In fact, it was the ONLY acne treatment that smelled so awful that my husband ASKED me if I had used something on my face when I came to bed. He has NEVER mentioned it before.The 3rd product that you put on your face leaves it looking and feeling greasy.  I felt very clean and a little dry/tight from the cleanser. The toner made my skin feel a little less tight. The 3rd product made me feel like I needed to start over again.It didn't clear up my acne.  I went off of all other products while using this. I continued to have breakouts and the acne that I already had was less severe, but did not go away.COMPARE:The ACNE FREE system is similar in price. I found it to be too heavy on the peroxide, leaving my sensitive skin very tight, dry and red.The PROACTIVE system is more expensive, but a pain in the derrier because you have to subscribe and pay huge shipping fees. Probably one of the best systems out there, but don't fall for the half-price hooks. They give you a half-sized product and you still pay full-sized shipping charges.The CLEAN and CLEAR system - similar to the ACNE FREE. It's just hard on your skin.The NEUTROGENA system (basic) was the best thing next to PROACTIVE and cost about $4 less than this one. It was fine for my sensitive skin and did a tremendous job of clearing up acne without irritation.Overall, if you're bent on buying the most earth-friendly product, this is probably for you, but you'll have to live with a little of your acne.  If you're wanting to get rid of it, try Neutrogena. If you have money to waste, go for Proactive.
My oldest kids (17 and 14) have been using this for about a month. It's pretty similar to the Neutrogena kits that are available, as well as any other salicylic based product.I was excited to buy an organic product, although Nature's Gate products often include petroleum based ingredients hidden by their complex names.  My kids hated the toner, they said their skin felt like it was coated all day with a film, and couldn't stand using it.So, there's nothing stellar to report here from our experience. It's a typical salicylic product that may or may not be extra gentle based on it organic ingredients.It's certainly no worse than other products.
I have sensitive skin (mostly on my face) and have a hard time finding a sunscreen that won't cause problems. I generally stick to expensive department store brands. Fallene Cotz contains only titanium and zinc, has no fragrance, is slightly tinted, and goes on pretty smoothly. However, it is slightly greasy and makes your skin look shiny. It does work, but you will have to put up with being shiny. That isn't worth it to me, so I plan on sticking with my old faithfuls, even though they are expensive.
I love all of the features of this particular sunscreen with regards to it being more "natural" than other brands. I do not feel that it is anywhere near the price. I used it on myself and on my children. I didn't notice a sunblock factor in any way superior to the tradtional spf 30 I've used from many other brands. It still had to be reapplied frequently, as with other brands, it didn't smell particularly good and left my skin feeling a bit sticky. I will say that after about 45 minutes of wearing, the "sticky" feeling goes away, but I noticed a lot of fine bits of dirt and fuzz clinging to my skin, which was annoying. The only big pro I can say about this is that chemically-speaking, it is healthier for the human race and I felt better about putting it on my children than the more chemical-laden products.  On the other hand, there are many other companies producing natural sunblock products costing significantly less then this. Overall, it is a good product, but not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag.
Being that this is the "ultra" deep cleaning formula expected better results than the original Biore strips, but I got the same results.  Upon first applying the strip, I immediately noticed the tea tree oil aroma.  After leaving the strip on for 15 minutes and letting it completely dry, I was left with a white residue all over my nose and it was especially caked into the crease between my nostril and cheek.  The strip only had a few small blackheads on it, the rest were still on my nose.  It seemed to take out the smallest blackheads but left behind the largest ones which are the most noticeable and ones I want to get rid of.In my opinion I don't think these strips penetrate pores enough to pull out the majority of blackheads.
I used these pore strips as directed. Washed face, applied strip and waited 10 minutes. It was completely dry by then. Removing it was more uncomfortable that I expected. What really bothered me, though, was the gooey residue it left behind at the edges of the strip. I had to wash my face again to get it off. Anyway, after closely examining the used strip, I saw that it removed some debris from the pores, but not as much as I would have expected. I also noticed a few fine hairs.
I like Biore pore clearing strips.  I use them pretty regularly.  (Probably a couple times a month.)  But after going through this whole bot of pore strips, I noticed absolutely NO DIFFERENCE from their regular deep cleansing pore strips.  It didn't clear out anymore pores than the other one, it didn't make my skin feel any different.  I don't notice any special difference that would make these "ultra," and also more money.I would recommend saving yourself some money, and going with the regular pore cleansing strips, like theseBiore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips, 24 CountYou'll get twice as many for the price of two of the boxes for the "ultra" ones, and the best part is, you'll get the same results!
I had been looking forward to using these and seeing the results; but after following the directions and removing the strip there has been no noticeable difference.Possibly if there were more debris in my pores and blackheads the results would be different, but seemingly for noses that do not have, as their product description says" headstrong pore-clogging dirt" there is not always the cleansing of pores that one would hope for.
If I did not already ownRemington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch, I might have given this 4 stars. But I do, and so I can tell you this:The S9500 is a dream. I've used it nearly daily for about a year, and it's smooth, heats up amazingly quickly, and just nice to use. This one, by comparison, doesn't glide easily, doesn't "feel" as nice, and I don't buy the claims about it causing less damage. Know why? Because, since it doesn't glide easily, you're actually spending more time with the heat on your hair than you need to with their other model. And you can set it at exactly the same amount of heat (the primary cause of the damage), and this one "pulls" on your hair more. So logic tells me that the S9500 would be less damaging.Other issues: the lock button on this is a bit difficult to turn because it's flat, and you need to rotate it right near the heat plates. AND... it made my lights flicker. Weird, right? I can use my hairdryer and my other straightener without any power problems, but as soon as this heats up, my lights start flickering and don't stop until I turn it off. Seems like it's causing power surges.Both straighteners have the same end result: nice, straight hair. But the S9500 feels like a much better way to get that result, and it's a bit faster and nicer looking, too.Now, if I were comparing this to my really old, non-ceramic-plate, circa 1995 straightening iron, this would be great. But now that I know better, I thought you should, too!
This is the 3rd or 4th straightening iron I've reviewed on Amazon.  I like the price of this one, for sure!  However, I think it might be worth it to pay $20-30 more and get a slightly better iron.  Here are the pros/cons:ProsHeats very quickly and beeps when it's readyHas high settings for people with thick or difficult to straighten hairTeflon fiber plates are very easy on your hair and won't snag itFairly long cordPrice is rightConsTakes several run-throughs to get hair as straight as some irons that only take once or twiceNo lock on the iron to keep it clamped shut (to be fair, only 1 iron that I've tried has this, but I love it)Heat setting might be too high for anyone with thin or fine hairThough there are more pros than cons, the con of taking several run-throughs is enough to make me go back to my slightly more expensive stand-by.
I have that trademark fair skin that redheads have, and it gets more and more sensitive as the years pass, so the idea of "redness relief" in this product intrigued me. I gave it a full month trial. The bottom line is, if it provided any redness relief at all, it was barely noticeable.The green color of this lotion didn't bother me, but it also didn't counter the redness of my cheeks upon application as seems to be one of the ideas behind this product. I do appreciate that it has sunscreen in it -- great for daily use -- but is it really fair to say that the sunscreen essentially accounts for its "redness-relieving" quality (since the marketing here is carefully worded)? Just the fact that it can prevent sunburn? Hmmmm ... The implication, of course, is for help with conditions such as rosacea, as other reviewers have noted, but that was not my experience with it, at least not after a month.The lotion comes in a quality bottle of glass, which I appreciate, and I like that it's fragrance-free. It was kind to my skin, leaving it soft. So overall, not a bad experience. Just not quite as good as implied. :)
I have always had a red tint to my skin and have searched for products to tone the redness down. I knew that a green tint will help so thought I'd give this one a try. It goes on smoothly although is a bit thick so you have to massage it into the skin. It does help tone down the redness at first but will not last the day through.
I have moderate rosacea, so my cheeks are unattractively rosy most of the time.  I had never tried a green-tinted skin product before, so I was excited to see what this could do.It's creamy and lightweight, and it doesn't have an unpleasant sunscreen smell.  I decided to initially apply it to only half my face and apply my regular moisturizer (an Olay night cream) to the other half so I could evaluate the difference in how my skin looked and felt.I can't say that the green tint did ANYTHING to reduce the appearance of the redness.  The half I put this Eucerin on looked just as red as the other half.  However, after a few minutes, I noticed that the other side stung a bit (common for me after washing my face; my skin is very sensitive), but the Eucerin side did not sting.  So I applied it to the other half, and then my whole face felt calm.  So I can't say that it helped with masking or reducing redness, but it DID make my skin feel better.However, even though it wasn't half bad in feel for a sunscreen, I could definitely feel it, and I didn't like that.  I don't typically wear sunscreen on my face (I just avoid the sun like a vampire), so I don't really want sunscreen in my day-to-day moisturizer.  But when I DO want sunscreen, I want a lot more than a 15 SPF.  And though I couldn't really see the green tint on my face, after I put the product on, my hand had a dull, greenish-gray tint.  Was this stuff similarly dulling my face and I just didn't notice?  Further, I'm concerned by the comments another reviewer made about having rivulets of green-tinted sweat.  I didn't get sweaty while wearing this, so I can't say if I'd have a similar problem, but I'd kind of hate to give it that chance.  I'm not sure that having the green tint (given that it didn't mask my redness) is worth it.I'll use this product up on days that I might have light sun exposure (not on sweaty days, though!), but I wouldn't buy it again.  Since it DID seem to soothe my skin, I might look into another Eucerin product that doesn't contain sunscreen, such asEucerin Redness Relief Soothing Night Face Creme.  If you can afford the cha-ching price tag, I recently triedPerfective Ceuticals Ultra-Light Sunscreen SPF 40, which I LOVED because it really DID help cover up my redness with its high titanium dioxide content (and it didn't create white rivulets when I got super sweaty).But if you just need an inexpensive, low-level sunscreen and aren't going to get sweaty, this Eucerin product wouldn't be bad, and it DOES make your skin feel soothed.
This product has both its good and bad points.On the good side it has very little fragrance, feels really good on your face and it is definitely non irritating. If you have oily skin, I think this moisturizer would be particularly good because it's lightweight and feels pretty oil free keeping your oil in check.The bad part is that when this lotion dries, it leaves a definitely noticeable green tint. It's not something you can wear alone because it's rather noticeable. It would however work well under makeup.I don't think rubbing it in really helped either. You could just see it, and once you have it on your face and it dries, it does look similar to what a mud masks looks like when you don't quite get it off.In many ways this is a great product, especially if you have sensitive skin because it's very gentle. At the same time, unless you wear makeup, it will be noticed.
I have mixed feelings about this product.  I've used it consistently for four weeks on a couple of reddish skin patches, not sunburn.  One smallish, moderately red patch seems to have actually lightened or become less red in the time I've used it.  A larger patch seems no different, but it is a darker red.  The product claims it "improves the condition of visibly red skin in 4 weeks," I thought that meant it would decrease the redness but perhaps I am misinterpreting the claim.  It's a fine line there.  It also states "Protects from redness provoking UV rays."  So are the long term effects meant only for redness caused by UV rays?  That isn't clear to me from the product description.As far as the greenish tint that offsets the appearance of redness, it works to an extent.  My husband has a very ruddy complexion, and when I used him as a guinea pig and put the lotion on only half of his face (he is a very tolerant guy), the treated half did look slightly less red than the untreated side.  But he also had a bit of dry skin, and the lotion there gave him a light greenish, Frankenstein's monster tone, not particularly desirable at times other than Halloween.  I also noticed this on my skin where it is dry:  unless I used so little as to be ineffective for masking red, the lotion did show and didn't look very good.  So, as a masking lotion, I would have hoped for better results.  As a lotion that actually reduces the redness, not just the appearance of redness, it seemed to work on a small, moderately light red area, but not on a darker, larger one.
Years ago I had a green concealer stick that worked great for neutralizing the red of pimples and skin problems.  I thought Eucerin Redness Relief sounded like a great idea, especially because it contained sunscreen. I love some of Eucerin's other skin products, and like that they are unscented and non-comedogenic.In reality, this is a thick, heavy green paste than looks terrible on my face. It's heavier than lotion sunscreen, made my face sweat, and the green color was just too flourescent looking on my face.  It didn't seem to be absorbed into my skin at all, leaving a green mask that made me look ill in natural sunlight.
The reduction in redness is pretty minimal. Sometimes I think I noticed it, others I'm not so sure. It does feel relieving, though.
The Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15 is a somewhat thick green-colored lotion. Yes, the color green will reduce skin redness as the color green cancels out the color red. Go check a color wheel and you discover how this works. The lotion is thick and green, so if you apply too much lotion your skin will look kind of a seasick green for a bit.The lotion is rated SPF 15 which provides basic solar protection. The Eucerin bottle says to not apply this lotion to broken or irritated skin. I'm not sure if you could use this on facial skin that has acne or other skin breakouts as this is technically broken or irritated skin.Overall, the lotion seems to be okay.The following review was written after short-term usage. I will update this review, if needed.Recommend with caveats given.Penmouse
I bought this for my rosacea.  I have only tried one other product for rosacea, Clinique Redness solution.  I like the Clinique better.  This product comes out too much at one time.  I'm going to have to make sure to just put a dot on my face. I think the Clinique wasn't as bright green as this product.  As others have said, once you put it on your face is a pasty, sickly looking white, so now you have to put on makeup, even in the summer.  Going back to Clinique, much more money, but works much better.
I got this thinking it would be a "reediness relief" formula. It seems more like a redness coverup formula. The color of the product is sort of an olive green, which does cover some redness, but in areas where you aren't red makes you appear corpse-like, and at SPF 15, isn't going to really keep you from getting any redder. I don't think I'd purchase again.
There's some things to love about this lotion and there's some things to sigh over, here are my pros and cons:PROS:- Fragrance free- Gentle, good for sensitive skin- Does mask redness- Effectively moisturizes and provides good sun protectionCONS:- Doesn't really "reduce" redness, just masks it- Smells like sunscreen- Green tinted lotion requires extra rubbing to blend into skin- Leaves skin looking moderately shiny- May cause break outs in some skin typesOVERALL: Don't jump for joy when you see "Redness Relief" stamped on this bottle, it's more of a marketing ploy than an actual product designed to reduce redness. It may prevent a sunburn, which could prevent a red face, but otherwise, it's goal is to mask the skin with a green-tinted moisturizer that goes on clear. It's not a BAD moisturizer with SPF, in fact, it may be the best one in my cabinet, but it also doesn't bring anything exciting or new to the table. I give it a moderate recommendation.
As far as I can tell the lotion is ok.  IT is soothing, not too greasy, and goes on fine.  My only complaint is the methol smell.  Is it there to convince us that this is a serious concoction, or does it smell because an important healing ingredient happens to smell.  Bring this out in an unscented version and I am all over it.
I based my review in comparison with that set I have been using the Babyliss Pro Instant Heat 20 Roller Ceramic Hairsetter (Model: Babchv21).I love how quickly the rollers were ready to use (less than 2 minutes) and the convenient storage case the rollers sit in.  Since the roller clips are heated as well, the actual set of the curl is much better than ordinary hot rollers that use a wire clip or plastic clip.  Another bonus is that the rollers come in only two "useful" sizes instead of the normal 4 or 5 sizes that range from large to too tiny.  I have been using hot rollers for years and I like the concept and design of the Remington H-2050 Heated Clip Hair Setter but it does have it's flaws for women with thick hair.  My hair is thick and coarse and since I had to use less hair for each roller so the clip would hold in place, I was only able to do half of my head with 20 rollers.  The curl did hold in place and there were no indention marks or lines from where the clip held the roller in place. The only flaw was that top portion of my hair was curly while the rest was flat.  In order to get the results I get from my other set, I would have to do two roller settings with this set.So with that said, the Remington H-2050 will work great with women with thin or normal hair but for anyone that has hair that is thick like mine, you might be better off looking for another brand or style.
I love that this heated in 5 minutes and curls were ready in 10 minutes. Unfortunately with my thick hair below my chest these curls just did not hold and easy to burn your self. I used hair spray and they were beautiful but only lasted about and hour and half. **Burn hazard* Do not let child under 13 use these without adult supervision due to burning themselves. If you have fine shorter hair you will get better results as my friend did.
The Remington H-2050 T-Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline provide beautiful curls that have staying power - used with the right hair products for your hair type.The roller heat up quickly, a must for those of us who always seem to be rushed in the mornings.  When I have time, I like to let the curlers cool in my hair, but even when I've had to take them out while still warm, I've found that the curler and heated clip has produced great curls very quickly.The curlers are set lengthwise on a heated bar in the base unit.  Because of this, the base is a bit larger than other models, but I really don't see a better way to design this since the clips are attached to the curlers to be heated simultaneously with the rollers.My only complaint with the Remington H-2050 is that it crimps my style in the worst place.  While the heated clips provide the advantage of a quick set, I can't seem to keep the one in the front area above my bangs from putting a crimp just above the root of that section of hair.  Just where I want height the most, the clip ruins it.  I've tried a number of things to prevent this, but simply haven't found a good way to keep this from happening yet.  And to be honest, if I have to work so hard to rig a way to prevent this from happening, I can't in good conscience rate these rollers more than a 3.  It is a shame, because if that one problem didn't exist, these would be a 5-star roller set for me.
The clips have a hard time holding onto my hair.  I have very fine hair and these clips aren't tight enough to hold it.  The clips are smooth and I really need something with teeth to hang on.  I also don't care for the lines left in my hair from the plates on the clips.  I want my hair curled, not crimped!This thing is big, too.  Takes up more counter space than I have available in the bathroom and I find it teetering off the edge, very dangerous, especially with the exposed hot metal.I did like that these heated up fast and I will continue to use them, but only leave them in a couple minutes before the crimp lines start to set in.  I also like the flocked roller.  I just wish they'd had the whole clip covered with the plate so it wouldn't leave the lines in my hair and I wish they'd find a way to make a smaller unit.
The good:- Strong tight curls faster than any curlers I've used before.- The clips hold the curlers in place.- There are enough curlers to do an entire head of hair in one "batch."- The curlers heat up quickly.- The product is not overpackaged -- nice for us tree-huggers.The bad:- The curlers aren't very big so the curls were too tight for me.- Although the clips grip the hair well, they do leave dents, particularly on the top of my head. (I have fine hair.)- The curlers heat up in a couple of minutes, but they continue to get hotter.- There is no automatic shut-off. That makes it rough for someone who always worries about leaving something on when leaving the house.- I had to pick up each curler by its clip, squeeze the clip to release the curler onto the counter, and then pick up the curler from the counter. The clip on the curler in the unit makes it look neat and tidy, but it adds an extra step.- The heating elements are obviously quite hot, but they are also easily accessible by little fingers. They are not recessed very far. I don't think I'd want this product around children.- The unit is very large and takes up a good part of a bathroom counter.
I had high hopes for this set of rollers, but they didn't impress me.  I will qualify this by saying that I have exceptionally long hair that is difficult to curl.  Even with the length and texture of my hair, however, I can usually get a decent curl that last as least a couple of hours.  With these rollers my curl looked beautiful when I first took them out, and then it completely fell out within minutes.  I was really disappointed.  Maybe someone with shorter, less difficult hair would have better luck, but for someone with difficult to curl hair, this product is not the best solution.  (It seems sleeping on sponge rollers is still the best solution for us.)
When you purchase this you receive 1 oz. which is supposed to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, improve the overall appearance of the skin with a safe effective formula.  It has Argireline which is supposed to relax facial muscles.  I looked up all the other ingredients and they are either similar to the Argireline or humectants which attract moisture to the skin, or emulsifiers used to mix the ingredients.  This is for sensitive skin, but nearly all the ingredients are things that could cause reactions, so use it with cautions.This looks like white grease.  I have been using it twice a day nearly every day for the past month.  I think that it has helped the creases around my mouth a little bit, but I can't tell that they helped the lines around my eyes at all.So looking at the price, I am just not convinced that I would pay for what I am seeing from using the cream every day.  I just don't think that I am seeing enough of a change to make it worth the price, but then I don't really mind my wrinkles all that much.  If you do, you might try a jar just to see if it works for you, but don't expect miracles.
Like so many creams and lotions, it is really hard to see a difference.  Clinical tests measure things the naked eye cannot so technically it might make a difference but I can't see it. It is a rather heavy cream so I seem to use more of it than I do with lighter creams.  It seems to pull a bit going on even though I mist my face before applying.  It is ok but not anything special.
As advertized this cream doesa good job moisturizing.  It leaves no residue on sheets, pillows, clothes, etc.  I have not seen any evidence of antiwrinkle-ing.  Unfortunately still have all my wrinkles.
First let me say this is decent morning and evening cream that moisturizes without leading to breakouts. With another name-brand cream, I had the breakout issue to deal with. However  think carefully about the claim of reducing the appearance of fine lines. What this means is that this cream makes wrinkles less noticeable. It does not eliminate or reduce them.When I use this cream I feel like I look healthy, perhaps a bit younger, but the wrinkles are still there. I like this cream but it is not a panacea and is quite expensive. For this reason, I will use and enjoy the jar I have, but I will not be ordering more. If money is not object for you, you might want to continue to get this, but for me, the price and the unremarkable results mean that one jar is enough.
Like lots of 40ish women I am a bit of a face cream junky.  I have used a lot of different creams that promise to do everything but clean my kitchen.  And we all know that almost none of them live up to their promises.  When I tried Hydroxatone I was already a consistent user of moisturizers and AHA's.  The jar is almost comically small and when you open it, the amount of cream is smaller still.  The smell was not over powering.  The cream did feel a little sticky on my skin but that feeling passed.  Hydroxatone did not improve my skin.  I did not notice improvements in wrinkles, tone, or coloration.  However, I also did not notice my skin getting worse.  This means that Hydroxatone worked as well as my current regimen of creams and AHA serum.  So it's not a bad face cream.  My previous regime was cheaper so I will stick to that.
not great not bad but I can't tell any difference from the other anti wrinkle cream I was using. I guess if it was your first you could see a difference. My skin wasn't dried out by using it I just couldn't tell a difference.
I didn't care for this moisturizer that much, works ok, but the smell was a little off for me and I didn't see the miraculous results the ad proclaimed.  I didn't notice much difference in my wrinkles eaither, but then, it will take more than a miracle to overcome the ravages of aging!! Can't blame the product for that. Its an ok moisturizer.
This cream feels really good and goes on with no problem as a night cream. But as a day cream under foundation it tends to come through and give you a shiny oily look and make your face feel greasy. So I use it at night and there is no oily feeling upon awakening in the morning. As for the anti wrinkle affect it might be more affective if it was an oil-free base where you could utilize it during the daytime but it's not quite there. This might be good for someone that has really dry skin that is not sensitive to the hydroxatone formula. For that reason and for that price I've had better luck with other brands I could use in the daytime that were more economical and when this is gone I think I will switch back to my tried and true good ole standby as I really see no outstanding results from this free trial. Just cannot justify the cost with the effects, or lack of.
I had previously reviewedHydroxatone Hydrolyze Intensive Under Eye Treatmentand found it to be a most excellent product which lived up to its promises.With theHydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex for Sensitive Skin, however, I am not nearly as impressed.The white cream is smooth as silk when applied to the face and neck in the morning and in the evening.  I noticed my face is firmer, plump - as if a hydration fairy visited me during my sleeping hows.So as a moisturizer, it's absolutely FABALOUS but as a anti-wrinkle cream, not so much.  During the time I've used this, I've witnessed no evidence that my visible wrinkles on my forehead and along my cheekbones have faded - as promised by this product.  Yet, in all fairness, I will say I've not noticed any new wrinkles so it is doing at least half of what it should.I've rated this product based on my experience.  However, please take my stats, which will follow, into consideration when using this review for the purposes of deciding whether or not to purchase this product:  39 years old, married, mother of four; smoker; resides in Tennessee; and is frequently outdoors during Spring, Summer, and Fall; seldom uses sunscreen.  -- Hopefully those private facts will help you to better compare my life to your own and whether Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex is the right choice for you.
I have been using this for approximately two weeks now.  My face has held in more moisture with this 10-30 degree weather than with any other lotion I have tried so far.  It's light and creamy, I love it's texture.  It's not greasy and rubs into the skin beautifully.  It seems to fill in locations when you first apply it.  I haven't seen a diminshed look on any of my face wrinkles yet.  I am hopeful byt the time I finish the container I will have some improvement in the fine lines around the eyes and mouth.
I have very sensitive skin that is also oily so when I saw this product especially made for my skin type, I decided to try it. While I have had no reactions to the anti-wrinkle complex, which is great, I am not sure about it minimizing my wrinkles. However, I have only been using a week, so will check back and update.UPDATE: I have seen no visible reduction of wrinkles in the 3 weeks I have been using it. Other, less expensive products out there work better.
I received this AM/PM Anti Wrinkle Complex w/ spf15 Hydroxatone from amazon on the vine and have been using it for about 2 wks. It is a very thick moisturizer and does seem to go a long way. If you tip the container upside down nothing would come out. I've tried other anti wrinkle moisturizer's before and have sensitive skin. I could never use Oil Of Olay products, my face always had a bad reaction to them. Before trying this I was using Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle cream w/ retinol and it took me a while to get so that my face could tolerate the retinol, it had a burning effect and I had to gradually work up to using it as directed. Having said that, I was able to use this straight out of the jar without any problems or sensitivity to my skin. I used it as directed in the am & pm. Under my makeup I did feel like it made my face look shiny and definitely had to use my loose powder, which I use anyway so it didn't really create any extra steps. The one thing I did notice however that when used under my makeup in the am it made my mascara run so I would suggest it more so at night or during the day if you don't wear makeup or don't put to close around the eye area which kind of defeats the purpose about minimizing fine lines. I also noticed several days when I had it on under my makeup that my eyes sometimes started tearing and felt as if they were burning. I'm guessing I got it too close to my eyes or somehow a little bit worked its way in and if felt as if I got soap in my eyes. I didn't think I put it close enough for that to happen but nonetheless it did happen. I did feel that it made fine lines look less noticeable when wearing the hydroxatone but after washing make up off and before applying it again, I really didn't notice much difference. Having looked at the price I definitely think there are others out there that are just as good for less than half the price. So yes it's a good moisturizer, as far as wrinkles go it is definitely no miracle cure,(although face appeared smoother with the cream rather than without) as far as price goes you can find similar products that work just the same for much less.
First thing you will notice is that the container is far larger than included product, with its first (and largest) ingredient being water. Keep that in mind as you shop products.While the product has a smell I did not personally care for, it was not offensive by any means; but some say I am hyper sensitive to smell.  As a moistuirizer, the product works great.  Fine lines seem to dissapear with consistent application whereas larger wrinkles soften.  Believe it or not, I use this for clients during photoshoots because it does not leave an oily sheen(to avoid post processing skin when possible).  However, I found this to be the case only while the product is applied.  Stop applying the product, even after a month of consistent application, and wrinkles appear again.  Not unexpected I might add.Overall, the product is decent but not exceptional in consideration of price point. For my client photo shoots, I will probably go back to using far less expensive mositurizers.
Not for the eye area. Every time I put it on, it would seep into my eyes and sting. Seems ok otherwise. Better for other areas.
The container this anti-wrinkle cream comes in is very nice. It looks beautiful, but it is very deceptive, it makes it seem as if there is much more in the container than there really is. I also am always amazed at expensive products whose first ingredient is water, which is what this has.I have to admit this feels the nicest and blends in the smoothest of any cream I have used; but strangely it reminds me of ponds cold cream which worked just as good as this as far as results go. That makes this at least 10 times the cost of what I have used before, which I really cannot fathom paying for, for a bit more smoothness in application.UPDATE>After a few months, the cream turned rancid and smelled terrible. It should have an expiration date. I guess they assume everyone will use this up before a few months time?
Always eager to try something new and different I looked forward to using this Conair dryer despite the fatc that I couldn't be happier or more pleased with my T3.Have to say that T3 is still tops with me.  This Conair is really heavy, at least for me.  And, it is bulky.  While described as foldable, I don't see how without breakage.The Conair  does have several nice features namely the retractable cord and the removable filter.  My hair is short and fine so a concentrator is important to me and I didn't find this one allowed for the precision styling that my former dryer did.
I love my sharper image ionic travel hair dryer, which bends at the handle and it's pretty light, plus it dries faster but not very loud.I was excited to try the Infiniti, which is also ionic and has a retractable cord, but it doesn't bend at the handle, and it's heavier. I guess it makes sense, since it's not meant to be traveled with, but rather, just easier storage with that type of cord. So basically, here are my reviews:Pro: It can be pretty (for someone who likes hot pink, but not me), has good variety of controls such as high and low blow as well as separate controls for high temp, medium, and cool. It also has a "cool" button for you to hold for cool wind. The cord is convenient and saves space.Con: The cord snaps when it retracts, so you have to hold the cord while you push the retract button, otherwise it can be painful when you get hit by it. It's heavier than the one I already have, and it's louder.Update: Okay, so I found another big con. The cord is way too short if you have to plug into an outlet closer to the floor. And after using it, the plug would slightly lift off of the wall, making it look a bit dangerous.
This spa treatment is nothing more than a "do it yourself" simple pamper.  The average person will get the same effect if you apply a good moisturizer, throw on a pair of socks and gloves and you have smoothness.You will receive enough for two treatments, 2 socks, 2 gloves, and 2 exfoliating scrubbers.  The ingredient moisturizer is a mixture of Aloe, Jojoba, Avocado, and all the vitamins possible.This spa treatment is nothing more than a "do it yourself" simple pamper.

But with a 5.5 foot, the sock is snug and with about 1/2" more to stretch.  Gloves should fit most women.The exfoliator is to scrub your hands and feet before, but it is a very rough surface and is way too harsh especially for the bottom of your feet, which generally could use it.  The gloves and socks are to be kept on for 15 minutes.  Sure, the moisturizer is there, and you will experience a "dry moist" sensation.I also can't see a company going through the extra expense to manufacture gloves and socks just for moisturizer.  And these are sturdy gloves and socks.Alternative use if you already own the set:Pamper with the product, it's good!  The socks and gloves are both made of durable material, so use the socks for walking around or with your sneakers.  Take the gloves and do the white glove test on the furniture.  Rizzo
SpaSensials Hand and Foot Treatment System claims to provide the the Moisturizing and Conditioning one can receive at a spa.  However, after the two treatments that I used, I found that the effects of the treatment barely lasted ten minutes.Initially, the first sensation when you put these gloves and socks on is a nice, cooling sensation that really does feel beneficial.  The effect lasts about two minutes before as the directions state you need to begin massaging your limbs to fully absorb the moisturizing lotion contained in the material.  Unfortunately, for me that means work that I don't feel like doing especially if I'm looking for a "spa-like" experience.  However, I followed the directions and did this not to receive the repeat nice, cooling sensation on initial contact, but quite brusque sensations of the material that these gloves and socks are made of.  The gloves and socks are made of medium spongy material, not very comfortable.  In the ten minutes that was suppose to be a comforting, relaxing treatment, I massaged and tried to reinvigorate the material to once again feel the sensation of the initial contact.  No such luck.  It never rematerialized.In all, my hands and feet felt smoother after removing the items 20 minutes later as the box suggested.  However, it only took 5 minutes or less of walking around and washing my hands once to remove any proof that I had just spent the past 30 minutes attempting to moisturize these body parts.  Not worth it.  If you want a truly spa treatment, in this case, take the money and get a manicure/pedicure.  You would have better luck there and someone else does the massaging :)
As a girly girl I am always looking for the latest way to pamper myself; and if it's easy on the wallet and not that time consuming, then all the better.Tonight I decided to try this on both myself and my husband.  My hands and feet get regular TLC and are in pretty good shape.  My husbands hands and feet are the opposite end of the spectrum and need all the TLC they can get.Step One/Package One: The cleansing and exfoliating pad.  Simply moisten the pad and with the smooth cleansing side clean the feet.Step Two/Package One: With the rough bumpy side of the pad you exfoliate and scrub the feet.Step Three: RinseStep Four: DryStep Five/Packages Two and Three: Put on the lotion lined socks and gloves.Wait at least 15 minutes, remove gloves and socks, rub in excess lotion and you are done.The package contains enough for two hand and feet treatments.  The smell was very clean and fresh, not at all overpowering or floral, much to my husband's relief.  The cleansing felt nice, but when using the exfoliating side it was a little painful.  It was tolerable on the heels and balls of the feet but on the sensitive arch and on the top of the foot it wasn't at all that pleasant.The socks and gloves fit nice and snug on me and with a little extra oomph I was able to wrestle them on my husband.  After removing them and massaging in the lotion, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it was absorbed into the skin.My hands and feet feel soft, but I am not overly impressed with the product; it really didn't slough off any dead skin.  My hands and feet just feel like I spent a little more time and effort with the moisturizer today.  The price is nice and the time it takes to complete the steps is great.  But overall I think you'd get the same benefits with some lotion and socks you already have in the home.
I tried this and even left it on longer than stated on the package. The buff is nice, it has a rough side for exfoliating and a smooth side to cleanse, this works well and the rough side is rough enough to exfoliate.The foot sock has a moisturizer inside but if you have bigger feet I think you may have a hard time putting them on the cuff is not stretchy enough,I wear a size 6 and had no real problem but I think a larger size would have to maybe cut a slit in the side to insert the foot. As for the moisurizer I think it should have been richer and more plentiful, it just didn't seem like there was enough moisturizer there. My feet felt a little better but not as good as I had expected.The gloves are fairly comfortable to wear but here again I don't feel the moisturizer was rich enough nor plentiful enough my hands felt softer but I can do that by rubbing hand cream on them. Unless the product is changed I don't feel there is enough benefit derived from the gloves and footies.
The idea behind this product is a good one.  The package comes with four treatments: an exfoliating scrub sponge, footies and gloves with lotion inside to moisturize dry skin.  First, I hated the gloves. Imagine sliding your hands into a pair of gloves filled with goo.  Unpleasant.  A bottle of hand cream would do as much, and you can control how much you use at one time.The scrub/sponge was very nice, and I wish they sold it separately as I would use it on a regular basis.  It created a good lather and the firm/rough side rubbed off dry skin without being overly abrasive.  The scent was mild.  I also liked the footies - they didn't turn me off as much as the gloves.  I find it difficult to put lotion on my feet. I always end up with some on the rug, or sofa, and I feel trapped in position until it dries.  The footies keep the moisture in and I can move about freely.  I put them on after using the sponge and left them on for 30 minutes.  My feet were softer after, though I think it would take several treatments to get the results the product advertises.  I didn't notice any stinging or burning sensation, as another reviewer did, but that could be an allergic reaction.  Customers should check the ingredients, or avoid if they have exceptionally sensitive skin.  Also note, I wear a size 7 1/2 women's shoe and the footies were snug.  I don't think they would fit a person with larger than an 8 or 8 1/2 size shoe.As it is, I dislike the gloves enough not to buy this product since they would be wasted.  However, the footies with sponge are available without the gloves and I would pirchase that.
Overall this is a good product.  I like that it came with the gloves/socks that are dispossable.  I felt that the treatment itself didn't leave my hands/feet as soft and smooth as I would have thought it would.  Other products that I have used have done a better job.  This product was good, but not the best I have used.  Depending on the price, not sure if I would purchase this product.
Hands really do give the age game away and also take such a battering in life - from every day tasks, and from the elements. And if your job involves having to handle harsh chemicals without the protection of rubber gloves, then you've got to give them extra attention for sure. Plus me living in the dessert isn't helping at all.I will first start with the `Moisturizing & Conditioning Hand Gloves' that is designed with this special stretchy moisture barrier and a moisture retainer that bring relief to dry, rough, callused hands (which I don't have). I did what was instructed of me and went over 30 minutes because the gloves felt really good. I even wiggle my fingers time to time to get the extra juices flowing. Once I got them off it was very disappointing. My hands were soft but the sensation of my hands felt more like dry moisture and I didn't like that. Next I did my feet and started with the `Exfoliating Buff' and that work really well on both ends. I don't think I would recommend it on your hands because the material is just too harsh unless your hands are simply that ruff. After that I put on `The Moisturizing & Conditioning Foot Socks' was made of the same material and requested the same time frame. I had no problem slipping on those booties being that I wear a size 7 1/2. The result of this turns out to be just the same as my hands. At the end of the day it turns out that I still had to apply lotion on both of them anyway.I believe you can get better products over the shelves with this stuff. My remedy is this: Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize. It's done every night before going to bed, and after washing my hands throughout the day. If your hands are in a bad way, then one remedy is to rub olive oil or Vaseline into them and then put on a pair of "moisturizing gloves," or thin cotton gloves, before going to bed. An omega-3 supplement might help if your hands are particularly dry, and Shea butter is also reported to be good for very dry hands.Being that I live in the state of Neveda I generally were sandals almost 7 months out of the whole year so I'm already a custom on keeping my feet moisturize and pretty. "SpaSensials Intensive Moisturizing & Conditioning Hand and Foot Treatment System" isn't for me and there wasn't anything `Intensive' about the product. I like the fact that the lotion can work for me instead of me having to apply. The scent was also a plus along with the price that there asking for. Overall, thanks but no thanks; I rather stick to my own remedy which has consistently done wonders for me.
**For the Amazon Vine Program**I have to admit that after you use this product, you feet and hands are very smooth, but when you put the "mitts" on those certain body parts, it feels a bit uncomfortable. I would recommend this product for before or after a shower or bath.A very inventive product for fans of spa products and to make your skin oh so smooth.Katiebabs
The good:- The moisturizer smells OK. Some people will probably like its scent; for me, it was just OK.- It left my hands feeling somewhat softer than before I used it.The bad:- The moisturizer left my hands feeling sticky, even after it had dried. I had to wash my hands right away, which probably took away some of the moisturizer's effectiveness.- The socks were a bit difficult to get past my heels, and I wear a woman's size 8 shoe.- My hands and feet felt kind of gross while I had the gloves and socks on. It didn't really feel like pampering; I was happy to take them off when the time was up.The verdict: I wouldn't buy this product. I don't think it does anything special, moisture-wise.
I found this product usable and useful, but not compelling.It does what it claims reasonably well.  You get two pairs of moisturizer-laden gloves, two pairs of similar footies, and two lotion-imbued buffing/toning pads.Perhaps unlike the target audience of this product, I am male, and I found the gloves and footies both a little too snug.  I'm pretty small-boned for a guy, so I suspect that larger users will have trouble with these items.The gloves and footies worked as advertised, keeping their lotion contained (no leaks or seeping), even when I actively manipulated items with my glove-clad hands.The lotion is light, greaseless, and mildly scented.  It caused no reactions on my fragrance-sensitive skin.  The lotion itself was fairly light.  I felt like I would have been better served by a heavy lotion like a "body butter" since I would normally seek out a product like this during the driest/chapping periods of the winter.The buffer/toner is essentially a disposable loofah style sponge with lotion in it that is activated by wetting the sponge.  Excess lotion must be rinsed or wiped away afterwards.  I didn't see any real advantage to this component of the spa system, over using a loofah and a moisturizing bath-gel in the shower.  And then you wouldn't be throwing away a loofah and packaging after each use...The gloves are too cumbersome to really do anything useful, so my hands would do better with a short application of heavy body butter.The footies were my favorite part of this set.  If the lotion in them was heavier and the set consisted of just footies, I would rate this item higher.As it is, this may be a reasonable gift item for that hard-to-shop-for person, but nothing in it is stand-out,  other things will work just as well for buffing and moisturizing, and there's a LOT of throw-away packaging and materials.  So only 3 stars for an acceptable performance.
I've tried two of these spa treatment gloves and socks so far, and I'm pretty happy with them. They work the way they say they do; that is, they don't leak moisturizer out of them. I put on the socks and then slippers the first time and did some things around the house, and that felt a little squishy, so I put my feet up the second time and that felt better. However, all the product did stay within the socks and not get onto my slippers or carpets. The gloves worked equally well, and I was able to work a TV remote and flip magazine pages while wearing them. The results are not quite as nice as I get with my cotton socks and gloves, but then again, I only wore them for about an hour and not overnight, like with cotton. For what they are, they work well, and any pampering for feet and hands is probably a good thing.
This was just a so-so product for me.  I used it after soaking for a while in the tub, so that should have been a head start.  I like the exfoliating pad, but a nice pumice stone ($1.00 or so) does the same thing or better for me.The sock felt strange, not soothing.  I use baby petroleum jelly and the results are just as good ($2.00 or so)I do have a spa pedicure every two weeks, so it's not like I am unused to spa treatment. This one was not special in terms of softening, mosturizing or callus removal.I think there are better products for these on the market and less expensive products.
My review title tells my biggest complaint with this mascara.  In all my days of mascara wand wielding, I've never dealt with a product that is so prone to clumps and the dreaded tarantula eye look.  I'm chalking it up to the nature of the brush and my own lack of skill after using anti-clump mascara for so long.  A base prep coat really helps with this problem.Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this. I purchased the mascara in brown and love the color and how smoothly everything goes on (save for those darn clumps).  And this truly does have some incredible staying power that doesn't flake as much as the more expensive department store brands--awesome.So I suppose this is one of those reviews where the good and bad cancel each other out.  If you're good at putting on mascara, I recommend this.  If you're like, you might want to find another product.
This mascara is very light weight and subsequently doesn't give much volume. So, it isn't good for those looking to "extend" their lashes.  However, it doesn't clump, or smudge and the mirror on the side of the tube is nice. This would be good for women whose lashes are already long or for young ladies who are just starting to use make-up. The color is less dramatic than black, which also makes it nice.  It is a little on the expensive side for the amount/size of the tube, but if you've got sensitive eyes it is nice to have.This isn't for everyone, but for some it's just right.
Pros: The bottle for this product is the neatest thing. It has a mirror on the side so that you can apply mascara any time. It's a really cool yet simple idea. The product itself left my lashes soft to the touch.Cons: I didn't feel that it made my lashes as long or as thick as I like them to look. I also prefer black mascara but thought I would give this a try. This color would probably only work on someone with blond or very fair lashes.  Otherwise, the color lacks impact.
The text is simple and restricted to the name of the mascara.  Difficult to tell what is unique about it and why I should buy it.  The bottle is slender and small and would fit nicely in a small purse.  The mirror on the back side is a nice touch, the perfect size and effective for applying mascara on the go.The brush is fairly standard, though the pile is on the thicker side.  The chocolate color is also pleasant, but standard.  The liquid appears to be a little bit clumpy.  The combination of the thicker pile of the brush and narrower opening of the bottle causes the mascara to build up on the outside edge of the opening, as the brush is plunged in and out during application.The product however, coats the eyelashes nicely.  There are few, if any clumps, and the lashes are separate.
As a nursing mother, I was thrilled to try this product...because we all know the stomach is not the only place a mother gets stretch marks. I think the idea is great, and of course the ingredients used are wonderful for pampering the skin, but I have two complaints that detract from the success of this product.First, the smell is rather unpleasant; it is reminiscent of reconstituted lemon juice. In other words, it has a very tangy scent that begins to grate on the nerves after a few minutes.Second, and more importantly, this product is treacherous for the clothes! The spray nozel delivers a hard blast of product that bounces off the hands and onto clothes. Being that this is a very oily product, your great skin might come at the cost of ruined clothing.This is a product that you must rub in very well in order to safeguard clothing, and furthermore, be sure to wash your hands well immediately after.While I think extended use of this product would likely deliver on its promise to prevent/reduce stretch marks, I think the scent and overly oily nature of it are unattractive "side effects."
My husband got this product for me. I liked the spay dispenser on this product, it made for easier and more uniform coverage when applying.  When it soaked in it felt very moisturizing, however since it is an oil you do have to be careful to make sure it is well absorbed before getting dressed.  I thought the lavender fragrance was a bit overpowering and lasted for most of the day, but I had friends who thought it smelled great.  I would recommend this product only to someone who really likes and doesn't mind smelling like lavender.
Not too greasy feel when you apply it to the body.  It is not very thick as it dispenses in a spray bottle.  Good in a way that you don't have to scramble for the cap  to close it every time (as you know oil is difficult and nasty to clean when spilled).The smell is nice and subtle.  Wife's stretch marks had improvements but did not disappear.  It is probably best during pregnancy and not after stretchmarks are already there.  It is also a good oil for massages.Expensive, I consider a good price for a 4 oz for this type of oil to be under 15 bucks.
This oil feels very thick and covers your skin nicely with lots of miniaturization. I have my doubts about it getting rid of stretch marks, but maybe it would be useful for preventing them, if you use it very regularly.There is a warming sensation when I put it on and the scent is quiet strong. Definitely a very "feminine" product. I am not pregnant, but I have "stretch marks" from gaining and losing weight on my belly and around my waist. I probably won't buy this product at the store because I don't love it due to the strong scent and the price, but I don't dislike this product either. I have dry skin and it makes me feel good when I put it on. (I normally use the all natural pure almond oil from whole foods).Again, I'm not sure how well it'd work with what it claims to be used on, but as a moisturizing oil it's not bad.
To be fair this is the first time I have used anything like this, so I really don't have anything to compare it to.  I am also only 28, so I don't really have too many skin problems, but I thought why not.  So both my wife and I read the directions and tried it out.  First off it was nice that it actually came with the batteries and the directions were easy to follow.  So we put on one of the pads and tried it out, it felt a little strange and after it was done both of us agreed that our skin was burning a little.  But it was really clean feeling and actually squeaked when we rinsed it.  Neither of us really noticed our skin looking significantly better, but as I said before it is not all that bad to begin with.  So, I guess if you are looking for a unique way to clean your face or if you have skin blemishes that you want to try to lessen this is an option, but for me it really didn't do much.
My wife was the main user for this product, and liked the feeling, but doesn't think it lives up entirely to the hype.First of all, the packaging was nice, and it was a nice touch that they decided to include batteries.  The cleaning puffs work very well and leave skin feeling fresh.  It is nice that there are different vibration levels, as the highest level felt a bit too much for my wife, but when I tried it was just right for me.  It is a very nice to have this treatment available on a daily basis, which does feel like it cleanses pores and cleans off dry skin.  The only concern my wife raised about the design is that the circular base works well enough but is not easily adaptable to the chin and the upper lips and other curvy areas of the face.Does it really remove wrinkles and age spots?  It may be too soon to tell but after a few weeks it doesn't seem to be making much of a difference.  While it's not magic, the skin rejuvenator does leave skin feeling, well, rejuvenated and fresh.  If nothing else, that's not a bad way to start the day.
This product is an enhancement to the rub and scrub method.  It is a nice little perk, but remember,  that once the pad supply is gone, you need to purchase more!!  The Neutrogena Wave cleaner is relatively inexpensive, but you will pay in the long run for the refills.The cleaner is not to be used around the eye area, so what that means to me is that I need to get another cleaning pad or a washcloth to do that area.  So I am back to doing two steps again.  There isn't a lot of soap sud in the pad, but it is easily changeable.With a vibrating cleaner, going up and down, round and round, I get the feeling like I am shaving!  Although the cleaner is "pretty in pink", it makes it easy to locate when you need it.For the long run, skip it.  Like I said,  I don't like using it, then switching to a manual effort and cleaner for the eye area.....Rizzo
This product is OK.  It is nice that it comes with the AA battery needed.  Cleansing pads are also included.  I suppose this is nice for traveling as it is compact.  I don't think this is a good product for everyday use, however.  It really does not have much power.  It claims it will leave skin soft but I did not find any difference.  I can't recommend this one.
The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser provided a reasonable clean in a compact, battery powered package.The ProsThe package is small and portable.  I enjoyed the fact that I was able to pack it for travel without it taking up a ton of space.  The replaceable pads are also small and water activated.  The vibration is mild and provides a comfortable, gentle cleansing for the face.The ConsThe lather produced was not sufficient for me.  I like more lather for a deep cleanse, or the "power" cleanse promised by the name of the product.  I didn't feel that this product provided a better cleansing than I would get from an old fashioned sponge and bar of Neutrogena cleaner. Therefore, this is not likely a product that will become a staple for me.
The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser is designed to clean the grime from your face... and that it does!  The vibration sent from the device is not rough and the pads feel good on the skin.  I wasn't sure if there was a particular direction that the pads should be placed which caused me to alternate sides until it created suds.  Once I got it started it felt nice until the solutions started making my face burn.  I really don't have sensitive skin so I don't understand why it felt that way.  All in all, I would use it sparingly because it left my skin feeling extra clean and wasn't drying at all.
The first thing I noticed about this item is that the cleanser doesn't suds up at all like what's shown on the commercials.  The vibration feels good on the face, but I'm not sure that my face feels any cleaner from using it.
Perhaps I didn't read the description of this product too clearly. For some reason I was under the impression that the cleansing head of the device rotated or moved in some way (I think the description of "gentle massaging action" gave me this idea). Instead what the set consists of are pads saturated with cleanser that are placed on the device head, which vibrates. I am not sure what the vibration effect has other than temporarily stimulating blood flow to the skin. Other reviewers mention that they found it relaxing...I really did not.The product contained in the cleansing pads themselves was a somewhat effective, low lathering cleanser, which had a nice fragrance. It seems that using the pads manually would almost have a better effect that using them with the device. My skin felt smoother, but I'm not sure if this was the result of the pad texture or the cleansing product itself.In short, I would give four stars to the product, 2 stars to the battery operated device. If the pads themselves were available separately in a more hand friendly size, I *might* consider purchasing them in that way to use manually.
I recieved this though the Vine.This came with one double -A- battery, and two packs of small round cotton pads with neutrogena soap in them. The pads adhere to the top.I didn't care for the soap in the pads .This is water proof. I kept it in the shower.If your a Neurtogena soap user, you might like this face soap!It came with a $3.00 off coupon to buy more little pads with Neutrogena face soap in the pads.I think they want you to buy Allot more pads!My face feels a bit smoother after using this.All this does is have a viberating motion!The viberating of the wave power can be a bit strange at first, but after awhile you get use to it.I would like this better if there was some differnt type of brushes on this that moved around to be more of an exfoliant.I gave this to my Granddaughter, she thinks its just ok!
I really like the design. This is small, you can hold it well when cleaning. It came with a battery, which is a plus. I am somewhat disappointed with the lather however. The pads don't foam up very well unless you manipulate them with your fingers first. I have small pores and normal to dry skin. It was an ok moisturizer. Another use you may not think of?  I used it on my elbows and really, really liked it for them!
I purchased this as a backup to the Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser And the Neutrogena Total Skin Renewal devices which have been discontinued by Johnson & Johnson. After reading Wave reviews on Amazon going from 2008 until 2/2011, I wasn't sure what to expect:1. the pads foaming or not,2. skin reaction,3. really waterproof,4. worth it,5. if thing would last more then a monthI took the plunge its OK, it deep cleans, my skin looks wonderful, massaging vibrations relaxing as long as it just glides over chin and cheek bones and doesn't rest there to give you the shakes. Although it says "gentle enough for daily use" after 3 days, twice a day my face was very dry and had chemical peel "frost" that eventually peels off. The cleanser makes my skin crave moisturizer. So I use the Wave in the evening followed by a moisturizer, much better :)  I think my ten bucks delivered a good return. Reviews have me afraid to use this in the shower, contributing to it's early death, so I haven't!The Wave came with a refill coupon, the Neutrogena site ran out with no info about replenishment :( Finding reasonably priced refill pads is "interesting", even AMAZON "eligible for FREE super saver shipping" ones sold out quickly...sign up to be notified!Additional research calling BOTH Neutrogena AND Clean and Clear found:Pads - Wave Deep Clean = white w/cleanser that DO NOT foamWave Deep Clean Foaming = blue w/foaming cleanserWave Gentle Exfoliating = white w/orange microbeads (others have mentioned pink microbeads too)Wave Shine-free Blemish-free = light orange with 1% Salicylic Acid  (discontinued)Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser = lilac pads with 1% Salicylic Acid (discontinued)... use 3 times a weekTotal Skin Renewal = cream pads w/mushroom extract (discontinued) ... use 3 times a week. This is my FAVORITE for skin brightening, tone, smoothness and clarity. I'm sorry it's gone!***ALL pads are the same size (1.57 inches/40mm DIAmeter)Web research: - you can find the refill pads from various sources at various, usually expensive prices (beyond SEVEN BUCKS) - some packages are WITHOUT the attachment head- inner bags of the pads are not always labelled and/or don't have expiration date info- there are knock-offs and/or valid generics that are showing up.- packs of SEVEN turning up In-store refill pad packs are 20, 24, 28, 30...14s usually come with starter kits.When it comes to my face, I'm leery about entrusting it to someone making a fast buck. Just be careful!
The product description claims that the Neutrogena Wave deep cleans and removes dirt and oil from deep within pores. No product can do that, but certainly a surface scrubber can't, regardless of how much it vibrates.For what it is -- a cleansing pad attached to a small vibrator -- this product is fine. There's no reason to spend the money it costs, though, when you can get the same results with any good cleanser.The pads are not too rough; the exfoliation they provide is gentle (as it should be). It was hard to work up a lather just by running water over the pad, but smooshing it with your fingers under the water and then attaching it to the vibrator works pretty well. The pads are scented; the scent is pleasant and not at all overpowering, but this product would not be a good choice for someone who is allergic to fragrances.I did not find this product relaxing, nor did using it feel like pampering in any way. It's just a vibrating face cleaner.Overall, I'd say this is just a gadget. No one needs it, but if you really want to use it, you're probably not going to do too much damage to your skin.
Pros:The Neutrogena wave power cleaner does fit nicely in your hand.You can use it in the shower and it does get very sudsy.The disposable pads are a nice touch. I use Neutrogena cleanser anyway, so it's a convenient format.My face did feel soft after use.Cons:I almost broke a nail getting the battery cover off. It is VERY un-user-friendly.All it does really is vibrate mildly. You still have to move your hand around to distribute the cleanser.The pads go on the cleaning head well enough, but I can imagine enough use would render the velcro-like head fuzzy enough to be unusable.All in all, I think better products are out there for a full facial experience. Personally, I think I will stick to Bufpuf pads or a washcloth.
Overall Thoughts:I was pleased with the pink color of the handheld cleaner, however, size wise, it was a bit too short, and hard to grip/hold onto.  Batteries were included in the box, so that was helpful.  Further, there was a large supply of 14 cleansing pads to use, which would last me several weeks at least.  The cleansing pads were easy to apply and stick onto the device, and the pads had a clean, and refreshing smell.Operation:I wasn't very pleased with the operation of the cleanser.  It wasn't very effective in removing all the makeup, and further, it didn't feel particularly soothing during use.  In fact, it felt jarring.  It made no discernible differences in skin appearance, however, at least no residue was left on the face.Final Thoughts:The wave cleanser might be more convenient to bring along than say makeup remover + cotton balls on a business trip, but the wave cleanser was big and chunky and took up room in the suitcase.  I definitely wouldn't buy this product.  It seemed to do a worse job than cotton balls + makeup remover, which are vastly cheaper, and no less convenient.  I guess if you must have an electronic gadget to remove your makeup, you could get this.
The Neutrogena Wave Power Cleanser is a petite, battery-powered facial cleanser that can go into the shower with you (a real plus) and provides a light vibration and foaming action for your skin.My experience with "the Wave" was quite variable.  I absolutely love the shape and size (tiny enough to be comfortable and easy to use even for my very small hands) and the color (hot pink).  I dislike the fact that the pad must be discarded after a single use and that the extra pads provided in the starter kit do not come in a resealable pouch.  I keep my Wave in the shower--so where exactly do I keep an opened, unsealed bag of foaming cleanser heads where they won't get wet and yet will be convenient to take one off the wave and put on a fresh one every time I shower?  So far, I haven't found a good answer.All in all, it is a cute little product, but I can get equally good (and perhaps better) results using my Buf-Puf Gentle Facial Sponge - 1 ea, 2 Packs and a little soap.
This is a fairly light, not-too-greasy oil that's mildly moisturizing, but not that much more. It has a fairly pleasant, herbal scent, to my nose. And that's about all I can say. I don't believe for a minute that it can prevent or fade stretch marks (which are genetic, and which mostly fade on their own, anyway). I don't really have any scars, so I was unable to test that theory.I've also read on some sites that some people use this to treat acne. That seems extremely counterintuitive to me -- if you have oily, acne-prone skin, the LAST thing it seems you should do is put more oil on your face. This may help with very dry skin or with wrinkles, to an extent.
Bio Oil is okay, I guess, although I can't say it really lived up to its claims. I didn't notice any improvement in my skin, although it didn't feel bad wiping this stuff on my face. It's a little greasy, though, sort of like baby oil, and takes its time drying. It's not something I think I'd buy, but it may have more effective results over the long haul and can't be adequately judged when you used casually.Brian W. Fairbanks
If my skin had tolerated the different oils that were used to make this product, I'm sure that this would have been in more of the 4 star range.  I was excited to try this as it seemed like a good multi-use oil, good for aging skin, discolored skin, scars, stretch marks, skin that had been out in the sun and also as a bath oil, alas, after trying it twice I found it gave me a weird itchy feeling on my skin and turned it a bit red.  I'm not generally one that has especially sensitive skin, so I can only assume that I am mildly allergic to one of the oils used in the product.  I was seriously bummed.....I liked the product until I had the mild reaction to it.  It went on kind of oily but soaked into the skin readily and felt great on the back of my hands which take a beating between the harsh soap at work and the cool air of winter.  The scent was very nice.  Not too perfumy, it had a slightly sweet lavendar scent.  I tried it twice, but the itchy feeling persisted and I had to stop.My husband, has dry hands and is continuing to use the product and felt like it was working for him, thus the three stars.  We liked it, but unfortunately, the plant extracts did not agree with my skin, so maybe this is not the best oil for those with somewhat sensitive skin.As for 3 months, I'm sure if you continue to use an oil based product readily and with some consistency you certainly would see results in the suppleness of the skin, that I don't doubt.  As for the claims of reducing the appearance of old scars and the like, well, that definitely would need some further review.All in all, a decent product but I would not recommend if you have sensitive skin.
This product is not all natural so don't let the name fool you, others have listed the ingredients so I don't feel the need to repeat it. It contains mineral oil so it is very greasy, it does absorb mostly into the skin but it still has a slightly greasy feel. There is too much perfume in it for my tastes.It does relieve dry skin but I have not seen any real imporvement in my skin so far (for wrinkles and fine lines). I think this may be good for someone with severly dry skin but don't expect miracles.
As one who adores aromatherapy products and beauty aids, I found this one to be rather average. There is no delectable aromatherapy scent, and the consistency, which is rather like baby oil, may not be very appealing.When it comes to reducing scars, skin irritation, stretch marks and the like, some cheap African shea butter is more effective and less expensive.
Bio-Oil contains basic ingredients needed for your skin, like Vitamins A and E.  The calendula, lavender, rosemary and chamomile oils are primarily for a light not un-pleasant scent.  I decided to try Bio-Oil over a 14-day period (event though it recommends several weeks).  There were four places I applied Bio-Oil twice a day for three minutes.  One was where I had old white scar-scratch on my arm from my cat, one was a wide old scar on my leg, another was a splotchy spot on my face from too much sun and the last was on my neck where I have a little bit of stretch marks.  The older scars (thin and thick) on my arm and leg did not change in appearance at all.  The little stretch mark on my neck and the splotchy spot on my face actually did show improvements in appearance.  The little stretch lines disappeared and my face has a more even appearance.  I was concerned about my face, as I break out easily, but Bio-Oil did not cause any breakouts.The bottle is more than half empty but I'll continue to finish it off on the two spots and seemed to get some good response.  If you use this product during pregnancy for stretch marks, you would definitely go through several bottles.  There is no doubt that it helps tremendously with moisturizing your skin.
I've used BioOil for a month now and have not seen tremendous results. I put it on some problem areas with mild cellulite and stretch marks and have not seen change. That said, these areas have been problematic for a while, and it may be that newer skin problems would respond more readily.It does make my skin soft and has a pleasant fragrance and is not overly greasy. It's not bad for a body oil, but I'm not sure it does what it claims to do. However, I think massaging it into your skin is not going to do any harm, and would probably be nice for pregnant skin.
Applying this oil is like applying baby oil and it has the same consistancy, but dries much faster. The smell is subtle and pleasant. My hands tend to get dry, have spots and look old, so I decided to compare the results between this and my cheap generic vitamin E cream. I used the oil on my left hand and the vitamin E cream on the right. After two weeks, I can't tell the difference. If that changes, I'll post an update. Overall, I like the oil, but I'll probably stick with my usual cream because it works just as well and is cheaper.
Bio-Oil claims to reduce the appearance of scars, stretch marks, uneven skin tone, aging skin and dehydrated skin with use over the course of 3 months.  Does it live up to the claims? After using it for 10 days, the answer is it's too soon to tell, but it's promising.It has the consistency of oil and a pleasant smell, a cross between tanning oil and massage oil.  It's packaged in an easy to use bottle that with a couple shakes dispenses the perfect amount of Bio-Oil onto your palm.  A 60 ml bottle should last you at least 3 months depending on the amount of the applied skin area.So what happened after 10 days?  Well, it definitely hydrated dehydrated skin, though any oil or lotion could do that.  I didn't notice any effect on uneven skin tone, but the Bio-oil did appear to slightly soften and reduce the height of scar tissue and stretch marks.  However, used over the course of 3 months, it might have a visibly noticeable effect.  Is it any better than rubbing lotion or massage oil on your skin? Not sure.  Buy it and try it.
Although I have extremely sensitive skin, I decided to try BioOil in the hopes that it might work to help relieve the dryness of the skin on my legs.Upon using the oil, the first thing I noticed is that it is very thin in comparison to other moisturizers, and started out feeling greasy on my fingers. The slight oily sensation remained till after I had washed my hands. I used it for the first time at night, before going to bed in place of the moisturizer I usually use. In the morning, my skin seemed slightly less dry than usual, so I repeated the application of the oil. Unfortunately, by the end of the day, my fingers and the skin on my legs were itchy and slightly reddened. In my personal experience, this is the first signs of an allergic reaction.I must be extremely careful as to brands and types of lotions I can use. I have an atypical reaction to products that do not normally trigger allergic reactions in other people so I wouldn't necessarily regard my experience as typical or one to be expected in all users. Early indications looked a bit promising as it does moisturize and soften skin, but my regrettable response makes continued use of this product impossible.I believe that this product may serve those with less sensitive skin fairly well. However, if you have skin which is prone to react poorly to some moisturizers, you may want to reconsider this product.
This shampoo comes with a lot of claims and promise, and I was optimistic.  Like "ultra glossy sheen."  Unfortunately, after shampooing and conditioning, my hair lacks luster and has looked much shinier with other shampoos. The product is rather runny and doesn't deliver much in the suds department.  The fragrance is pleasant and not overwhelming.  And yes, my hair felt fairly smooth and not stripped at all after using.  I did follow up with a conditioner as my hair is very dry.  For reference, I am Caucasian with fine (but thick) color treated blonde hair.  After blowdrying and flat ironing, my hair was hardly shiny and, in fact, lacking in luster.Being a lover of all beauty supply stores, I was aware that Motions is a brand made for ethnic hair, but I'm game to try anything.  Love mixing up my hair routine, and do it constantly.  However, as another reviewer remarked for this price point, better shampoos can be had for less money.  The Suave Professionals line comes to mind.  Why spend more if you can achieve greater results by spending less?
I love the convenience of a 2-in-1 shampoo. Great for a quick wash after the gym. Though the product only recommend weekly use, I had no problem using it daily. I do find that I needed extra conditioning now that the weather is cooler and drier on my hair. This worked better in the summer months for me. The scent put me off at first because it smelled too 'sweet', but I got used to it and now don't mind it much.
Using this shampoo is nice but I haven't gotten very much improvement from it.This shampoo is designed for medium to coarse hair.The one issue I have with it is that it does not de-tangle my hair. Snarls usually accompany coarse hair.If the formula were to help unsnarl my hair I could rate it higher. I get much more beneficial results from Dove Moisturizing shampoo which leaves it so soft that I do not even need a separate conditioner.
I use less conditioner and my hair has body and easy to comb. I like the feel. I was not sure of the smell but with a conditioner I don't have the shampoo smell stay with me.  I think it is fine but not exciting.
I found, as a "tester", that this product was OK, for shampoos. I say "tester" because I have often tested and tried many different shampoos for the sake of reviewing(sort of like that "I play a doctor on TV but I am not one" line). This is an OK, usable shampoo for me. Motions at Home Lavish Shampoo suits the needs of my very fragile hair, which has been traumatized at times by some of the other products which I have tried.The only thing I must note which is odd is that this shampoo requires that you use it weekly.That is weird. Possibly it is because the target audience for this shampoo is not in my demographic.It also says if you get it in your eyes, it can be irritating and you should quickly wash it out with water. I DID have to do that! I am not crazy about that aspect because I had a cataract in my right eye which was removed last spring, around a half a year ago. I don't need irritations in my eye, which has a plain lens in it now.Finally, and this is even odder, it says it makes "lavish bubbles". It makes NO bubbles that I could see, possibly because I was trying so hard to keep my eyes closed but more likely because it simply ... MADE... NO... BUBBLES.And we do not have weird water.I gave the companion product to this, which you can see under conditioner pudding, same brand, higher stars.My brush went through my wet hair really well after using that.
Motions at Home Lavish Conditioning Shampoo is labeled for medium to coarse hair. It wasn't until I received my bottle that I found it's advertised for "women of color," which I'm not. Therefore, it may not have worked effectively because of my hair, though it is very thick and curly, so I'd expect it to work.I loved the smell, it's mild and not overly feminine, just nice and clean. Using just about 1 - 2 teaspoons I got far more lather than I expected. That aspect, again, I really liked. The rest of it, though, was nothing better than the shampoos I currently use.I skipped conditioner just to see how effective the conditioners within the shampoo worked. Skipping conditioner was a mistake. My hair frizzed as soon as it had dried completely. (I tend to let my hair dry naturally into whatever waves/ringlets it wants to form.)I did, however, have my husband who has fine, straight hair give it a shot. He doesn't use conditioner often, and he really liked it. Given that, I think your enjoyment of this shampoo depends on your hair type and typical procedure when it comes to your hair.UPDATE:I did try the shampoo with the anti-frizz conditioning cream. It makes a huge difference. Used together, my hair has never looked better. Curls are no frizzy and my hair feels amazing.
Unlike most shampoo/conditioner combos, this one did actually leave my hair conditioned so that I didn't need a separate conditioner.  However, I also felt that my hair was too weighed down and lifeless afterwards.  My son actually liked it for this reason, since he says regular shampoo/conditioner combos make his hair too fluffy, but I didn't care for it.  I wouldn't recommend it for hair like mine--untreated, medium thick, wavy hair.  It does say that it's for weekly cleaning, so perhaps it's meant for weekly nourishing between other cleansing.  Or perhaps it would work better on much coarser or more damaged hair.  For me, though, it's not a winner.
First, If you haven't read the fine print, this product is for African-american or ethnic type hair. If you're looking for something for fine, Caucasian type hair you're on the wrong page.With the word "foaming" in the description I expected something like shaving cream.  It has the consistency of  dish-washing detergent.  It works very well and leaves the hair soft. Doesn't stick to your  iron. Works best if you leave it on overnight.The scent is something like bug spray mixed with vitamins but it goes away eventually.
I have used several products in this Motions line. This wrap lotion like most of the others products a little goes a long way. I also think unlike most of the line this one actually works well for all hair types. I wrap my hair often to get a straight layered look framed around my face in the morning with/without hot irons and this helps in acheiving that look. My hair has some bounce and shine to it.
I prepared my hair as instructed and tried to  pump this product onto my hand, it fell short in the foaming department.I have used foams before and they are not so watery.  But with that said it is a pleasant smelling foamy substance. I combed it through my hair and it made it look nice, the only thing I had expected was a stiffer feel to my hair after it dried but it didn't.The bottle states this the ultimate hold which I find it did not live up to.
I read this product blurb and thought I would be applying it like a leave in styling gel "holds hair in place and helps it stretch as it dries for a beautifully soft style all day long. Will not stick to irons. Collagen amino acids provide flexible hold and control. Panthenol adds shine. Long-lasting formula holds wraps, wet sets and thermal styles yet combs out easily. Gives you natural-looking style that leaves hair soft and shiny."So I read the following directions with trepedation:first: "comb a generous amount evenly through hair, wrap hair and sit under the dryer until hair is completely dry. TIP: If you don't have a hair dryer, just blow dry hair and flat iron then style as outlined. Then comb out the hair wrap."2nd: "Moisturize hair and scalp with 'Motions Weightless Clear Hairdressing' to enhance shine and provide hair with weightless moisture."3rd: "Dab a small amount of 'Motions Shine Enhancing Pomade' on your fingertips and glide it down the strands concentrating on the ends of the hair."4th: "Add a final dose of shine with 'Motions Oil Sheen and Conditioning Spray'."5th: "lightly mist 'Motions Light Hold Working Spritz' on ends for invisible, natural-looking hold."That is a little bit much for me, so instead I have been using it before blow drying my hair and after flat ironing and it has been keeping the style several days longer than if I had only used a hairspracy or styling gel.When I get to the end of the bottle, I'll decide whether to continue or use another product.I have thick curly hair that is shoulder length that I also get regularly highlighted.
I used this after my shower to pull back my hair into a pony tail to keep flyaways down. For that purpose it works very well. What I didn't like is that after my hair dried it looked very dull and lifeless. When I brushed my hair back out, it was very flyaway and still dull looking.For reference, I have baby fine hair, which is wavy. I wouldn't recommend this for my hair type, though, it did work great to slick back hair for a pony tail.
Motions At Home Foaming Wrap Lotion, 8.5-Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of 6) ($22.50) did not do much for my dry hair. It did bring some shine and a bit of control. This is the kind of product I'd recommend you sample first before committing to 6 bottles. I was hoping it would live up to all its claims.
My daughter has coarse curly hair. We have been using Motions products to protect and improve her hair. The key to that is moisture and gentle treatment. We used this product after a blowout. We wrapped her hair to preserve the straight hair over night so she didn't end up with a head full of kinks. It did work well. The blowout was preserved. The style looked fine.But it was a little dry. And as the day wore on it looked drier and drier. Was finally used a little spray oil to keep it from puffing up. So it does work well but if you actually have dry curly hair, you might watch and see if you need to add moisture.The best thing for us about this product is that it has left my daughter preserve straightened hair from one day to another in a bun. She is a dancer and is is great not to have to redo the hair constantly. We use the wrap lotion and the spray oil and she still has a neat fuzz free bun.
Ok so first off I thought this might work on my hair which is very thin but it does not... however my grandaughter used it on her wild hair and it calmed it down so much I couldn't believe it was her hair :) First let me explain her hair .... very curly and thick and very runaway. Yup runawaqy it is always every which way but how she wants it :) She used this and it made her hair smooth down and looked very nice :)
The scent right out of the bottle is not great, but it goes away pretty much when the hair is dry. It didn't bother me too much, unlike some of the other Motions products I have tried.This lotion does not leave the hair stiff or sticky. The product provides good hold but was too drying on my hair. I felt like it needed lots of moisturizing afterwards.
This is a product you can use every so often if you want to create this particular style of curly. However, I found on the 2nd and 3rd day, the build up was just too much for my hair to handle. It created a nice hair of curly waves the first day,  fresh out of the shower with wet curly hair. I found it helped to get the frizzes under control. Great product for naturally curly hair.
This is good used with big rollers that straighten your hair.  But it's a bit drying.  I notice alcohol is the third ingredient in this product, so that explained the drying aspect.  The last thing I need on my hair is drying alcohol.  But it does what it says it does, which is straighten out your hair, even if you use rollers instead of wrapping.
I wish I had read the reviews better.  This is not made for my hair type.  I was over moisturized and super greasy.
Motions Foaming Wrap Lotion works well to help shape your hair when used with a heat product such as a blow drier or iron.  I don't particularly like the glossy look or even the feel of my hair after using it.  The scent is one that, I find, you will either love or hate.  I don't like the smell at all.  And, at over twenty bucks a bottle, it seems a little pricey.  Although, I know most higher quality items tend to be higher in price as well.  I'm just not sure if this meets the standard of higher quality.
One of my grandaughter's friends from college who spent the weekend here is of the group for whom this product is intended. I keep all kinds of products for my guests to have handy so I asked her if she wanted to try out this lotion. She gave it a try and said that it worked OK but the scent was not to her liking and she would not want to use it again. She said that she definitely would not make a purchase.
My daughter followed directions and it did what it claims to do. But, she found the scent not very pleasing and her husband couldn't stand the smell of it either.
Generally, I found the Motions brand to be really decent quality for its price. This was not the case with this product. this brand is marketed towards unruly African American hair, and although I have thick dark hair it is not as thick nor as dark as African American hair. Maybe this is the reason that the foam wrap felt sticky for my hair and made me immediately get in the shower and wash it off. I'm simply not a fan of this product, but to be fair, I've never tried any other foaming product, so it might just be my distaste of the foaming lotion rather than my dislike of this specific one (hence the 3-star rating).
This is a light-weight foam that works into your hair very easily.  It gives a hint of lift as you dry and style your hair.It has a pleasant smell which I can't quite put a name to and is not sticky or heavy on your hair.  It doesn't leave a residue on your curling iron.  If you are looking for a product to provide some lift and body, this will work for you.
Hey now this is a good product I got at Amazon this winter that does what it says it will!!  It is called Motions At Home Wrap Lotion and it smells good and holds hair good!!  NO matter the style you wear... curls, wrap, flat, waves, etc. you get a good hold for the whole day without that stiff feel to your hair.  No more helmet hair!  You got to try it to believe it does what it says so don't take my word for it; get you some from Amazon today for fast shipping.Motions At Home Foaming Wrap Lotion, 8.5-Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of 6)
I was impressed that this Motions at Home Foaming Wrap Lotion held as well as it did. Wrap lotions generally tend to be fairly hit or miss in terms of effectiveness. However, there are a few issues with the product.The smell is terrible. It's not so much a problem when it's in your hair, but it's one of those things where you spend an extra minute at the sink trying to get the smell off your hands so that it doesn't linger all day. It's not the end of the world, but I certainly don't advocate for using this product if that's an issue.This lotion is alright. It works, but there are certainly better options out there. If you're looking to keep your hair down, you'll be satisfied.
Well, this product did seem to work a bit in keeping a wave in my hair, but basically I just tried this for the heck of it and it's not even for us long haired guys.
First let me say that I am not a professional when it comes to wrapping my hair.  I cleaned and conditioned my hair with Silk Elements products that I normally use, then I followed the instructions on the wrap lotion and set my hair.  I did like the light sheen that it gave my hair, but that was about all I noticed.  I don't particularly like the scent.  It goes away after awhile, but I just don't like to have pronounced scents in my hair.  I think that it might smell funny with some perfumes.  I tried the product several times and I found that it needs to be clean every time you use it or you can get a bit of build up.  Some products do not react the same in my hair as they do others.  As with all hair products, this is one that might be worth trying, but I would not recommend this.
There is minimal control of style achieved and the foam is not reliably dispensed.  I do use it in conjunction with hair oil and it does not flake or get crusty at all.  I have tried using more, and it does not seem to help.  I have not used it with heat so maybe it works better then.
I tried this product on French braids.  They were beautiful, not super stiff, and shiny.  The hairdo stayed put all day without a flaw.  The scent was not pleasing at all, it was mild so it left quickly -good thing.  I have thin-med hair and wavy.  For the French braids, I ended up using a lot of this product.  At this rate, I'll only have enough product for a week.  The foam is like a runny mousse texture.  I don't think I'll be buying this product, it's not cost effective for me.I recommend to buy just a bottle and try it before ordering a pack of 6.  Test it and see if it works on your hair type and the style you're looking for.
I can't stand the crunch feeling of most wrap lotions. This one didn't leave my hair sticky or crunch. It was far from a miracle product for my hair though so I'll keep looking. Sigh
I tried this on my youngest daughter as she got out of the tub. Towel dried and applied two squirts. I did not comb her hair first as the product recommended.  After a quick blow dry her hair seems extra glossy and shiny.  She complained of the smell but that dissipated fairly quickly.  Her hair is not super fine but is shoulder length and blonde and often unruly.  When she woke up this morning her hair was not as messy and wild as it usually is.  I"ll have to update after a windy day of play...
This is a reasonably priced product at around 50 cents an ounce. There is nothing spectacular about it nor is there any negative feature that would preclude its use. It has a decent odor and performs a reasonably decent conditioning job. With so many conditioners on the market to choose from and with prices higher and lower than this product it is difficult to make a compelling case to select this particular brand. If you are a user of this brand's products you will probably be satisfied with this conditioner. Otherwise, if you are not a fan of this brand, you can find conditioners that work just as well, and some better, for a lesser cost.
This conditioner has the following core ingredients:Water, mineral oil, polyquaternium-32, glycerin, along with a list of other chemical ingredients, ending with trace amounts of honey, avocado oil, and hydrolyzed silk.It has a nice scent, not overpowering, not fruity.  Due to some of the ingredients (such as mineral oil), I would not recommend it as a conditioner for fine/thin hair.  As advertised, it is better suited for coarser hair types.After water, mineral oil is the main ingredient of this product.  Opinions vary on the use of mineral oil on hair.  Some experts say it can clog pores on the scalp, while other say that is an issue only with industrial grade mineral oil, and that cosmetic grade mineral oil does not clog pores.I found that this conditioner does add some "life" to hair.  It rejuvenates the coarser hair in our family, adding gloss and a bit of curl retention.  We haven't noticed any build up after several uses.  So hair looks natural, but not at all sticky or weighted down.The product directions say to leave it on your head for several minutes covered with a shower cap.  I tend to cut back any conditioner instructions, as I find using about half of what is suggested looks and feels better.  Others in my family use the product as recommended.I would rate this as a decent conditioner, nothing spectacular but not at all bad.
This is used as a deep conditioner but when I use it, it makes my hair feel heavy and coated. It's not a greasy feel but coated and that makes it seem thicker and fuller. That's good I guess if you have thinner hair but my hair is thick and coarse and this makes it a big fluffy mess. On the other hand, theMotions Hair Lotion, 12 oz.is one of the best products I've used on my hair and makes it look fabulous!
My son is biracial so I'm always looking for a great conditioner to keep his hair soft.  I received this and put a small amount in my son's hair.  The following day, I got a call from the daycare around noon saying he was scratching his head and behind his ears to the point where it's all red and raw and he also has a rash about 1/2 inch down onto his forehead.  So, unfortunately, I can't rate the product on conditioning abilities because he only used it once before his head broke out.
My hair is short and layered. It is colored (by me at home every two weeks) to cover the grey and white that now crowns my pate. My hair has always been thick and does have a mind of its own so a good cut, shampoo,  conditioner and styling products are essentials. I also shampoo my hair every day so my scalp tends to be dry. This far and away the best conditioner I have ever used and leaves my hair feeling smooth and satiny. I attribute this to the silicone in the Motions At Home Moisture Plus Conditioner. A little dab rubbed into my scalp and hair after shampooing really does go a long way and has made my scalp feel great. I have to give this product a rave review. It is not just for African hair.There is only one problem with this product and that is why I edited my review and deleted two stars -- the bottle the thick conditiner is in is impossible to use. Although I keep it standing on its head, squeezing enough of it out to use is challenging.
While others have complained about the smell, I didn't find it overly strong or offensive. I noticed that I had to use quite a bit of product since this has little or no lathering to it. My hair felt a bit softer initially, but there wasn't a drastic difference between this and other products that are cheaper. What I didn't like about this product was that my skin felt greasy by the end of the day (forehead and temples). I was disappointed at the length of time that my hair felt clean. Also (for me, this wasn't a problem but for others it may be), this product reduces hair volume quite a bit and my hair felt flatter against my head than normal. If this is a desired result, then you may like the product quite a lot.
My hair is sort of between traditionally black and white hair, and it tends to get frizzy and difficult to manage, so I have to flat iron it and not let moisture get to it, or it reverts back to that frizzy state.The instructions asked to keep it in the hair under a cap for 3-5 minutes, which is already kind of a hassle, but I did it. The results? Somewhat unimpressive. After using a Motions brand cleanser, which over-dried my hair, this conditioner failed to add back that lost moisture. The results were relatively manageable hair that was dull and somewhat dry with some flyaways on top. With cheaper store-bought brands like Suave and store generics, this is even worse, so at least the conditioner did better than those. It did not, however, do as well as salon brands I've used. It was roughly comparable to Dove, which is sort of in the middle.If you use this, plan on adding an after-shower conditioner, lotion, or other add-on to bring shine and moisture into your hair.
I liked it the first time I used it.  My shoulder-length colored hair was manageable and softer the next day.  By the next night though, my head felt greasy and the third night was quite bad.  Also, when I stopped using the product, my hair started getting a bit wild--strands all over the place.  I had to brush them with a wet brush for a while there; that's how much it thinned my hair.  So, this is good for the occasional use but definitely not for everyday use.
My wife and I have used this a little over a week now and it seems to be doing a great job of conditioning our hair compared to other products.  It does feel a little pasty and not as smooth and creamy as other conditioners.  But it goes on very well and does a great job.  My only problem was the smell as it didnt have a good smell for a conditioning product.  I would like my hair to smell good when I'm fininshed showering.  Its not that it is totally stinky but its not what you would expect from this type of product.
I really liked using this conditioner.  It has a pleasant smell and felt as though it rinsed cleanly from my hair leaving it shiny & healthier looking.  My wet hair was easy to comb through and didn't feel dry or greasy, just a nice balance.Unfortunately this blissful look was short lived.  Within a few hours, my hair looked dirty with a dulling color.  For a few hours my hair looked and felt great, unfortunately this was very short-lived.
I've had this product for about a month now. Overall it just OK in my opinion. It gives your hair a greasy feeling in usage and its a very heavy type of conditioner which i didnt like. It is scented with something but it doesnt last after shower and isnt obtrusive while showering so no worries there. The end result left my hair pretty smooth but nothing more or less than other conditioners that i've tried.
While I suspect that this was formulated for "ethnic" hair, I thought it may do a superior job of conditioning my color treated, bleached and blow dried hair which is in the long range.While I cannot say how well this performs on hair that is naturally coarse and dry in texture, I can attest that it was not formulated for hair that it normally smooth but otherwise dry by color treating.It left my hair feeling heavy and waxy.I could feel oil on my fingers after touching my hair.It doesn't rinse out well with ANY amount of water, which may be a good thing if your hair is very dry.The fragrance is incredibly strong. As in, I had already taken my allergy meds and ended up having to WASH this out of my hair because it smelled so strong 13 hours later that I feared my reaction after sleeping on it all night.It may be a good conditioner for it's intended purpose, but if you're thinking of trying it for color treated hair in lieu of a standard conditioner for that hair issue, I do not recommend trying it as I made the mistake of doing.
When I first used this conditioner it didn't work very well since my hair was very damaged. So I'd not recommend this product if your hair feels like straw. After getting my hair back to normal however, this conditioner works OK on my fine dry hair. It does add some shine to your hair.~The Rebecca Review
First off make sure you have a shower cap, because the directions call for one.  You are supposed to put the shower cap on after applying and leave in for three to five minutes.  The conditioner itself is very thick and easy to work in and rinse out.  My hear does feel healthier after every use but I am not sure if it is really that much better than other conditioners you can buy off the shelf.
This conditioner is white colored and very thick.  It has a strong citrus odor when first applied.  Both my girls say they like the smell after it has been on my hair for a while.  There are definitely no fly away hairs after using this product...even in dry, winter air.  It does seem to leave a slight residue, so I didn't feel like my hair was totally "clean" after using this.  I'd say that my hair was medium soft, generally detangled, and below ordinary shiny.  I will probably continue to use the conditioner through the winter, but I doubt I will purchase it again.
It doesn't take much of this conditioner to help your hair get detangled, but the mineral oil in it can give the hair a pasty feeling.  I used just a little dab to cover the ends of my hair and worked it right through.  My hair felt thick and coarse and I didn't care for the smell.I didn't notice any shine or anything special, just detangled.  Not sure I am convinced this is a conditioner for my type of hair (thin-med-wavy).  I felt the need to use shampoo twice to get rid of the coarse feeling when washing my hair the next day.
This Motions at Home conditioner is good for very dry hair, like mine gets after I color it. The conditioner is thick, but works into the hair fairly easily. I find it is too heavy for me to use near my scalp; I only use it on the ends. My hair looks healthy and shiny after I use it, but it feels like it doesn't completely rinse out. After too many days of use, my hair can look heavy and greasy. That is why I alternate with another conditioner that's a bit lighter for my hair. Lastly, the scent of this conditioner is okay. It's a bit strong going on, but not so after my hair is dry. Overall, I think this is a fine conditioner for dry or damaged hair.
I have thick fine blond hair that is a medium length.  Usually after I wash it I use a very slight amount of a spray on conditioner and my hair is clean and shiney and full of life.So to test this out, I substituted this for my usual spray on conditioner.  I was hoping for an end to the itchy scalp I have been experiencing.My hair seemed a little bit greasy after I used this.  It has mineral oil listed as the second ingredient so that's probably why.  I wash my hair to get out the grease, then put more on it when I dry it with this.  I don't have dry hair at all, just my scalp from all the swimming I do.  I didn't care for the grease this put into my hair.To give a fair review, I next massaged a bit of this into my scalp on the back of my head where it itches, and it did relieve the itch.  In fact it worked wonders for this problem, so I'm convinced my itchy scalp is from dryiness.  I feel this did not improve the looks or condition of my hair, but I can recommend this if you have an itchy scalp.  I took cotton balls and sprayed them with this and rubbed them onto my scalp where it was itching and it did stop the itch.This is an ethnic product I think so to be fair, I probably have the wrong type of hair to give this the proper test.  But I'm impressed that it cleared up my itch and will continue to use it for that purpose alone when needed.
When the kids were young we used Motions products almost exclusively. Then we started to notice that the products with a high level of mineral oil triggered headaches for some of us. The Shea Butter is way down on the ingredient list (try 34th or 35th). In lieu of full disclosure, panthenol, hydrolized keratin, collagen amino acids, jojoba and wheat germ oils precede it on the ingredient list and biotin follows it.What I really like about the product: I do love the creamy texture. It absorbs quickly while leaving a very nice sheen.Scent: Very fruity and sweet. This, like their Marula Hair and Scalp oil, reminds me of the scents that are found at Bath and Body works. However there is a low note that is rather off-putting and funky for me. I like the Marula Oil product better, it is a cleaner scent without the unpleasant low note.Final analysis: I'm not crazy about the scent, but if you like sweeter scents and your scalp can tolerate mineral, this is a great product. If not, look for a different oil moisturizer.
It is an oil therapy and as such it does just that, it adds oil to your hair and scalp.  I could never use this product and leave it in my hair for the day.  The only way I could do that would be if I wanted a wet look.  But, I cannot stand the oily feel.  It might be suitable to spray in your hair and leave for several hours as a treatment before then washing your hair and styling...I don't know.The other issue I have against this product is the scent.  It just about made me sick to my stomach.  I could smell it even after washing my hair.So, I cannot rate this product better than 3 stars.  I would rate it lower, but I recognize that it may be beneficial for other hair types and those with extremely dry scalps.  The scent is simply a matter of preference.
I mistakenly ordered this thinking it was more of a conditioner product -- "Moisturizer Hair Lotion" seemed pretty obvious.However, this product is really a sort of styling oil. I found this out the hard way in the shower. Happily, a simple rinse and towel dry later, my hair looked basically normal. I think this might be useful to replenish a more or less natural level of 'oiliness' after washing / conditioning, which, for me at least, leaves my hair sort of dry and frizzy for the next day.Still, I don't really enjoy having artificially oily hair, so I wouldn't buy this. I'm only reviewing it because I got it as a sample.
It is light and a tiny amount goes a very long way.  I thought it would be good to cure my winter time fly aways but it kind of left me with a wet look.  I was very careful not to put it at the roots, and I am thankful I did or I would have looked dirty and oily all day.
I do not have "natural" hair, I am of the Caucasian persuasion and my hair is as thin and straight as can be. I ran out of my usual leave in hair conditioner and decided to try this brand out.  It smells nice, it went on nicely, but my hair did not like it. It weirdly dried it out, not moisturized it.
As a disclaimer, I have brown sandy, disheveled, spiky-in-places, thin wavy hair.  This product wasn't made just for me.  It turns my hair into the windswept look without my consent.  This is made for a different type of hair.
Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion is a decent daily moisturizer.  I have natural hair and I haven't noticed a difference using it compared to the regular moisturizers I currently use.  It is light weight and doesn't leave a greasy film on my hair, however the amounts I have to use for coverage wouldn't make this a cost effective product for me to purchase. I do love the new look for Motions products! I recommend this product for individuals with relaxed or chemically treated hair.  I'm sure the outcome would be better for those hair types.
I really can't review how well this product worked since I was only able to use it on my son one time.  The following day, his entire head, neck, ears, and forehead broke out.  I've had this same problem with other Motions at Home products, so there is something in them he's allergic to.
I got this for one of my grandaughters to try out since she is young and has nice long and dark hair as opposed to mine which is short and light (gray). She is on the dean's list at college so I figure a smart gal like that can give a quality review. She came over from college to spend the weekend here so I took the opportunity to try out her product analysis capability.After making a test run her conclusion was brief and concise: This is not anything special. It is just a fairly mediocre moisturizer with an odor that is not particularly appealing.Based on her feedback I placed this item on my "Do not buy" list.
I have very thick and course hair and have had difficulties with moisturizing it and figured this would be a good quick-fix solution and help me confront my fear of hot air dryers.  Now, this is pretty moisturizing and a little goes a long way.  I've noticed a definite difference in my hair after blow-drying after locking this in.  I also find this works well on dry hair and keeps flyaways tamed.  However, many might find this may make their hair lean toward the greasy look.  Which may be good or bad--I like that it does make styling easier, but I know many must have the "just washed" look.  So, this is a product that does its job and moisturizers, but it may not be the best quick-fix solution.
In hindsight this is probably not the right kind of product for my short straight hair.  But what the hey, I tried it anyway thinking maybe it would cutdown on cowlicks.  I did apply this oil in the shower.  My hair did lay flatter but just a bit too greasy for my tastes so I will not add this to my regular hair products staple.  But too each his own - 3 stars for me.
I am not a huge fan of leave-in moisturizer, and Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion is a prime example of why. First the good, with Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion. It is a decent sized bottle, so for me, with regular use, this bottle could last a long time. The only bad thing is after a few uses, I am not sure I will ever use this product again.At first, Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion seems great. Makes my hair soft, shiny, and all that I want. The problem is after a few hours, my hair would get really greasy feeling. And even after washing my hair, the feeling stays. All in all, it took about two washing just to get my hair back to feeling like normal. Bottom line, great at first, but definitely a down side.
I used an amount of solution the size equivalent of a 5-cent coin for my long hair that extends to the middle of my back.  I rubbed the moisturizer between my palms and massaged it through my hair and scalp.  I then blow-dried my hair and although my hair did not come out as bouncy as it does with other products I've tried, it did not have that overly dry feeling I get when no product or no in-shower conditioner is used.  The next morning my hair felt a little slick and it looked darker than normal yet it really does not feel like I have any product residue in my hair.  Overall, I'm not too impressed.To me this is nothing special; it's just okay.  I prefer to use a heavy in shower moisturizer that I rinse away rather than this and then blow dry.  My hair, which is very fine, was left a little more lifeless with this product.  After having tried this, it is not a product I would purchase for myself based on the okay results I've had.
I have used several products in this Motions line. This hair lotion like most of the others a little goes a long way. I also think it might not be the best thing for fine/thin hair it will weight you down abit. I enjoy it occasionally as I have long thick often rudely hair. I would give it a try especially if you use pink oil moisturizer its the same thing.
I was disappointed, it's not for my hair type. It did have a super silky feel to it.I should have read the reviews better.
This product has a nice, pleasant scent. It's a great value because you only need to use a small amount.Unfortunately, it resulted in more of a greasy look rather than the shine I was looking for. I have long, wavy hair, and it might work better for someone who has different type of hair.
I didn't realize at the time of selecting this product to review that it is for those of African descent with African-type hair.  No where on the outside label does it indicate it is mainly for non-whites.  I finally figured it out after seeing how greasy my cleanly washed and blown-dry hair looked in the mirror.  It says on the back of the bottle in very, very, very small print, "relaxed, pressed, natural, weave".  And that's all it says about that...anywhere....on the entire bottle.  Well....I'm glad I didn't pay for this stuff.On the plus side though - it really smells great!  I'm very wary of scented hair products but this stuff has a delightful scent.  And though I really can't use it as indicated on my non-African hair in the way I would like too, I can see how this stuff would be great for getting that "dirty hair" look but with clean hair.  I will most likely find another use for it, maybe as a skin lotion....why not?  I hate to waste anything.
This maybe called a LOTION but if you opt to slather it on like one, you'll be a greasy mess! It's more a light hair cream. A little dab warmed between the palms of your hands THEN finger combed through your dry hair will impart moisture and shine. It won't weigh down your curls or make your straight hair clumpy.But IF your hair is already very dry, this will probably be better used applied LIGHTLY to damp hair before blow drying and/or air drying to seal in moisture. It's pretty good but the scent bothers me and I will not be purchasing it.
This Motions at Home moisturizer worked alright in its efforts to moisturize my hair. I wasn't blown away by it, but I definitely noticed a difference. There's definitely a few cons that prevented me from enjoying this product.The product is a bit of a pain to apply. A small amount doesn't get all the way into your hair, but a large amount in a pain to style. It smells nice, which is a plus but I'm not sure that should matter all that much.My hair did feel a bit better. I've been using a lot of deep conditioners at the same time, so I'm not sure how much I'd attribute that to the product itself. This product is good, but its certainly not great.
This is not the best stuff for thin hair. It made my hair greasy. I let my grandaughter use it who has thick curly hair and she said she kind of liked it but it was a little too greasy for her too :(
I am a long haired guy and while I figured this to be a gal's product, I thought I'd try it.  Scent wasn't bad, but otherwise obviously useless for us long haired bearded guys.
I tried it on clean dry hair as a styling aid.  I tried it on damp hair, just after shampooing.  I tried it on wet hair.  I tried using it as a conditioner, after shampooing and before rinsing.  No matter what I did, my hair felt heavy -- not moisturized, just heavy, and not very clean.I hate to toss it, but I can't figure out another way to try this product.Three stars, because the problem might be my hair type rather than the product.
These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine. Even so, this is just a mess of a product. Oily, sticky, gross. Not for me.
