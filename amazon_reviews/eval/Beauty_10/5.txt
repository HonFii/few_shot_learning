I am a devotee to this serum, it does wonders for my skin. I've always been complimented on my skin, but the lack of sleep and long work days haven't done it any good. This serum is a truly regenerating serum. I put it on every morning before any makeup and the results are visible. When I stop using it my skin becomes less smooth and does not glow.I also tried the Olay ProX range but it is a little too much for me right now being in my 30s. This fragrance free serum is just the perfect thing. I have combination skin and it works well for me. Sometimes I don't get it as it is pretty pricey but I can tell the difference in my skin when I am using this serum so I caved in and signed up for a subscription on Amazon. The one with the SPF factor is not as good as this one, nor the one with "Touch of Sun" tanning. This is THE best, and gentlest anti-aging product I've found till date.The greatest compliment I can give is that if I had to choose one face moisturizer for the rest of my life it would be the regenerist.
As a woman nearing 50, I need all the help I can get, especially as I don't wear foundation. This serum goes on silky smooth and leaves my face soft and supple. It makes a perfect base for powder and blush, working almost as a primer. I originally tried the scented version of this, and the scent was very pleasant.
I've used this regenerating serum for more than six months and have found it to be as described--easy to apply, absorbs quickly, no scent, and overall a winning formula for a moisturizer.  Another plus is the price which is much more reasonable than the same type of item in department stores and it does the same, if not better,job.
Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Concentrated Amino-Peptide Complex, Fragrance Free - 1.7 fl ozis, in my opinion, Olay's finest product to date.First, it's fragrance-free.  Men can use it too.It contains ingredients that help maintain the integrity of the epidermis in a silicone base.  It can be used under sunscreen or alone at night.  It can be used under makeup.  In fact, because of the silicones used, it's a bit like a primer.This serum is suitable for all skin types, though if you have dry skin,  you may want to apply moisturizer over it.  It's non-irritating and non-sensitizing.It contains antioxidants, peptides, and niacinamide.  Olay touts niacinamide as being a sort of miracle ingredient.  The advertising for skin care products drives me a bit crazy, because they can only deliver so much.  Olay's claims aside, I am 100% crazy about this product.  My skin really does look better - and no one is paying me to say that.I do not buy the Regenerist Eye.  I use this for my eye area.  Regenerist Eye has a slightly different texture, but otherwise it's the same product at a higher price.The fragrance-free version of this product is definitely worth trying, regardless of your age or skin type.
The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer is how smoothly my foundation went on after using it.  (I used to feel as if my moisturizer and face makeup were too much for my 48 year old face.)  I'm looking forward to the possible fading of age spots in the future with continued use.The price is better than Wal-Mart's if you subscribe and it really is a convenience.  If you run low before you're due for a shipment you can adjust the delivery.  I also subscribed to the eye cream and night cream.
I started a new skin regimen recently, retinol cream, AHA 8% cream and this Olay Regenerist Daily Serum, and I'm amazed that I can see a difference already, in a week. My skin is smoother and healthier looking and even a little tighter, altho there is not yet a huge difference in that department. Still, I recommend this as part of your skin care regimen because it seems to give the others a boost. I useOlay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sensitive Skin, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)every day, as well.
I've been using this serum for at least 6 years.  I love the fact that Olay eventually came out with this fragrance-free version, that in itself is a huge selling point for me.  And it works!  Most people think I'm at least 15 years younger than I really am.  I have a few very fine wrinkles only when I squint, and that's it.I am a normal-to-dry skin type in the winter and normal during the other seasons.  This serum really helps keep my skin hydrated with the harsh winter winds, and in the summer sometimes this is all I need as a moisturizer if I'm not going to be outdoors - otherwise I also apply a high SPF product if I plan on being outside.Yes, the silicones in this help with the dryness and they also help to blur the fine lines.  I also use a dab of this on my crows feet.  But you may need to watch out if you have a problem with milia.  I occasionally get a few, but I do with just about every other product I have tried so it doesn't matter what I use.  I like the results with this; I've tried other brands without the "cones" and they just don't work for me.This serum contains many ingredients that are beneficial to your skin such as peptides, niacinamide, several vitamins and green tea, which are often found in much higher priced beauty products.Pros:  Hydrating; almost instant blurring of wrinkles due to the silicones; great ingredients; no discernable fragrance.Cons:  The silicones can cause milia occasionally; Olay tests on animals and this bothers me & I wish they would find another way to test their products before putting them on the market -- other companies do, why can't Olay?I recommend this for anyone with normal or normal-to-dry skin.  If you have a problem with acne, probably not, but maybe if you are brave enough, you could do a test first.
OPI is my favorite nail polish.  It goes on smooth, dries fast, has  a large variety of rich colors, and it lasts (I get about 1 good week).They key to nice looking nail polish is the brush, and OPI brushes are very  good.  I am attaching a photo with the brush freshly dipped into "Got the blues for red", a shade of deep red with just a hint of blue that I really like.This is a great product, I recommend it.Ali Julia review
I love OPI polish and "A Rose by Dawn" is my favorite color.  I wear it year round for both my manicures and pedicures.  It goes with everything I wear and I get lots of compliments on it, especially on the pedis.I brush on two coats, goes on smoothly, and then I top it off withOPI Nail Polish, Top Coat, 0.5-Ounce.  It's a great combination and usually lasts close to two weeks (unless I'm swimming a lot or cleaning a lot, with my hands in water for extended periods without rubber gloves).
Love OPI nail polish and the rest of their product line. For everyday wear, this color is perfect. I have fair skin and when I wear this it blends in because it is a flesh tone. It is very natural looking yet it provides a subtle glow and covers nail imperfections in a snap. It lasts a long time and is chip resistant.
This is a very nice shimmer polish.  It's a cherry fuschia color and not very purple at all.  Two coats are all I needed for my manicure.  I always use a basecoat and top coat with my polish.  I had some minor tip chips after 3 days, touched up with another coat as I typically do.
I just have to say that I LOVE this shade of polish by OPI. I purchased it on a whim, and I'm so glad I did. The color is this awesome light gray with just the slightest hint of olive green. It really makes my nails pop, and I receive so many compliments when I wear this shade. Plus, the staying power is great. Definitely scoop this one up!
Received this color as a gift for Christmas and I love it.  It's a great neutral gray, and I see the olive green hints in it too that another reviewer saw.  I guess color is subjective.  Looks so cute with my olive green cords and a dark top, especially next to purples.  It also lasts a really long time without chipping.
I used one of these last night and was appalled at what it pulled out of my pores! I thought that my skin was pretty clean, but even after my facial last week I still had so much junk in those pores. These strips work very well, they were easy to apply and remove and didn't break me out or anything. Great product!
Great product.  A little strange to use the first time, and looks kind of icky when you pull it off - it clears the pores out and you'll be amazed at how much stuff is on your face! but easy to use, and works.  Will buy again.
I remember years ago I bought strips like this but they were so different.First, these go on a wet face and they dry sort of like a cast for a broken bone but they don't hurt when they come off.  They peel off easily and gently and leave no residue.  I have some blackheads that are not really visible but this strip did pull them out.  It's great. One application and you can have a smoother apprearance on your skin.Very nice product and I would recommend it, especially if your trouble spots are the sides of your nose.
If you follow the directions as stated on the packaging, you will be very pleased with this product. The instructions are very simple and it only takes a few minutes to rid your nose of hard to remove dirt which embeds in pores and gives a really nice clean feeling afterwards.You can actually see the results on the strip if you look at it from the side against a dark background, you will see everything the strip has removed from your face. Great results, I highly recommend these, and I will continue to buy them myself.
My Wife and I both use the Biore Cleansing Pore Strips. These work wonderful. We have used Biore and Pond's and these work much better than the Pond's brand. It is unbelievable how much is dirt is under the skin on your nose. When used properly the strip is usually full and looks like a porcupine. They leave your nose clean and smooth and you can really feel the difference. You can also use these stips on other areas of your face as well.
I used to use these all the time when Biore first brought these nose strips out but then they got a little on the pricey side and I eventually stopped using them.However, I forgot how well they do work. They are so easy to use too. Just cleanse your face first, then make sure your nose is wet, apply the nose strip, wait 15 minutes, peel the strip off, and if you're like me, look at the strip to see what it pulled. I know it sounds gross and improper to talk about but half of the fun of these strips is seeing what is on the strip once you're done with it. And be glad that your face is now cleaner because you used the Biore nose strips.Also, make sure that if your skin can dry out easily to put on some mosturizer after using the strips as they can dry out your skin a bit.
Having used these strips since their introduction years and years ago, I can testify that they really do work if one follows the instructions carefully.Here are some dos and don'ts that may help you have a successful experience:-Do not wet the area excessively or wet the strip itself. If the strip isn't conforming to shape of your nose, you've used too much water. (This is also why some people get a glue substance on their faces ... too much water.)-I, personally, have never had success with using these while relaxing in the bath. I have tried to use these while taking a bubble-bath, but they never dry when I do that. I think the steam from the water may prevent them from drying properly. So, I would suggest using them away from warm, steamy areas.-Allow the strip to dry completely. If you have ever experimented with paper-mche, it should feel like that when dry. It should be hard ... not firm, but hard.-Peal slowly from one side in the opposite direction. Do not "rip it off like a band-aid."-Finally, if you trim the product to customize it, you have to toss the excess. I have tried to use the left over segment a week later, it does not work. (Again, I assume it must have something to do with exposure to humidity (since these are individually packaged and sealed)).And, yes, there may be a startling moment afterwards where your pores appear large. That is because you just removed all that build-up. Do not worry, it will be fine:)Like a lot of folks who love this product, I find them super gratifying. I love the feeling of my skin afterward (so smooth!) And I love the idea of removing all that "gunk." Biore was an innovator who quickly became the standard. Before them, people would literally use extractors to have clear pores. It was slow and uncomfortable (and most people had an aesthetician do it). So, many thanks to Biore for a product that makes life easier!! Love these!
I used to buy these all the time, and was very impressed with how they worked. I switched over to other exfoliants and sort of forgot about these strips for a while. Well, I am once again a loyal customer, because the proof is immediate on how great these little strips work. My skin is no where near as oily as it used to be, so I won't need to use them quite so often. However, they are absolutely effective in improving the appearance of your skin, and I will definitely make Biore Pore Perfect strips a regular purchase!Whenever you feel the need for a deep cleansing, Biore will definitely work for you.
I've used this for a few years, ever since they came out.What it basically is is a glue strip you put over your nose and when you yank that off, out comes the blackheads and a tiny layer of the skin. How well it works for you depends on how delicate your skin is and how strong and deep the blackheads attach.As a long term user I can definitely say that it works very well. When I first started using them I had a lot of blackheads all over my nose and I can remember the strip being dotted with gunk when I pulled it off. Over the years I've gotten much less blackheads, to the point that I only use these once every 6 months or so. And each time I use the strips I only get a small amount of blackheads there now.So in summary, these have definitely worked great for me.
And I haven't a complaint. For me, they work perfectly. I use them right before I do any deep cleaning of my face, and to my mind, I'd never be without them.Highly recommend!
I love this product! I simply wet my nose as the instructions said to do, put the strip on and forgot it for about 15 minutes. When I pulled it off I was shocked at what it had pulled from my pores. I put the strip under my 'day' lamp and a magnifying glass because it looked like dark stubbles of hair! Gross! Especially since I sure don't have any hair on my nose -- nor was all that black 'dirt' visible to my naked eye! I knew my pores were large there but I didn't know they were THAT bad. I'll be using this weekly now. My nose even felt smoother afterward as if the cleaned out pores had made the skin itself tighter. I highly recommend this product to feel like you've done a super thorough job of cleaning ALL of the skin on your face.
No one wants clogged pores or visible blackheads on their nose. That's why the Biore pore strips are so handy. Just wash your face and wet and apply the strip, after it dries, peel it off, and behold what was clogging your pores. These really work and are easy to use. The only way they wouldn't be effective is if they are applied wrong or not allowed to dry, unless your skin is so perfect that your pores are clog free.
Whoever invented these things is a genius, pure and simple. They are amazing. I don't care what you try on your blackheads, nothing works as beautifully as these little miracle strips do.The process is super simple- wet your nose, place the strip and let dry. When you peel it off after 10-15 minutes, you pull out all the gunk that was so happily residing in your pores. And when you do? UgH! The stuff that comes out is fascinating in a way you are probably too proper to talk about (more proper than I am, apparently). You will be shocked and disgusted by what these pull out of your pores. It leaves your nose a little dry afterwards, but that is the small, small price to pay for such a great result!Love these!
I used Biore strips as a teenager, but felt they never cleaned as well as a normal cleanser and weekly facial mask, so I stopped using them.  My have they changed!  The Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips (nose strips) are now a permanent part of my weekly routine!The first time I tried the new strips, I was familiar with the easy to use instructions.  I applied the strip to my nose and waited for it to harden, so I could see the results.  When I removed the strip, I couldn't believe my eyes!  These strips totally cleaned the gunk that was trapped in my pores.  I thought that maybe it was a one time thing, so I tried again, and once again, blackheads and trapped dirt were easily removed--this time a much smaller amount though.Since using the Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips I have noticed a difference in the appearance of the pores on my nose.  In addition the skin on my nose is brighter and rejuvenated.I am so excited for these strips and encourage those looking to improve the appearance of their skin while deeply cleaning their pores to try the Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips.
I've been using these for years, I've ventured out and tried other more expensive brands and I always go back to Biore. I use them all over my face. I will cut one in half and use them on my cheeks, I put them on my chin and forehead. They do the job the best. You can't go wrong with Biore products.
This product delivers like I thought it would.  I love Dove products anyway and this one certainly did not disappoint.  First of all before even using the shower cleanser I noticed the nice clean smell as I was dispensing it into my hand.  It lasts long enough after my shower for my husband to comment on how clean and nice I smelled.  That's another plus!It left my skin feeling moist but NOT greasy.  This is what I'm looking for when I use a shower product in the winter months.  It's so light on my skin that I think I'll be able to use this one year round.Recommend to buy.  I think you'll be glad you did.
The two Dove body washes we tend to use in our household areDove go fresh Pomegranate and Lemon Verbena Scent Revive Body Wash, 24 Ounce (Pack of 2)andDove Go Fresh Burst Body Wash Nectarine & White Ginger, 16.9 Oz / 500 Ml (Pack of 3). However, we were offered a review sample of the sensitive skin version with NutriumMoisture (yes, one word.) so we decided to give it a try, While it doesn't smell as good as our go-to body washes, it still works extremely well and leaves my skin soft and mositurized instead of cracked and chapped as is usually the case in winter. Unlike a lot of other body washes (included some of Dove's own products), this is a non-nonsense back to basics body wash. It smells like soap, lathers wonderfully and leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed. It's a great buy no matter how you look at it.
With both allergies and winter dryness, my skin has had a bad case of the itchies recently. I find myself acting like a bear, scratching my back against door jambs, and my legs are in a constant state of torment.When I received this, I immediately tried it out and was very pleased with its moisturizing effects. What I noticed most was its neutral scent, particularly important in my case. I am also using other products when I am not in the tub, but it is nice to have a body wash that helps as well.
I like trying new potions and lotions - you never know what you're going to find. One of the things I have found is that Dove Body Wash is very good. The first things you notice are that it has a nice smell, and that it lathers nicely. It leaves my skin feeling clean and yet soft and moisturized. So far I have had no break outs or any other ill effects from it at all.Yes, I am quite pleased!(Review of Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash with NutriumMoisture)
Dove Sensitive Skin Nourishing Body Wash; Nutrium Moisture.I love this body wash.  I love body washes, and I love Dove.  Dove is an awesome, trusted brand that I've been using for a very long time.  I've always trusted Dove soap.  And this particular body wash has nutrients, and is for sensitive skin.  I do have sensitive skin.  But this body wash is good to my skin.  Dove is good to my skin anyway, but the sensitive formula is even more gentle.I love soaps and body washes, and Dove is a brand that I love for these.Highly recommended.  Everybody has to use either soap or body wash.  And this particular type has no scent, so anybody can use it.
Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisuture is a nice addition to my bathtub/shower. It's a body wash everyone in my whole family will use. It doesn't smell too feminine for the men and it has a pleasant smell to satisfy the girly girl in me.  It cleans and moisturizes. I bought my second bottle just this afternoon!
So in love with this product that it will be a staple in our house from now on. I've always loved Dove soap for sensitive skin and this is more than the icing on the cake with it being in body wash form. It really does leave your skin soft and supple from use. You wont regret this purchase ; )
This is a wonderful body wash in a creamy lotion.  It not only cleans you skin, it leaves it feeling like you have just applied a lightweight moisture lotion.It lathers up easily and makes you feel like you are in a bubble bath with all the lather.  This is something I always look for in a body wash --- lots of lather.  It doesn't take a huge amount of product to make the lather, either.Dove has always made good skin products and this is no exception.
Dove always puts out such good products.  This is a very nice body wash for sensitive skin.  Won't leave you itchy or rashy or feeling dried out.  Highly recommended for those of us with sensitive skin who can't take heavily fragranced, drying products.  Highly recommended.
It lathers well and has a light, clean scent.  The scent doesn't linger, which works well for me because I work in an office where we aren't allowed to wear perfume.  A little goes a long way, as this foams up nicely, especially with a mesh pouf.  It does moisturize better than most body washes.  I used to useSoftsoap Body Butter Coconut Scrub Body Wash 15 oz, and if I didn't use lotion, my legs would just flake dry skin.  I was able to tryDove Creme Body Wash, Visible Care Toning, 18 Ounceand was impressed with it, as my skin was much less dry then when I use the Softsoap bodywash.  This bodywash moisturizes my skin as well as the Dove Visible Care Toning does.Dove clearly has a superior line of bodywashes, that moisturize better then others.  I am satisfied with it, and will use it again in the future.
This is a good basic body wash. It has a subtle fragrance. It is non-irritating. This body wash lathers up well and rinses completely leaving no residue or greasy feeling. I felt that the moisturizing properties of this body wash were fairly effective. I did not feel it was drying.
I'm quite pleased with this body wash. It has a thick consistency and lathers well. I'm especially impressed with the moisturizing ability - I've tried other brands that offer that benefit and they either don't do much of anything in terms of moisturizing, or are so oily that I don't feel clean after showing. This strikes the right balance between clean and moisturizing. I especially appreciate it this time of year (winter) when my skin feels so parched.Excellent product that I highly recommend.
I may be a little woozy from suffering from dry itchy winter skin, but I've used this a couple of times now and my skin feels better and I'm not itching and my skin isn't flaking. This has a pleasant scent and appears to be quickly absorbed into the skin. This has no oily residue and is very foamy.I'm impressed with the results and think this is a really good body wash.
Prefer using body wash to soap and this one is very good.  Smooth on senstive skin, never leaving it feeling dry or taut.  Always feel clean and yet the product is gentle and easy to use.  Definitely worth getting again.
I already use Dove products.  I typically use the regular bar soap, though, so this is different.I really liked the delicate scent.  It reminds me of a light Shea butter.  The soap is thick and really lathers well.  I could instantly feel the moisturizing ability as I spread the lather.  After my shower, I did not have a tight feeling in my skin.  I noticed much less dryness as well, and I already use Dove!  I still used lotion, but I could feel this really is a better moisturizing soap.  And after several days of continuous use, I still agree with my original assessment.  This is a wonderfully rich moisturizing soap.I highly recommend this soap, especially in this dry winter.
I love this body wash. It smells great and doesn't irritate. I have super sensitive skin and some scents give me a headache. This is not one. I love how this body wash makes my skin feels and smells.
Dove Sensitive Skin is an unscented moisturizing body wash. I personally want fragrance in my body wash but know that other's may not. This Dove is particularly moisturizing. Lathered nice and I felt like I didn't even need lotion after my bath.
I like it, a lot.  Yes I know I am repeating myself but this product is great in my book.  The scent is very mild, almost nonexistent.  The feel while washing is smooth and comfortable, not slick like some or gritty like others.  The lather rinses off easily and just left my skin feeling good.
I have problems especially in the winter with many soaps and this one has really been good for me. It has caused no problems with itching or anything, it lathers well, cleans well and smells good. The smell reminds me of ivory soap. I would buy this and recommend it to others with or without skin problems. It is a soap so you still need to moisturize your skin after a shower but it doesn't make your skin dry either.
I have been using this product for a year or two, and I wouldn't do without it, especially in the winter when my skin starts to flake with dryness.  Because I have sensitive and often dry skin, I have to be careful about what soap-like products I apply.  I use a mesh body sponge, and the lather is thick and creamy with only a teaspoon or so of body wash.  The only thing I don't like about it is the tapered top that makes it tough when I'm running out and want to store it upside down.  I have to balance it against the shower wall.I highly recommend this for anyone who has dry or sensitive skin.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
I'm a big fan of body washes, so much so that one of my brothers gave me several bottles ofOlay Cr&egrave;me Ribbons. It was a marvelous body wash, however one thing I didn't like about it was the pink residue I had to clean out of the tub after I bathed. The Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash left nothing out of the ordinary behind and except for the typical wipe-down I was quite satisfied. A luxurious bathing experience can definitely be spoiled if you have to spend several minutes cleaning a tub when you're done.I like the fact that it is hypo-allergenic because I do have sensitive skin. Not overly so, but can get a rash if a soap or body wash is harsh. Many of the homemade natural soaps are off limits to me because they sometimes have additives that don't agree with my skin. The Dove Sensitive Skin Nourishing Body Wash is unscented, but not fragrance free, something that some may wish to stay clear off. It has a nice, clean delicate scent that I liked. It left a baby-like fresh scent behind. Mind you, I'm from the era of women who enjoyed a dab of fragrance in personal products.One other interesting thing I notice was that the Dove Sensitive Skin Nourishing Body Wash had "nutrium moisture." A lot of products have the most interesting names for nutrients or properties, but what do they mean? In this case I found that it was a special formula unique to this Dove product. "The Dove line of body wash products includes a proprietary formula called NutriumMoisture technology. It includes a special combination of oils and other ingredients that work to restore the outermost layer of the skin and are actually absorbed into the top layer, rather than simply coating." I must admit, I feel good, my skin feels good, and my overall experience was a positive one. This body wash is certainly a winner in more ways than one.INGREDIENTS:Water, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil or Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sodium Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Lauric Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Chloride, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Tallow Acid or Palmitic Acid, Sodium Isethionate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Methylisothiazolinone, Etidronic Acid, Titanium Dioxide.
This is one excellent body wash that does what a good wash should do all around.  The moisture is evident, skin is left feeling wonderfully soft and healthy, and it foams well.  This has all the great qualities for which Dove stands.
gave this to my oldest adult daughter to use for she has very sensitive skin.  she used it and said that a little goes a long ways.  she advised that the body wash did not dry out her skin and used less lotion after her shower.  she really likes this and told me that she will buy this
Wow, I have several positives to say about this product. First off, I am sensitive to strong scents because I get migraines and this scent does not trigger my migraines. Second, I am not good at using lotion at all other than a facial moisturizer and occasional hand lotion when my hands are so dry I can't take it any longer. Since using this Bodywash, I have not had to even think about using lotion. My skin, especially the sides of my torso would get dry and tight and I would think, I should be using lotion but since Dove, I have been comfortable with my soft skin. It's great for winter and all year long! It's awesome that you can get it at a pretty decent price on Amazon thru subscribe and save but my secret is to purchase the WalMart Equate twin pack. It works just the same and you get twice as much! You literally get two 24oz bottles for the price of one Dove 24oz bottle. I realize some people will want to stay with brand name but I'm on a budget so it was a great find for me.
I have been using bar soap with shea as regular bar soap is drying and liquid soaps can leave a greasy film on the skin.  Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture is able to deliver a nice moisture without drying or leaving that greasy coating.  The scent is very nice and light - even my husband likes it and he is strictly a bar soap kind of guy.  The bar soap I buy is extremely expensive (due to the shea), so I am thrilled to find a relatively inexpensive liquid soap that we both can use happily.I am also trying out the Dove Body Wash for Sensitive Skin.  I find it to be a little lighter in consistency but it does as good a job as the regular soap.  I have sensitive skin on my face, so this works great for that purpose.I recommend both soaps and will be buying both again in the future.
This is my all time favorite body wash because of its intensely rich lather and fresh pleasing scent. I first discovered it several years ago on a visit to my in-laws. They were in their 70s at the time and recommended this product to me because they said it had really made a difference with their dry skin. I loved the scent when I first opened the bottle. It's very fresh, clean, and pleasant smelling without smelling "chemical-ish" or flowery at all. The lather is so rich and creamy that I can't compare it to that of any other body wash I've ever tried, and I've tried a lot of them. Every member of my family likes this stuff, from my in-laws to my husband to my kids. I would recommend this to anyone who would like a creamy body wash that makes a lot of lather and has a pleasant scent that men or women will like. I also think it's especially good for kids and older adults who have issues with dry skin.
I've never had a bad experience with any Dove product, and this body wash is one of the best! As you would expect, it lathers up to a rich foam and cleans very well. The scent is mild and inoffensive. But, the real selling point is the fact that it seems to keep working throughout the day, making your skin feel soft even though the dry indoor heat of winter. If you are in search of a moisturizing body wash that will not irritate, this is a great one to try!
I was unexpectedly pleased with Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture.  Typically I figure that all soaps are about the same; I usually prefer liquid soap because it is a bit more convenient than bar soap and it seems less likely to leave soap scum behind (which is a real pain to clean off of the shower walls and door).But beyond the fact that this is liquid soap, I actually saw some benefits to the Dove product.  It cleans OK and rinses off well, not leaving behind any type of oily residue.  That said, it really does seem that after a shower using this product my skin feels a less dry than after a shower using my typical "whatever's on sale" liquid soap.  I'm not sure I really need this extra conditioning or "moisture" all of the time, but it certainly can be beneficial during the cold winter months in the northeast.In addition, the scent (similar to Dove soap bars) is not objectionable, and at least for this particular container the price is reasonable for what you get.
It's hard not to come out of the shower with your skin screaming for moisture in cold winter weather, but the NutriumMoisture body wash really does seem to make a difference.  I'm not having nearly the itching and flaking that's normal for me at this time of the year, but neither is my skin slippery or oily.  The body wash has a nice light scent, and I'm very satisfied with the result.
I don't know why I ever stopped using Dove Body wash a couple years ago but I'm happy now that I am using it again and this formula in particular works very well for me.  My skin is not only very dry but I also have psoriasis where patches of skin are highly sensitive.  This body wash definitely is soothing and moisturizing.  Most important is simply that it cleans well without irritating.  If you have normal to dry skin or even extra dry skin, eczema, etc. I would highly recommend!
I tried the Regular and the Sensitive Skin. Both contain soybean and sunflower oils to help your skin. Both had more of a soap fragrance than anything else. I could not discern a difference with the Sensitive Skin version. I noticed that these bottles contained about twice the volume of the more specialized products like Axe. But the thinness of the soap is going to cause you to use more. This is typical of most body washes. The major difference between the Unilever products is the scent, the thickness, and whether you want any combination of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Its pretty much a personal preference.I like the thick stuff better and the fragrance is like an after shave so 5 stars. I would compare this closely to Clear Shampoo for men. The creamy texture does not drop off your hands like the gels. You don't have to use much to get a nice lather so its not only economical but it won't begin to clog up your drains.
I have always loved usuing Dove products and this body wash is no exception. It has the regular Dove scent and works up into a beautiful creamy lather. I do feel like it keeps me more moisturized than some other body washes (although I do put lotion on right out of the shower). This is a good size bottle and I love the shape of it. I will definitely buy this again!
These Dove body washes are European-style cleansers used with a washcloth or loofah and they don't produce much lather. They do clean well and leave the skin feeling soft, almost like lotion has been applied to it.The Sensitive Skin version is not truly unscented--it has an almost undetectable floral undertone but overall has a smell similar to the generic unscented body lotion that comes in a little bottle at the hospital, not offensive at all.The Deep Moisture version has a rich tropical floral scent that is very heavy and extremely long-lasting. I can't quite pin it down but it is something like a combination of passion fruit and tuberoses that fades into bergamot. I am sensitive to most perfumes and was surprised that this doesn't give me a headache especially since it is so strong.There is also a Go Fresh version elsewhere on Amazon with a moderate scent of nectarine and white ginger with a whiff of mandarin orange.The bottles are a bit awkward to grasp when they are full and wet because of the size and the way they are curved and the tab on the cap is almost sharp and not pleasant to open and close. I put them in a bottle with a pump dispenser, which works well.
Dove is (and has always been) one of my favorite brands of body wash. The Deep Moisture Nourishing 24 ounce bottle comes in handy for my dry skin. The winter months are rough on my skin so a nice moisturizing body wash like Dove is essential (along with good lotion). This Dove body wash cleans and moisturizes with a great scent while rinsing clean. Dove is always a necessary item for me year round.
I love the dove products for sensitive skin.  My daughter has bad eczema and the doctor recommended these products.  Her skin is looking better already.  It doesn't dry her out or cause itching.  No added stuff that makes her skin flame up.
I've always loved Dove Body Washes because they always last longer than your average body wash. You only have to use a little of this body wash to get a large portion of your body covered. Beyond that, it smells great too.While I typically don't use body wash for moisturizer, I can say my skin feels a lot better. This kind of body wash would be good in the hot summer, when my skin gets dry though. Until then, I'm content using it as is.This body wash has a pleasant smell that's not too overpowering when you exit the shower. I find many products try to put too much scent in so that people will feel like they've worked, but that's not the case here. It's not too expensive and it's a great purchase.
This body wash is great. It smells very fresh and leaves my skin soft and very well moisturized. It lathers really nicely with just a little.  I have very sensitive skin and this body wash was great for that! Overall, it's good body wash and I really like it!
I am a big fan of Dove products, and started using them when all that was being produced was the famous Dove bar, when the advertisements urged you to "stop using soap and start using Dove." At various times over the years I have switched to other products but seem to be always come back to Dove. The body wash is thick and has a mild, pleasant smell to it that would be appropriate for both men and women. The product rinses off completely but my skin stayed soft and moist for hours afterwards. The NutriumMoisture is new to me, but it seems to hold in moisture better than products without. I did not feel the need to apply lotion immediately after using the body wash. Since I became a "senior" adult, dry and itchy skin has been a major problem. I think I have found a solution with Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture.
This is a great product for men and women. I love a soap with a great lather that doesn't dry you out. Dove never disappoints and i am faithful user of it and a lot of its men's products.
I obviously really like this stuff, since I use it every day.  It is much gentler than bar soap, and I started using it when I noticed my skin getting too dried out using my old go-to, which was Pears bar soap.  This does a great job at retaining skin moisture. Most days, I don't feel the need to moisturize after getting out of the shower, even in the middle of winter. Fresh, clean smell - not over powering when using and doesn't linger on your skin afterwards.  Also seems to cut down on shower soap scum.  The soap scum build up seems to progress much slower with this vs. bar soaps.  Bonus points:  I don't need a separate shave gel/cream because this also works well for that purpose.I am unable to do a separate review for the sensitive skin version of this product, but I wanted to mention that it is very good for sensitive noses as well - although it does have a trace of a scent, it does not linger long or bother me.
As a guy, I never gave the Dove brand a chance until I took a medication that dried out my skin.  My doctor recommended it, and ever since I've been hooked.  What makes it great is that it leaves the skin clean without drying it out, and does not include any perfumes that might irritate the skin.  The Sensitive Skin Dove body wash is the liquid equivalent of the classic soap.  There is no lingering fragrance, with the only scent being similar to an unscented lotion.  This scent is only present during use, since it washes off so cleanly.The texture of this body wash is just like lotion.  I even double-checked the bottle to make sure that I hadn't accidentally brought lotion into the shower!  My fear was that it would not get me clean or rinse off well, but it did both.I still primarily use bar soap, but if you prefer body wash or need something portable for the gym/travel, Dove has done a good job of making a liquid that retains the properties of the bar.
Oddly enough, I'm one of the few people I know who have had problems with Dove Body Wash.  Other people talk about how gentle it is, but I tend to get rashes from it.But since this was the Sensitive Skin formula, I was anxious to give it  a try.I'm happy to report that I've had no rashes and no ill effects at all - just smooth, soft skin.  It smells good, is silky soft, and washes off well, leaving no residue.  And cleaning the tub later was a breeze.I'll definitely use this product again and again!
Moisturizing body wash for winter dry skin. It's perfect for dry skin from winter air and central heater running homes. Keeps body moist and not flaky during winter dry spells. I saw the commercial that nutrium is moisturizing nutrient that goes into skin cells to replenish needed moisture and nutrients to make skin feel rejuvenated. Letting water infuse into skin and keeping it there with very thin layer of oil. After shower it feels moist and I towel dry by petting instead of rubbing the towel on skin.
Dove body wash is a real treat, especially with the dry winter air and skin. It has a satisfying fragrance, a smooth feel and defintely refreshes the skin. This reviewer suffers from "winter dry skin" and Dove Nutrium Moisture for sensitive skin is a blessing. Dove products can be counted on to offer solutions like dry skin. I heartily recommend them.
rich creamy lather, and does not dry out the skin. Rinses off clean too. I adore this body wash and will use no other now.  If you have sensitive skin this is the body wash for you
This is a great body wash. I normally use the scented body washes, but gave this a try. It left my skin feeling soft, and moisturized, which is impressive considering the air here is devoid of any moisture this time of year. I've always had this experience with Dove products though.As for how it works in the shower, the bottle has a convenient arrowhead shape. It's easy to pour the body wash out, and it doesn't run down the sides of the bottle. It lathers well and a little goes a long way. Also, it says it's unscented, it does contain fragrance and smells like a bar of dove soap. The fragrance is very mild though so it doesn't interact with my perfume later on.I definitely recommend this body wash, or anything by Dove. They make great products.
I have very, very, very sensitive and dry skin.  Living in Alaska where homes are typically more dry than the world's deserts doesn't help.  Oh, and we have forced air heat.  Dry, dry, dry...So, I'm pretty tough to please with body washes.  There aren't many that I can use without needing moisturizer afterwards.  This body wash by Dove is one of the few!I love the way this smells; nice and clean and not overly perfumed.  It lathers nicely without parching my skin and, wonder of wonders, I can wash and go!  Thank you, Dove, for giving me five extra minutes to hit the snooze button!This body wash arrived all contained in the bottle and not dripping through the packaging material.  Whomever taped over the dispenser end, thank you!  Please teach the rest of the world about shipping liquid soaps!Nice product + safe and non-oozy arrival.  What's not to love?!?
I have allergies and my doctor recommends using unscented products that are mild on my skin.  While this does have a mild sent it feels great on my skin and I have not had  any reaction to it. Plus a little of this product goes a long way.All I did was pour a little of this into a wash cloth and used it like I would regular soap. It does not create much of a lather but works as good as my bar soap.This feels nice on my skin. Plus since it is in a bottle I don't have a bar of wet soap sitting on the shelf in my shower.I will use this again.I also tried the Dove Deep Moisture Body Wash. It has a more pronounced scent but feels fine on my skin and works just as well at the Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash. My skin does not react to either product.
For years I have struggled with eczema.  Most body washes contain ingredients that trigger my breakouts, so I usually stick to sensitive formulas.  I found that the Dove Deep Moisture Nourishing Body Wash with Nutrium Moisture is perfect for me!  It is is sensitive enough that it did not cause my skin to breakout, but it kept my extra dry skin moisturized during the harsh winter weather.Dove's Deep Moisture Nourishing body wash has a great scent, appropriate for male and female consumers.  It is a light soap, but works into a great lather, so a small amount will suffice, and you definitely get your money's worth with the 24 ounce bottle.  After using this body wash for several weeks, I have noticed a huge improvement. I can now say goodbye to itchy, ashy, or scaly skin after using this soap.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.
I love Dove Body Wash and this one for Sensitive Skin is really great.  I couldn't believe how much lather you get for the small amount that you use and it makes you feel ultra clean and soft.  It makes regular soap a distant memory of the past that will stay that way.  I have tried a number of Dove Body Washes and this one is right up there with my favorite.  Fragrance isn't overly strong like some other similar products.  Use this then a bit of lotion afterward and your skin will rejoice.
I have eczema and need as much skin hydration as possibly from a body wash.Have tried Axe products and others, but so far Dove and Olay get my votes as hands-down the best moisturizing body washes that you can get most anywhere.The scent isn't over-powering, it works in easy, and my skin feels like it retains water without getting dry an hour after a shower.That's all I ask from a body wash, and Dove delivers.
Previous to this wash I was using the Target brand version.  I was surprised by how much better this Dove brand worked in getting rid of the scaly dry skin on my legs.  It works really well as a shaving lotion for legs. A little of this goes a long way.  It does not lather up a great deal, probably due to the moisturizer.  Did not cause problems with my daughters super sensitive skin.I don't think I will use this during the summer, but I will purchase it for winter use when skin is so dry.
I have a hard time finding washes that won't irritate my skin.  This product works well and only a little is needed on a poof to make a lot of suds.  It also rinses off well and doesn't make me feel itchy.
I love Dove moisturizing body washes and the sensitive skin is my fave - I can actually shave with this stuff too, it's my fave body wash!
Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture Deep Moisture Nourishing, weird grammar on its lengthy title not withstanding, is an excellent hydrating shower cleanser. It has a very slight, light fragrance and is quite thick. You don't need much to get your body covered and the result is a genuinely smoother less arid skin.This is a luxury wash at a very reasonable price and if, like me, you're in a dry part of the country you can't go wrong with this 'nourishing' wash. You got a lot of product for your money and it does what it claims - mild cleansing with 100% natural moisturizers.
and makes my hair super shiny. I color my tresses about every 6 weeks, with a commercial hair color (no salons for me), and after using this shampoo for a few days I can see the difference. My hair looks vibrant and shiny -- and is manageable. Is this from the glycerin, the mica? Or ny of the other unpronouncable ingredients? Although there is very little Natural anything contained in this shampoo's ingredients, whatever the ingredients are, they are dong a great job on my hair.Since I will continue to use this every day until the bottle is empty, I will continue to post updates.
Once again I find myself delighted with a Dove product.  This company just can't produce a bad product.I like the shape and color of the bottle.  I like the creamy white texture of the shampoo.  And let me say a word or two about that scent.  While it's light, it is coconut, mixed with a hint of frangipani and passionflower.  It is wonderful, and while I usually don't like to smell a shampoo scent at all, this one is a huge exception.  It's tropical and spa-like.This has a creamy, dense foam.  It rinses out easily and cleanly.  My hair is smooth as silk afterwards, without feeling stripped.  Even my color looks bright and fresh.Would I buy a replacement bottle when this runs out? You bet I would!  This is one of my rare ten star reviews.  This is fantastic shampoo at a great price.
I'd recently gotten my hair colored with an "unnatural" red (as my stylist called it). It's a color I've had issues with fading in the past. I purchased a small sample of a salon brand color shampoo & conditioner in hopes that it would help prevent the fast fade. It didn't. I was fading just as quick as before and I really didn't want to spend more time in the chair to get it touched up. I switched to this Dove product and the fade stopped and the color has held and hasn't faded any further. I'll definitely continue to use this on my color-treated hair.
I have to admit that I've been dye my gray hairs for too long.Wanted to see how just how this works and it cleans your hair very nicely and surprisingly it doesn't "strip" the hair or dye.  Usually, every time I shower I would find some evidence that my hair dye is washing down the drain.  That wasn't the case here.It lathers very nicely, I'd say a lot better than the Tresemme-- which is supposed to do the exact same thing-- and after a few hours, especially coming from a mile walk in this Miami heat, it still feels great.Very nice product.
I have to say, this shampoo has a richer lather than any I've ever used. My hair tends to feel stiff and strawlike after washing, and gets tangled unless I use conditioner. While washing, my hair felt as if I wouldn't even need conditioner, due to the rich, silky  lather. However, after rinsing, my hair felt sort of stiff and greasy, as if it had hairspray in it.Don't let that fool you, though. Once my hair dried, it was soft and shiny. And the scent was light and pleasant. Definitely recommend this shampoo.
very gentle, and no offensive smellI think of Dove as soap but their hair products are gentle and smell almost fragrance free
I really like the Coconut scent of this shampoo.  It seems rich and earthy, while producing a nice thick lather and a clean feel when rinsed out.  I have been very impressed with this product.I'm not a shampoo connoisseur, but this shampoo seems great, and at a decent price.
First off, the smell is not floral or fruity, just a soapy smell, didn't really like the smell to much. It suds up nice, doesn't feel too heavy. It rinsed out easily and left my hair feeling silky and no tangles. I used this with the corresponding conditioner, and after I dried my hair it felt light weight and soft.I like how it makes my hair feel. My hair is colored and this shampoo is for colored hair. I don't like the overall smell, I liked the smell of the conditioner better but the shampoo smell is overpowering and I can smell it throughout the day. I been having trouble with static cling hair and I didn't have that issue after using this product.The bottle says it's lower sulfate vs their regular dove shampoo which I don't use. Also says nourished healthy looking hair keeps color vibrant for 8 weeks...not quite sure about thatBut overall I like the way it makes my hair feel
The Dove hair care line is becoming a quick favorite of mine. The Color Care shampoo and its partner conditioner sport a very light, fruity scent and the lather was as thick and creamy as you can imagine. The conditioner left my hair soft but with body too. It quickly rinsed out and left just a hint of fragrance behind. I would suggest you use half the amount you might ordinarily use of other shampoos and this stuff really lathers. I'm really loving this product and would definitely buy it to use regularly.
Normally I like to use a shampoo containing some sodium thiosulfate but this one worked well.  I think it was the glycerin, the first and most major ingredient in this Dove shampoo, that made it work so well.  Glycerin is way down the list on the Kirkland shampoo label, explaining a main reason this shampoo works a lot better.The heavy use of glycerin, a natural moisturizer, makes this a quality shampoo although it also increases the costs and thus price.
I used this product with the companion conditioner and it worked very well.  Hair was soft, manageable and color lasted well through the Hawaian sun, sand, salt and chlorine.  Good product.
The Dove Color Care shampoo is formulated with lower sulfate which is supposed to be gentler on color hair. It has a nice lather and I felt like it did a good job of getting my hair clean. It has a really nice scent and left my hair smelling good.The bottle is a nice size and fits in the shower nicely. I really like the line and will be using again.
I really like this shampoo.  It lathers extremely well without requiring a lot of the product and cleans my hair with a single application.  It smells great too! As for helping my color last, I really don't see a difference, but I've never seen a difference with any shampoo/conditioner that claims to increase color longevity.  I find that things like being in the sun, exercising, eating well, etc. have a much bigger impact.
I am one to buy all kinds of shampoo and conditioners. I love to try new products. It could be anything from salon to grocery store products. After using this shampoo, I like the way it lathers up right away, and makes your hair really feel clean after rinsing, but after I used the conditioner and blow drying my hair, it really made my hair feel healthier and lighter. I color my hair about every 5-6 weeks, and it can really dry out sometimes, especially in the warmer months. I also use a straightening iron, so my hair can really get damaged. This is a shampoo that I will be buying again.
I like this shampoo color care. It works great my hair feels great and the color seems to be staying a bit longer. I also like the smell. I use it with the conditioner it works great together.
I loved the light coconut scent. It made my shampoos very enjoyable. This a great whole family hair therapy conditioner. This shampoo is for color treated hair and works great on my colored oily hair.  My husband has normal thirsty hair while one son has thick oily and another has normal. This worked well on everyone.Follow with the great matching conditioning therapy (see my review of it and click yes if it helps)Dove Hair Therapy Conditioner, Color Care, 12 Ounce (Pack of 6)
I like to dye my hair sometimes with Manic Panic - I use this stuff instead of regular shampoo because semi's are known to always fade fast because of the harsher normal ones with all the chemicals and things. This stuff smells ok, leaves my hair soft and doesn't remove as much color per wash. Just add a bit of your semi dye to the conditioner and your color will be perfect for months!
I was delighted withDove Hair Shampoo, Color Care, 12 Ounce (Pack of 6)- not least because I am miraculously not allergic to this product.  (I am allergic to something in nearly all shampoos and cream rinses.)  The product left my hair soft, shiny, full of body and tangle free.  My opinion wasn't the best of it though.Shortly after the shampoo arrived my 16 year old granddaughter dropped in from the UK to spend part of her spring break with Grandma.  She does not have the baby fine hair that I do and her hair is unfashionably naturally curly  and of an unwanted color, so one day her hair is black, another red, and of course constantly subjected to a barrage of straightening irons and blow dryers.  TheDove Hair Shampoo, Color Care,did an almost miraculous job on her hair, leaving it glowing and healthy-looking.  She loved it so much we had to go shopping for more for her to take home on the way to the airport!Grandma's $0.02 - Outstanding product!  Highly recommended
Dove Color Care Shampoo  is part of the damage solutions range which are light, medium and intense damage.This shampoo is for all hair types and comes in a 12 oz bottle. It shampoos and repairs surface damage done by coloring to retain original color for up to 8 weeks with Vibrant Color Lock.This is a good priced shampoo and it's made here in The USA.
I have come to really respect the Dove brand. The Dove Color Care shampoo is another great product from that brand.First, it just smells fantastic. It is coconutty but not overwhelming. You don't end up smelling like tanning oil. The shampoo is thick and makes a nice lather. It rinses out quickly and easily (I have long hair and some shampoos take forever to get out). My hair felt moisturized and detangled even before I added the conditioner that goes with it. But with the conditioner it is just fantastic.
I used Dove Color Care Shampoo immediately after color-treating my hair at home. I use professional permanent color and 20 volume peroxide. Usually, right after using color, my hair has that feeling of wet cloth. If you color your hair, you know just what I am talking about. This shampoo gave my hair an improved feel after washing. Of course, I also needed to use a conditioner. I used another Dove product for that from the same line.While I cannot say that this product will make my color last longer, I can say that the texture of my freshly colored hair is greatly improved. The scent is absolutely wonderful, and it took a very small amount to wash my hair thoroughly.I've used this Dove shampoo with natural drying and blow-out styling, and the restults are equally impressive. I really do love this product and will purchase it again! I am happy to recommend it.

I wasn't sure about this shampoo. Sometimes Dove products have disappointed me. However, this shampoo has done a great job. It lathers up a lot and rinses well. Combined withDove Hair Therapy Conditioner, Color Care, 12 Ounce (Pack of 6)this shampoo does a great job on my hair. I color it about every 6-7 weeks so it often gets dry and fuzzy. This shampoo, with the conditioner, makes it soft, shiny and doesn't seem to strip the color at all.It does not have a super strong scent which may be good for those who are sensitive to scents.
Very nice shampoo- Lathers up thick and smells great- Washes out with ease- Love the way my hair feels after, very nice shampoo for thin color treated hair!
ThisDove Hair Shampoo, Color Care, 12 Ounce (Pack of 6)andDove Hair Therapy Conditioner, Color Care, 12 Ounce (Pack of 6)is one of the best I've tried for color treated hair.  It left my mid length over-processed hair feeling soft and full.  It has a mild fragrance that didn't overwhelm my senses, and my hair has nice shine & body.  The shampoo lathers up nicely using only a small amount, and rinses cleanly.I have tried many shampoo and conditioners for my color treated hair and most left my hair feeling very dry and the color still faded. This is by far the best combination I've found.Dove Hair Shampoo, Color Care, 12 Ounce (Pack of 6)I also appreciate the bottle designs.  Not everyone can see in the shower, and with these you don't have to.  The shampoo opens at the top and the conditioner opens from the bottom.
I used this shampoo and feel the result was everything I could expect in a good quality shampoo.  It is very lightly scented and the scent disappears after blow-drying.  I can't tolerate strong scents and was very pleased that I could not detect any scent after using this shampoo.  It gently cleansed my hair and rinsed out easily.  I followed up with the Dove Hair Care conditioner.I can't really address the aspect of color care since most of any applied color is long gone in my hair.  I have let it grow out and am going with my natural color.  But, it was gentle and smelled very pleasant.
This Dove shampoo has a very attractive, clean fragrance.  I have short/medium length hair and exercise twice a day regularly, so I need a light weight shampoo that I can use at least once per 24 hours without causing my hair and scalp to become "over washed."  This shampoo works great for my purposes, keeping my scalp moisturized but not oily and my hair soft without getting weighed down.  Highly recommended!
Dove Hair Therapy Color Care Shampoo is intended to preserve hair color rather than strip.  It has a mild, vaguely tropical scent and cleans the hair well.  It rinses easily but doesn't leave the hair feeling stripped.  It will take a while to see if it makes hair color last longer but it seems gentle enough to work.
This shampoo is a creamy white gel that lathers well with a clean light scent. It was easy to rinse out and my hair came out feeling very conditioned and moisturized. As far as color care shampoos go this seems like a quality shampoo, and the price is a great value. I am very happy with this shampoo and will continue to use it. My hair feels great and has extra body, when combined with the matching color care conditioner.
I really like Dove's line of shampoos, but I think this one is my new favorite.  I like the way it lathers up and how it smells.  It is also gentle on my color-treated hair (not sure if it has helped it, but it certainly has not hurt it).  It leaves my hair clean, smooth and fresh smelling.  I plan to continue using this shampoo.
I like a shampoo that enhances the color of my hair. Using this shampoo will let my hair stay dyed a little bit longer. I t does bring out the color and the highlights in my hair. I like that it cleans your hair very well. Use a little and get a big result. This also makes your hair smell so nice as well. Overall it is a great product. Dove always makes something that works well and smells great.
I have short brown hair with blonde highlights.  I have usedRUSK by Rusk SENSORIES BRILLIANCE GRAPEFRUIT AND HONEY COLOR PROTECT SHAMPOO 33.8 OZshampoo for some time now because it was what my stylist recommended, although I always felt like my hair felt like wet straw when I got out of the shower.  I was excited to be able to try this Dove shampoo (and separate conditioner) and I am so happy I did.Out of the bottle, this shampoo is thick and creamy, very similar to the consistency of Dove shower gel. The shampoo has a pleasant scent, although it is a little "perfumey" and not a natural scent like that of the Rusk I am used to.  Immediately after lathering and rinsing, I could tell a difference in my hair.  Before I even put the conditioner on my hair, it already felt smoother and not straw-like at all.  I used the conditioner, and my hair felt wonderful, and was very easy to comb out after towel drying.  I wash my hair every other day, and I was concerned that my hair would seem too greasy the day after shampooing, due to the extra "moisturizing" of the shampoo and conditioner.  My hair did seem a little more limp than usual the day after shampooing, but it was not enough of a problem to be noticeable.I am very pleased with this product and I plan to continue using both the Dove shampoo and conditioner.
It does take very little to cover your head with sudsy shampoo.  I quite like it.  The scent while using is good, but doesn't remain...no big deal.  The price is right, so this product  does fly.
I've always been happy with Dove products and this shampoo is no exception.This product does a very good job of cleaning my hair without stripping it of all its natural oils.The smell is very nice without being over powering, and it lathers quiet nicely with a very small amount. I like this shampoo and would recommend it to others.
I love this shampoo.  I color my hair about every 6 weeks and find that most shampoos will strip the color pretty quickly.  I could tell a difference with this one right away.  It's been about 4 weeks since my last color and it's still holding strong.  I use it with the same conditioner and I love the way it feels. It smells good, comes out nice and creamy and a little bit goes a long way.  I am very pleased with this and plan to keep using it!
This shampoo has a nice texture, it's kind of like a lotion with a little gel mixed in. It produces a nice rich lather and left my hair feeling squeeky clean without feeling like it completely stripped it of all it's oils. It seems to be good for color treated hair which can tend to be a little dry.  I usedDove Color Care Conditioner, 25.4 Ounceas a conditioner.  My hair has a lot of shine and feels soft after using it. Some of that is probably due to the conditioner, but I can't really use just a shampoo since I have very fine hair and it would end up very tangled after washing if I didn't use a conditioner.The price of this product is very reasonable and it does everything a good shampoo should do. It produces a good lather, gets my hair clean, and isn't too harsh. I learned a long time ago that it isn't necessary to spend a gazillion dollars on shampoos and conditioners with fancy salon names and packaging, when the results were identical if not better with many of the "supermarket brands". And I love the scent of Dove products. This has a light floral fragrance, just enough to make you feel good while shampooing but not enough to conflict with your regular perfumes or body care products.
my daughter loves this because she has allergies. and this is the first product she is not allergic too. I really loved it for that reason alone
This shampoo really does feel gentile on your hair.  It smells really good and is exactly like I was expecting something from Dove to smell like.  It has a creamy look and suds up very well.
I shower, and wash my hair, every day. I also like to put my hair through more abuse by styling and coloring it. I recently had an ombr&eacute; job done, so I was happy that I was able to receive this through the vine.Starting out, I only used a small bit, dime sized really, which turned out to be enough for my medium length hair. It lathered up very well, although the smell was off-putting. It smelled like hair dye, but none of my color was rinsing out. The smell continued until I styled my hair later on. However, it didn't interfere with my perfume, so I'm quite happy with it.After a couple of uses, while my fly-aways have neither increased nor decreased, my hair color has stayed as vibrant as when I came out of the salon. My hair looks and feels soft as well. (I also used the accompanying conditioner)The bottle itself is clean looking (yes, aesthetics in the shower), easy to grab with soapy hands, and dispensing isn't any better or worse than any other shampoo I've tried. I definitely plan on buying more of this.
The shampoo has a rich creamy feel to it when lathering it in. The smell isn't overpowering, which is nice. It rinses clean and my hair feels nice after blow drying. It does help slow down fading just as well as any other color treated hair shampoo. If you had to chose between this and something more expensive you will be just as happy with the Dove prodcut.
I am a senior gal with shoulder length, thick, color treated hair.  I am careful what hair products I use because I need a light fragranced product (respiratory issues) and I need a product that will not dry out my hair or scalp.I have used this product twice and really like it.  It does not over lather because of low sulfates, which is a good thing in my opinion.I use Dove unscented bar soap in my home and this Dove shampoo has a light fragrance, that at first I thought might bother me, but it did not.I used the Dove conditioner and the end result was clean, shiny hair.  I rarely use a blow dryer so I let my hair dry naturally and then used electric rollers (yes, I do use those :) and my hair, which is strawberry blonde in 2 shades and is always shiny, was gorgeous!  And, the main thing, the style stayed in quite a while even going shopping in 90 degree weather.Once my hair dried there was no lingering fragrance at all.I definitely would buy this and I am one of those people who have watched the tv commercials for months and it never occured to me to buy this product.I am so glad I had the opportunity to try it!!
I also received the Dove conditioner and both products are extremely effective when combined. However, the shampoo alone definitely requires conditioner for best results.Of course that's perfectly logical and if you prefer separate shampoo and conditioner then this is the product for you. I just personally feel that with today's 2-in-1 and even 3-in-1 hair and body wahes that two individual products aren't needed when one will do both easily and inexpensively.So the shampoo is great when used in conjunction with a suitable conditioner and it's one I recommend highly.
I've been using a product line called "curls"( I have fine, naturally curly hair) but I'm always ready to try something new.  Sorry, Paul, this shampoo works just as well and is a whooooole lot cheaper.I love the faint coconut smell. I've found that all shampoos and conditioners seem to build up after a few weeks so I switch to a different one for a few days. Garnier has one called "pure clear" which works very well and seems to remove any build-up. Then back to the yummy stuff. I think this shampoo works just as well , or better than, some of the more expensive shampoos I have.
this is my experience I wash my face and body every day with adovia sea mud soap, it smells really good like citrics , it makes me feel hydrated,  moisturized and fresh,  I love that is 100% natural. I know that it  to helps to relieve acne, psoriasis or eczema symptoms, I do not suffer for aything like that but for me works good. This is my second Adovia product and believe me I enjoy their products.
I received a wonderful Dead Sea Mud Soap from Adovia. I loved this Soap! I used it as soon as I received it. I really did help with my eczema and acne!This soap is recommended to help with acne, eczema, blackheads and psoriasis. For only $12 it is a steal on amazon! All you have to do is use it as you would any other soap! I love this soap and would recommend it to anyone!
I've tried plenty of products that claim to help with skin conditions but his one actually does. I can see a difference in the redness of my face by the end of the day when I use this versus when I use something else to wash with.It has no smell, doesn't stain my white wash cloths, and has a great lather.
I was not sure what to expect from the Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap. I am very happy with it. I normally do not use bar soap since I personally do not like the &#34;squeaky&#34; clean feeling of it. I prefer for my skin to be soft and moisturized after washing. This however feels just as soft as the dead sea mud mask upon application, it feels creamy with just enough abrasiveness while using to clean my body. I feel it does really great especially under the arms and on ly elbows and heels. My face well... it takes my makeup off quite well too. It does not irritate my skin in any way.
It&#8217;s always fun to pamper yourself, with new skin care products!  This soap removes dirt, bacteria and gently cleans your skin, while infusing it with essential minerals.  It helps keep your skin feeling purified, detoxified and fully cleansed, while hydrating and moisturizing it.  This soap was created with mineral rich black mud, from the shores of The Dead Sea!  I got chance to review this soap on my blog, Quick Tattletails.
I love this product simply because it works and instantly. It has a really good smell and texture. The price is perfect when you factor in the other products you will not have to buy just by selecting this one. If your on a budget like my family is, then I would recommend trying this product first because you really may not need other product and as we are all not the same I can not guarantee you my exact results but I can stand by the fact that it works.
I already love Adovia mud products, but this soap is totally amazing, it can clear up breakouts & acne overnight & sooth eczema.Mud is great for skin & to have it right in the soap is a win win, leaving your skin softer & feeling refreshed.Great for soothing bug bites as well & great for dry skin
I recieved this in exchange for an honest review.I didn't expect this to do anything for my psoriasis, yet it did!  And it's cheaper than any otc or prescription that didn't!Check out my full review at [...]
Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a low value free gift from the manufacturer forposting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions Ihave expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.The packaging is simple and elegant, a good representation of Adovia's product line. The Soap is an all natural black mud soap made of a combination of minerals derived from Dead Sea Mud, it has the word Adovia imprinted on it, and feels somewhat rough to the touch. Contrary to how the bar of soap feels in our hands, since I make a foam to wash my face it does not feel rough at all, instead it feel nice and refreshing.I apply it and leave it for about a minute then rinse it off, I dry my face and find that it feels clean and soft. Even after a few hours my face feels clean, and with just the right degree of moisture, it does not feel dry or greasy at all.I normally wash my face with a liquid cleansing soap, but if I was going to by a bar of soap to wash my face this would definitely be it.I wrote a more detailed review at our site, you are welcome to check it out at craftyspices {dot} com
I actually took a peek at what others were saying and I am kinda confused at the no scent remarks. I really think this smells very lemony. It's very pleasant to me. I love how this product is not tested on animals. It's a very nice little thick bar of soap and should last a while depending on how you use it.I have open pores and small black heads that are all around my cheeks. They aren't super serious but they are there and they bother me. I really do not believe in covering it up with makeup because I think that can just make things worse down the line. I have been using the soap bar on my face in the shower and on my body. It makes my skin feel a bit tighter and cleaner. Of course soap makes your skin feel cleaner but its a different type of clean feeling. You feel like your skin is fine as it is and you don't need to pile on all the foundation when going out into the world. My pores have visibly closed up to give my skin a more smooth and natural radiant look.My boyfriend suffers from rosacea , itchiness, and skin flaking and has been using this soap bar along with the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask. He has noticed his redness really has gone down to minimum. His skin isn't flaking as much and the itching has gone away. This is all with everyday use with the bar and bi weekly use of the mud mask. We both couldn't be happier with the results of this miracle bar and mud mask so far.Also, if you are hesitant because of the price tag, don't be! How many creams have you seen claiming to clear your skin up costing hundreds? It's a small fraction of the rest of that junk. You will not be disappointed and I would totally recommend this to anyone who is suffering from skin problems. It's abrasive but in a gentle way so you will have no problem using this on your face regularly like we do.
I really enjoy Dead Sea type of products, so trying this out was right up my alley. I absolutely have fallen in love with this soap!The smell of the soap is very natural and earthy, which if you have used any type of Dead Sea products before, you know what I am talking about. To use, I got into the shower, and rubbed the bar vigorously over my loofah creating a very nice lather. I then washed my body as normal. It felt so refreshing on my skin, almost rejuvenating. I literally had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling. I was able to get half of my body washed before having to re-lather some more soap on my loofah.  After I was done, my skin just felt so soft, smooth and supple. I do suffer from sensitive skin, and some skin issues, and this soap did not irritate or bother me at all.The next use I used the soap as apart of my facial routine. I rubbed the bar of soap between my hands, and again got a a nice lather going. I put it on my face and used a facial brush to gently exfoliate my face, and also clean and remove any dirt or left over makeup. After rinsing, my face was so clean and fresh feeling.I really enjoy this soap, and reach for it every time I am in the shower!Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.
It can be hard to find something that is strong enough to clean your face but still gentle enough to not irritate your skin- especially if you have eczema, psoriasis or acne! I do not have Acne but at the moment I have a couple hormonal breakouts and since I am washing my face in the morning and the night with this soap I am noticing that my skin looks much more balanced. Don't be fooled by the dark appearance! It foams nicely and the foam will be clear to white. The soap also feels very nice and light and also drys super quick so it is very hygienic to use. It smells also very nice and fresh! I recommend this!
Adovia's Dead Sea Mud Soap is a moisturizing bar of soap that hydrates your skin while it cleans.  I am most pleased that this soap is made from all natural ingredients and does not leave a heavily scented fragrance on your body.  The lather is very refreshing and does not leave black traces of residue on your skin or in the bathroom.  I have used this soap for my face which tends to be oily as well as on my body which is sometimes a little dry. The value of the price of this soap as compared to other facial skin care products and treatments makes for an real value for your money.  A great overall experience with this product and prompt shipping from the company.
I purchased this for my teenage son and it has done wonders to clear up his skin. This is a great product that is also gentle on skin. I would recommend this to anyone with acne prone skin or just to have around for a healthier face.
Don't let the dark color fool you, it won't discolor your face at all.  It has a nice pleasant scent and it lathers really well.  I have been using it by wetting my face thoroughly with warm water and lathering the soap on my hands and then rubbing it into my face really good.  Then rinsing my face with warm water.  Patting it dry.  I love the softness of my skin. I also love that there is no greasy residue.  I love the soft moisturized feel of my skin.  I also love that it is getting rid of acne due to hormone imbalance and shrinking my pores down so that I am getting no more break outs. My face has an all over moisturized feel to it.  If you are looking for a nice reasonably priced soap to get rid of acne, this is probably a good answer for you. It sure is working for me.  I would say that the price is well worth it ! I have told my preteen daughter to use it as she is complaining about breaking out on her face. We will keep using the Dead Sea Mud Soap and enjoying the benefits it brings us.  I am using this on my son who has eczema and he says that now he has no more itching on his hands.  This is an awesome benefit to our whole family.~ Linda ~
The Dead Sea Mud Soap is infused with minerals that are wonderful for your skin, while it gets rid of dirt. It is also known to help relieve acne and for people with psoriasis and eczema.It has a nice fresh scent which makes you feel clean and moisturized. My skin felt gently exfoliated and was just the right amount of exfoliation. I feel like my skin is healthier by using Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap. I'm going to continue to use it and would recommend it.
I love trying new products. I also love products that are natural and have few ingredients. I am an avid label reader. When browsing the aisles of a store in search of a new cosmetic or bath product, I do not purchase or use products that have ingredients that I cannot pronounce or that I would lose a spelling bee championship over if given the word to spell in the final moments. I have been sulfate (sodium lauryl and laureth sulfate) free for over a year, and have not used any shampoos, facial or body products that contain this yucky chemical. Sodium Laurel Sulfate is toxic and harmful to humans, plants, and animals. It irritates skin and causes skin to dry out, it is also a pollutant. I am always on the lookout for natural cleansing agents that are nourishing for my skin and that help draw out impurities and make my skin glow with healthy luminosity.I have always been fond of mud mask treatments and in the past would use mud masks that contained sulfur and charcoal. This combination worked wonderfully, however, the sulfur would sometimes be too strong and would irritate and burn a bit (Queen Helene Mint Julep Mud Mask) and the sulfur in some products (not the mint one) would smell like rotten egg. I recently had the opportunity to try out the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask and loved the results I had with it. I was super impressed with it and am loving the spa like luxury at home. I was happy to be able to review the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap the past 2 weeks and I have to say it is another great product as well.Enriched with Dead Sea mud, this low sudsing, SLS free soap that leaves your skin cleansed and nourished, but not stripped. Itcontains Dead Sea minerals derived from Dead Sea Mud, which make this a great light exfoliant for skin. The ingredients are simple and natural.Ingredients80% Palm/ 20% Palm Kernel oil, Dead Sea Salts, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Deionized Water (Aqua), Natural extract (Fragrance).I have used this every day for the last week and a half and have not had any problems with irritation and my skin has not dried out with continued use. It has a light pleasant fragrance, however, I do wish they would have put what was used to scent this bar as it only states &#34;natural extract.&#34; Despite this being a grey soap, I did not have any staining to my tub or shower, which pleased me. I have had some temporary staining from charcoal soaps that I have used in the past.I have not had acne in a long time since switching over the the oil cleansing method (over a year ago) and giving up sulfates and traditional facial cleansers, so I cannot comment on if this clears acne, as my skin is clear. I would bet that it is quite beneficial on clearing acne for those with problem skin. I do want to note that I did suds this up in my hands and washed my underarms with it as I had some bad razor hurn last week that would not go away. I had been testing out a new natural deodorant that had baking soda as one of the main ingredients and often my skin reacts poorly to baking soda. Baking soda as a deodorant ingredient works wonderfully at keeping odor at bay, but never seems to love my skin the way I wish it would. The baking soda had caused my razor burn to worsen tremendously and I was pretty miserable for almost 2 weeks. My poor armpits were red and angry with me and burned non stop. About 2 days ago I tried washing my crying armpits with the lather from this Adovia Mud Soap and I have to say, the redness has lightened a noticeable amount. My armpits and the rash is a lot calmer and healing nicely. My armpits are still slightly itchy, however, the burning has stopped.I know that Dead Sea Mud draws out impurities and toxins, and perhaps it was able to draw out the baking soda that had been slathered into my pores deep down? I am not sure, but I know it worked and this is what matters to me. This soap was also great on my face and neck, my skin feels refreshed and smooth and I like how clean it leaves me.I would recommend trying this soap if you are looking for something to gently cleanse you skin.If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &#34;helpful&#34; and or leave a comment.

I've been using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap twice a day for more than a week now and the first time I used it, I like the feeling after using it because my face felt squeaky clean. I didn't get any break-outs and it didn't dry my face up. I also have an oily skin type and I noticed that using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap helped in making my face less oily. I have 2 acnes at the moment because my time of the month is almost up but I noticed that it's not getting as BIG as my previous acnes.I'm not sure if it's relevant but I also noticed that even if I've been using it twice a day for more than a week now, the soap bar haven't become &#34;gooe-y&#34; or &#34;melted&#34; yet. Other bar soaps I've used becomes gooe-y and soft after several times of usage but the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap still retains it's original shape and guess what? The Adovia engraving on the soap is still there!
Before I even took it out of the box I loved the way it smelled. It wasn't overpowering or too floral, just right! The soap lathered easily. I used it just on my face. It was smooth without any grit, which was one of my concerns because of the dead sea mud. It left my face feeling refreshed. It didn't feel dry or tight afterwards either. I would recommend this product!I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.
I love that is great for Eczema, Psoriasis or Acne. I suffer from Eczema and found that this has helped my skin stay moist and clean. My face and arms feel super soft after using it and that is always a plus. I have noticed a change in the apperence of my skin, the pores have shrunk and it has left my skin really supple.
I just bought a bar of Adovia's dead sea mud soap to try out. I've used their Dead Sea Mud Mask so I had high hopes for this product.I have combination skin - oily on my forehead and nose but normal to dry everywhere else. The soap didn't dry out my skin in the areas that turn flaky with regular soaps and did a great job of cleansing my skin in the oily areas. I'm going to use this soap after my next workout as I think it will do a great job of cleansing the oily skin on my back and chest.The soap has a pleasant smell and isn't overly fragrant. I don't like soaps or cleansing creams that smell like a bottle of perfume.PROS:Great cleansing bar that doesn't dry out skin.CONS:This soap doesn't lather up like most soaps. But it's not that big of a deal, just use a bit more water and it will eventually form enough lather to wash your face.
The mud soap works both for my son's acne and eczema. With only just a week of using it, the acne and pimples have cleared up. What he likes about the soap is that it doesn't leave his skin dry. As for his eczema, the spots have lightened and the itchiness is gone. It works as a great moisturizer as well. We will definitely be buying this soap again!
Is Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap Worth Its Price Tag?In a word? Heck YES! O.K. that was two words but just one would not suffice. This mud soap help control oiliness while still hydrating skin. And because Dead Sea mud is known to treat skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis, and eczema you may find that this natural product lessens your dependence on other remedies.  I actually rub on the soap and let it soak into my skin a bit before rinsing and I&#8217;ve had noticeably smoother skin, fewer outbreaks and a lot less itching from my dry skin. Don&#8217;t expect it to lather up like your usual brand, however, it is all natural and does not contain any of the chemicals that make beauty products lather.As I already mentioned, my skin tends to be very dry and itchy and it wasn&#8217;t until I began using Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap that I finally had an epiphany. This soap doesn&#8217;t have loads of lather because all of its ingredients are natural. No sodium lauryl sulfate! Sodium lauryl sulfate is the ingredient in soaps, shampoos and household cleansers (!) that cause them to lather up, and its dangers are well known.* I&#8217;m extraordinarily sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate in oral care products. It makes my tongue and gums burn so badly that before I was clued in by a doctor I could only eat or drink items that were at room temperature. I was in misery. Why did it take so long for me to realize that it could be effecting my skin?Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.
This is my second Adovia Products that I have been using for two weeks.Yes! it's a Bar Soap that's great for my Acne skin! Let me tell you first , that  I usually don't use bar soap for my body/face.I always prefer face wash kinda stuff for my face & body wash/shower gel for the whole body. So far I have tried Dove bar soap  and recently fall in love with this amazing little soap bar from Adovia!! It is not a fancy bar but it's magically works great for my skin which is why I love it.As you can see, it's a dead-sea mud soap which is great for any skin type.This soap bar is mainly great for acne,  psoriasis, eczema symptoms.I don't have acne on my face that much but I do have bacne[ acne on the back] and sometimes it's so itchy that I wanna die!! This little black soap actually removes/cleanse those nasty  bacne and reduce the itchiness!! I am really impressed!! I have dry skin,so i wasn't sure at first that how it's react on my skin. I was happy to see that it's not only hydrates my skin but also moisturized!! My husband have lots of acne issues! So it was plus point to test this soap on him! He has also oily skin, so he used it and loved it! This one bar soap is quite costly;so we only use it on the effective areas.I highly recommend this soap to anyone! I am definitely gonna repurchase it for my hubby !!got this for free to review.
Right away I'd give them 10 stars after the first use.  This product is called Dead Sea Mud Soap, it's a product made for every skin type. This product is from black mud, found in the shores of the dead sea. You might be curious how mud will get you clean, well I'd be glad to help you out with that.Dead Sea Mud Soap:This product is created from mud that actually doesn't make you dirty, but clean! It's a mud that will actually remove dirt from your skin and infuse it with minerals as well as keeping it hydrated and moisturized. Your skin will be nourished by this mud and will look so much more beautiful than it already is. The truth is that Dead Sea is becoming very popular inbeauty cleansing products because it does so much more that any thing on the  market. It's not only taking away what you don't want on your body( dirt), but adding back what your body needs(minerals/nourishment).I can tell you when you receive your product it comes in a nice box, tightly packaged and in perfect condition. The box has the wonderful easy to read Adovia Mineral Skin Care brand written right on it. Once open you will notice the beautiful mud gray color of the bar soap. I noticed after the first use that it made my skin feel so nourished than any other soap I used before, even those organic soaps.  I know some of you may be like, why pay so much more for soap when you can get  it cheap for 1 dollar a bar at the drug store, but wait that won't do anything for your skin!Instead of making you look gorgeous it will dry your skin out maybe even ruin the natural beauty of the skin. That's why I believe in using good and healthy products like Dead Sea Mud Soap because it  will actually help you stay hydrated and reduce those horrible issues of Eczema and Psoriasis or even Acne, most soaps don't even do that!So don't just go by my word. Instead, just go and try it out yourself. Cause its time to play in the mud and get clean!
This product was given to me for free, in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated in any other way and my opinions are in no way influenced.I received this product very quickly and in perfect, brand new condition as described by seller.What do I think about this soap?This soap is not like your regular soap. I say this because it doesn't lather up the way most soaps do. It will lather up a little when you rub it in your hands or on a loofah, but it doesn't soften up. It also won't dissolve in a matter of days if you leave it in a wet spot. I love this because it will obviously last a lot longer than many other bars of soap.It doesn't really smell like anything to me. I like that because I don't like to use highly scented stuff on my face.I mainly use it on my face because it is my most sensitive area. I tend to break out occasionally a few times a month and my face sometimes dries up or gets oily in spots. What I like it that this soap helps balance those two problems. It must affect the pH levels of my skin. That's great. And yes it does clean my face VERY well. It doesn't feel greasy afterward or like it has soap scum. (A lot of bars of soap that I've tried do this sort of thing, so I was happy that this soap was completely different). It helps remove makeup from my face as well. It doesn't dry out my skin like many soaps do that are meant to help with acne.I have only been using it for a couple of weeks and I am very happy with it. I like to use this daily and the Dead Sea Mud Mask once a week. They seem to compliment each other very well.It's a great product and if you also suffer from skin issues, I think that you should most definitely try it out! You might love it as much as I do.
Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial, but all opinions are 100% my own.I use Adovia's Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, so when I was asked to review their Mud Soap I jumped at the opportunity! I just love their skincare line. Their products really do make my skin baby-smooth and have helped alleviate the problems I had been having with adult acne. I perform frequently, so it is really important for me to have beautiful skin. This Mud Soap works great as an all over body cleanser - I highly recommend it, especially for dry or acne-prone skin.Packaging and Shipping: this product was shipped in a timely manner and received no damage during transit. As always, Adovia has beautiful packaging that you might see in an high-end spa.
My daughter and I have been trying out the Dead Sea Mud Mask and she is also using the Soap. She has a little trouble with small patches of eczema on her face so we are always looking for something that will work for her.After using the mask and the soap her patches seem to be clearing up so she is pretty happy about that! We will also be trying out the Dead Sea Mud Shampoo that we just received so a review will follow on that too!!
I am not one for soap at all, but this soap is just great!It doesn't make my face feel dry or sticky, just clean and fresh. My redness has decreased since using it, and I have less breakouts on my nose, which is my biggest trouble area.Great product for those who have tried everything, and are ready to give up. It's a wonder product!
I like this dead sea mud soap it left my skin feeling really soft. I also like that it didn't lather too much, and it was still cleansing my face well. This soap smells great which is a plus. You can use this on any skin type. Overall, I like this dead sea mud soap works well with my argan oil or emu oil. Make sure you apply a moisturizer after using this soap, and you will feel the difference.Received this product for free through tomoson.com, all opinions expressed here are my own.
One of my favorite things is that it is made from 100% all natural products. That&#8217;s a really big plus for me. I like to know what I am putting on my face and using on my body. All natural is the way to go for me. I don&#8217;t have a bad case of acne but I am 60 and for some reason I am getting break-outs. I had enough of that as a teen. I really believe it could help after I see what it is doing for me. I have someone in my family I would like to purchase some for. I am sure it would make their life a little better.
I received the soap in exchange for honest review from Tomoson. The soap helped exfoliate and moisturize my skin. The soap is gritty to help exfoliate the skin. Your tub water will turn black, but your skin will be smooth.  I used the bar up quickly. Will purchase again.
I got this soap to try and I have to say I am in love.  I have very sensitive skin and  used this on my face everyday.  Helped take the makeup off and get my face clean.  It did not break me out at all and i can see the difference in just a few days.  It also smells wonderful.
I have used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap in the shower for a couple weeks. I've used it all over for washing as well as for my face. I like how it fells on my face, washing away just enough oil but not leaving my skin too dry.I know the Dead Sea Mud Soap has passed the test for my sensitive skin because it does not irritate my skin when I use it for shaving. I am allergic to most shaving creams, so I use bar soap to shave my legs. Not just any bar soap that you can buy at the supermarket will do, it has to be one that has more natural ingredients and not too much perfume, like the bar from Adovia.The bar itself is a little rough because I take it out of the shower so it dries put in between use. I actually like that because when I use it directly on my legs just for washing it fells like I am exfoliating a little too.It feels like the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap is doing its job washing and not leaving me too dry! It's a good bar of soap for me.
I never thought I would ever say that I could fall in love with a soap? Yes you heard me - SOAP !! I was recently sent a bar of Dead Sea Mud Soap for a Radiant Clear Complexion!  In one word &#34; WOW&#34; what a feeling. I have very sensitive skin and many products tend to make me feel irritated and burn. But this soap did just the opposite. It actually helped reduce the redness and feeling of irritation.If you suffer from acne, psoriasis, or eczema symptoms yourself. You know first hand what I am talking about. This is the product you must try- once you do, you will never go back to using another soap for your face and body. I tell you , I am like not wanting to get out of the showers !!!Disclaimer - I was sent this complimentary  product to try out. However, I only give my honest opinion.
As someone in their 40's who has suffered with acne for a good portion of their life, one learns to manage their expectations when it comes to acne products.  Nature's Gate acne product is not a cure all, but it does provide an effective regimen, which is similar to ProActiv, at a fraction of the cost.  While I don't believe any regimen out there is totally "chemical free", this one at least contains several natural ingredients, which aren't as harsh on your face as some of the other products I've tried.  I love the fact that it does not leave my face either dry or greasy feeling.  With average use, I believe the "kit" is meant to last for 3 months.I used the product for 4 weeks, and the following are my conclusions.1. The Corrective Cleanser has a very light feel, similar to shampoo.  Initially I questioned whether it was really working, but it does.  After rinsing it off, my face actually felt clean.  The cleanser itself has a mild, non-lingering scent.  As part of my shower routine in the morning and the evening, I also use a mild exfoliating scrub by Crabtree & Evelyn called Naturals - Solutions for Men (Daily Face Scrub).  The combination works very well for me.2. The Calming Toner removes excess oils that could block the pores.  It works fairly well, has a decent scent, and did not dry out my skin, which many alcohol based toners tend to do.  I just wish they gave you a larger bottle.  The problem with many of these regimens is that they tend to have a "one size fits all" approach.  I really respect acne regimens like AcneFree, which give you so much more for your money.3. I really like the Corrective Lotion.  My first test for it was, "does it leave my face either dry or greasy?"  To be fair, I must tell you, I have oily skin.  After a long stressful day, my face does not feel or look greasy.  The second test was, "does the acne treating component work for me?"  Well, so far so good.  The lotion contains salicylic acid, which is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts.  It works by causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, preventing pores from clogging up, and allowing room for new cell growth.  I think it also assists in evening out your skin tone.The long and short is that the product works pretty well for me so far.  Understand, though, that everyone's skin is different, and to effectively treat acne, you must find a combination that works for you.  That includes the right shampoo, conditioner, gel, face regimen, etc.  I wish I would have had that advice as a teenager.  I like the fact that this product is not harsh to my face and contains several natural ingredients.  For $25, it's worth a try.
This product is a much welcomed, effective alternative to the horrendous marketing ploy of Guthy Renker's product, Pro-Activ. This product was wonderfully packaged, had a pleasing scent and consistency, and has given results equal to or better than its competitor. And, now here this, ***purchasing this product once does NOT automatically enroll you in an automatic subscription to this product without your consent***. What a great alternative to being force-shipped the Pro-Active product only 3 months after your original purchase date, whether you want it or not! I highly recommend trying Nature's Gate's product to avoid this hassle, you won't regret it.
This is a three step cleaning system made of natural ingredients that are healthy for the skin.  Tea tree oil never smells that great to me, but I found the products to be inoffensive.I love that the bottles are clearly numbered in the order that you use them.  The wash (bottle one) is mild, but left my skin very clean.  The toner (bottle two) felt a little sticky.  Like there was some residue but after using it several times I find it works wonderfully.  The third bottle has concentrated liquid to put on troubled spots.  A little goes a long way.All in all, I am very pleased and like the idea of doing less chemical damage to my skin and still addressing the things I wanted to.  As always, I also moisturize.********* UPDATE **********It has been a couple of months.  I went to get a facial this past week and the woman who has been seeing me for years asked me what I had changed in my skin care.  I recommend this and will continue to buy this product.  What a difference.
While not a big fan of three step face regimes, I do like Nature's Gate products in general and this Acne Treatment System in particular.  Some reviewers have mentioned reactions to Tea Tree Oil. I have lots of allergies, but apparently no sensitivity to Tea Tree Oil. I only use this if I notice some breakouts, which as it is hot and humid where I live now...is this time of year. My sporadic use may be why I'm not showing any sensitivity, I don't know.  I like that these are somewhat more natural than other products out there.  They feel nice on my face and they smell ok. I like this product, but I recommend that you take a good look at the list of ingredients and decide if it is a good fit your.
I don't have acne but I get these big under skin pimples that really hurt and a few others.  I only used it a couple of times before passing it to my son that does have acne.  It really was helping me. For people without extreme problems I recommend this product.  After my son uses it a few times, I will update with his feedback of the product.
I have become more aware of the "bad" ingredients in many cosmetics and skincare products and have been wondering a lot lately about how I am going to keep my skin clear without slathering it with cancer-causing agents.  Then I stumbled upon this product!  The box says "Get Clear Skin in 6 weeks"; however, I've only used the product for a few days and already my skin is starting to show signs of vast improvement. (I will come back and update my review if this changes.)  The box comes with complete and clear instructions.  The packaging and labels on the bottles are neither feminine nor masculine.  It's pretty much "acceptable" for both guys and girls.  The products don't have a medicine smell or any kind of floral or girly smell.  The cleanser and toner are lightly scented, but it's nothing that lingers or bothers me.  I can be sensitive to perfume smells due to allergies, and this doesn't affect me at all.  The corrective cleanser and controling lotion bottles are labeled with expiration dates on the bottom.  If you are looking to try a skin care system that's as good as, if not better in my opinion, than the "leading brands" give this a try.Two additional notes: The lid on the toner leaks ever so slightly.  Beware if you are planning on traveling with this product.  Also, the bottles which contain organic product are not labeled for recycling(?).
My skin was very dry and irritated from my previous acne regimen when I started using this system.  Additionally, I believe I was breaking out more (before I started) due to the heavy moisturizer I was using to prevent the dryness.  When I started to use this system, my skin cleared up a bit more, and it didn't dry out so much that I had to use a heavy moisturizer.  I believe it does work without over-drying.
We use a lot of Nature's Gate products and have for years so when I saw they had an acne treatment system I was really looking forward to trying it.Two of my sons have had some acne problems for the past few years and I still get the occasional pimple myself so we were all looking forward to trying this out.The kit comes with three products, a corrective cleanser, a calming toner and a controlling lotion.The cleanser contains both Salicylic Acid (a commonly used acne treatment) and Tea Tree Oil. Both are good for clearing your acne, and they contain certified organic botanicals.The calming toner, as well as some of the other products, have a new product called Oligopeptide-10.  Nature's Gate is the first company to include it. It's a fusion of 15 naturally occurring amino acids combine with Salicylic Acid.  It's works synergistically to eliminate bacteria and fight your acne.The kit comes with a 4oz bottle of the corrective cleanser, a 4 oz bottle of the calming toner and a 2oz bottle of the controlling lotion.One thing I really liked was how nice it smelled. Each products had a different but pleasant smell.It works, we're seeing an improvement in our skin already.  I'd recommend this, it's natural and the price is right too.
I've been using this product for a couple weeks and I'm seeing improvements. I personally like how there is both salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide used in this brand. It did make my face red where I applied the product, but it goes away. I'm not a big fan on the scent, but it's not unbearable. Recommended for anyone with light to mild acne.
My daughter has problems with little tiny acne spots on her hairline and forehead. She used this one time, and the little tiny zits went away by the next day, and her skin is left soft and moist. With this new three step method, she can't go wrong. Thanks for letting her try this new product. She was sceptical at first, but now she loves it, and only does it once a day before going to school. She is only thirteen, and this has done wonders for her self esteem! Thanks for this wonderful product, she loves it.
First, I'd like to say that everyone's skin is different and so sometimes the only way to know how products like this will work on YOUR particular skin is to try it.I'm Asian and 30 years old.  I've struggled with acne here and there and have been on the Proactive system for over a year with mixed results.  My skin is better on Proactive, but not the best...I was not really happy with it and still broke out.  Proactive was also extremely expensive - $50.00 for the 3-piece system (they charge like 14.99 for shipping).I tried out this Nature's Gate system with a lot of skepticism and I was definitely surprised.  From the 1st time I used it, I felt that it was doing something.  It tightened my skin and I could almost feel my pores shrinking.  I'm Asian and my skin is naturally oily, so maybe that's why I haven't experienced the drying like other reviewers have.  Also, I use a very small amount.  Just a dime size amount is enough to do the job.  If my face is extremely dirty or has a lot of makeup, I'll use another soap to remove all that excess first, then use this afterwards, so it's working on a "clean slate".  Normally though I just go straight for this morning and night.I've been using it for 2 weeks now and am extremely pleased with it.  My acne has just about disappeared and my pores have definitely shrunk, I'm looking forward to seeing how my skin will be in a couple months of this treatment.  There is a pleasant smell to it, to me, it smells a little medicine-y, but not bad at all.  I can't believe how much better this worked for me and yet is still so much cheaper than the proactive.  I've cancelled proactive and am going to sign up for the automatic delivery here on Amazon.  That brings the price down to about $20.00.Definitely worth it!
I swim a lot outdoors in south Florida and am tan enough usually that I don't get a burn.  But my face does get pink sometimes and I needed something to keep the sun off it that wouldn't come off as I swim.  I had tried for many years to find this miracle product with no luck.  Everything I tried was no match for an hour at a time of swimming.Then I found this.  Now I can swim for an hour or more and not have a bit of sun damage or redness to my skin.  It is definitely gooey and greasy feeling, but for me that's a good thing.  That is why it stays on in the water.  And yes it IS hard to wash off, but again, that is what I was looking for.  It feels similar to vaseline on the skin.  It even beads up the water a bit.I don't find the flesh toned tint to be a problem at all.  I know this would be chalk white, and make my face look greyish-white, due to the titanium, if it weren't flesh tinted.  It is an exact match to my light beige skin.  I can't see it on my face at all. It blends perfectly.  I have medium warm skintone.  I love this stuff and am so happy I finally found something I can swim in and that is strong enough to keep the  afternoon sun off my skin in the tropics.  I wouldn't wear this as an everyday sunscreen due to the greasiness, but for someone who is outdoors in the sun a lot, and in the water, it's perfect.
This product is quite simply excellent.On the down side it's a little expensive, but when you consider your health, is cost really an issue?I used this on my children in 80-90F Mid West USA heat, so it wasn't tested in very hot climates, and I used it sparingly, and mostly on their faces (to supplement a more mainstream all over factor 50 for the rest of them). It goes on evenly, easily and quickly without the sticky residue or mess of old fashioned "total blocks" like Zinc Oxide cream that people used to plaster on their noses and look silly all day.It's hypoallergenic, and more importantly works exceptionally, even during exercise and swimming, and it was nice to see them without the tell tale red cheeks after a day out swimming, they have always had with other facial sunblocks.Factor 58? well, I've seen even Factor 85 recently, but even if you don't know anything about the subject the enclosed literature is easy to understand without blinding you with science.I highly recommend this product, especially if you are travelling to hotter climates including the Caribbean, and places nearer the Equator, where it is much easier to get sun burn.As already said, a little expensive, but you get what you pay for. Excellent results.
I love this sunscreen. It goes on very smoothly, the light tint is perfect for my fair skin -  doesn't make my face look white like a clown's (in fact it seems to make my skin look better) - and it is odorless.  I am happy to know that with its spf of 58 and effectivenss against both uvb and uva rays I am well protected.  I also think a tube will last quite a while since it doesn't take much to cover my whole face.
I am now a big fan. It isn't greasy. It disappears into my skin and it hasn't caused me any kind of blemishes or problems. I sometimes am blessed with adult acne...fun! So I am careful about what products I use.I am very careful about skin products in general actually. This doesn't have parabens and the sunscreen ingredients are natural, not the crappy ones that I can't spell or pronounce and that year after year we are warned to avoid as they seemingly promote cancer...which is what we are trying to thwart with the sunscreen in the first place. Cheap sunscreens are loaded with them...sometimes even more expensive products slip them in. You have to read and research carefully to avoid them as cosmetic companies love them since they are cheap and absorb better.I would definitely recommend this for children and adults. This is an excellent product and yes, it is a little bit pricey. However, I choose to save money on things that don't involve my family's skin, our health or our happiness. I can skip an expensive pair of shoes and spend the savings on things that are good for us. It is all about personal choices.
The Fallene Cotz is a very effective, non-greasy and quick absorbing sunscreen. One of the issues with many sunscreens is that they leave your hands and body greasy and have an over-powering smell.  Fallene Cotz is easy to apply, strong protection, long lasting, and perfect for sensitive skin.My only issue is the cost... Fallene Cotz is roughlu three times the cost of standard "Baanans Boat" varieties. If you value the high quality a high quality sunscreen then this is the product for you. While "Banana Boat" has sunscreen varieties that offer similar protection I often feel a "film" on my skin which is absent when I use the Fallene Cotz.Overall score -A+ for the productC for the costOverall - A-
To try out this sunscreen, I spent the better part of the day in full sun putting up a fence. No burning on or irritation on my fair, sensitive skin. I was in the sun long enough to actually get a tan line from my watch, but no redness or burning. Best of all, it either stays put when you sweat or doesn't have eye-stinging chemicals, because my eyes weren't in agony like they usually are 5 minutes after stepping out into the heat with sunscreen on. I used it liberally all over my face (and wasn't at all careful around my eyes--just closed my eyes and slopped it on) and had no breakouts or stinging eyes.I doesn't have an overpowering smell, and it absorbed quickly and didn't feel thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens. One weird thing: it's tinted, so it looks (and feels--I can't quite describe it, but if you've used liquid foundation, you'll recognize the feel) more like cosmetic foundation than lotion. The color didn't show up on my skin, but if you have smears you don't rub in, they'll be beige instead of white like they are with most sunscreens. It's a mineral-based sunscreen (whatever that means), so I'm guessing that accounts for the tint and feel.And as a control reference point, I did forget a spot (the 1-inch strip between the top of your jeans and the bottom of your shirt that's exposed when you bend over) and got badly burned there.One last note: I didn't wait 15 minutes before exposure, per the instructions, because I was in a hurry, but it didn't seem to matter for me.
This product works great. My daughter spends every day outside at a day camp with 6 year olds. Her nose was really getting burnt badly every day and I was worried about all that exposure to harmful rays. This product goes on smoothly and provides just the right degree of protection without that white pasty coverage so often seen with zinc products. An added bonus is the skin colored tinting that makes it invisible while still giving the sunburn prevention. The water resistance is very important too with all the time in and out of pools and other water activities. She does have sensitive skin and usually gets rashes with sunscreen but this one has caused no problems!
I was a bit nervous to apply this sunscreen b/c I grew up swimming on a team and our swim meets were outside - ALL DAY LONG.  Therefore we always applied zinc oxide to our noses which looked like clown makeup but it was great in keeping our noses from burning and therefore peeling.  This sunscreen contains the same zinc oxide but goes on smooth and blends in without leaving your skin white.  I felt like the coverage was far superior to the other sunscreens I apply to myself and my children.  Knowing that it won't breakdown as easy as the others when my kids are in and out of the pool all day long eases my mind.It is quite pricey for the size tube you get (2.5 oz) but you really can't put a price on protecting your skin from the harmful sun rays!
Fallene Cotz sensitive skin sunscreen is a nice product.  Used this on my redheaded son as he ran around outside.  It has a tan tint that absorbs quickly without a sticky residue but will stain T-shirts.  Natural ingredients like ultra-micronized titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are used for the sun screening.  Water resistant is a major plus for the swimming season.  It is also nice to not have any clashing fragrance to deal with.  The product only needs to be applied in an even thin layer and reapplied every 3-4 hours.  Well worth getting for the sun filled days.
Works well and is not that greasy considering the SPF.  Stays on like it should and doesn't stain clothes.  I didn't use it on my face, but I do have sensitive skin and thought it would be too heavy.  It didn't break me out anywhere else so far.  I'd recommend if you need a really high SPF.  It might be too much for your average person.
Fallene makes a number of wonderful suncreens specifically for the face. I like this one best out of all of them. First, the protection is amazing. I get sun spots easily and this is the only suncreen that protects my skin enough to prevent freckling and blotching. Second, it comes in a convenient tube. I can apply it anywhere with no mess. This suncreen is made of zinc oxide and titanium oxide rather than chemicals. This is an advantage because chemical suncreens break down with exposure to sunlight but zinc and titanium does not which is why it gives superior sun protection. I used to buy this from my dermatologist's office for $25 but now I can buy it for cheaper at amazon. Highly recommend!
For me personally - I got this sunscreen for one specific spot - my nose.  Almost all other sunscreens (non-oily, made for the face, etc) still leave my nose a greasy mess.  This felt like I was putting on an acne mask - in a good way.  It was a fairly thick consistency and tinted enough to see I was covered.  It felt like it soaked in and didn't leave me with a slick feeling (or a white nose).For the rest of my family - it's not just a nose thing...We used this on my daughter for an all-day, play outside kind of party.  It went on easily and protected all day (through kiddie pools and sweat).  My son also has a very short buzz cut and this protected his head on full sun beach days.  It's hard to beat spray-on sunscreen for kids, but if you have sensitive skin and those don't work for you, this certainly protects well.
This product absorbs well and leaves no oily residue like some sun screens.  My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily.  Finding sunscreens that work well with my skin has been difficult.  I actually like how this product feels on my skin and definitely like the fact that it does not irritate my skin.
Yes, it is a little "heavy", but it really works well.  Not only do I have very sensitive skin, but I burn easilly and have allergies.  I have used this everyday on my hands and not only did they not burn, but for the first time in 20+ years, my hands did not break out from touching grass!  Awesome protection!  I will definitely buy this again and again!!
I'm as pale and Irish as they come and after a week in the Mexico sun with only Fallene Cotz 58 SPF sunscreen to protect me, I'm happy to report that for once I did not get a sunburn. Maybe it was just dumb luck, but I was totally satisfied with the protections of the product. It's light, greaseless, and odorless, and sustains its potency even after swimming. I also noticed that fingernail breakage was kept at a minimum as well (another problem I have when I spend time in the sun and swimming), so I would have to say that it also moisturizes. The only drawback I noticed is my t-shirt managed to retain some of the tint from the sunscreen.I'm a believer and a convert now. I won't be spending extended periods in the sun without it.
I have tried just about every pore strip available and most of them, including the original Biore, have given about the same results. Application with the new Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strip is the same as before - you wet your skin, dry your hands then peel the strip from the plastic backing and apply to your nose. After about 15 minutes, the strip should be hardened to something similar to paper mache. Gently peel the strip away and you can see just how much dirt, sebum and blackheads are removed. After just one use of this newest version of Biore's Ultra strips, you can see a HUGE improvement over any other pore strip on the market. The strip itself is larger than the original and contains witch hazel and tea tree oil, both of which help minimize the pores and for me, have a wonderful soothing effect. I do think these strips hardened a bit more than the original so if you have sensitive skin, you will want to be especially careful when pulling them off. My only negative comment is the cost - all of the other Biore versions of pore strips (along with other brands) are much less expensive. But even with the premium price tag, you will never go back to anything else.
The trick I've found when using Biore strips is to make certain the strip gets very wet/moistened. The more water, the more the glue on these sticks to your face, and the more stuff it will pull out when you take it off. Just be certain to leave the strip on till the strip is very dry and solid. That way the glue has attached to everything it's going to, and will come out with you pull it off. Biore strips are also great for using on the chin, not just the nose.I was teen and Biore first came out with their Pore Strips and loved the idea that something could pull blackheads out of your pores. I found that the more open your pores are, the better these work. Now all these years later my pre-teen daughter uses them to help her complexional. One thing I have found is they don't exactly pull anything out from the tops of your nose, but it's a magnet for anything in the pores on the sides. That's where you really notice these working. What these strips pull out from the sides, you usually can't even see before they pull them out. It's similar to the experience of waxing your eyebrows. When you wax, you're expecting to see the dark eyebrow hairs get pulled out, but are then surprised to sell a bunch of fine light colored eyebrow hairs there as well you didn't even realize were there to begin with. These strips work the same way, pulling out some stuff you didn't realize was there.
I really like several face care products with tea tree oil and like that these strips feature it on the pad along with witch hazel. While you only get 6 strips in this box compared to eight in the boxes that aren't "Deep cleansing" these are cheaper, so the price per strip basically evens out. I looked into this because I was contemplating taking ordinary strips and moistening them with tea tree oil and witch hazel instead of plain water if these had a much higher purchase price.If I ever found a great deal on the plain ones, I would still try this technique out as I really feel like these offer slightly better results beyond the clean scent and tingly feeling they provide. Despite the fact that I cleanse before using regular strips, I still felt like my nose was nicer looking in terms of smoothness and pore refinement after the "deep" ones.
I have had terrible blackheads on my nose for a few years now.  So I decided to try these and I have been pleased with the result.  The scent of the oils is a strong one, but invigorating nonetheless.  I don't really see a lot of dirt or anything like that when I pull the strip off, but my nose has been clearing up so they do work.  I plan on continuing with these since I haven't had luck with anything else and these do clear up my nose.
These Biore "Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strips" work great at removing pore clogging dirt from your nose and it is oddly satisfying (if not a little gross) to see the results. My teens have used Biore products with good results for years and this is decent addition to their skin care regimen.Using as directed will keep your nose pores clear but it can be a little rough on dry skin during the winter months. My kids have noticed an improvement in their completions since starting to use these at night.Highly Recommended!CFH
I very much like the original version of the Biore strips, and was interested to see what the "ultra" version could do. They perform very well, but I really can't discern any appreciable performance difference.The ultra has some additional ingredients (tea tree oil and menthol) not found in the original version. The ultra also boasts of having witch hazel, but that is also found in the original. The ultra has a scent, which I assume is due to the menthol; the original does not have a scent. It's not a bad scent, but it didn't do much for me - I'd just as soon have it not be scented.The ultra is supposed to do everything the original does, plus "invigorate." I didn't experience any invigoration. It worked just fine, but no difference in end-results from the original.Both work very well, and deserve 5 stars. However, given the price per strip differential (the original comes 8 per box versus 6 for the ultra), I'll stick with the original (and my deepest apologies for not being able to resist that phrase).
My Wife and I both use the Biore Cleansing Pore Strips. These work wonderful. We have used Biore and Pond's and these work much better than the Pond's brand. It is unbelievable how much is dirt is under the skin on your nose. When used properly the strip is usually full and looks like a porcupine. They leave your nose clean and smooth and you can really feel the difference. You can also use these strips on other areas of your face as well.
These Ultra Deep Cleansing Pore Strips are grossly satisfying. All you need to do is wash your face, wet the target area, apply the strip, let it dry for 10-15 minutes, and strip away hairs, blackheads, whatever is on or near the surface of your skin. When I looked at the strips after I was done, I could see all the debris they pulled out of my pores. Yuck. But hey, that's exactly why I used them. My skin felt remarkably smooth after I did it -- I couldn't believe that these could make such a difference with the surface texture.The instructions say to use them only on the nose, but since Bior&eacute; uses different shapes of the same material for different parts of the face, there should be no problem also using them on your chin (as I did) or forehead. The shape and slits are designed to fit the nose, of course, but they can just as easily fit on other areas.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
The cleansing strips are made especially for the nose, but my neediest area (I have no idea WHY) is my chin, and they do an amazing job there! Of course I also use them on my T zone to keep those pores clog free, too. Recommended!
I love the way these strips make my face feel after I peel them off.  O love seeing all the dirt and gunk that came off of my face.  These strips are even easier to use than they used to be.  Just make sure not to use them more often than recommended or you could really irritate and dry out your skin.  These are a great way to deep clease the skin.
It has been forever since I have tried a nose strip. I was expecting a forest of pore residents to be standing on the pad when I tore it off, but I guess I must keep my face cleaner now; several pores made benefit of the deep-cleaning of the pad, nonetheless. It is refreshing putting one of these to use.The process is easy; all it takes is me washing my face [and nose], leaving my nose wet, peeling off the patch backing, applying  the patch and pressing firmly with dry hands and then waiting fifteen minutes or so. Once the strip dries to the form of my nose, I slowly lift up on the edges and voil&agrave; - clean pores!Not to be gross or anything, but this is much easier, and likely better for the complexion, than scrunching and squeezing. I do not want capillaries showing when I get older. Bior&eacute; strips are bomb!
I used the original Biore strips all the time as a teen; this new version is a significant improvement.  It's easy to apply, softer and covers more area that the original Biore strips.  With the tea tree oil and witch hazel, it gives a nice cooling as it dries.  I could smell the witch hazel, but it wasn't unpleasant and had sort of a refreshing, clean scent.  Removal was painless (none of the ouch factor that I remember from the originals!) but they are nonetheless quite effective; my pores are noticeably smaller, and my skin looks smoother and much clearer.  I am definitely a fan of this new generation of pore strips.
I use these regularly and find their effectiveness excellent. They remove blackheads. Period. I don't find the removal part painful if you do slowly. No allergic reactions and love it!
