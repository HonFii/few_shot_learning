I love Oil of Olay. My primary moisturizer is Oil of Olay Total Effects 7 in One and I love LOVE the creamy fine odor-free texture of the Total Effects but this one is just a weird feeling on your face. I also did not notice any results from using it. I think I even tossed the rest and I've never done that with a cream. Pretty sad it didn't turn out good as I do love the line of Oil of Olay.
These will not stick long enough to pull out anything even when I apply them to a very dry face. They certainly do not "lock on and pull out dirt".  I was hoping to pull out a blackhead but so far I have tried 3 of them and they just become loose or fall off long before the 10 or 15 minutes recommended to leave them on.  Maybe the batch I got isn't sticky enough?  Not recommended.
I'm 43 and these strips have been around for some time now. Over the years, I have tried these strips and was left disappointed. I'd stop then years later try again, hoping the product had been improved. Each time, I came away with the same result, disappointment.I have pretty oily skin and get acne in my nose and it enlarges my pores. I got these strips again a few weeks ago, again, hoping they'd improved. But they didn't. These strips cost $8 for 14 strips.I  used an entire box and each time I used one of the strips, it didn't work. The instructions say leave on your nose for about 15 minutes, which I do. When I remove them, the strip is clean and fails to serve its purpose. I think its safe to say, I'd never buy or use these strips ever again. Sorry Biore', for me, these strips were a flop.
I'm not into smelly product.  Even things like Dove that has a fairly neutral scent.  The smell from this product is still on my skin 12 hours later.  YUCK--  did not bother my skin at all--  lather was so so (not overly sudsy however not as strong a lather as I would like)would have given it 3 or 4 starts except for the lasting scent...  But the scent just annoys me.  Feel the need to take another shower with something that won't leave a lasting scent.
I always expect great (or at least somewhat noticeable) results with skin care regimens...so that's what I was expecting with Nature's Gate. Unfortunately, I didn't get the results I was hoping for.Honestly, I didn't see much change at all (except for a dried out face). Granted, I didn't use the product for the entire month--but I figure if I didn't see any noticeable results after two weeks, I probably wasn't going to see any after a month.
I have adult acne, and broke out worse than a teen after a month of using this. I really wanted it to work, but benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid works better than this with my positive attitude.
Before I explain my one-star rating, allow me to share some background:1) I have extremely fair skin; I use SPF45 (waterproof & sweatproof) year-round, and I still get sunburned now and then, even with all my precautions. (The pic in my Amazon profile is the closest I will ever get to a tan.)2) For the most part, I have always had good skin, until I had my first child -- I've had more outbreaks in the past three years, than all my teen years combined.  My acne is definitely at the mercy of my post-pregnancy hormones.3) My main problem is blackheads (which I usually just use Biore strips for), and I've never had to deal with some of the more extreme problems you see in dermatologist commercials.4) I am only allergic to latex (i.e. balloons, gloves, etc.); I have no other allergies. I am not allergic to any of the ingredients listed on the product; I have used similar products in the past with no problems.I used this product for the first time last night. I read the directions-for-use very carefully, and followed them precisely.  I was not using anything else; I didn't scrub my face.  Again, I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail.First I washed with the cleanser; I didn't feel anything, and I didn't see any changes to my skin (I didn't expect any immediate results).  I used the toner next; it smelled great, but I noticed a tingling sensation in my skin...still no cause for alarm.However, after I used the lotion (and I used a tiny amount for a "thin" layer just as the directions instructed), my face felt like it was on fire! I tried to rinse the stuff off with plain water, and I was left looking like a chemical-burn victim...it's drastic.I have absolutely no idea why that happened, but I will not be using this product ever again.  Maybe it would work for some people, but at this point, I would not recommend it for anyone else with fair skin.  I gave it one-star because this morning my face still looks like it's been burned.  I feel much safer using natural products likeBurt's Bees Natural Remedy Kit.
I've used a lot of sunscreens living here in south florida but this was about the strangest product I've ever tried. It comes out of the tube like light tan pancake make up and is thick like toothpaste. They claim it dries clear but it doesn't. It leaves you looking like you either just rolled out of a coffin after a year of being locked inside or you are joining a band of street mimes. I mean really, this product makes your face look like you are dead not to mention the extremely heavy slimy feel that completely clogs your pores. Hard to believe anyone would put something so awful on the market. OK it's SPF 58 but I would rather go out in long pants and long sleeves and wear a face mask then use this product. It also stains your clothes the same awful beige/tan color, nice! You can get a giant bottle of NO-AD that works just as well for a fraction of the price and no stains on your clothes or the look of death. Stay away!
After using this product for over a month I defintely would not recommend it. I thought the plates would create less damage but it caused more damage to my hair than my previous flat iron. Maybe if you only use cheap flat irons this would be a good product and cause less but my Solia Flat Iron never caused the amount of damage this does in a month's worth of use. My recommendation is if you value your hair to stay clear of this and invest in a good flat iron.
I have the Remington Shine Therapy straightener and it works very well, so I thought this one might work well too, in addition to protecting my hair from the heat.  Well, it doesn't straighten hair very well, so I can only imagine that by using the product for an even longer time trying to get hair straighter, my hair would get just as damaged.  I will just stick to my old straightener.
I purchased this because I have broken capallaries in my cheeks from sun damage. Most people say they don't notice it, but it's something that bothers me. I hadn't realized how strongly tinted green this was. You're pretty much smearing mint green all over your face. It doesn't sink it for me, just smooches around making my face patchy green. I used only a small dab and it really wasn't for me. As just a regular lotion without the tint I'd probably like it, but I just couldn't get past the weird green. I just live with my slightly red cheeks, and consider it built in blush for now. I think using a tinted moisturizer is easier to use then this stuff. I continue to look for a good moisturizer with spf(preferably 30 and over).
First, know that a little of this stuff goes a LONG way.  After using it for a few weeks, there was no difference in my skin tone, texture, or anything. I took before and after pictures. No difference.
The formulators really need to go back to the lab with this one, aesthetically-speaking.The product has an offensive odor, more so than usual (I know most wrinkle creams smell bad).Secondly, it goes on greasy, leaving a very visible oily sheen to your face. My Pond's brand cream with the same claims goes on smoothly and is absorbed into the skin within a minute or so. This product sits on top, so much so that I use a washcloth to try to wipe it off before applying my makeup.Thirdly, the packaging feels cheap. It is plastic with a metallic-looking plastic lid. They should have made it glass or obviously plastic instead of trying to make it look expensive before you touch it.This is my honest opinion. I hope the product works for someone, but it does not work for me.
I have sensitive skin.  My issue is usually with fragrance.  I also have dry skin.  I was very excited to try this product.  Unfortunately, my skin broke out into almost immediately after using this product.  Some bumps were pimples and some were hives from reacting to something in this.  I also had my mom try the product (she has normal skin).  She did not react immediately, but after a couple of days the product was also bothering her skin.  I would NOT recommend this product!
When I first had the opportunity to try the SpaSensials product, I was thrilled!  As someone who lives in a rural area, I have good use for hand and feet softening products.  I tend to get dry hands and feet and the thought of placing a glove and sock on with high intensity moisturizing capabilities was a very exciting prospect.When I got my package in the mail, I planned that evening to try my first application.  Here is what I expected based upon the claims on the box (I am quoting here):" Intensive one-step moisturizing and conditioning Hand & Foot Treatment System..... Advanced Technology helps SpaSensials intensive conditioning formula to quickly and effectively absorb into the skin"There is a little graphic in the box that illustrates how other skin technologies leave little droplets of moisturizer on top of the skin and SpaSensials have the droplets actually break through the surface of the skin, moisturizing from the inside at a sublevel.Wow.  This promised to be some kind of wonderful product!That night while we had family movie night, I quickly opened the box to prepare to be pampered.  Inside the box were two exfoliating buffs, two pair of softening socks, and two pair of softening gloves.I was not going to waste any time.  I was doing both my hands and feet- and I could not wait.The first thing I did was open the exfoliating buff.  I wet the pad to activate the cleanser.  I used the rough side for exfoliating my feet, and I use the smooth side for cleansing them.  It felt nice and the cleanser was pretty decent, although there seemed to be more suds than anything substantial (I am a person who is very interested in cleansing agents so I observe more than most people, I am sure).After that, I dried my feet and hands and then I put the socks and gloves on.  The smell was delightfully herbal with a touch of florals.  It felt a little odd at first- sort of like wearing plastic gloves on a very humid hot day.  However, I got used to the wet feeling and sat back to watch our movie with the family.The instructions say to leave on the socks or gloves for 15 minutes and that the moisturizers stay on the inside and not the outside.  This is true- it is possible to use your hands or feet if you need to walk or pick up something, but 15 minutes is not too long to wait if you can.After the socks and gloves are removed, I massaged the rest of the moisturizer into my hands and feet also as instructed.MY EVALUATION:I could not wait to have my soft hands and feet after doing this process.  At first they felt pretty nice, but honestly, I get the same experience from putting on hand or body lotion and putting on gloves or socks.  Yes it can be a bit more messy, but I could use plastic bags from the vegetable dept under the socks and get the same results.I tested this product in two ways- sticking by the instructions exactly, and then the second time, leaving the gloves on for over an hour and the socks on over night.The results were that the longer application made my skin a little softer, but what disappointed me is that my skin only stayed soft for a few hours.  By the next morning (or in the case of the overnight socks- 8 hours later), my skin was just the same as if I had not used anything at all.I get better results from some creams than I do this.  Perhaps if they gave plain exfoliator pads which allows the consumer to use a non-Sodium Lauryl Sulfate impregnated cleanser (which dries out skin terribly) that could give a better improvement in the long range effect of the moisturizing part- but I don't know.I was very disappointed at the short range effect of this treatment.  It really was non-stellar in performance after such a short time that I have given it 1 star.  I just don't think that it does very much - and certainly in my experience does not live up to its claim.  I have some other moisturizing creams that do a better job than this does- without gloves and socks.The fragrance of the moisturizer was lovely so all of my efforts were not lost, but I would like to see someone come out with a better more effective product that really leaves skin truly moisturized for more than half a 24 hour period.
I was very excited to try this Bio-oil as I use natural products for skincare most of the time.  I believe that I can get better results using natural products than any other products as a rule.This product claims to be good for reducing stretch marks, scars, and skin unevenness.  What a deal!So the first day I received it, I began to apply it twice a day to a prominent scar on my foot- and I applied this product each day to my foot completely, leaving the other food untouched.  That way I could compare the results in time.Well, after almost two weeks, I can honestly say that there was no observable difference.  Now the instructions say that you are supposed to give it three months, but I wanted to review it BEFORE then.There has been no change at all in my scars or my skintone of the foot, so in my opinion, that is just a bit too long for me.The other thing I am not fond of with the Bio-oil is that it comes in a plastic container, but contains mineral oil.  Oils will leach plastic from the container over time, so that is a concern to me.  Also, I do not like using mineral oil which is a cheap more unhealthy way of stretching cosmetics.If this had Almond oil, or apricot kernel oil as a base, it would work much better.The oil does NOT soak into the skin as promised, it does leave a greasy film on the surface, although it could be worse.  I have tried worse products than this.The fragrance is very fake smelling and extreme.  My daughter thinks it smells like bug spray.  I find myself recoiling every time I try to smell it.  For having lavender, rosemary, and a few other oils in it, this sure smells chemically fake to me.  I use essential oils constantly so I am used to using all kinds of strong natural fragrance.This is not a fragrance I am fond of.
I was a bit skeptical about this product to begin with and after using it a few times my initial opinion remains. The Bio-Oil is too sticky and uncomfortable to put on. And after it is all over your hands, it takes a long time to wash off. And I really can't see this oil getting rid of stretch marks because there is nothing in the ingredients that would help at all.Stick with another creamer or something a bit less harsh. This product is not worth it.Kate Garrabant
The timing on this product was excellent for me. I had just had surgery, and I was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance, redness, and tightness of the scar.The product arrived, but I wanted to give myself a little more time to heal so I held back from using it. I'm on antibiotics which are drying the heck out of my skin. Seeing the bottle, I used a little on the dry skin on my wrists.The oil had a lovely scent; the oil went on and sat on my skin like...well, like oil. And I had used a drop for both hands! I had to wipe the excess off if I did want it on everything my hands touched.A few hours later, I noticed an army of little red bumps on the back of both hands. The rash wasn't itchy but definitely noticeable. A day later, I still have dry skin on my wrists, but now it's dry skin with an obvious rash. But at least it's not itchy!What's shocking is that I'm usually not allergic to anything. What's fortunate is that I tried this first on my hands instead of on my tender, sensitive surgery scar! I don't want to think of what it would've done!This product may work for some people. I'm not one of them. Considering that I'm fairly hearty with products and don't get allergic reactions as a rule, I'd be careful before I applied with stuff slapdash to any iffy places on the body. This is one rash you really don't want.
This review is for the manufacture of the item and for the customer that saw the avertisement and was misled.I do not feel I am the right person to review this item as it was not for my hair type. No where on the label or in the advertizing did it say that it was for African American men or women but it clearly was so by the directions. I think in our world of politically correctness we are missing a great deal of joy for lack of celebrating each others differences or cultures. I am a German American woman and this product does nothing for me because my hair happens to be different from my African American brothers and sisters. I threw the product away but I would hope that an African American would get the product and give it a raving review.
Although, the scent was delectable, I'm not a fan of the Motions Lavish Conditioning Shampoo.  My hair was difficult to untangle and it left a residue on hair/scalp.  I wouldn't purchase this shampoo even if it were on sale.
I didn't realize this was for ethnic hair when I selected the product to review.  It left my hair heavy feeling and unpleasant smelling. I gave it to my daughter who said that it was "really weird shampoo".
To me the smell of this was just plain offensive, it actually made me feel nauseous. I did use it once but had to re wash my hair three times to get the very strong smell out of my hair. Apparently this is for coarse ethnic hair which was not clear from the description but when I went to the product website it shows only models of color. After learning that, it of course was not intended for fine blond hair, so I won't bother with details on how bad it performed on my hair type, lets just say I looked like I stuck my finger in an electric outlet! No matter who this was intended for, the smell is just way too much for me but thats just my opinion.
Words as advertised but the fragrance is terrible so I don't plan on using this product.  Headed for the trash can.
I've never tried a wrap lotion though I've had my hair wrapped many times. I washed my hair with Nexxus shampoo and conditioner as usual. I also applied a leave in conditioner before using this wrap lotion. The lotion went in easily. I hated the results. My hair was dry and stiff and generally a huge fluffy mess.1 STAR: It didn't work for me at all. It was pretty much a nightmare. This is hitting the trash can. Motions needs to work on their scents. There's a slight fragrance, but mostly, it smells like chemicals.
I gave this to my 12 yr old granddaughter, who gave it back to me after saying she has 2 different wave machines & didn't work at all.  My friend said she'd try it & said it did nothing for her hair.  I personally don't have enough hair to curl.
My daughter tried it and she couldn't stand the smell or texture, so she refused to use it. It might be a great product if you like the scent.
I've tried this several times, hoping it might work. But it leaves my hair looking dry, and full of static electricity. A really lousy detangler also. I might give the rest away, or pour it down the sink. My regular Pantene works far better.
OMG! This product was scary. I'm not sure what happened. Maybe it contains some ingredient I am allergic too but I thought I was going to have to go to hospital after using this product. I am not sure what happened. I was in the shower and conditioning my hair and brushing my teeth at the same time. By some mistake some of the foam went into my mouth; no biggie. I spat it out and continued with my routine. Not 10 seconds later, I felt my mouth start to go numb and feel like it was swelling up. I have never had this happen to me before in my life. I was so scared that my mouth was going to swell so much that it would block my air passage. I immediately washed it out of my hair and threw out the conditioner, my toothbrush an toothpaste. Sorry but I will not be using this product again.
I just finished posting a review for the shampoo made by the same folks as this conditioner.  I was not any more fond of this conditioner than I was of the shampoo.  This product, when dispensed from the bottle also comes out thick and gel-like but you rather expect more of that with a conditioner.  This was masque like and rather difficult to rinse from your hair.  I also didn't care much for the fragrance.  I personally like a lighter shampoo and conditioner than what is offered in this line of products.  If you feel the same way I suggest you don't purchase this one.
This Motions at Home Moisture Plus Conditioner has got to be one of the worst conditioners that I've ever used. The conditioner smelled horrible and was very unpleasant in the shower. I would've tolerated the smell, but there were more problems with the conditioner.The conditioner took a long time to come out and the results were pretty disappointing. The conditioner did not work as a conditioner at all. It left my hair feeling very heavy and not soft at all. The experience was very disappointing.I tried the conditioner a few more times and got the same disappointing results. I won't be using this conditioner again. It's debatable as to whether or not this even qualifies as a conditioner at all. I do not recommend to anyone. I would give it zero stars if I could.
You have a body lotion, a face lotion, a hand creme, a foot creme, but no hair lotion!?! Why not? Why limit yourself to after-the-shampoo leave-in or style products.One reason would be that the ingredient list here consists of mineral oils, which generally trap moisture and do a lot more damage than they are worth. Another is all the other chemicals in this product.This oil moisturizing is a good idea but doesn't really provide the moisture necessary for your hair to thrive, so that you feel your hair become even drier after use.
I used this on clean, damp hair prior to blow drying. This lotion is creamy and is meant to be used sparingly. I have shoulder length hair so I used an amount that was less than a dime in circumference. I rubbed it in the palms of my hands and then circulated it through my hair. The end result was unimpressive. My hair seemed a little oily and looked darker. Other than that, it really didn't do much in terms of truly moisturizing my hair and giving it body and/or shine.Just an observation here, but this product contains mineral oil. I have never had anything except greasy hair when I've used products with mineral oil. This may just be my problem, but if you've had problems with products using mineral oil I'd suggest you not buy this product.I'm sticking to my daily conditioner that leaves my hair clean, soft, and shiny.
I did not want to put this in my hair when I opened the bottle. The smell was so bad it's describable. Being a trooper, I attempted use anyway. Huge mistake. I rubbed a tiny bit in my still wet hair, then dried and styled as usual. My hair looked like I hadn't showered in weeks. It sort of matched the smell, I guess. It was weighed down by the product and looked oily. It was plain nasty.It took a couple of showers to get the oil completely out and for my hair to resemble something normal. What a mess. This is the worst hair product I have ever tried.
This is somewhat comparable to another moisturizing pink oil that we often had in our home while growing up. That one was heavier/greasier to help with flyaways and to make our braids neat. Although this product,(Motions Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion) is also pink and in a similar-looking bottle, it is NOT the same.Though they are both mostly water and mineral oil (I have only recently found out that MO is not good for use on hair), this Motions Oil Moisturizer is EXTREMELY heavy on the alcohol.Motions Oil Moisturizer has a fairly pleasant smell-light and crisp. Yet, I can feel it evaporating on my hands, with barely a hint of shine left behind when I handle it. It is too lightweight to tame any of my curls.This does nothing for my hair besides keep it dry. If you have fine hair shafts that are textured, this is not the best choice. It has left my hair still feeling/looking dry and dusty.I get a better shine using olive oil from the kitchen, which won't hurt my hair.Ingredient list for Motions Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion:WaterMineral OilPropylene GlycolPolyquaternium 37Ppg 10 Methyl Glucose EtherPropylene Glycol Dicaprylate/DicaprateSodium LactateDimethicone Peg 8 LanolateDimethiconeAcetamide MEAHydrolyzed KeratinPPG-1 TRIDECETH-6Sodium PCAFragranceSorbitolProlineSodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino AcidsCocoyl SarcosineSimmondisa Chinensis (jojoba) Seed OilVitamin EHydrolyzed GlycosaminoglycansWheat Germ OilBenzyl BenzoateTriticum Vulgare AcidHexyl CinnamalLinoleic AcidIodopropynyl ButylcarbamateLinaloolCitronellolD&C; Red 33DMDM HydantoinPanthenol
I used this product on my five year old daughter who has very curly, mixed hair.  I tried to use this on her hair after it was freshly washed and conditioned.  Since the Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser and Deep Conditioning Masque did not leave her hair feeling moisturized I thought this product might help using it as a leave in.  It was very thin and sticky. I section her hair to comb it, I only used this for one section because I could not comb through her hair.  I was not a fan of the smell either.
I tried this hair lotion out but it was just awful. It made my hair feel awful and greasy. i wouldnt recommend buying this hair lotion.
I like to use a product that holds my curls/waves without drooping by the end of the day.  This product does that but makes my hair look like it needs to be washed.  It looks greasy and stringy.I used a small amount in the palm of my hand and rubbed it through my hair.  I immediately noticed that stiffness and thought once I dried my hair it would make the curling iron curls stay.Unfortunately, it didn't happen that way.  It was either spikey or stringy and totally unmanageable.  I rewashed my hair immediately to get the product out.  This is not something I will be recommending to my friends and family.
I used this product on my five year old daughter who has very curly, mixed hair. I used this on her hair after freshly washing and shampooing her naturally curly hair.  I was looking for something to hold her curls together and keep them from frizzing.  The directions say to work a small amount through hair, I had to use a lot more than that.  It had a sticky feeling so I was nervous about what it would look like when it dried.  It was fine for the first couple of hours, when I dropped her off at school she looked ok, when I picked her up that afternoon her hair was a huge fuzz ball!!!  The snarls were everywhere all the way down to her scalp and it also ate through the plastic rubber band that was in her hair.  When I tried to rinse it out that night and comb out the snarls it took 45 min.  I will not be using this product again.
This pomade contains mica powder and you can see it glitter in the jar and on your hand. Fortunately, though, you cannot see the glitter in your hair. While the pomade itself is okay, I didn't like the scent. The scent is hard to describe, but had a chemical kind of scent to it that was just awful. I find this ironic because the label say "New Look New Fragrance". I'd hate to think this is an improvement over the previous fragrance. I've tried several products by "Motions" and fortunately they do not all smell bad. I have found there is no consistency in the fragrances they use. Some products are good, some just okay, and some downright bad. Of all the ones I've tried, this one smells the worst. And no matter how good a product may be, if it smells bad you are just not going to use it.By the way, after this stuff was in my hair for a couple of hours I couldn't take it anymore and had to wash it out. Of course, this is just my subjective opinion and since there are so many positive reviews on this item, there are those who will like it.
I had hoped for a product that would help my daughter's hair stay silkier.  She has a habit of twisting it until it falls out and if we keep it well conditioned, it is harder for her to do that.I tried it on myself first as it is not a children's product.  It took 3 shampoos to get it out of my hair, and even after washing it out, my hair felt brittle and sticky.  If you want dreadlocks and have straight hair this might be the thing that allows you to do it.  Then I got a rash from the shoulders up.  To be sure that it was the cause, after it cleared up (a couple of weeks) I put a little on a patch of skin and it did in fact get itchy and red again.According to the instructions this is a salon product (the instructions involve salon equipment) and I don't think it is ever intended to touch your skin. I'm kind of a rashy person so it may be just me, not that is a particularly irritating product.  I've gotten hives at Mary Kay parties too. But definitely not low allergenic.I'm not sure why they are packaging it for home use without changing the instructions but if you do decide to use it, treat it like you would a coloring product.
If you're looking for an inexpensive deep conditioner, look at theL'Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage Erasing Balm 8.5 FL OZwhich is pretty much the same price as this, but MUCH better.  This felt nice and thick when applied, and did a good job detangling, but after waiting 10 minutes (the direction say to leave it on for 5-15 minutes), it had completely dissolved.  After rinsing, it felt as if there was NO conditioner applied, and nothing but shampoo had been used!
While the price of 2.99 is appealing for me, and I like to deep condition my hair every now and again as I don't cut it often as I should since I'm trying to grow it back to my old length. I do want to say that my hair is below my mid back.This is greasy. Way to greasy. My hair felt so disgusting after using this. It felt awesome going in and smelled great but after rinsing, I thought my hair felt heavy and oily.
Zia, on its Amazon.com page, describes this exfoliant scrub as "safe enough to use every day."I did not find that to be true.After massaging the product in for about a minute, my skin felt tight, dry, and very uncomfortable.  Even after applying and reapplying moisturizer, even after six hours, my skin still felt uncomfortably taut and dry.In addition, this morning I've found bits of bamboo stuck into my fingers.  I cannot attribute that to failure to rinse adequately because I rinsed five times.To be fair, I've only used this exfoliant once.  And once is not a good test of a product.  However, I like my skin too much to try it again.My advice?  Approach with caution.  There are other exfoliants on the market that will remove dead cells without harming live skin.
Not much to write. This Does NOTHING at all for my Gout. Couldn't even tell I had tried anything. Waste of money. Wish it had worked, but I should have known it couldn't be that easy to get rid of even a little of the pain. I've tried 2 other formulas of this brand for sinus allergies and they did nothing either so I won't try anything in this brand again.
Let me be blunt: While I am generally open to both vitamin and herbal therapies for various physical ailments, I think homeopathy is a crock in spite of the fact that I have friends who swear by it.  However, in the spirit of inquiry and fairness I decided to give this formula a try.  I have been religious about using it in the manner described on the box.  The result?  A gout flare-up.  So no, this didn't work for me.Will it work for you?  I don't know.  What I do know is that the dilutions in this formula are so minor as to leave not a single molecule of the original substance in the water.  To simplify, if you dropped a sugar cube in a swimming pool you'd have a stronger solution than you'll find in this formula.I'm all for alternative healing methods, but this isn't one I'd choose.  Sorry if I sound cranky, but my toe hurts.
I'm horribly allergic to Nonoxynol 9, when I found this out 20 years ago I vowed never to let it touch me again. And here it is in a wash designed for your private area.....?? No effing way will that happen! I can't believe something so inflammatory to so many women is actually in a wash for your mahookeydo!It wasn't in the product description or I never, ever would have ordered it. (I would never expect something used as spermicide to be in an intimate wash!!)
For a product that is used for a very intimate area, the dispensing side is where the bottle stands; I used very little of this and had no problem the first time I used, but after the second time I became itchy not only privately but my whole body since I used it as a body wash.  I then decided to shower again using my regular argan oil body wash and after that shower no more itchiness.  I decided to try it again, but had the same results. I do not want to itch so I am not going to be reordering this body wash.
I was excited about this product as I straighten my hair, and any way to make it easier is of interest.I found using this product very difficult. You had to hold it and pull the hair through, and I did not find that this significantly straightened my hair at all.I finally took all the accessories off and used it as a regular hair dryer, in which case it worked fine.
This blow dryer has more gimmicks than a food processor.  It has three heat settings (cool, warm, hot) and two speed settings.  There's a little button hat turns hot air into cool air (when you hold it for several seconds).  It's not the lightest of hair dryers so they invented a little stand so you can set it upright for hands-free drying (I don't know how anyone would use this).  The big sell here is the "conditioning cartridge" with options for `moisturizing', `smoothing' or `extra body'.  I have no idea what kind of `chemicals' are in it.  This is inserted into the conditioning cartridge which will have you pulling your hair out trying to "fit it" on the end of the dryer and when you try to "pull it off".  It is not user friendly.  Plus, I highly doubt the '30-day' cartridges do something any hair conditioner couldn't.  It's a gimmick and a rather troublesome one at that.  The comb attachment did allow me to dry my hair into a buzz cut or flat on the sides, but to be honest; I just blow it all over and let it fall where it does.  I suspect women with long hair might like the cool drying setting with the heavy, thick-toothed comb to prevent tangles, but you can do that with any dryer and a brush.  When I saw the feature called, "ionic conditioning" to `reduce static and deliver nutrients', I rolled my eyes.  It's a perfectly adequate hair dryer, but you don't need all these frilly, non user-friendly attachments.  This was a hard sell, especially with the price.  My advice is to go simple - like you probably already are.
I've had my Infrashine flat iron for over 2 years.  In all that time, I have never once burned myself, because the iron is set well inside the border of a non-conducting substance.  I burned my ear with this iron the first time out.  And I could smell the iron, even though I set it for the same temperature as I use on my Infrashine (330 degrees, so that I don't fry my fine hair).  I figured I would like the slightly larger size of this straightener since I just use my iron to flatten my slightly frizzy, multi-directional hair, but the Wahl Straightener weighs quite a bit more than the smaller Infrashine and was difficult to handle.  The controls are easier to use than the Infrashine since they are on the outside, but the power button had to be held down hard both to turn it on and to turn it off.  To be honest, I just didn't feel safe with it and don't even think I'll keep it as a back-up unit.I didn't even try the conditioning attachment, the whole reason I got this iron.  It turns out that the Healthy Infusion conditioners contain ingredients like squalane (which is derived from shark livers), collagen (which comes from young cows and is a common allergen), chitosan (which is derived from the shells of shrimp and other sea crustaceans), paraffin (i.e., mineral oil, a petroleum by-product), keratin (derived from wool) and fragrance, among other ingredients, some of them toxic (e.g., CETEARETH-30).  Why would I want to put that stuff anywhere near my head?This straightener is probably half the price of mine, but not anywhere near half as good.  I spent well over 3 figures on my flat iron but it was worth every penny, and I see that Amazon has a partner that now offers the same one I have for considerably less.  I thought I was going to like this iron but it wasn't worth the nothing I paid for it.
I love Jergens Cocoa Radiant so I was eager to give this product a try. What a disappointment.This lotion contains "oat extract". Generally oatmeal is used in skincare as a soothing and moisturizing agent. I have no idea what Jergen's did to these poor oats but it is not good. I put the lotion on and had on major impression- sticky. I decided to power through and let is dry totally. I assumed the oats would kick in and give a non-sticky finish.Instead, it actually felt stickier and filmier. It was so sticky that went I bent my arm, my forearm and upper arm stuck together briefly. Ew. I have no idea how well this would moisturize over the long term. I finally freaked out after 20 minutes and washed the lotion off with soap and water. Maybe I am just weird but there is no way I can stand that gummy feeling all day.
I used this lotion only on my hands and had no complaints. It absorbs fast, smell is not overpowering and not bad and there is no weird thick feeling on the skin.And then I applied on my whole body (except for face) after shower and 10 minutes later got red knees and my body is itching. I don't consider myself as a person with sensitive skin, I use a lot of acids and retinol creams on my face and body without problems. Did not expect any redness and hot feeling from lotion with pure oat extract which is soothing for skin. I don't know which ingredient is irritating but I'm not going to use it again, maybe on hands only (because of convenient pump).
I put just a small dab of this greasy substance on my hands and the odor just about knocked me over. My hands also had somewhat of a greasy feel so I headed for the bathroom sink to try remove this unwelcome substance. I scrubbed my hands several times with soap but the horrible odor lingers on and is almost as strong as it was at first. The greasiness is still prsent but not as bad as it was initially and I really have no problem with the grease factor. However, the everlasting gross odor will ensure that this is something I will never use again. i have used Vaseline products for many years but something went bad wrong when they came up with this mess.
It says right on the packaging that this stuff absorbs into your skin within 15 seconds.  That is not a feature, that is a warning.  To be more honest, it should have said "WARNING:  After applying, you have 15 seconds to scrub off your skin if you don't want to smell like you applied an entire bottle of cheap cologne across your body."  This stuff smells bad.  Real bad.  Think of crossing some Right Guard deodorant with some Old Spice (traditional flavor), with the multitude of bad smells from the cologne counter at your least favorite discount seller...and then combine that all into a greasy lotion.It's not something you'll be lining up to rub all over your body.  I'm a man, and the odor made me sick...and the old lady liked it LESS than I did.As far as the lotion:  it works as well as the 99 cent tub of greasy stuff from the dollar store.Not recommended for anyone in any situation.  It stinks and the lotion is cheap stuff that doesn't help the skin more than rubbing yourself down with Crisco.
An itchy, bumpy, red rash has developed all over my legs and arms after use of this product for several days.  I didn't know if it was just a coincidence, until I started reading similar reviews.  So, if you have sensitive skin, you may want to skip this product!
I was eager to try the Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Body Lotion due to past experiences with Nivea products. I was not at all pleased with the nauseating scent of this lotion. Also, I did not notice any skin firming action either. Not a great deal at $17.00 dollars for a pack of two 13.5 FL ounces.
I thought I would try this out and I didn't even get to use the product on my skin. The smell is was horrible! I pumped a bit out, smelled it and was like, "whoa...yuck". I thought maybe it was just me so I asked my husband to smell it. He said "why did you buy old lady smelling lotion?". I simply couldn't bring myself to put it on and smell like that all day.I'll stick with unscented lotions. If you have a sensitive nose, I would encourage you to not purchase this lotion.
I did not receive this item. It was requested along with a book. As usual, the book was received post haste. However, this item, being a non-book, would normally have generated the mandatory "out of stock" response to whatever I request that is not a book. When I did not get the mandatory "out of stock" response I thought a miracle would occur and I would actually receive something other than a book. But, it was not to be. Just a tease.Not being a member of the "in" crowd I never expect to get any of the usual "out of stock" items like electronics, exercise equipment, software etc. But a measly bottle of shampoo? Go figure.OK. After I posted the above a used bottle of the shampoo arrived. I say "used" because dried-out, caked shampoo was around the outside of the bottle. However, there was enough shampoo left in the bottle to get a shampoo. I suppose the used bottle was in response to the obvious glitch in the program that let me actually select something other than a book.Axe is a great name for a horror movie but a butt-ugly name for a product touted to provide the services of a pimp. I decided to test the Axe pimp qualities by shampooing and visiting a business establishment that had a staff of certifiable hotties. I entered and shook my Axed hair so as to permeate the premises with the aroma alleged to attract any or all of these hotties. Most of them ignored me although I noticed them giggling and pointing at me. When a hottie came over to serve me I gave her my most enticing look and she saluted me with the middle finger of her left hand and quickly departed. Real pimps have no need to worry about the Axe competition.
I've tried every hair gel, wax and paste on the market. The Axe Whatever Messy Look is like putting cooking oil in your hair. The scent is kind of weird too. LA Looks is the least expensive gel and a far more effective product than AXE. Seriously, don't waste your money on this one. I only gave it one star because I didn't have a choice.
After getting an unfortunate sunburn on vacation this summer, I tried using this lotion -- to no avail. I did feel a bit of relief upon the moment of application, but it was not nearly enough, and not nearly what I've felt with other similar gels and lotions. Within a few minutes, however, my skin was as dry, hot and painful as if I hadn't applied anything at all. I tried countless applications over a matter of days, but nothing really changed. If I wasn't on vacation in another country, with no other option, I wouldn't have bothered with this product at all. As it is, I certainly won't be buying it in the future.
I did not like this product at all. I use body lotion daily as I live in Minnesota and it is so very dry here and it shows on your body. This lotion was thin in consistancy and it had a terrible scent. Body lotion should be at least creamy and this was not. I even shook the bottle but it still was basically "water". It may be organic but not nice. Do not buy it--spend your money on a brand more reliable.
Olay Professional comes in such an appealing package that I couldn't wait to try it, but I won't be completing the thirty days required to see better skin.  Here's what happened:Day 1:  Completed the protocol described (eye restoration complex morning and night, Age repair lotion for morning, wrinkle smoothing cream for evening).Day 2:  Woke with extremely irritated eyes.  No, I did not get any of the creams in my eyes, but my eyes were irritated, itchy, and puffy.Completed the day's protocol.Day 3:  Extremely irritated eyes again.  Stopped using the product to see if that could be the cause.Day 4:  Irritation lessened.  Did not use the products.Day 5: Little irritation remaining.  Did not use the products.Day 6:  Back to normal.It was clear to me that Olay Professional caused my skin irritation, so I went to their web address ([...]) to check out their ingredients.  They have complete lists of ingredients for every product in the Professional line on that site.Not being a chemist, I could not tell much about the ingredients in these creams except that they all contain niaminicide (vitamin B3). It may be the culprit, being too strong for my skin, but with so many ingredients in each product, I cannot be sure what the problem might be.I am not aware of having sensitive skin, but the coincidence of starting to use these products and experiencing significant skin irritation is too strong for me to continue using them.  A disappointment, because I really expected a lot from Olay ProfessionalMy suggestion:  Try it gingerly.  It seems to work for many women.  Olay documents a 17% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles after a month's use. But I'll never know.
Oh what a disappointment...The first three days of use were pretty good, then small break outs started to appear, and mind you, my skin doesn't freak out for no reason, if I punish it then yes it will revolt, and this 14 day torture system was certainly punishment to my pores. I must admit I never got to the face mask, I just couldn't do this horrible ritual anymore, I missed my nice face creams and soothed skin, this made it tight and dry then I would wake up to find clogged pores and random strange things on my face, this feels full of chemicals that are a harsh change from the beautiful creams I have been using.Since I'm only 27 and there are no wrinkles yet I can't say how this works on wrinkles, but the lotion in them was strange and not pleasant and my skin literally felt unhappy each time I used it not to mention the breakouts, those were such a fun bonus...- Kasia S.
Cheaply made, and it doesn't do what it claims to - if you can get waves out of this thing, I'd be truly amazed.
I'm not sure if I received a defective unit or what, but the Remington Studio Sleek & Curl 1-inch flat iron didn't perform well for me.  I used this on my daughters long hair, which is very easy to straighten, and the results were disappointing.First, the unit wouldn't turn on.  I manipulated the button using the stick from a lollipop, and it finally turned on.  The units light is supposed to pulse until the temperature is stable, but it never stopped pulsing, in 20 minutes time.  The unit did appear to be heated, but it's hard to be sure at what temperature.I do like the long cord and its swivel, and the appliance is easy to handle overall.  However, the results were unacceptable.  My daughters hair did appear to be straightened and shiny immediately after use, but within a few minutes, the hair lost most of the shine.  By the time she got on the school bus, her hair looked almost as if it had never been flat-ironed.If you are in the market for a fairly inexpensive comparable flat-iron, I recommend spending just a few dollars more and purchasing the TRESemme Philips Thermal Creations Straightener.  We have excellent results with this unit.Again, perhaps my unit is faulty but it just didn't perform as expected.
I ordered this product, because winter time makes crispy critters our of my hair and scalp. I have used hair and scalp oil with good results, but not this brand.The bottle gives a nice fine mist, but the oil blend used is greasy and, worse, sticky feeling. It also contains various chemical compounds that are not good for anyone who needs to stay away from estrogens or phytoestrogens (if you have hyper-coagulability or are taking hormonal birth control or are at risk for breast cancer, this means you).
I sprayed a little on my dry hair ends and I looked like I put a pound of lard on my hair! I had to wash my hair, it was a mess.I suspect this product could work on African American hair, I have a fine hair and the product is just way to heavy for me.
I got this for my daughters long, thick, dry hair. I was hoping it was be a nice and easy final step to make her hair manageable. It smelled really nice, so I sprayed what I thought was a conservative amount. Less than I would normally use, but apparently too much, her hair was shiny, slick and greasy. Short on time I combed it back into a ponytail to 'hide' the fact that her hair looked like it hadn't been washed in a month and sent her to school. When she arrived home it was still looking a like I slicked her hair with straight petrolium jelly. Another hair wash later, I tried again with much much less product, I combed it through, which was difficult because her hair still felt dry. And lo and behold, her hair still looked unwashed and greasy. Sadly this is a total pass. Seeing as her hair type seemed ideal for this product, I'm not sure who it would work for.
I had a previous bad reaction to the Motions gloss, so I waited until the eruptions from that cleared before I tried the Marula oil product. Reading the ingredients list, I was surprised to see just how 'unnatural' this stuff really is. It should not be called "natural hair therapy" unless they mean it is for natural hair, because the product itself is mostly chemicals. "Marula" is down the list of ingredients, in between oil and silicones.I used this just on the outer 3/4 of my hair, because I do have oily scalp and don't need more oil on it. If you have whitey-girl hair (even dry and thick and curly like mine) you won't want to use a lot of this because it's very concentrated. If you have porous hair type, it will probably love this like a parched desert.I would like to have given a review that tells you how my hair did on this, but like the glossing oil this caused my scalp to break out into juicy zits. Then I got them along my hairline and down the back of my neck where my hair sits. I've used other Motions products and liked them, I just don't understand what it is about the gloss and the Marula oil that gave me such a horrible reaction.
I have fine straight hair.  When I sprayed it on, it was a fine mist, not heavy and has a nice scent.  After a few minutes of air drying, my head looks like a huge wet oil pack.  I tried blow drying it and styling, and it still looks extremely oily.  I had to wash it out.  It says for all hair types, but I googled it and found out that it is recommended for black women.  Maybe if you have very thick and dry hair, you'll like it.  I was hoping to use this to improve hair growth, but it is way too oily.
Despite the word "Natural" being in the title of this product, it is far from "natural" considering it has a few synthetic preservatives in it. That's my first objection.Secondly, it is so oily that you just can't help getting this everywhere! Once on your hair it just migrates to your face, neck, back, shoulders, etc. It caused me a major breakout!Definitely not for me.
I personally prefer just putting a pure aloe lotion on if I have a skin problem of any sort.  I have previously reviewed Aubrey Organics' Pure Aloe lotion here and given it five stars.  I  am going to stick to that product instead of changing to this one.  First, the smell is not pleasing with this lotion.  When I hear the word botanical, I think of something smelling good.  This does not smell good nor does it remind me of anything I've smelled in a botanical garden.  I belong to the botanical garden in my city so I do know what that smell is like.  Second, it feels greasy afterwards, especially if you have put it on your hands.  That greasy feeling does not go away. Third, the price is atrocious.  There is nothing about this product which warrants that price tag.  The only positive thing I can say is that my skin did feel less dry but my aloe lotion does just as well with no bad odor, no greasy feel and incredibly more value for its pricetag.
First and foremost, this lotion seems effective. It does (initially) make skin feel soft and moisturized. However, many physicians and dermatologists tell their patients that these products (any containing petroleum and synthetic components) can lead to a litany of skin-problems. (The most common and immediate being chapping or dryness ... which is ironic!) The EU (European Union) has banned ingredients present in this product (weird how America sometimes seems behind on health-issues).Certainly, the addition of synthetic fragrances only serves to complicate the issue. I very much enjoy scented lotions ... but those containing essential-oils (natural). Yes, these are a bit more expensive, but the products are more sustainable and more likely to be compatible with biology. There are a number of products which focus on long-term skin-health. They range from luxury products like Lavanila Laboratories The Healthy Body Butter  or Juice Beauty Green Apple Antioxidant Body Moisturizer to more "back-to-basics" products likeBurt's Bees - Milk & Honey Body Lotion. These are expensive to experiment with, I know, so test them at your local health-food store or Sephora and then buy them here!Perhaps the genuinely distressing element of this product is the advertised "vitamins." One is dubious of vitamin-delivery dermally. While (perhaps) feasible, one wonders exactly how effective it is. Overall, the package reads like a desperate ploy ... "add some buzz-words and natural-sounding phrases AND VITAMINS... people love that." Some people are keen to marketing techniques though ...If you are drawn to this product for its "affordability," know that is made for pennies (because the listed ingredients are REALLY cheap). You may wish to consider selecting dermatologist-recommended product (ask your doctor which one he/she likes best) or a more "natural" product ... and simply using it more conservatively (to make it last longer).Certainly, one bottle of this product will not hurt you (I tried it, I'm fine), but why not invest a little more in yourself (and the environment.) Leave this product for your grandmother ... try something more fun, innovative, and sustainable!

Can't really speak as to how great a moisturizer it is, since it's unpleasantly cheap green apple/ citrus smell made it an immediate scrubber.  Wait for the unscented version.
We all age, it's a fact. There are a billion things out there that say they can help. The best thing I found for wrinkles and problem skin (no it doesn't get rid of them but it helps a little and I like the way it makes my skin feel) I also don't have very many but I have used salycic acid. My skin is sensitive and didn't agree with this product and I am also prone to by all natural items or organic. I've used a lot of things as I've been in my 30s and even costmetic grade peels. If you can't afford it, try the salycic acid. I have reviewed it here on Amazon and love the product and use it often.
I've tried and used lots of wrinkle creams and haven't had any major problems with any of them, Olay included.  I'm actually a big fan of Olay Regenerist.  I started with one cream, the Wrinkle Smoothing Cream, which I'd use in the morning & at night.  It had never gotten into my eyes, that I'm very careful about.  After a few days, I noticed a burning sensation from under my eyes to my temples, but didn't think it was the cream, since I really haven't had any major problems with anything I had used to date.  After the week, it was downright painful, although I had no noticable reaction, it simply burned.  Even slightly applying my Cover Girl pressed powder was painful.  I stopped using it  and a few days later the burning sensation went away.  I'm leary about trying the others, but I'll wait another week before I attempt to try one of the other creams.  If and when I do, I'll post back on my results.
I cannot stress enough that you should test this on a small patch of skin first before using.  Especially the tube of anti-wrinkle cream.  On my second day of use, I noticed small blistery bumps around my eyes and on my chin.  I stopped using the products immediately and washed my face thoroughly, but the skin irritation got worse.  I tried calling the toll free number on the box but was never able to reach a live person because their phone system kept disconnecting me.  I eventually sent an email and the reply was that if needed I should see my doctor.  The blisters got worse, broke open, and it took over a week for my face to completely heal.  I was really disappointed, not only in the product but in the customer service from Olay.  Even though there is not a warning on the box telling you to test the product before putting it on your face, I really urge everyone to do that.  I sure wish I would have!
I am not a very fussy person when it comes to beauty.  I don't wear makeup most days, but do want to keep from looking like a Char Pei on a bad day before I'm 60.Because of allergies, I've always been a Neutrogena gal, using their Healthy Skin line for years.  I'm currently using the Anti-Wrinkle / SPF 15 with Retinol, which I've been happy with.When the Olay ProX System became available through the Amazon Vine program, I really looked forward to testing an expensive anti-wrinkle system.  When the box arrived, I was ready to throw my cheapo Neutrogena tube in the junk drawer and start slathering the high-dollar solution on my wrinkled mug, but then I got a thought, "why not do a side-by-side test?".  Literally, the right side of my face would be Neutrogena, the left would be the property of Ms. Olay.I started on May 29, right after taking a `before' photo.  So nice to take a close-up makeup-free snap of yourself in bright daylight, such a wonderful way to start the day, but this was for science!Every day (and night) since I've faithfully applied the three Olay products as directed to the left side of my face and neck, and done my usual Neutrogena in the AM and nothing at night on the right.After a month, there is absolutely no discernible difference between the right and left sides of my face; well, besides the differences that were there already.  I have the same amount of wrinkles, the same depth, the same age spots, everything.In the interest of science and for +40 ladies everywhere, here are close-up views of my wrinkly un-made-up face for all to see:(check comments for this info)Yes, it is ugly, but for a good cause!In conclusion, I did not have any adverse reaction to the Olay products.  All three felt good on my face, never oily or heavy.  If I had seen any results at all, I would be happy to continue using them and paying 4x the cost of the Neutrogena Healthy Skin cream. However, without results, I can't see any reason to spend the extra money just for nicer packaging.
Really tried to see a benefit...sometimes I looked and well, maybe, then I looked again....no, not really.In the first week I found myself with a soreness in the area and then a small pimple.  Thought that maybe it was working to clean out some bad 'stuff????.'Rolling the serum, which turns out to be pretty pricey in the overall, just stimulates the area to a pink and a puffing of minimal nature, hence, the sometime look of disappearing lines. It is also not a pleasant feeling.  Even gently, they are metal rollers.I would rather use a good eye cream and gently tap around the eye area as I applied it.  It is also helpful to do this when applying any makeup or concealer.One thing I did get as a benefit: that I was doing more on my own than this product could provide.
The scent of this product is disgusting, and it make my eyes burn and my skin rash. I only tried it because the OIL OF OLAY brand is reputed to be gentle and all natural. Due to the unpleasant experience, I cannot recommend this product.
Is this what we have come to, ladies? We are so desperate for our youth that we will spend 2 minutes a day rubbing the skin around our eyes with a few ball bearings while it smears lotion?If it was an SNL skit, we all would have a good laugh. I was lucky to be offered a sample to try and I thought "why not?" I am not in to anti-aging creams and elixirs, so I thought I would give it an honest try.After 3 weeks of doing this, I see no difference. My skin initially reacted to the lotion with a break out around both eyes. I gave it a day and started again. Nothing, Nada, except a few lost minutes a day staring in the mirror, giggling.If this is the kind of apparatus you need to feel like you are fighting for your youth, then this is the product for you.
This body wash was a major disappointment. Reminded me of dish washing liquid. I would pass this up and spend a few more dollars on well known name brands that can deliver.Katiebabs
I have fine, curly hair and have learned to be cautious of how hair products can weight it down so rather than use this detangler as well as conditioner I just used the detangler.  When I sprayed it on to my wet hair and waited a few minutes as prescribed it did help ease the comb through my hair BUT after my hair dried and I tried to comb it it shredded my hair because the comb would not go through it.I assumed this was a fluke and after washing my hair again and this time using my usual cr&egrave;me rinse I sprayed the detangler on.  Same result.  After the hair dried there was more shredding.  Please note the directions state to shake the container well before spraying and I did this.  Oddly I liked the way my hair looked but it's not worth the damage it did.  I'll never use this product again.  It's headed for the trash.
I planned to use this to straighten out a section of my hair that is tangled and unlike most other parts that are straight. The scent of this product is very offensive to me. I decided to read the reviews and found that most of them use it for children of a different chromosome type than mine. Other research also indicates that the target group for this product is young girls ages 4 to 7 who belong to a different cultural group than the one to which I belong. So, my conclusion is that although this product is not for me, and I threw in into the trash, the fact that my preferences are not the same as those of the targeted group is no major surprise. I do not intend to imply that my preferences are any better or any worse but just that they are different.
My wife has tangly curly hair and can use all of the help she can get. (I hope she does not read this) This review is in direct correlation to what she told me last evening. The detaingler could not get through her hair-it was to water based and she tried several times to no avail. She was not pleased.Better luck next time!
As much as I liked the complementing shampoo which was very nice, I really did not like this conditioner. It left my hair feeling gluey and heavy. In order to get this stuff out, I had to wash my hair twice before it felt clean. I am not using this product again.
This is the fourth and thankfully final product in this line that I tried.  I dreaded using it because the others were so horrible.  Unfortunately this was just as bad.  It was excessively greasy and would not wash out leaving my hair weighed down and wet/dirty looking.  At least I knew to try it on a day I didn't have to leave the house.  After a few more washings I just about have the last of it out of my hair.Perhaps this was meant for African American but there's nothing in the description to indicate that nor is there included a description of the type of hair that would benefit by this product. In my opinion this company has done a vast disservice by their marketing department. Probably they wanted to sell to the greatest number of customers possible and that's why they were vague. All this does is alienate the customers who aren't part of the targeted demographic as well as not informing those who COULD potentially benefit from the product that this is for them.
I have liked the other Just For Me hair Milk products. My sons coarse curls need moisture to keep from breaking and become an unmanageable tumbleweed.Unfortunately, the conditioner is the weak link in this line. The conditioner smells great as does the rest of the line. But this conditioner is a mess. It left my sons hair feeling more raw than with the shampoo alone. The conditioner is a little sticky  but it leaves the hair a mess. This is definitely one to miss.
This is far and away the most awful conditioner I've ever tried.  And I've tried just about every brand, from drugstore versions to high-end salon versions, and OMG, there isn't a worse conditioner out there.  You could put vaseline in your hair and get better results than you'd get with this gunk!I've used the shampoo of this brand though, and love it!  (I've tried it without the conditioner, and it's fantastic!)After shampooing, I used this conditioner, like any other, let it sit in my hair for a couple minutes, and rinsed well.  My first reaction upon squeezing a good amount into my hands was that it felt thin and watery for a conditioner.  It didn't have a creamy, silky feel to it.  While massaging it into my wet hair (while in the shower), it felt awful dry.  It didn't feel like my hair was getting any moisture, and didn't create a soft feel to my hair, like most good conditioners do (even when my hair is wet).So I rinsed it out thinking, "oh well, it probably will just be a little drier than usual."Imagine my surprise when my hair was dry and it felt gross and gunky!  How could a shampoo feel so drying when wet and still leave a disgusting slime residue in your hair?!Worst of both worlds, by far!  I couldn't stand the way my hair felt all day.  I pulled it back and covered it with a hat.  It was THAT bad.  I couldn't WAIT to get home to wash my hair out again.What a HORRIBLE, AWFUL conditioner!  I would never, ever purchase it.  In fact, I'm dumping the remainder of the bottle down the drain, because this sludge won't do anyone's hair any good.I wouldn't even use this on my dog!  That's how bad it is.  Seriously, don't buy it.The shampoo of this brand, on the other hand, is fantastic.  I don't understand how a company could make such an awesome shampoo and such a crap conditioner!I'll continue buying the shampoo, but I won't touch the conditioner ever again!
I picked this up since it stated it could be applied to curly dry hair. I usually apply a bit of mousse to my hair, let it dry, and then if I am going out I with scrunch my hair upside down with some hairspray. I thought this would be a good substitute for the hairspray to give my very curly hair some body.If I could give this negative stars, I would. When I went to apply it, I put a little in my palm and rubbed it around and scrunched it in my hair (dry) upside down. It felt like glue! I looked in the mirror and my hair literally had white spots in it. I then tried to wash my hands; the product would not come off! I tried washing my hands for an hour; it was still suck on my hands! I had to drive and with the heat of summer, they stuck to the steering wheel. When I reached my destination, I tried washing my hands again and it was still on my hands!When I came home I pulled my hair back and it all stuck together. I did not use much of the product. I tried washing it the next morning and it was like wet glue when I got it wet. I ended up having to cut the ends of my hair since I could not get it combed.This is by far the worse product I have used on my hair. I would avoid it at all cost if you have very curly long hair.
I tried this once on my daughter's curly hair, and once on my own very curly hair, and threw it away. The chemical smell is so strong, even my husband sniffed our 2 year old and said "Is that paint? What is that awful smell?" and when I was putting it in her hair, the thick slimy texture was so gross I wanted to wash my hand even as I squeezed the bottle.I felt terrible to trying it on her first (of course I re-washed her hair usingBurt's Bees Baby Bee Shampoo & Wash, 12 Fluid Ounces (Pack of 3)and then tried the stuff myself, only to wash it out of my own hair because the smell was literally making my eyes water. I had to soap and exfoliate to get the feeling off of my skin.
This is one of the worst hair care products I've ever used.  The instructions say to use a dime size dollop on wet or dry hair.  I used about half that and it hardened on my hair and made it look dirty and greasy.  Worst of all I could barely get a comb or brush through it and though I did so with great difficulty it ripped and tore my hair out.  I used it when my hair was dry.  I wanted to go re-wash my hair but had to get out of the door so I spent the rest of the day looking and feeling horrible.  Also the smell was disturbing.  It's not an unpleasant smell, cocoa butter?, but it persisted until I was able to get home and wash it out.
This is the worst hair product I have ever seen. It is also the worst my family, neighbors and mail lady have ever seen. The scent will destroy all your air passages. The gunk itself formed a hard substance in the palm of my hand that defies breakage. Washing this off the palm of my hand required a major effort which left a mark. I have been using Black Jack crack filler on my driveway but I think I will switch to this "Curl Perfecter" to fill the cracks in my concrete driveway if I can lessen the hardness in some way. There is no way I would put this on my hair or even on the hair of anyone else. Do not buy his worthless product. It is a loser of the first order.
The strong stinky chemical odor almost put my off, but wanted to try it out. the smell does go away after about 10 minutes.  It says use dime amount on hand rub together and apply to wet or dry hair, and I applied to wet, combed and styled as suggested. It did make the flyaways tha come dissappear an dmke my hair shiny, but that was from the oil content.The oil did stay on my hands and was sticky between  my fingers had to wash a lot to get rid of the sticky feeling.As to curls it did not hold mine.
This comes out like Elmer's Glue and goes on your hair like it too. I've used it on my daughter who has curly flyaway hair. No matter how much you spread it around on your hands to allow for light application, it sticks to hair like glue. It is really tough to wash out and looks like the hair is stringy and dirty.I would not recommend this product.
This stuff is bad, all the way around. It leaves your hair sticky, stinky and weighed down. Even the smallest dab! I would not recommend this at all.
my daughter is half korean and this didn't work on her little amount of hair. Twist, braid, it doesn't hold any curls and the smell I thought was overly strong and not pleasant
The ingredient list for this product would require a chemistry degree to decipher.  The product smells bad.  When I put the "dime sized" squirt on my hands to rub into my palms, it was so smelly and sticky that I knew I did not want it in my hair.  It took FOUR washes to get my hands product-free.  Mineral oil is one of the first ingredients, and I'm not excited about that on my hair either.  "Hair milk" probably just means it is white and opaque.  This does advertise itself as "perfecting" curls or smoothing styles.  As such, it is basically a rub-in hairspray.  Not recommended.
I jumped at the chance to try this serum for the crows feet on my 48yo eye area.  I stopped using liquid foundation a few years ago when I found that it seemed to accentuate my lines, even trying those anti-aging varieties.  One of my main concerns was that I might have an unfavorable reaction to this serum, since I have sensitive skin and have had reactions to plenty of OTC creams.  No irritations with this.  It feels nice going on, kind of silky, but quickly dried and had a slight tacky feeling.  In the beginning, I ignored it, but towards the end of my test, I felt the need to put on a little dab of eye cream (Loreal Regenerist or Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye) to get rid of that feeling.  It became bothersome.  I wanted to believe their claim of "Up to 85% reduction in wrinkles in just 28 days".  After a month of using this product twice a day, I noticed no improvements, sadly.
Boy howdy, this didn't come with much in the way of instructions.  It just says to apply and let dry before using any cosmetics.  That made me think that it was only supposed to be used once a day even though many products of this type are to be used twice a day. I decided to see what I could find on the internet, so I checked out the company's website. Indeed, this product is supposed to be used twice a day. It would have been nice if they mentioned it in the information brochure that's included with the product.I've used this twice a day for a month, and, honestly, I can't see any difference in my skin.  I only used it on one side of my face, and I have a 15 times magnifying mirror, so I can get a good look, and I don't see any change at all.  Even if it did work, I wouldn't be inclined to buy it.  Yes, there are products that are even more expensive than this, but in the grand scheme of things, this is pretty expensive.  I also have an issue with the bottle.  The neck of the bottle isn't much bigger than the pipette. If I'm not very careful about putting the pipette back in the bottle, it scrapes the side of the neck and the product runs down the outside of the bottle. Messy.  This product is very perfumed. It wouldn't be such an issue, but it's right there by my nose, and although the odor fades as time goes by, it's there all day and night. Even if this product did improve my skin, just for that reason alone I wouldn't buy it. Combined with the difficult dispenser, and the price, I can't recommend this product.
I liked the fragrance, seemed to rinse off the skin, and even liked the micro beads; however, after using it my teenage son started itching and then had acne breakouts.  I itched as well but no acne.  Probably will not use again...whatever chemicals are in this body wash we're having an allergic reaction too.  We don't normally have sensitive skin so that makes me think this product isn't safe for normal users.  I wouldn't recommend.
I would love to say this works but I would be telling a lie. Don't waste your money on it because it doesn't make one iota difference to your skin.The mask you put on every night for 5 nights makes you look like Freddy from the Halloween movies. The mask won't stay on long without sliding off,  and even though the directions said to leave it on for 10 minutes or until the serum dried out of it...so make that more like 30 minutes instead of 10.  The little bottle of serum makes your face a little stiff so I assume the inventors of this stuff thinks that is making your skin tighter. Well, maybe for a few minutes it does and then it just starts to itch and feel like you need to clean your face up.I don't have any wrinkles except when I laugh and then I can see them around my mouth and eyes. They are still there by the way. Not even one of them has disappeared. I don't use creams or lotions and never have but if I have to go through these long, drawn out treatments every night for the rest of my life, I say forget it. I prefer the wrinkles! I advise you not to waste this much money on a treatment that is useless.
With so many products from China containing Lead -- and other questionable ingredients -- you might want to think twice about putting this stuff on your face, lips and in your eyes.
Aveeno Ageless Vitality seems to be marketed as a miracle cream that not only "keeps your skin resilient and younger-looking", it will "reduce the appearance of wrinkles or diminish the look of age spots".  Aveeno also claims that 100% of women showed improved skin vitality in 4 weeks.If only this product really did all it claims to do.  Perhaps it microscopically reduced my wrinkles - all I know is that when I look in a mirror, I see no difference at all in the 4 weeks that I have faithfully been putting the Biomineral Concentrate and Rejuvenating Day Moisturizer on my face.In fact, the Day Moisturizer is not only heavily perfumed (to cover the sunscreen smell - see below), if used as shown on the illustration in Step 2 (around the eye & on the eyelid), the day moisturizer will irritate your eyes.The Biomineral Concentrate ingredients are: Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Trislloxane, Silica, Zinc, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Tycopheryl Acetate, Copper Powder.  The package includes 4 tubes of 0.08 (2.5 ml) each.The Day Moisturizer consists of Avobenzone (3%), Homosalate (12%), Octisalate (5%), Octocrylene (1.7%), and Oxybenzone (3%) - all with the stated Purpose as Sunscreen.  The product also has a large amount of inactive ingredients in addition to the sunscreen (dill and blackberry are towards the end of the inactive ingredient list). There is one 1.0 fl.oz container of Day Moisturizer.With no noticeable difference in my skin and no noticeable difference in my existing wrinkles, I'm going back to the original skin protection that I have used successfully for years - lotion mixed with a high SPF sunscreen.1 star because of the claim that 100% of women showed improved skin vitality, when, in fact, the product does not live up to its claims.
When I received this product, I intended to give it a four-week trial, as it promises to deliver miracles in just four weeks: "After 4 weeks, 100% of women showed improved skin vitality with increased firmness, smoother skin texture, reduced appearance of wrinkles or diminished look of age spots."Unfortunately, I had to stop the trial at two weeks because I just couldn't take it any longer.  I think that I may have discovered Aveeno's magic secret to making wrinkles disappear: irritated skin.  Skin that is distressed can swell, and look slightly puffy.  Puffed up skin is firm. Puffed up skin is smooth. Puffed up skin has less wrinkles. Just like Aveeno promised. Unfortunately, puffed up skin is also painful.  The skin in the area around my eyes was very swollen and uncomfortable, even though I had taken great care not to put either the biomineral concentrate, or the moisturizer in that area.  But maybe I'm just allergic to the product.  I don't know, but I sure wasn't happy with the results.I also was not thrilled with the packaging, as other people have commented.  What's the point in having four little bitty tubes of "naturally charged biomineral concentrate?"  (Naturally charged?  Honey, I'm here to tell you that electrical charges are always 100% natural, since there is no such thing as artificial electricity. But I digress...) Since the tubes are opaque, it's impossible to tell how much product is in each one, or how much product is left after use.The larger pump container of the moisturizer is also opaque, with a pump action dispenser.  It smells strongly of good old fashioned regular sunscreen, and feels like good old fashioned regular sunscreen. I didn't find anything remarkable about its moisturizing powers. Heaven help you if you get any in your eyes...Back to the four little tubes: If the stuff is so wonderful, why not provide an amount equal to the sunscreen, so it can be applied to all the same areas as the sunscreen?  Why not mix the two lotions in one tube?  Or, if they can't be mixed, why not package them like a two-barreled epoxy syringe that delivers equal amounts of two different substances?  The current packaging scheme guarantees that the user will run out of the biomineral concentrate before they run out of the sunscreen lotion.  Then what?  Does the lotion work without the concentrate?  Or is the user supposed to toss the remainder of the lotion, and run out and buy another kit?The remainder of the product, with all its wasteful packaging, is going into the trash, and ultimately sit and take up space in a landfill for all eternity.  I am returning to my five-star stand-by day cream,Neutrogena Visibly Firm Face Lotion, Active Copper, SPF-20, 1.7-Ounce Bottle, packaged in a recyclable glass bottle.Sorry Aveeno, my swollen eyelids will not forgive you.
The promise of reduced fine lines due and higher SPF protection was all I needed to hear to try this product. I have very fair combination skin that is starting to get fine lines.However, I was unable to finish the four week treatment due to skin irritation and outbreak. Initially, I was delighted to find the Biomineral concentrate vanished into the fine lines and provided a "spackle" like effect so that when I put my make up on, the lines had all but disappeared.But after one week of use, I noticed a breakout around my mouth and jaw. My skin became far more sensitive to exfoliating that it has ever been. I had to stop using the product immediately. In a few days, the breakout cleared and the irritation eased.Unfortunately, this is one product I do not recommend particularly if you have sensitive skin. The SPF lotion was too dense so it didn't blend into the skin well and the pump seemed to be a little large for it. I always wound up with far more in my hand than I really needed.On a positive note, it did seem to work nicely on my hands. Whenever I have too much product for my face, I usually rub the excess into my hands. They looked great for that week!
I've tried a lot of different cleansers over the years, and honestly, this was probably the worst one.  I have combination skin and am still acne-prone, but my skin isn't overly sensitive or anything.What I didn't like:- It has a horrible medicated smell, as soon as you squeeze it into your hand.- It tingles A LOT as soon as you rub it into your skin.  Some people like tingling cleansers I suppose, but this one was way too much for me.- It left my skin overly dry.Overall, it felt harsh, drying, and unnatural.  I've liked many of Biore's products in the past, but this was certainly not one of them.  I don't think this cleanser is for everyone.
I really like the new foamy soaps, but this one does not work very well. It has a very small pump head and only pumps a very small blob of soap. It squirts on the bottle or out over my hand. You have to pump several times to get a usable amount of soap.The soap its self does not smell very good to me. It's kind of like a very light baby scent, but more institutional/hospital like. It is not "natural" ingredients or scent. I like essential "real" scents of nature, but this smells more like outhouse deodorizer, sorry...
Ingredients - Water, Decyl Glucoside, Polyglycerl-10 Laurate, Cocoglycerides, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Benzoate, Cetyl Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthum Gum, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium HydroxideThese don't sound "Natural" at all. Besides that, There so many problems.1. it didn't foam well with a normal dosage. I had to use twice as much to wash my 5 month old grand-nephew with. I know it doesn't have the foaming chemical Sodium Laurel Sulfate but Yet they call it "foaming baby Wash". One would assume one of these ingredients would be some kind of working substitute.2. I use a lot of children's and women's products because of my sensitive skin - I had to use the rest of the bottle, which was like 3/4th left to wash myself.The bottle was used completely in 2 washes the day I got itTo sum it all up - It takes too much to use and labeling it 96% Natural is false. This thing has more chemicals than an Alex Mack EpisodeThis is Johnson & Johnson - Their products are usually very very reliable. but not this. AVOID
This product is such a waste of time, not only did it dry out my skin, but oh what fun to stand in the shower pumping that little bottle to get any foam out, I swear it takes like twelve pumps to get a decent amount, and it disintegrates quickly, very unimpressive. This was free from the Vine program but I can't even finish it ( I've used half) and would certainly never spend money on it, with so many great brands and washes out there this is a joke. Even the scent is very blah, it looks and feels more like a gimmick to get people to try it out, but it fails on all account. I buy baby products from time to time for myself but this will never be something that I will use again.Not recommended unless you're a little kid who doesn't mind washing with cappuccino foam.
I usually have no problems with Johnson's Baby product but the formulation for the Baby's natural wash dried out my skin, to where it flaked in patches.  But this is not my only complaint for starters the bottle pump is not at all sturdy for a plastic dispenser, the pump broke off after unlocking it the second time, then there is the amount of product that can be dispensed from the pump, a light foam that disintegrates quickly, forcing you to pump out more product.  That is not economical and would probably make you use more of the product than what is recommended.  If that is the case then using it on baby is not good because as much as possible you want to limit concentration of soaps to their sensitive and developing skin.  Below is the list of ingredients in the Product:Water, Decyl Glucoside, Polyglycerl-10 Laurate, Cocoglycerides, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Benzoate, Cetyl Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthum Gum, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium HydroxideThose are normally found in washes, including the washes and soaps from Whole Foods, but I know that citric acid can cause drying or irritate skin depending on how you react to it.  Sodium Benzoate can cause hyperactivity, so it is mostly a consumer choice if they want to use this.
I have used this product for 3 days now, long enough for any conditioner to do what it is supposed to. The features of this conditioner are supposed to be as follows:*Volume conditioner contains ultra lightweight conditioning agents that adhere to fine hair, prepping limp strands for lasting volume*Micro-boosters help prepare the structure of fine hair to hold voluminous Styles all day*Gentle enough for color-treated or permed hairDescription is "Pantene's unique volumizing system (Shampoo, Conditioner and Root Lifter Spray Gel) with micro-boosters preps fine hair's structure so you can create your volume Style. Now your flat hair looks full again with weightless body and shine."I have very very fine hair, so the promise of more volume was too good to pass up. I did not notice any more volume to my hair after using this product. I made sure to not use any other volumizing agents such as gel, or mousse to see exactly how my hair reacted to this conditioner. That said I also live in one of the most humid states in the USA so there is that.EDIT- THis product WRECKED my hair. Stripped it, dried it out, My hairdresser scolded me within an inch of my life for even trying this.
I tried a sample of this product and it felt very smooth. The scent, although subtle, didn't trill me; it's not natural. Also, I am used to serums being a clearish, thick liquid, but this is more like a regular face lotion, just a bit thicker.I have marked it down by several stars because it has parabens (methylparaben, ethylparaben). These products should not be included in any beauty products as they have been linked to cancer. As a breast cancer survivor, I would not recommend this product to any women for this one issue! All of the Cover Girl & Olay Simply Ageless products are considered moderately to highly hazardous (even developmental/reproductive toxicity) by the Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Environmental Working Group; you can check their database online for all sorts of other cosmetics you may be using.
This primer comes in a good pump bottle and has a lovely texture and basic moisturizing as well as acting like a primer.  Unfortunately, within an hour of application, it had melted into my eyes and they have been red and burning all day long.  This does not happen with my foundation alone, so I guess it is the fault of this primer.  Not recommended.
I have waist-length, naturally curly hair and have used Pantene's other shampoo and conditioning products in the past, so I was excited to try this new "Medium-Thick Frizz-Control" formula. My hair normally has a shine, bounce and natural highlights, so I expected this shampoo to enhance those qualities. Unfortunately, I found that the product made my hair dull and lifeless.I tried the shampoo a number of times, alternating hairstyles just to be sure, but found that it left my hair drier than normal and more prone to tangles--and even mats!! I never use anything in my hair besides leave-in conditioner and I tried the shampoo both with and without it. It's a shame--it seemed like it should've been a great product--and I really LIKE Pantene. I so wanted to like this product, but it just did not agree with my hair type.
my foot...if you have ANY kinds of allergic or sensitivity to scents put this product back.  I have migraines and triggers most always center around smells. Although this product might be OK and I just mean OK, the smell makes it quite nauseating.  If you like the scent thieves then go ahead and try it.I just couldn't get around that smell.  When will manufacturers get that?  If we put it on our face which is alot of the time sensitive anyway, why do they keep flocking us with smelly products?  Most people know that if it has a scent in it the product most always has alcohol too?But, for the sake of a review I will tell you this:  I did give this product a try and after washing my face before I went to bed with my normal cleanser and my face being totally void of anything, I applied this cream. It does have a nice texture and creaminess to it.  It went on well and felt clean and not at all greasy.  Very nice.  But then this...it never dried or went in.  It stayed on top of my skin and got very sticky within a period of about 10 minutes and the cream was still sticky when I woke up the next morning.  My whole face was sticky.This claims to be an am/pm cream but if it stays on top of my skin during the night I'm sure it will do the same during the day and my face will be sticky underneath my makeup.  But, no I didn't try it during the day.  I don't even want this cream on my hands.  The scent itself isn't worth the usefulness of the cream.
Have come to the conclusion, it really did nothing for my lashes or brows.It also became an irritant the longer I tried using it.Believe I gave it a fair trial but could not recommend this product and would not purchase it in the future.
I tried the Envyderm Cosmetics Eyelash Enhancement and Conditioning Nighttime Serum, and the only claim it lives up to, for me, is that the tube does last about 5 months. It probably conditioned my lashes, too, but I didn't notice any results such as darker lashes, thicker lashes, longer lashes, or any other result that would make me look in the mirror at my eyelashes and say "WOW!!!  Thank you, Envyderm!"  I have to laugh at the product description's assertion that this product is a great alternative to false eyelashes, because to me, that's like saying that's like saying a graham cracker is a great alternative to a TV remote.  Doesn't even come close to accomplishing the same thing.  I'm really glad that there are people who've had amazing results from this product.  I followed the directions and didn't see any results, so from where I stand, this product is overpriced snake oil.
I used this every night and sometimes during the day for 4 weeks. I have seen no improvement in the thickness or the length. I even took before and after pictures hoping I could post them in my review, but nothing looks any different. This product didn't sting just tingled when applied and sometimes I get swelling when I use a product like this and there was none, but all that doesn't matter if the product doesn't work.:{ I had to add to my review now that it has been 2 months. I stoped using this product 2 weeks ago and have been losing eyelashes. I would guess about 2 a day! This is really freaking me out and I am so upset. I now have a gap in my lashes where there are just little ones growing and no more longer ones. I would advise trying this for a couple weeks on a patch of hair somewhere other than your lashes!
I've never had a bad reaction to any makeup/medication but after one application, it burned - not a little - but enough that I panicked and washed it off and tossed it in the trash. I read reviews where other's said it's normal for it to burn but this was not mentioned at all in the directions (very little directions I might add).I would suggest if you buy it, try it only on one eye, and only on the bottom lash line - like a dummy I dove right in and put it on both eyes, upper AND lower as the directions stated.I see many favorable reviews - so this may work for you - but please - don't be an idiot like me and put it all around your eyes before trying it in one spot! Much luck!
I really wanted this Envyderm product to work.  My eyelashes are thinning as I grow older, and I was so in hopes that my 70-year-old eyes would once again be rimmed with long, thick lashes (even just a little thicker and/or longer would have made me very happy.)  But no such luck.  Although the product description guarantees thicker & longer lashes, there was absolutely no difference in my eyelashes after using this product.
It didn't work for me.  I removed my makeup at night and applied it on eyelids and eyebrows for several weeks.  At first it stung a bit but not bad.  My skin is sensitive.  But I saw no difference.
Update 3/22/12I've used this every day for well over a month now, and I can safely say that there was little to no growth on my lash line.  This was a pretty big letdown.  I'm sure results vary from person to person - sadly, this did not work at all for me.  Not recommended.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I don't expect miracles with any type of beauty product - what works for one person may not necessarily work for another, so I started using Envyderm with little expectation.  It's been a little over 2 weeks, and while my lashes aren't bursting with new growth or look hugely lusher, I did notice a few stray hair starting to grow along my lash line.  That said, it could very well be a huge coincidence that I have 4 or 5 new hairs per eyelid, but I'll just presume that it was Envyderm that created the base point for the new growth.Using Envyderm is very simple - just apply to your lash line as if it were eyeliner.  I haven't had any irritation since starting to use this, but I do notice that my eyes seem to be a little more sensitive/there is more oil accumulation around my eyes when I wake up in the morning.  I don't wear contacts.All in all, so far Envyderm has exceeded my expectations, if the new hair growth was stimulated by Envyderm.  I will update the progress in another 2 weeks, then by week 6, when a noticeable difference should actually happen.  In the meantime, on the fence on how I feel about this product.
This product arrived not sealed in any way. Just the eye brush in the serum in an box not sealed. I called the company and they confirmed that they do not seal the product. They also told me they have gotten other calls with the same concern. They say most cosmetics are not sealed. I went shopping that day and I was not able to find anything that was not sealed except nail polish. So do I want to put something on my precious eyes that may have been tampered with? no!So I went on looking at the product and all the ingredients. I looked up the ones I didn't know at FDA.GOV and found some are listed as irritants. Now I am sure I am not going to put this on eye lid where it can get in my eye if I forget and rub my eye in my sleep. I would have tried this product had it been sealed and probably  not done research on it.I will just keep the tiny light lashes I have had all my life.
I am pretty disappointed because I was so excited to receive this product from the Vine program.  I thought I will finally have long, luscious lashes!This serum was incredibly simple to apply, just like using liquid eyeliner, and only took a few moments to apply and dries very quickly.  Unfortunately, the second night I applied this I woke up at 3 am itching all over.  No eye irritation, but just itchy everywhere.  I took some benedryl and threw this product in the trash.  This was the only change in my normal routine, no other new products or foods.  This may work for some, but for anyone with allergies or is sensitive to some products, use caution.
I normally wouldn't review a product of this type so soon after starting to use it but the hype claims that a difference can be seen in as little as two weeks. Fortunately, the changes in my lashes after two weeks of nightly use of Envyderm Eyelash Growth and Conditioner Serum aren't apparent to anyone but me: quite a few of them fell out within a few days of each other, something that has virtually never happened to me prior to this. Coincidence? I think not.Due to my mom's primitive grasp of eugenics, she married the man who she was convinced would endow her children with blue eyes and great (albeit semi-invisible) eyelashes (thanks, Dad!). Okay, we're not talking about Elizabeth Taylor's lashes but good enough that they're remarked on even though they're behind glasses.  My point is that I have lashes to spare and even if those I lost don't grow back, I'm still in good shape. But that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it--who wants to lose a bunch of lashes? At present, they don't look as good as they did.I often use Double Cils (Mavala) because it seems to do a nice job of keeping my lashes in good shape. Unlike Envyderm, I don't think Mavala promises that use of their product will result in longer, thicker lashes which is good, because it doesn't. However, Envyderm Eyelash Growth and Conditioner Serum was offered through Vine, i.e., it was free (its list price is much more than I'd ever pay for a product of this type), and I figured "why not?" Could my almost weirdly long lashes actually be encouraged to result in the human equivalent of a Wheaten Terrier's lashes? And who wouldn't like thicker lashes? So I bit the bullet.FWIW, use of this product has not resulted in discolored or reddened skin, despite my being extremely fair and pale. And since I use it as directed, I've yet to have it seep into my eyes and so can't complain of any irritation. But it does result in a kind of drawing sensation on my lids and despite its being a runny product, my lids feel heavy as well after application. It's also somewhat drying but the fact that I'm 57 and have rather sensitive skin may contribute this--it's correctable with virtually any moisturizer that contains petrolatum.I'd like to rate Envyderm Eyelash Growth and Conditioner Serum well but my call, based on experience, is "possibly harmful/essentially useless." I hope those who actually paid for it have better luck than I've had. And incidentally, it's just as useless for eyebrows.
Received as part of the Vine Program. Thank goodness because if I had purchased this I would have been flipping out about now. Having used this product for well over two weeks now, faithfully every night, I can honestly say I see absolutely no difference in my lashes or brows (been using it on my brows, too, as they are thinning and I thought this would help). In addition, I find my eyes burning periodically throughout the day. Not sure what harm, if anything, that I did to my eyes, but I have stopped using this. I don't recommend this to anyone.
Despite the fact that the product description says, "Irritation study showed no irritation caused by product," I found that this product caused my eyelids to become slightly inflamed and irritated upon initial use.  I was not willing to try it again. As I received the product free through the Amazon Vine program, felt no reluctance in throwing it in the trash.In the past, I have foundThunder Ridge Emu Products 100% Emu Oil 8 Ozto be highly effective in fostering eyelash growth and thickness, with zero negative side effects.
UPDATE: I gave up on this and went to RapidLash. It works! Boy, was I shocked, surprised, impressed. They're about the same price, but the RapidLash works and works FAST. My eyebrows are now filled in. My lashes are at least 150% to 200% what they were before. And, biggest shocker to me, they're both over-the-counter products that don't require prescription.INITIAL REVIEW OF ENVYDERM: Have been using this for 3 weeks and have seen no change at all.  Didn't expect to either.  If a prescription product like Latisse takes 8 to 16 weeks to show results, then a non-prescription product like this one surely isn't going to show results sooner.  To tell the truth, it's a little difficult to get myself to apply diligently every night as instructed since there's no apparent payoff.  Nevertheless, I have incorporated application into my nighttime routine and it's easy, almost effortless, although so far unrewarding.  I will update in a few weeks, earlier if I see results.  But in absolute honesty, no change to date after three weeks of nightly applications.  At this point I am giving 2 stars so that I don't encourage or discourage anyone else's purchase.  I surely will try to give more information as I have more to give.UPDATE 12/15/11:  At 7 weeks of faithful use now and still see NO improvement.  I read all the positive, excited reviews and wonder why they're getting such great results while I get nothing.  Maybe this just needs more time.  I will keep using and keep updating.  One note though, why is it that Latisse provides individual applicators for each eye for each use whereas this product provides a single applicator that is returned to the tube after every use?  If use even on clean eyelashes may introduce bacteria to a Latisse applicator, why doesn't the same principle apply to this product?  Just wondering ...UPDATE 12/29/11:  At 9 weeks, still nothing so I am dropping my rating to 1-star unless something changes because this appears to be a total waste of money.
I did not try this long enough to be able to state whether it works or not. I used it for a couple of nights and each time resulted in burning painful sensations.. not something I want, especially in the eye area! It almost feels like the beginnings of a stye. I am discontinuing use permanently as my eye comfort is more important to me than long lashes.
This product has me baffled.  Per the directions it's to smooth the hair when wearing it in a pony tail.  Why specifically in that style?  Like the other two products in this line that I've used, detangler, curl perfecter, it hardens my hair and makes it all but impossible to brush.  Again the smell is overpowering and does not seem to dissipate and it has some kind of odd sparkle stuff embedded in it.Perhaps this was meant for African American but there's nothing in the description to indicate that nor is there included a description of the type of hair that would benefit by this product.  In my opinion this company has done a vast disservice by their marketing department.  Probably they wanted to sell to the greatest number of customers possible and that's why they were vague.  All this does is alienate the customers who aren't part of the targeted demographic as well as not informing those who COULD potentially benefit from the product that this is for them.
It didn't last more than 20 uses.  That's not much.  It was good until it died, for what that's worth.The Remington S9500 is easy to use because it warms up to the desired temperature very quickly and because the ceramic plates and surface material, it slides very well against hair.  The  plates appear to be a technological advance over other hair straighteners.The cord is long and it can therefore be used more easily in some environments.  This hair straightener works as intended, although not for many uses in my case.  The good thing about it was that it took less time because of the quick heating and ease of pulling through the hair.A supplemental product that we discovered actually works when used over time to make individual hairs thicker and thereby make hair appear denser is BiotinNOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg, 120 Vcaps.  Together, this supplement and the S9500 can make some people's hair look even better!Finally, my experience might not be typical.  Maybe the one I got had a defect.  Still, I have to base my review on my experience only.  I recommend NOT to get this product.
OK, WOW, WHERE DO I BEGIN ??  I have 7 curling irons in my own collection and i thought this would be great.  First, it comes with a glove.  Do you know what the glove is for?  to hold the barrell as you twist your hair around it and hold it in place.  there is no top part that you flip up or open and put the end of the hair in and close it to hold it in place.  you actually have to hold your hair on the steaming hot barrell !!!  yes, i tried this thing 3 times.  each time, i almost burnt my hand.  the glove does not offer that much protection.  i just don't get it.  why would anyone get this thing?  i can't figure it out.  it's time consuming to no end.  it actually took me about 10 minutes to curl one strand of hair, and that was between taking my hand off because it was burning, my hair falling off the barrell and then putting the hair back on.now, if they would make it into a regular curling iron, i would buy it.  i love the ceramic part and it was a pretty pink color and i like the digital temp but wow, this is literally a hot mess.
I was looking for item to use with an add-on. I asked my wife if she needed anything and she said a new curling iron. I made a major blunder by ordering this iron without showing it to her first. She hates it primarily because of the glove part. She prefers the clamp type. I told her that over 1100 reviews gave it 5 stars. She said she would try it again.Long story short. She burned her finger and made a suggestion as to what I could do with this curling iron that she now hates with a purple passion. Being a good Samaritan can have its downfalls at times.
My hair is straight and fine.  I've used all sorts of styling tools, especially since I found a hair stylist who really knows how to cut my hair.  I have more styling tools than I care to admit, but I like trying new ones.  Usually it's fun, but it wasn't with this wand.The first time I tried it, I discovered the barrel is very slick.  I could not get my hair to stay wrapped around it.  After ten minutes of sectioning, winding, picking up and winding again I decided to let it go and try it again another day.  The second time I tried it, I had quite a bit of product in my hair, and that made it stick to the barrel just enough to wrap until I got to the end of the strand.  It's hard to feel my hair through that glove, and I wasn't getting it wrapped all the way to the end, so I wound up with curls with little straight wings on the end.  I finally resorted to holding my hair on the wand with my gloved hand to wrap the entire strand.  I spent about 45 minutes working on my hair.  My arms were exhausted, and my fingers were burning, as were my ears where I bumped them.  My hair didn't look good, either.There are many tools you can use to curl your hair.  Curling irons with clamps, rollers, hot rollers, curling brushes and flat irons, likeCorioliss Pro Fix Flat Iron, Pink, orRemington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1".  You can find lots of videos on the internet that show how to curl your hair with a flat iron, and it won't take 45 minutes.I cannot recommend this wand.  It's difficult to use, and frankly, it isn't safe, even with the glove.
It had great expectations over this product. I had heard many wonderful things over curling irons of this type of nature. So I opened my box, plugged the thing in and waited for it to heat up. I was a little taken aback over the prospect of using a glove to help curl my hair on an iron with no clamp, but the idea of beautiful bouncy curls atop my head prompted me to dawn the glove. Three curls in and I decided I hated the thing. I am not a hairdresser nor have I been trained in this arena I am guessing one needs to be in order to happily and successfully use this product. What may have started out as a beautiful curl up the barrel ended up in this twig of a thing of hair. No, I didn't burn my dew, but no matter how I tried I couldn't get my hair to lay flat over the barrel. The glove didn't help in that respect either. Sure it helped me in keeping the heat from my skin, unfortunately my hair stuck to the glove when I moved it through my hair further frustrating my efforts. 3 curls in. 10 minutes later. I unplugged the beast and threw it away, dug out my old iron and happily finished my hair. It needs a clamp to hold the hair in place or unless super tight to the scalp line your hair will slide up the barrel. I really don't have that kinda time to fight with a piece of beauty equipment such as that. So in the round file it went. Sorry, can't say I would recommend this product at all.
I have to admit that I'm not very good at styling my hair...but I do have a Sedu Revolution Flat Iron that I do fabulous curls with so I'm not a total retard in that aspect.  I wanted to try this out because it's a totally different way of curling hair and therefore would be able to do the spiral curls that would be very pretty...and I cannot do with my flat iron.  Well...that was the theory, anyways.This items comes with a pink curling wand and one heat resistant glove.  You will need the glove.  It was very quick to come up to heat and that's about the end of the pros.  I have layered hair and I couldn't get good results with this wand.  I guess maybe if all your hair was the same length, you would just grab a section of hair and wrap it around the wand.  If you have layered hair though, you get a lot of frizzies sticking out as you're trying to wind the section of hair around the wand.  The few curls that I did manage to get, the curls felt dried and burnt.  Not like my Sedu flat iron which comes out bouncy and soft.  I really needed to use the glove so that I wouldn't keep burning myself, yet the glove made it so that I couldn't feel my hair very well and I couldn't manipulate my hair properly.  All in all - I wasn't able to curl all my hair with this thing and just got frustrated so I stopped.I would not recommend this item unless if you really know how to work a wand type curler.  If you do...then this one does work.  It gets up to heat properly and does make some pretty curls.  It's just not for me.
I have long, thick, curly hair that tends to frizz when left to dry on its own.  I used this product on damp hair as directed and styled as usual.  Blah.  Even though I used a TINY amount, my hair looked limp and felt greasy.  It really bothered me every time I touched it.  Plus, it smells heavily of coconut.  I think this *might* work if your hair is very dry or coarse, but for normal hair, I give it a thumbs down.
A friend of mine who had tried my sonic cleaners thought she was getting a great deal on this cleaner that was modeled to look just the same as the Clarisonic and Nutrasonic.  If it did not bill itself as working the same as those sonic cleaners in the product page, I'd have no beef with it.  But it does.This is simply a spinning brush, no different than rubbing your skin really hard with a washcloth. It is not a sonic cleaner and does not claim to be and therein lies the difference.There are expensive sonic toothbrushes, expensive sonic professional jewelry cleaners, and expensive sonic skin cleaners. They are expensive for a reason. They use sonic wavelength technology to microscopically clean and reach where surface scrubbing cannot, and do so gently.I love Olay products and because of that I'm disappointed that they style this and bill it as a match to the high end sonic cleaners because, unlike other Olay products I've liked, this will actually do more harm than good.I could do a long comparison review here telling you how the speeds differ, the bristles differ, the cost of the brushes etc. but to me it's not about that. I'll let you make your own decisions there.  What's important for me to note on this one, is that it actually damages your skin.There is a reason why you should only do microdermabrasion treatments with fine molecules (not with things like apricot scrubs which actually damage skin) and only rarely.  Because harsh treatments on skin will actually cause miniscule DAMAGE to the top layer.  What you want to do with sonic cleaners, is remove the dead skin, without hurting the new skin underneath--thus cleansing pores and reducing wrinkles.If you have a microscope in a kid's set or science set at home, do what we did.  Use this on one hand for a week and either do nothing on the other hand or borrow a sonic cleaner.  At the end of the week, compare both.  You can actually see damage on the skin layers using this and smoother skin using the sonic cleaner, or nothing at all.This is no different than scrubbing really hard with a washcloth.  And that develops more wrinkles as well.  A sonic cleaner cleans with sonic wavelengths, not harsh abrasiveness.  Yes it costs more, but it's better to simply use your hands than use this until you find a good bargain on a Nutrasonic or Clarisonic.
Hmmm.  I normally like Olay products, so I'm not sure how they wound up with this huge misfire.  But this product is awful.  Even for free.First of all, the name of the product is "7-in-1 Anti-aging Eye Cream". So, call me crazy, but I thought this would be, you know, an eye cream.  It's not.  There is nothing eyecreamy going on here... it's not moisturizing at all and in fact my middle aged eyes (and I would think I am the target demo here) need an actual eye cream first for this product to go on at all.  So ... what's the point?  It also claims to 'immediately reduce the appearance of dark circles'.  I had to laugh. Dark circle appearance is reduced because this is a concealer. It's makeup! There's nothing magic, it's not actually treating your dark circles... it's hiding them.Which brings me to my second point: Even if you accept this product for what it is (a concealer), it still fails.  The gigantic nylon brush glops way too much product on, and you need to use your finger to blend it anyway so why bother with a brush at all?  The texture is very thick and unpleasant.  The color is too dark for me.  This is a very heavy, unnatural-looking concealer.  Yuck.BOTTOM LINE: This is a concealer, not an eye cream - you need to use an actual eye cream first to get this stuff to go on smoothly.  As a concealer it is heavy and gloppy and thick.  I can't recommend this product to anyone at all.  I tried it for a few days to give a fair review, then tossed it.
This is a rather strange product, I have been using it for over a month now and quite frankly I don't see any difference, when I get lots of sleep my face smoothes out in hours and I'm only thirty so I say don't waste your hard earned money, this doesn't look or feel like eye cream, the fluid looks like liquid foundation and it's dark, a yellow tinted makeup is what this resembles... I always felt silly painting it on with that huge brush and would find the need for eye cream in the end anyways, so what's the point, I read the box twice trying to see what this is, they don't call it an eye cream making it look and feel like a vague gimmick. Try if you're really curious but it's nothing I would recommend to any of my friends and I love to share if they want to listen, so this says a lot. With so many eye and face products on the market I wouldn't waste my time on this, not recommended from my experience.Shiseido, Burt's Bees and Estee Lauder are great for eye products, as much as I adore Olay products this seems a bit bizarre from them, not a concealer and not a cream, a nothing in between!
Typically I find Olay products to my liking.I have never tried an anti-aging product before sowas not sure what to expect. This made me a littleconcerned about writing a review.I should not have worried! I am not having any difficultywith this at all. As far as I can tell it really did nothing.It was not moisturizing in my opinion, nor did it fade the darkcircles or even conceal them.I tried to approach this the the most open of minds, andI have given this several weeks trial. Nothing. No differencethat I or my sister can see.Not recommended by me.
As many of the other reviewers have stated, yes, this is more like a concealer and not really what I'd call a cream. The color & texture of this is like a medium colored yellow based foundation. I'm fair skinned & I don't really have dark circles too badly and when I put this underneath my eyes, it actually emphasized what dark circles I did have.Also, I didn't notice any improvement with the start of any fine lines I do have.Just doesn't work for me.
Anti aging-noDark Circle- noI have no idea what this should be doing, but I have used Olay products before and this is by far the worst product made by them.I do not get dark circles often, so I did try it and my concealer worked much better than this. I think you need to customize when it comes to dark circles for skin tones.
I thought this was a moisturizer and dark circle treatment product.  When I bought it at the store, that is what the package advertising made it sound like.It's actually a bad concealer.  I bought it before I read all the reviews....silly me!  It won't happen again.
Having reached my mid-40s, I've become somewhat obsessed with undoing the damage to my skin caused by a couple of decades suntanning, sleeping in makeup, and skipping the moisturizer. As part of my efforts, I'd had a glycolic peel which had produced amazing results. I've also become religious about daily cleansing, toning, moisturizing, and every week I get a facial. The result was that my skin had been looking better lately than it had in YEARS.Then I tried this stuff. I did not change anything else in my skincare routine; I simply used this daily moisturizer, night cream and eye cream in place of the Olay Pro products I'd run out of. Three days into it, I started to break out. Every woman knows those things can happen with hormone fluctuations, stress, eating the wrong stuff or, heck, just because the planets got out of alignment. (Kidding.) So I kept using Youth Code... and I kept breaking out, particularly on my nose. Meanwhile, I thought the skin under my eyes was looking less hydrated but I also wondered if my frustration over my breakouts might have made me more critical of the product.When I went for my weekly facial, my aesthetician just about blew her top. Not only were my pores clogged again (hence the nose zits) but she confirmed that the area under my eyes looked more crepey. So I'm not using this product anymore, and now I'm looking at a couple of weeks working on unplugging my pores and calming my skin again.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Unfortunately within 48 hours of use, my skin began to develop a really bad problem.  It became very dry with a few pimples - definitely not what I was going for in a skin treatment.  Maybe it's just me, so I can't speak for everyone. But I'm definitely avoiding products from Oil of Olay.
Neutrogena claims that there will be "visible results in just one week".The only results that I saw within one week were ALL of the side effects posted on the side of the box:1) mild redness:  my skin is light, so the redness was visible & I had to wear darker foundation to cover up the redness;2) warm, tingling sensation: my skin felt like it was badly sunburned & was very sensitive to touch for about 3 days;3) flaking: skin felt dry & flaked just as warned (I doubled up on my daily moisturizer).The redness, sensitive skin & flaking did subside after 3 days (I went to every other night per the instructions).  I've been using the product for over 2 weeks & see a bit of softening of my laugh lines in the morning, but the laugh lines return by the end of the day.  Small wrinkles around the eyes and forehead creases haven't changed at all.Impressions:The bottle is a nice looking bottle, but is tall and is deceptive in the amount of product that it contains (there is only 1oz of product & the bottle looks like it holds much more).  Also, the bottle is a solid color, so it is impossible to tell how much or how little product is left in the bottle.There are 31 ingredients in the bottle & Retinol is ingredient #27.  Water is the #1 ingredient.This product did not work for me. I am disappointed.
I would not recommend this product to anyone.My complexion is medium in tone.  I tan easily.I followed simple directions and had a severe skin burning reaction.  My face actually hurt.  Waited two days then three days between applications.  Same thing happened to my skin. Everything I used to try to soothe the burned skin made the condition worse.
My wife really didn't like how there wasn't any information on what age group this wrinkle cream is for. She looked high and low, unable to find anything. Despite this, she reluctantly gave it a try; my wife had a very bad reaction to it, in which she described as a burning feeling and promptly stopped using it after a few attempts. I don't think a burning sensation is such a great reaction also.I mentioned this night cream to my mom and she shared with me her bad experience with a Neutrogena product. She mentioned that in about a month of using the cream, she got more wrinkles as the product was not for her age group. At the very least, Neutrogena should clearly state what age group this is for and what can happen to those that use it that are younger.
This product says I will work in 7 days. I have very fine wrinkles. I gave the Neutrogena Rapid wrinkle repair two weeks to improve my wrinkles. After two weeks I saw no improvement. It does smell nice and is a nic lotion, but there was no wrinkle repair. I would not recommend this product!!
I did not find this shampoo to help my hair color.  I also found it to be a little drying, ended up with frizzies.  The smell is nice, but I would not purchase again.
If I worked at an old hospital and got used to the smell first maybe this would be okay.  It smells horrible!  I got it on half my face and felt sick so I washed it off and still smelled it on myself all day.  I don't care if it worked, I had to throw out the bottle because I can't use something that smells this bad.  If you have no olfactory senses, you might want to give this a try!
This purports to be hypoallergenic, but it is not, since fragrance is perhaps the top allergen/irritant, and this is highly fragranced (and not naturally so as the ad copy suggests--the label clearly excepts it from the naturally sourced ingredients--claiming it is somehow necessary for the product ?!?!). It also doesn't clean very well--it seemed to be repelled by the long-wearing makeup (silicone is the sensitive skin's friend!). I also tried just using it as a hand wash, but it seemed ineffective for that. I'm not sure what this is good for--washing skin that isn't really dirty?We have soft-ish water here, and it felt a lot like I was using hard water. FAIL!
This product from Clearasil is supposed to "clear pimples fast and reduce the appearance of marks."  The product does "double duty," according to Clearasil's website, as the product can also be used as a mask.After three days of using this cleanser rather than my usual product, I started breaking out.  The product contains salicylic acid rather then benzoyl peroxide - fine for exfoliating skin, but not so great for the treatment and prevention of acne by itself.  I switched back to my regular 10% benzoyl peroxide cleanser, and my skin went back to normal.As for using it as a mask, the directions say to slather the cleanser onto wet skin and leave for a full minute - what my doctor advised me to do with ANY acne wash to help it penetrate.The bottom line for me is that there are a dozen better acne washes out there.  Skip this one in favor of a good benzoyl peroxide wash.
Unfortunately, I cannot give you a review of the actual product, but I can tell you that its not a good thing when you want to try a new lotion/serum etc. but there is a problem with getting it out of the dispenser.  I popped off the cap and pushed down to dispense the serum, but nothing.  So I figured I needed to do it a few times, still nothing.  Then I thought it might be like some soap dispensers and I needed to twist it to get it to work, still...nothing.  I then pushed down over 100 times, to try to have it start working...all to no avail.  I EVEN read the packaging and the label on the pump to see if I was missing something...nope.  So I have a bottle of Olay Regenerist wrinkle revolution complex, but God only knows how I'm supposed to get it on my face...guess I'll have to contact the company...to be cont'd.  :)
Upon first sight, this is a really nice case. It looks sleek, well built and, in my opinion, like a crazy little beauty safe! Then I opened the case and it was quickly apparent how cheap the case is. The edge metal on the top isn't flush or fastened to the case and has bubbled a bit so you can push it up and down. The metal on the outside seems to be very thin facade over cardboard. The corners are the most well made part- consisting of solid metal corners to prevent scuffing or damage to the most vulnerable part of the outer case.Inside, the bucket shelves that slide out and open are cardboard covered in cloth, which is fine, but fragile. But my biggest disappointment was how these shelves were attached into the case. They are only attached at the bottom by a bracket and at the top by a slide bracket that isn't firm enough to keep the shelves steady. The shelves can be tilted, uneven, and feel so poorly attached to the case, I was expecting them to break just through my cursory inspection. The fabric on the shelves is cut and glued and on the corner of shelves, it is already frayed and will soon be pulling free easily.The clasps seem to have key holes, but no key was included...I wouldn't buy this for myself or anyone else, for that matter. I expect it to be broken in a week or so of regular use. I intend to give it to my 12 yr old niece to do with what she wishes! If it breaks, it breaks! (which I fully expect it to do).
For starters I got this for my wife, I'm a guy and I don't use curling irons. However, I did some tests with this curling iron by testing the various temp settings it claimed it could reach and the curling iron consistently under performed. Keep in mind, the description says "Lcd temperature control, heats up to 400 degress f in 30 seconds".... you'll see that is a fantasy and not at all reality.First test, 0 degrees to 220 which is the minimum setting on the curling iron:The max temp it reached was 180+/- after 2 minutes. Approx 50 degrees shy of 220.... And nowhere close to 30 seconds...Second test, 0 to 310 degrees which is the default temp the curling iron is at when turned on:I timed this one and broke it down in 30 second increments. The max temp was 286 degrees, that was 26 degrees off30 sec = 250 degrees (it should have reached max temp in this window....)1 min = 263 degrees1.5 min = 274 degrees2 min = 278 degrees2.5 min = 283 degrees3 min = 283 degrees3.5 min = 284 degrees4 min = 282 degrees4.5 min = 285 degrees5 min = 287 degrees5.5 min = 284 degrees6 min = 286 degrees (6 minutes and not even close to the set temp, nowhere near the 30 seconds it claims)Third test I turned it on to max which is 400 degrees, the description clearly says "Lcd temperature control, heats up to 400 degress f in 30 seconds"I timed it for approx 5 minutes and the max it reached was 361 degrees. That's approx 39 degrees off and took over 5 and a half minutes longer then it should have to get to that temp!I'll say the curling iron is built decent, the construction feels solid, the cord is long and it comes with a nice heat mat to keep you from burning your counter, table, wherever you put this thing. But the fact it can't reach the temps it is set at in a period of 5+ minutes is a concern to me when they claim 30 seconds. With a product that states it has instant heat in 30 seconds it lives up to it, but it doesn't even come close to reaching the set temp and in my tests of 5-6 minutes... This curling iron is a complete failure.The directions that come with the curling iron states that 220 degrees is good for delicate hair, that test I reached 180. 310 degrees is good for average hair, that hit the 286 degree mark, 26 degrees off. High of 400 degrees was good for curly hair and it only hit 361 degrees, 39 degrees off.If you need a curling iron and temperature isn't that important to you then this might be a good one, like I said it's built well. But if you need precision in terms of heat this isn't what you want.Please note I did these tests with a calibrated infrared laser thermometer. It's an accurate, hi-tech measuring device. Other items I tested include my fridge which was right on, my AC which is accurate and my freezer which is right. The only thing way off is this curling iron.I'm attaching pictures of my tests to this product as well.
My daughter experimented with this and another straightener.  This one - which is more money than the other - did not straighten as well nor do the "curl" feature it was advertised to.  (Maybe her hair is too thick?).  She also burned herself - the design seems like the hot area are where you normally place your hands while straightening.  The cord is long and swivels, which is nice.  But it tries to do too much and there are better options out there at better prices.
We did not like this hair styler -- it took too much time to make a wave in your hair. It was very hot and was not safe for me or my young teen to use. We used it once and put it back in the box.
After carefully watching the instructional dvd, (28 min long), I powered this baby up with visions of smooth, glorious skin dancing in my head.  Alas, the lights came on but nothing else happened.  I tried hard to see if I could do anything to get it going but it is just a small light machine.  Arggghhhh!!!!  I wanted it to work so badly!  After reading the other reviews, it doesn't seem like a very reliable machine for the price.
I was a little nervous about using this on my face, so I prepared myself by watching the instructional DVD twice and reading all of the enclosed material. The DVD is very reassuring, and very misleading. They make it sound like you just need a little practice at the lowest setting and all will be well. Not true.Right out of the box, my unit functioned poorly with the fine tip attached. I started trying to use it on my forehead just like on the DVD. They must have turned the unit off for those DVD demonstrations. You cannot slide the tip smoothly across your face like that. If you have adequate suction, as soon as you start to move across your skin, the tip pops off your face. With my unit, suction was sporadic and mostly nonexistent with the fine tip attached.I switched to the precision tip, which gave me more reliable suction, but I still couldn't use it as instructed, because it HURTS. I was not pressing hard, but it was like pushing sandpaper tightly against your face and then dragging it across the skin. I don't have particularly sensitive skin, but this was so harsh that I decided to check some reviews before possibly damaging my skin. I'm glad I did. I won't be using this unit on my face again. One reviewer mentioned that people have been injured by this product, and she herself was under a doctor's care to heal the damage it did to her skin.On the DVD they say your face will have some redness for about 30 minutes after a treatment. Once again, untrue. Many hours after use, there were still red patches on my face, and my forehead and nose had a burning sensation.I thought maybe I could at least get some benefit from the machine by using it on the dry and calloused places on my feet. For that I used the coarse tip and a higher suction level. It was a complete waste of time. The only place you can get suction is on the bottoms of your feet. No edges or contours, because you have to the the entire tip flat against your skin to get suction. I have big calluses on the outer edges of my big toes, and there was no way I could get the tip flat enough to get any suction in that area.I cannot recommend this product, and I suggest you read a large number of reviews carefully before making your purchase decision. I'll stick with more gentle forms of exfoliation, and accept my fate of being old and ugly.
If you have sensitive skin DO NOT try this product.  The product actually irritated not soothed my skin and I DON'T have sensitive skin.  I love Neutrogena products but this is a no-go for me.
Update. 5-13-14. I now have a eye infection..Never had one till I started using this eye balm!!I have used other L'Oreal products with out any problems before this one!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Just got this, and as I said, after two days, I now have dark circles and Puffiness under my eyes!!This is a heavy eye balm, and it seems to even wait down the skin under my eyes.I'm not young, and have bought allot of eye creams,but this is the worse.Also you have to use the top part of your nails to get this stuff out of the jar.Now I know to only buy eye cream in a tube.I would not recommend this to anyone..Maybe it is more for a man with thicker skin.. Maybe my Hubby might like it!!Or I'll use it for cuticle cream around my nails and toes..
After several weeks our 14 year old is not seeing any results, has given up on the product and moved on to something else. We were hopeful, and I wish we could say we had seen "something" improved at least, but alas we cannot. He did not have any adverse effects from the product, as others have stated here, like redness or irritation, but it just didn't work for him :(  All bodies are different, results cannot be the same for everyone.  We thank Amazon for the opportunity to test and review this product for their  Vine program.
After two months, I honestly couldn't spot a single difference or improvement in my skin since adding this to my routine.  I was using a serum from Philosophy (Philosophy When Hope is not Enough Serum-1 oz) which costs a third of this and worked much better.  I won't be buying this again
I was excited for the opportunity to sample and review one of the high end facial products but that quickly turned to disappointment.  I do not have sensitive skin but one use and I had red blotches across my forehead. The scent was very strong, almost perfumed rather than just scented. Why is that even needed on a facial product? I'll continue to try the products on my hands to use them up but this is not a product i would ever pay for or recommend. Oil of Olay is a better bet for your money.
The research:Foremost, let's look at what dermatologists have to say about the use of gold in "skin care." A phenomenal report in the New York Times noted, "Dr. Judith Hellman, a dermatologist in New York City, did research into gold face creams after enough magazine beauty editors pestered her about them. 'At best, they do nothing, and at worst, they can give you irritation of the skin,' she said. 'I would tell people to put that money into gold that they can wear around their neck or on their fingers.'" From the same article, another dermatologist (Dr. Jeannette Graf) stated that, she had done "intensive medical searches on this very ingredient" and found that "there are absolutely no scientific studies that show that gold has any effect in firming or revitalizing the skin, nor that it reduces wrinkles or gives skin a plumped, golden glow.'" But Dr. Graf did find that gold was named "'allergen of the year' in 2001 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society" (Kingson, Jennifer. May 24 2011. Fashion and Style Section). I know that this seems obvious to most American consumers. We watch The Doctors and Dr. Oz. We read Consumer Reports. Nonetheless, we sometimes get distracted by "big claims." So, absolutely know that you are paying for gold that will have no positive impact on your skin. And, know that those who have sensitive skin can actually be negatively impacted by these products. (That's straight from the research). Therefore, be certain to conduct a patch-test (i.e. apply the product to a small area, wait twenty-four hours, and then proceed with this product if there are no negative results).Now for the "caviar" claim. Again, Americans are smart consumers. However, sometimes it takes awhile to disseminate the proper information to the public. Therefore, many may truly believe that this could be the next "big thing." What I can tell you is that caviar is not that next "fountain of youth." As reported by The Associated Press, Dr. Sanusi Umar clearly stated that there is no evidence that caviar has any benefit.What else do you need to know? The first ingredient is water. This may be problematic for a variety of reasons. Many in the field are quick make one loud point: if water is the first ingredient, the product is usually 70-95% water. Now consider that some preservatives are included (because water "spoils") and you do not really have a great deal of active ingredients remaining.Now, if you search some of the ingredients on this label, you may be alarmed to find that there are a few alarming reports about "propylene gycol." However, I think it is crucial to note that our FDA has labelled it safe. (It is even used in dog food ... so, again, I feel like you have no worries here). Still, it may do you good to dig deeper into this debate. It seems really heated.Now, my main concern (again as a savvy consumer) was that this product is manufactured in Spain (i.e. without the careful watch of the FDA). So I did some investigating. The good news is our FDA website states, "Cosmetic products imported into the United States are subject to the same laws and regulations as those produced in the United States. They must be safe for their intended uses and contain no prohibited ingredients." But there is also a statement that claims, "The FDA encourages cosmetic firms to register their establishments and file Cosmetic Product Ingredient Statements with FDA's Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP). However, firms importing products considered to be solely cosmetics in the United States are not required to register with FDA."Since there are no ingredients listed on the plastic bottle itself, you may wish to save the box and show it to your dermatologist if you have any questions.The experience itself:Since some people are sensitive to scent, I thought it sage to report that there is a moderate to heavy aroma comparable to baby powder with a touch of cinnamon. To most, it will not be offensive. (I found it quite pleasant). To a few, it could prove prohibitive. (And, there are a few for whom it will clash with their signature scents).It goes on clear and finishes clear.It is not tacky (to the touch) and seems to "disappear" into the skin.I had no problem with layering an SPF 20 tinted moisturizer over this.I see no genuine differences yet (not even on a temporary basis like with many beauty-counter products that contain caffeine and the like). However, I will report back when the bottle is complete and provide my end results. And, I feel it only fair to note that I use Refissa every night (a prescription anti-aging retinoid) and follow that in the morning with CeraVe with a fresh "punch" of vitamin C (Philosophy Turbo Booster C Powder) which provides sun protection. Pretty much whatever my dermatologist suggests, I do. So, I may not see any difference with a beauty-counter product. We will find out!And, pick up this month's (January 2013) Allure because:If you desire great skin, Allure has a great section titled "28 Days Later" (no, it is not about zombies!) Here is the gist of this well-researched article devoted to getting great, glowing skin within a month:-Wear sunscreen every day-Get quality sleep-Add more fruits and veggies to your diet (for the antioxidants)-Exfoliate regularly-Use a retinoid (they even suggestNeutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair... which is extremely cost efficient).-Add more water to your diet-Moisturize (they suggestCeraVe Moisturizing Lotionas does every physician I have ever visited. It is SUPER cheap, comes in a huge container, and genuinely is one of the very best moisturizers you can use).This is how to change your skin. Yes, it takes effort, but why pay for "gold" and "caviar" that numerous studies indicate are ineffective when you can follow this simple list of small suggestions? You CAN make this list your friend. You WILL save yourself money and frustration. And, as countless doctors are quick to note, in the case of beauty-counter skin care, expensive does not mean better (at all).
I used to use a terrific temporary-but-instant plumping product from Avon, and unfortunately they stopped making it. Since then I have been looking for a product to replace it, and this is not it. This stuff makes your skin feel tight where you put it, and not in a comfortable way. And it leaves flakes when it dries. Didn't like this AT ALL. I will have to keep looking for my miracle product.
When I squirted this in my hand, I had a feeling it was not going to work for me.  I used it anyway.  Bad idea!  It broke my hands out in rash after only one use!  It didn't seem to make much difference in my hair, either.  There are other brands out there that are much better than this.  If you have any issues with fragrance, stir clear of this product.  It annoys me to no end all the products with fragrances.  If everything has a difference fragrance, you could end up smelling pretty awful!This serum is 1.9fl oz.  States 48 hour frizz control.  Dispenses from a pump bottle.
The first ingredient listed on this item is "Water", that means water is the main ingredient. That's a big negative. I don't like this. I usually use oil of olay original. I love it, it makes my skin look and feel like a new babies skin. This stuff makes my face feel dry and tough. It gave me no softness at all. It does have a little odor, nothing terrible but nothing good either. It reminds me of what lotions smell like after they have gotten very old and runny. It feels like it blocks my pores. I left it on for an hour or so then washed it off. I won't be using the rest of it. If you want something that truly works everytime with a minimal amount needed & is mild to sensitive skin & hypo-alergenic then use Oil of Olay. Just the "original" is all you need. I use about the size around in my hand of a dime & it's enough to do my entire face & neck & I don't have to worry about if it gets near my eyes, I just shut my eyes and massage it lightly all over my face. Keeps it smooth and soft and moisturized all day & it keeps your skin looking younger and no smell to it except fresh and clean & it leaves NO oily or sticky residue. This item does none of those things. Try oil of olay and you won't need anything else. I'm 60 and started using it at age 30 and I don't look 60, not my words, all my friends say that and they can't believe I'm 60. I swear I don't look over 50,at best, & it's due to using oil of olay original.
Since December has arrived in NYC I have found my skin to be very dry.  We have had an unusually warm winter thus far but it is still wreaking havoc on my legs, arms, forhead and cheekbone area.  T-zone area a bit oily with the rest being rather dry and flaky.  Now onto this moisturizer...The product arrived and I applied to my face after my morning cleaning regimen.  My first observation was that it had no scent at ALL.  The product is labeled for sensitive skin, hypo-allergenic and noncomedogenic that is dermatologist tested to be pure and free of harsh chemicals and dyes.  I just don't agree with their claims because of my personal experience.  I use Dermologica moisturizer, scrubs and sprays.  I alternate with St. Ives scrubs every third day and use an Aveeno nightime moisturizer nightly.  For full disclosure I will let it be known that I had abandoned my regimen for a week which initially lead to the dry, flaky skin on certain parts of my face.  This is the reason that I reached for this moisturizer the day that it had arrived.  Initially as I applied I found that it took a bit of cream to actually cover my face and have it feel 'moisturized'.  It didn't feel as if it was enough.  By the midday my face didn't feel as dry as the day before.  The next day I applied again but my skin just didn't feel right.  It felt rather tight and it stung... initially I thought the stinging was a 'refreshing cold feeling.  By the third day I finally realized that the refreshing feeling was actually burning my face.  It was feeling sunburned!!  I didn't realize something was wrong until I took a photo for Christmas Day and I was all red.  Somehow the flash enhanced the mess on my face which alerted me to turning on all the lights in my bathroom to inspect my face.  I discovered that it has a red tint on my upper cheeks/bones and the t-zone area.  I was appalled and very upset that a product marketed for sensitive skin actually did this to my face.  I discontinued use immediately and found that my skin while not noticeable visually felt like it had tiny bumps allover.  Back to my tried and true products and my face recovered two weeks later.  Never will I use any product that is not popular in the USA, nor will I believe a good thing can be found dirt cheap.  My Dermologica products are minimally 25 dollars a piece but worth every penny.  If you need a good value than Aveeno and St. Ives products will fit the bill.Do not recommend this product.  It wreaked havoc on my skin.  My skin isn't that sensitive and this product did damage; I am afraid if a poor soul that had ultra sensitive skin used this product.  I went to have a treatment on my face and the aesthetician remarked that my face seemed, 'sunburned'.  I wish I could point out which ingredient did this but I dumped the tube after I saw that picture Christmas morning.  It truly felt as if there was alcohol in the mix.
After loving the toner I thought the lotion would be great as well and I could start saving some money on facial products. I have no idea what was in this to make my face break out but it did. My skin is very sensitive. I use Glymed products and a Clarsonic ritually. I tried this lotion for a week just to make sure my skin wasn't trying to adjust or if it was PMS but it was definitely the lotion.
I guess it's probably the result of my gene pool but I'm cursed with frustratingly sensitive, reactive skin. Even the one cleanser I've found that is alright for my skin isn't great. I recently decided to start looking for a better alternative in hopes of finally having happy skin. Simple's claims sounded good so I thought I'd give it a try.The first two days that I used it my skin was so painfully parched and flaky I almost gave up. But I figured since it was new to my skin I would give it a month before I tossed it. Maybe I just needed to get used to it. I spent the next three weeks suffering from the worst acne breakout I have had in months! Break-through breakouts are not uncommon when switching cleansers but it just got worse and worse. To make it more awful my skin was so flaky and dried out. But since my husband was also using it and had initially said he liked it I left it for him to keep using. A week later he was having the same miserable breakout symptoms I had been having.Needless to say we've gone back to our old product and will not be using Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash. I believe that one of the main reasons we both had this much trouble is that the second ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate. Having recently read an article about this chemical--and industrial degreaser used in many soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and other products for cleaning because it's cheap--I think it's probably part of the problem. I think it might be time to remove it completely from our home but first of all not using it on our sensitive skin!While I hated this product, I did also trySimple Cleansing Facial Wipes, 25 Count (Pack of 2)which I have had no adverse reaction to. They're soft, big enough for the whole face and neck, and nice for those times you need to clean up in a hurry. I definitely liked them better than the face wash.
Sure they are fragrance free, but they also feel like cheap tissues, hard and scratchy on your skin, and they do not remove any dirt or surface impurities whatsoever.  After trying these first on myself and then my pre-teenaged daughter who has the start of oily skin, I expected to see either a residue or at least some oil or dirt on the cloth.  Nothing ~ not a thing ~ like we didn't even use it!  Directions are to use the wipe on your face and neck for maximum benefit.  We followed the directions but the feel was not refreshing or cleansing and we didn't think our faces were cleaner at all, let alone exfoliated.  I will toss these and go with either Neutrogena or Clean and Clear next time.
I enjoy facial wipes- usually a quick ways get your makeup off when you are too  lazy or tired to wash.These wipes however, were horrible.The material is rough and abrasive.It's like trying to exfoliate your face with sand paper.In addition the wipes are not porous- so they on't feel "wet" enough.My skin is oily and  tough, and these were too rough for me.If you have delicate or sensitive skin, do not  not use these.Also way too abrasive for the eye area.I cannot recommend these at ll.
I know these are supposed to be exfoliating, but even though I consider myself to have very tough (not sensitive at all) skin, these hurt my face. I actually threw them away.
First of all, the wipe is not as soft and thick as I would hope for a gentle facial wipe to be. It felt more like a hand wipe they give you on a airplane. And this tingled my eyes so bad, I had to use water to wash everything off. My eyes were irritated and sensitive skin around eyes was burning for a bit afterwards. This is not gentle and kind to skin! AT ALL!
Simple Soothing Facial Toner gave my face a nice soothing feel that I enjoyed, but after I enjoy using this toner when I come out of the shower. I had high expectations for this product but the next day I noticed my complexion had these very fine bumps that are similar to a rash. I wanted to be sure that it was this product that was doing this to my skin so the next day I only used this product and again my face had this fine but rash like irritation on my face. I really wasn't pleased with the results and I immediately discontinued my use of the Simple Soothing Facial Toner.I love Simple Facial products and have used them before because of my sensitive skin but something in this particular product didn't agree with my skin. I will use Simple Facial products again but just not this toner.
Because the Simple line of facial products bills itself as a pure, hypoallergenic line of products for sensitive skin, I was shocked to see that this facial scrub lists water and mineral oil as the first two ingredients.  Mineral oil is a cheap, odorless distillation of petroleum, and while other products such as Vaseline and Chapstick are petroleum-based, mineral oil has no place on delicate and/or sensitive skin.  Think of it this way:  mineral oil is used as a laxative because it prevents water from being absorbed into the body.  It creates a barrier.  On the face, it means clogged pores and, ironically, drier skin. I own a couple of other facial scrubs:  Clinique and a Walmart-branded apricot scrub.  Neither contain mineral oil.I do applaud Simple for using more natural exfoliating beads from a natural source, rice; however, the scrubbing beads are too big and too few per square inch, making them not as effective as those in products with a smaller, high volume concentration of beads.  The scent is off-putting, although I didn't find it as strong as others have noted.  It's just not a pleasant smell.  Heck, if Simple is going to use mineral oil, it may as well add a light scent to cover that of the ingredients.If you want an inexpensive facial scrub, you'd be better off getting the Walmart Equate brand of apricot scrub.  Otherwise, go with a better, hypoallergenic brand such as Clinique.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
I recently developed facial acne and have been trying a few different products to help manage it. I have used the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub daily for two weeks. I was excited to try it because it is "natural" and "unscented." Honestly, the only difference I have noticed in my skin is that it is a little drier. This product does not foam or lather well and it has an obtrusive aroma. I do not recommend it for combination oily skin or for people sensitive to strong aromas.
This product is really not simple. It contains mineral oil and parabens, which have been shown to cause cancer. The texture is slightly gritty. It irritated my face. I won't be using it again.
I like to wash my face before I go to bed. My face tends toward oily. I followed the directions; wet my face with warm water, put some of the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel onto my hands and work it into a lather, wash my face in a circular pattern. I did so even more thoroughly than I would have with my glycerin bar or regular soap, but when I rinsed my face off with water, my face was just as oily as it was when I started.I did one more wash with my glycerin bar for the satisfactory results I was initially seeking.I do not care for this product. In my opinion, this stuff is absolutely worthless. I just can't recommend this as a refreshing facial wash.
I HATED this face wash with a vengeance. The biggest thing was that it didn't clean. I use a mineral powder base and a little blush so I am not heavy on the makeup, and this cleaner couldn't even remove that. But then to add insult to injury, when you try to rinse it off IT WON'T COME OFF! It sticks to your face like glue and I had to rub and go over it several times just to feel like it was off me.  And like many others have complained about, the smell is not pleasant.  Not horrible like many described, but still... it could have been so much better.  I just cannot recommend this slime for your face. :(
As a breast cancer survivor and am always checking cosmetic ingredients on EWG's Skin Deep web site. Their web site will give you information on ingredients used in products, even cleaning products. You can also check Wikipedia which uses information obtained from EWG's web site.Ingredients in this product are bad for you. Specifically, Sodium Laureth Sulfate which is the second ingredient listed (which means there's a lot of it in this product). The problem with SLS is that during the processing of the chemical there are toxic impurities present, specifically DIOXANE, which is a known CARCINOGEN and NERVOUS SYSTEM TOXIN. SLS is banned or used on a very limited basis in Canada and Europe because of its toxicity.Besides SLS, Benzisothiazolinone and Cacamidopropyl Betaine are main ingredients. These are known to cause HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM TOXICITY and can irritate your skin, eyes, and lungs.If you use this product, I would recommend only using for very occasional cleaning, but rinse very thoroughly. Don't use as a skin cleaner and don't let your kids use it at all on a regular basis.I just can't give this product a good rating, and even more since the container is sealed, so you can't even replace their cleaning solution with a healthier alternative.
I've been using this body wash for over two weeks and it has caused a horrible breakout on my back and arms and my skin is unbearably itchy. I'm not sure what ingredient has caused this reaction because I normally use Dove Softening body wash and I've never had any reaction to it. I REALLY love the Dove Softening wash so I will stick with that. I do not recommend this Toning body wash for people with sensitive skin.
I usually use home made soap made from goats milk. I thought why not try something new. Such a mistake. I used for a week and was so dry and uncomfortable I had to quit using this body wash. I don't feel I am someone with dry skin but this product sure did dry me out. I don't live in a really cold area so dry skin isn't usually a problem.So I have no idea if it tones and I quit using before I noticed any.
DISCLOSURE:I am an Amazon Vine Reviewer that gets free products in exchange for my reviews.  Normally, my review would have the following warning in green at the top "Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program."  The reason this review does not show this green warning is because Amazon canceled this order before it shipped but then several days later shipped me the product anyway. Therefore, I want the readers to know that I did not purchase this item in case that is a concern to you and because I feel like it's stealing if I don't review all the products I receive, I decided to submit my review anyway.REVIEW:Normally I am not a fan of creme or moisturizing body washes because those types of soaps always felt like I was showering with hand lotion.  However, one day I decided to tryOlay Total Effects 7 in One Body Wash, Deep Penetrating Moisture, 15.2 Ounce (Pack of 2)because it was offered under on the Vine program.  I absolutely fell in love with that body wash and have since ordered it many times under the subscribe and save program.  Therefore, when I selected this body wash I expected a product that acted the same as the Olay body wash. Unfortunately, my experience is extremely disappointing and here is why.- It lathers lightly.- It feels like I'm washing with body lotion.- The fragrance is off-putting to me -- it kind of smells like Aloe but there's no Aloe in the product.- It leaves a residue on my skin which I am fine with on the Olay product but am not pleased with it on this product because I do not feel as clean or smell as fresh as the Olay product makes me feel.- I tried to use it for 7 days to see if it "visibly enhances skin's beauty in one week" but was only able to tolerate four days because it itches me. Each day that I used this product made me itch more than the day before. However, the itching was not bad enough to make me scratch but it was almost getting to the point where I would be scratching soon. Originally, I thought the itchy feeling was because of dry skin but because I moisturize heavily I discovered it's definitely this product.  I have very sensitive skin so there must be some ingredient in here that doesn't work for me.  The only part of my body that does not itch are the soles of my feet and my hands.I will make sure to never ever buy this product for myself. As far as I'm concerned this creme body wash gets ZERO stars.PS My review for the Olay product I mentioned is in the comments for those who are interested.
The Introduction:I am not a neophyte to prestige skincare. I am also aware that a person should use these (at most) in tandem with prescription strength retinoids (such as Refissa or Renova). My own dermatologist is adamant that protocol should entail washing once-a-day with [ASIN:B001ET76EY Cetaphil]], followed by a basic moisturizer likeCeraVe, and Refissa/Renova at bedtime. She is extremely vocal that this is the only scientifically proven method for improving skin tone/texture and boosting collagen production. And, she has been equally as vocal that money spent on prestige beauty is a complete waste of money. With all of this said, I have to admit to breaking her rules ... I am mad about Kate Somerville products and all too frequently tinker with the Philosophy line. (Philosophy'sTurbo Booster C Powdermay actually have some legitimacy when mixed into one's moisturizer in the morning since it has proven to provide even more protection against sun-damage. Good to know, right?) All of this is to say that I have been invested in my skin since I was in my late teens and have years of professional admonishment echoing in my brain ...The Verdict:When this kit arrived, the exterior package was slightly scuffed. It appears that it had a rough journey to my home. When I opened the purple box, I instantly noticed that the "clam-shell" container had moderate rubbing on the highest points. It's unfortunate that better packing was not implemented inside. A thin sheet of bubble-wrap may have prevented such damage. This is not an Amazon problem but it is a manufacturer problem. Moreover, I was genuinely alarmed to find that this "gun-metal clam-shell" is a cheap plastic material. It looks akin to one of those lip-gloss containers for little girls that one might purchase at Target or Walmart. I certainly will not be leaving this out on my vanity. And, longevity will undoubtedly be an issue (especially with the filmsy interior). Too bad.Presentation aside, the products themselves are adequate, at best and before considering the price. The exfoliating product, Rub Off, is extremely coarse (i.e. contains big chucks of "material") and there is very little of the exfoliating element in the cleanser. I found myself having to rub a bit longer (not harder though) than I would with a comparable product. The results were not as profound as I can easily achieve with Philosophy'sMicrodelivery Exfoliating Wash. I highly recommend this Philosophy product. As indicated by its name, the particles are fine and the results are amazing. Think of Philosophy as cleansing your skin with the finest sand imaginable (it is an invigorating feeling) ... and think of this product as rubbing your face with rocks (it is awkward and unpleasant).The moisturizer, Buying Time, is (again) adequate. I like the thickness of this product. However, some people will find it difficult to use with mineral makeup. And, afer a week of using it, I had no issues with sensitivity (which is good news to those with sensitivities). Still, I saw nothing (whatsoever) to justify the price. Ditto for the eye cream, Eye Never. I have seen comparable results with Olay Pro-X and Regenerist products. And, at least with the Olay products, there are a number of physicians that stand behind this line. (And, a number of studies that indicate that these Olay products do no harm).The Undercover Agent touts itself as an anti-wrinkle serum. It claims to aid in the repairing of DNA. At this point, let's be savvy consumers. The actually bottle of this is $135.00 (because you only receive a deluxe sample-size here). I wonder, if this is a "miracle" serum, why doesn't my dermatologist carry it ... or why doesn't she advise I use it? Hmm. (And, it is important to note that my dermatologist does not carry any products in her office. She has no biases). Why has she specifically said that these products are snake-oils, hokum, etc... Something to consider.Here's a practical note for potential buyers: these products are the size of the deluxe minis that one would get from Sephora. Can you really imagine paying for a cheap plastic case containing five mediocre samples? This feels like a "gift-with-purchase" item. Under no circumstances would I ever imagine $165.00 for this ... especially considering the positively mediocre results. I hesitate to seem unduly harsh, but I feel compelled to be completely frank: the price is vulgar for what you receive. And, that is the bottom-line here.
I was excited for a lotion that also acts as a sun screen. This one does not go on white, like others and feels more like a lotion, rather than sun screen. But the look and the smell of this product is not pleasant for me - there is a dye in it and some fragrance, obviously. I feel like I have been to the bath and body shop, after I put this on. I prefer more natural products.
If you have sensitive skin, this is not for you.Within about 36 hours, every part of my skin that had contact with this lotion broke out with hives.I am going crazy.I have sensitive skin, and eczema. However, of all the lotions and sun screens I have ever used, none have given me such a reaction.I can barely function right now. My entire arms and legs are covered with red, small swellings of bumps, and itching like crazy.I've tried washing with mild soap and lukewarm water, taken antihistamine, and 1% hydrocortisone cream to no avail.Don't buy this if you have sensitive skin. I'm just thankful I didn't put any more of this anywhere else - I am already losing my mind.It has been over two days of itching.I'm going in to see my doctor first thing Monday...Update on June 24, 2013: took me 2 weeks of oral steroid prescription pills to begin the healing process. After 2 months the itching had finally become not so bothersome. Thank you for those passing concerns my way.
Dangerous because transparent and one has no idea where it went on, and how thick a coat.  I got burned in spots near my suit straps because I had missed applying so many spots. This doesn't happen to me when I use the usual white stuff, so I blame the product.  It's worse than nothing because it gives the illusion of protection.  I threw it away after one day because it cannot be used safely.
I read one review where the person was so upset by the fragrance in this Cetaphil foam wash product. I honestly just thought they were overreacting, so I got this myself. Was honestly surprised how utterly terrible the "masking fragrance" (Cetaphil's description, not mine) turned out to be. It smells like SUPER STRONG FLOWERY BABY POWDER, and it really ruins the wash for me.Also, the foam gets up my nose and ends up in my hair. Foam is not the best medium for washing faces. I much prefer the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.I would never recommend this to anyone. The product seems gentle on the skin, but the fragrance is so strong it's almost unbearable to use.Save yourself the agony of using this product and get something else.
I had been excited to try this new Cetaphil Moisturizer, especially after such wonderful reviews on the Cetaphil products from family and friends.  Multiple family members had been prescribed Cetaphil products due to problem skin and had seen wonderful results.  I do not have horrible skin, but do struggle with getting rid of blackheads zits and I am in my late 20's.  I did not have the same results as my family and friends.  Three days after using this on my face, I suddenly had the worst acne I have had since maybe I was 13!  I had produced white-heads all over my forehead, chin, and around my nose and upper-lip.  To be honest it was embarrassing to even go out.  I was shocked that a product that is made for acne-prone skin (therefore should be wonderful for sensitive skin) would only worsen my skins appearance.  Sadly, I will not be continuing the use of this product...with which I had had such high hopes.
This review will be very short. My skin is extremely sensitive, but I picked this product (which, to be fair, is not advertised as a product for sensitive skin), because generally Cetaphil has been good for my skin due to its non-comedogenic, oil-free, fragrance-free formulas. This time Cetaphil, unfortunately, let me down. I had an allergic reaction to it immediately after using it for the first time - redness, itchiness, etc. It took almost a week for my skin to heal.
I have a medium amount of shoulder length fine hair. Normally I wash it every 2-3 days. It is not normally oily. I tried this spray on both washed and  unwashed damp hair. I used a very minimal amount of spray and followed the directions. My hair went instantly limp and turned horribly greasy. The smell was a little strong and icky smelling to me. This might work better on coarse hair.
First, this works by using water and wax. The first couple of ingredients are aqua and paraffin. Then this goes on to list a whole host of chemicals and very cheap preservatives. This certainly isn't priced like a cheap product, but this is most certainly formulated as a cheap product. There are five different parabens in the ingredient list: Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben.So, if you want to wax your hair, expose yourself to cancer causing parabens and pay a premium price to do it, this is your product.I am so disappointed by Toni&Guy.; But I'm sure they don't care -- they're making a bundle way overcharging for cheaply made products. Poor form.
Putting a few blue beads in a heavy, waxy cream is not a &#34;scrub.&#34; A true scrub should have a very dense quantity of grit in an emulsion of cleanser. I also think this does the opposite of clearing your pores. It's full of wax and though your skin feels soft after you use it, what you're feeling is that wax coating your skin. You'll definitely need Biore Pore Strips if you use this regularly.
I have fairly typical combination skin -- some areas are oily, some are normal, a couple have a tendency to dryness. My usual facial cleansing routine is a foaming cleanser likeAveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser, 6 Ouncein the winter and a scrubbing cleanser likeSt. Ives Blemish & Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 ozin the summer, with a light facial moisturizer likeSimple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounceyear-round, and that keeps my complexion pretty clear as long as I useBiore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips, 24 Counta couple times a month.This was my first time trying a cream-based scrub. I thought it would be gentler than my usual apricot scrub, so that I would need less moisturizer in the summer, and it does in fact moisturize my skin in a way my usual scrub doesn't. However, it completely fails as a scrub! It takes forever to rinse the cream off my face because it's so heavy and waxy, and two days after I started using it the hollows under my cheekbones broke out like they haven't in years.I guess this'll teach me to mess with a system that was already working. . .
