Over the past twenty-odd years, Enya Brennan has become known worldwide for her layered vocals and delicate instrumentation, in many ways defining New Age music. But for her to have essentially taken the crown of this genre implies a depth to her music, and this is very evident on "The Memory of Trees".Enya's first few albums were good, but there was something missing, something that had yet to be developed. I'm not entirely sure what that intangible "something" was, but she certainly found it on this one. The title track is an instrumental masterpiece featuring her trademark layered vocals (though no lyrics to speak of), and it reminds on of a clear fall day. This sets the pace for the record, which is decidedly autumnal. 'Anywhere Is' is about the maze that life's choices put us into, while 'Pax Deorum' features few lyrics (all in Latin) that reverberate almost like a dark stormy night that eventually settles into a calm drizzle. 'Once You had Gold' is as delicate as a falling leaf, and 'On My Way Home' brings back memories of weekend trips home from college, traveling through the gorgeous foliage and dizzying scents of fall.If 'Only Time' defined her "A Day without Rain" album, it's 'China Roses' that defines "The Memory of Trees". Enya has crafted a lullaby-like soothing piece of moonlight that is instantly calming. It's easily the best piece of the record and, even nearly twenty years after the album's release, it still stands firmly, refusing to sound dated in a genre that, at one point, relied a little too much on synthesizers.It's been over fifteen years since "The Memory of Trees" was released, but it's a still favorite when it comes to Enya's music. As another reviewer said, you can't go wrong with this artist, but this album is definitely one of her best.
Enya - The Memory of Trees (1995)In certain circles, such as my profession, massage therapy, Enya is ubiquitous. People tend to get really tired of hearing her all the time. E.O. - Enya Overdose - can be an unpleasant, almost sickly experience. Aside from that, I think some people are just jealous of her enormous popularity. I just learned that her "Day Without Rain" CD which came out in 2000 was the 16th highest seller of the last decade.But she's wildly popular for good reasons. One could say her music is synthesized plastic, but it's beautiful, soothing plastic . . . what's not plastic is Enya's sweet, melodic voice (at least I HOPE it's not plastic! - I sincerely doubt she uses auto-tune). Enya's been accused of being soulless - harsh! - but sometimes you'd rather hear something calming, pleasant and pretty instead of some gut-wrenching Aretha Franklin or Janis Joplin weeper, wouldn't you?The following is a song-by-song breakdown of the album to give readers an idea of which tracks they might like to sample before getting the whole album:"The Memory of Trees" - a majestic, cinematic opener. No lyrics, it serves as a wonderful prelude. *****"Anywhere Is" - I know some people like this one but I find it unbearable. To me, it's too cloying, "sing-songy" and flat-out dorky. It's just too "jaunty" for my tastes. I'm forced to program the songs on my CD player whenever I want to hear this album because I refuse to listen to this one (and of course, I program only certain songs from this album for massage). I was shocked to see it on Enya's Greatest Hits collection. *"Pax Deorum" - Quite different than anything else here, this track has an ominous, pulsing sound which makes me think of impending war in some Medieval or Lord of the Rings setting. Enya chants most of the words, sung in Gallic, in a low register. I never use it for massage but it's an interesting track if yer in the mood for it. ***1/2"Athair Ar Neamh" - Another one sung in Gallic, this soft, restrained song is one of the most beautiful on the album. *****+"From Where I Am" - is a short instrumental with only piano and some very subtle atmospheric touches. A sweet melody. *****"China Roses" - possibly Enya's best song ever. Sounds like floating through heaven. Magical! *****+"Hope Has a Place" - a gentle song about love. ****1/2"Tea-House Moon" - a pretty instrumental, vaguely Oriental. ****"Once You Had Gold" - another, soft, sweet song with a gorgeous melody. ****1/2"La Sonadora" - is a subtle, slightly somber track sung in Spanish. ****"On My Way Home" - begins with some rolling, old-school synth sounds reminiscent of her first album and soon bursts with bright energy. A fitting finale. ****
Strong debut for the Boston post-punk/new wave band, fronted by the legendary Ric Ocasek (though bassist Benjamin Orr could almost be considered a "co-frontman"). Snide charm and effortless hooks dominated this effort, with several deserved hits along the way (and at least a couple more that probably could have been smashes as well). Heavily influenced and influential, its flavor is dulled a bit by time--their fusion of punk/new wave with catchy hard rock is no longer quite as new."Just What I Needed" is, of course, the standout of the bunch, but the underrated minor hit "You're All I've Got Tonight" is nearly its equal. Meanwhile, the hit track, "My Best Friend's Girl" hasn't aged quite as well, but it's got such a goofily fun hook that it's nearly irresistible. Surprisingly, one of the weakest tracks, "I'm in Touch With Your World," is the one that works hardest to stand apart; unfortunately it falls victim to a weak melody and the clich&eacute;s of punchy psychedelia.Best cuts: "Just What I Needed," "You're All I've Got Tonight," "Good Times Roll," "Moving in Stereo," "Don't Cha Stop," "My Best Friend's Girl," "All Mixed Up"
This 1978 blend of tuneful pop and power rock has stood the test of time very well. The album contains a magical fusion of the melodicism of pop and the passionate force of rock. The first three tracks: Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed form one of those legendary song cycles, just like the sequence of Dirty-Ass Rock &amp; Roll, Darling I Need You and Rollaroll on John Cale's Slow Dazzle album. But every one of the tracks is excellent, made timeless by their killer hooks, tight harmonies and focused energy. To my mind, The Cars continued the poprock tradition of artists like Queen, Alice Kooper and Roxy Music, whilst there is also a specifically new wave feel about this album that reminds me of an obscure contemporary of theirs, one Mink DeVille, and of course those other famous poprockers Blondie. Of course, Pat Benatar and The Knack mined a similar vein, but they came later. All of the songs were written by Ric Ocasek, no mean feat considering their gripping melodic appeal and lasting popularity on the playlists. This album is one of the best examples of late 70s style rock with a punk attitude.
When this album was released, I was the perfect age to receive it. I was a hard core music fan yet bored with hard rock and prog, embarrassed at the disco movement, too naive to appreciate soul and funk, too cool to listen to top 40/bubblegum and too suburban to accept Brittish punk rock. I was hungry for new, cutting edge tunes since Led Zep, Stones, Tull, Kiss and others became soooooooooo stale.Along comes the Cars.Today, the Cars sound so tame and nostalgic but in 1978, this stuff couldn't be any more hip with the reverb soaked detached vocals, synthasized sounding drums, compressed guitars, and adventerous keyboards. I know it must sound hard to believe but "Just What I Needed" was a complete breath of fresh air. Everybody (and I mean everybody...even my guitar teacher, famous shred master Michael Angelo Batio) was intrigued by this fresh sound and they were, sorry for the pun, thought of as truly a "new wave" of musical talent. In my high school, the cool kids abandoned everything and embraced hippness of The Cars.Now, in hindsight, it is easy to see why the Cars made such a quick impact. These were hardly young kids but, rather, they were seasoned veterans, honing their craft, writing finely composed songs and applying high quality musicianship. Guitarist Elliot Easton was as good of a chicken picker on a Telecaster as anybody, Ric Ocasek was a seasoned songwriter, Keyboard player Greg Hawkes was a session player and drummer Dave Robinson came out of the Modern Lovers. These guys must have studied Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Roxy Music since you can hear the influences everywhere.Their debut has many of their best songs. "the good times roll" has all of the above quality ingredients, the aforementioned cool, detached singing, motorizing guitars and in your face keyboard theme. "My best friend's girl" changes the pace beautifully mixing new wave with twanging rockabilly. "Moving in Stereo" is a hypnotic, groove oriented song. "You're all I got tonight" test your speakers by utilizing all the right stereophonic squibs and squalls.Because these guys were so experienced musically, their sound seems to have quickly moved on and matured, which may have been (ironically) to their disadvantage, since, in the end, they sounded like everybody else. Each album lost more of the "edge" that attracted me.I think their debut and "Candy O" are their best albums since they were the most adventerous.
Pet Sounds  being The Beach Boys 11th studio album and their 1966 release and singles released on the album were "Caroline No", "Wouldn't it be nice", "Sloop John B" and "God Only Knows". Yes it is a good album, however to compare it with "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" does not work for me as I consider Beatles to be far superior. Even Rolling Stones has made better albums then this. However, do not get me wrong this is a good album, but not as good as many would have you believe. The booklet is very nice with many photographs, liner notes written by Brian Wilson and David Leaf. No lyrics are included but we get a list of whom plays what on each track. 4/5.
This album along with contemporaries "Forever Changes", "Revolver", "Sgt. Pepper's..." has always held a very special place in my heart.  These albums like true classics never get old and even listening to them so many times over so many years these albums always manage to reach me.  The sad thing about "Pet Sounds" though is that unlike the other albums mentioned above which have been mixed well and have sounded really good post remastering this album has at best an average quality level of mixing which makes it really difficult to get a very good sounding version of "Pet Sounds" despite numerous attempts at trying to get this album to achieve its sonic potential.  If only George Martin produced/mixed this album!  I've owned many versions of this and prior to this release the best sounding version I've heard was an old made in Holland stereo mix version which I have since sold and regretted as I've yet to find "Trombone Dixie" anywhere else on a single cd version of the whole album as a bonus track like that version did.I don't have an SACD player and so I may update this later once I spin it on my friend's player soon but even on a standard cd player this version while is very good with respect to previous releases given the original mix isn't the best sounding when compared with restored/remastered releases of it contemporaries mentioned above.  The cardboard gatefold packaging is very nice though and would interest collectors of mlps releases although strictly speaking this is not a true replica of the original vinyl sleeve.  Also included is a 20 page colour booklet with all the lyrics and a Mark Linett essay.Mofi did the best that they could with the material that they had to work with but this is certainly not a reference-quality audio experience.  In short, this release may just be the best version of the album that is currently out there but it is certainly not the best sounding mofi release.Still recommended!
PET SOUNDS is without a doubt a wonderful collection of beautiful harmonies and melodies. Each song is an incredibly well-crafted set piece, individual masterpieces when heard separately. The problem is when they are put together in this package, there is a sameness to the songs. Found in the heart of each song is a gentle, haunting melody without an edge. The songs move seamlessly from one to another and this actually works to their disadvantage; they just are not different enough from each other to be fully appreciated in this setting. Unlike SMILE, where Wilson is able to constantly surprise and amaze, PET SOUNDS is a pleasent and sweet series of songs, I enjoy them but they create a sense of comfort rather than amazement.
"Pet Sounds" is the Beach Boys masterpiece, some kind of reply to the contemporary folk rock music trend at the time. Beach Boys previous music had been mostly about summer, sun, beach and surf but finally Brian Wilson decided to get serious and write songs about more deep and personal issues. This album is considered among the best of all time and it did influent many others in the future. The sound of this album was very unique when it came out and it's a beauty to the ear aswell. Folkish sound with the classic Beach Boys sound singing in voices.After the Beatles "Rubber Soul" was released Wilson wanted to reply to that and that's what he did here in his own way ofcourse, the music in the mid 60's had changed alot from the early part. It's difficult to not comapre the two albums though, some people even rate this as the greatest of all albums, agead of Rubber Soul and Abbey Road, I don't. Rubber Soul was the most influentual album for rock music in the 60's but Abbey Road is my favorite album. I don't think we should compare the albums with each others actuall. Beatles is Beatles, and Beach Boys is Beach Boys. The Reason I'll only give 4 stars however is that I feel that there isn't enough variety on this album. Most songs if not all were Wilson pennned and most songs are emotional midtempo or ballads. With Beatles, there were atleast 3 diffrent writers on most albums and the music they made at this time were more contemporary rock infleunted and most songs sounded very diverse aswell and gave them many more hits then "Pet Sounds" did, which only had 2 big hits "Wouldn't it be Good" and "Sloop John B". I'm not trying to take anything away from this album though, it's a very good album on it's own right.There are many good songs here. "Wouldn't it be Good" one of a few uptempo songs here and a big hit aswell. "That's not me" and "Don't Talk" are both good balalds. "I'm waiting for the Day" is a midtempo folk rock song. "Let's Go Away for a While" is instrumental. "Sloop John B" is a midtempo song and also a major hit. "God only Knows" is a great ballad, and "Here Today" reminds me abit of "Good Vibration" based on the musical backround in the beginning and in the end it actually sound very much like "Eye of the Tiger" from Survivor. "Hang on to Your Ego" is a uptempo song aswell with great instruments.Overall, a great 60's album worth your time, with quite a few top hits that influented the contemporary music back then.
Count me in among those who simply never "got" this album.  Or, at least, never "got" it like those Mojo critics who voted it in as the greatest album of all time, or the RS panel which put it at #2.  It's good, yes, but a magically mystically transcendent and Shakespearian-worthy reflection of the human condition?  Hmmm...many of the tracks seem overly-sweetened to these ears, especially "You Still Believe In Me", "I'm Waiting For The Day", "Here Today"...the chamber orchestration applied to "God Only Knows" still works, largely because the melody is so timeless; along with "Wouldn't It Be Nice", the title track and "Caroline No" it's the best thing on the disc.  Wilson's lyrics are OK and certainly more sophisticated than anything The Beach Boys and most other pop acts were capable of in the spring of '66, but even the best here ("I Just Wasn't Made For These Times", "Caroline No") are written from an overly-sentimental perspective.  Oddly enough, though, I enjoy "Don't Talk" in spite of--or maybe even because--it's a simple romantic ballad (the repetition of the chorus at the end creeps up on me and sends shivers down the spine)."Pet Sounds" never *truly* grabbed me until I heard the stereo version prepared for the box set, and which is included here.  This version brings out the album's delicate arrangements much more, and to me is the only "true" version (I expect a lot of disagreement here, of course).  Anyways, I've listened to and pondered its worth dozens and dozens of times, hoping that eventually something would magically "click" and I'd be enlightened, which is how a lot of people have described their coming to love the album.  With me, though, it has been more of a gradual appreciation--a lyric here, an instrument there, and especially hearing the stereo version--than a sudden impulse to erect a Brian Wilson shrine in my bedroom.  I've heard the "Smile" material on boots and it is the wacky, wildly experimental stuff there which seems more like what I'd expected of "Pet Sounds".  Still, I would recommend the album to anyone who hasn't heard it, for it is still an essential work in the history of rock, albeit slightly saccarine and sentimental in places.  For heartfelt lyricism and stunning arrangements without dross like "Sloop John B", I'd recommend "Rubber Soul", Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom", Joni Mitchell's "Blue" or The Kinks' "Village Green Preservation Society" instead.
Let me get this out of the way first. I really do like this album. Always have and always will. There are a number of killer songs - the usual suspects (Wouldn't it be Nice, Caroline No, God Only Knows) and the great songs that weren't hits (That's Not Me, I Know There's an Answer, Here Today, I Just Wasn't Meant for these Times). However, as much as I like these songs, I do have to take issue with the "legendary status" of this record. For me there is too much filler (lush but relatively insipid ballads and unnecessary instrumental interludes). I never particularly cared for Sloop John B. As for the "concept" aspect of the album, well, I don't see it. A few animal noises here and there do not a concept make! Is there a story (Tommy, Superfly) or a common theme? I know that teenage angst permeates the LP. But surely, isn't this the case for a great deal of the music recorded by guys in their teenage years and early 20's? And would someone please explain the significance of the title, cover and the pet sounds?I am a subjective listener of music. When it comes to lyrics I recall and sometimes sing along without delving too much into hidden, or to be honest, surface meaning. I listen to the "sound" as a whole rather than analyzing instrumentation, recording techniques and the like. Although I do have a high end stereo system I am equally happy listening to music through decent headphones, in the car or through my new wireless Sony speakers. However, as I considered my comments on this album, in light of the myriad glowing reviews, I did listen more carefully. I have to say that my objective listening did not lead me to a heightened appreciation of the music. On the contrary, I was disappointed to discover that the more carefully I listened the more I became cognizant of flaws in the LP. For the first time I realized just how pretentious, precious and produced (not over-produced, just slickly so) it all sounded.I didn't care for the surfin' music that preceded Pet Sounds. I have played and enjoyed the subsequent Surf's Up and Holland many times. Pet Sounds? For me it is an interesting and self-indulgent experiment. Is it revolutionary? Is it one of the greatest records of all time? My answer is a pretty firm no on both counts. Although it does represent a giant step forward for the Beach Boys it's neither a Rubber Soul nor a Sergeant Pepper!
I like the Beach Boys, but I have to admit that I prefer their earlier California style hits (e.g., Fun, Fun, Fun) and I'm not a big fan of 60s music.  Nevertheless, "Pet Sounds" is undeniably a beautiful CD that still sounds great today.  "Sloop John B" and "Wouldn't It Be Nice" were top 10 hits in the US and "God Only Knows" and "Caroline, No" cracked the top 40, but all the songds sound great.  Brian Wilson's voice has never sounded more beautiful and the harmonies are near-perfect.  As a bonus, "Hang on to Your Ego" is included (it was recorded at the same time, but not released).  It's a great song and may be familiar to alt rock fans via a remake by Frank Black.  The liner notes are also terrific and include comments from Brian Wilson as well as a song by song description.  Great CD!
It seems sometimes this album (at least by the public) is overshadowed by the mega-popular and best sellingGetz/Gilberto, but that is somewhat harsh, as this album is ever bit as worthy.  In fact the two should easily be bought together, as both are essential Bossa Nova albums and the only two albums you need that belong to the genre (as far as I'm concerned).  It's a bit more accessible and more upbeat, with more subtle swinging rhythms and quicker than it's companion.  Those who bought the aforementioned mega album and were let down a bit by the downtempo will be happy that this album contains what they wanted.That's not to say this album suffers from lack of gorgeousness.  Right from the start, an essential love song, Desafindo, opens up the album, and the singing lines are replaced by gorgeous saxaphone playing.  And while Gilberto was a vital part of that record, Charlie Bird's guitar playing blows Gilberto away.  He actually plays some solos, and boy are they pretty mean!  Very intricate and melodic, and he's just as good as providing a gorgeous rhythm as he is when he adds spice and flair to the songs.  The aforementioned beats are played great with the backing band, and Stan Getz's saxaphone is in fine form, as usual.  And unlike it's companion, there are no vocals.Back to the songs.  Each of these songs will satisfy the hunger for bossa nova rhythms. (but it's not the same rhythm for the whole length, of course!), and it's as melancholy either.  The only track to be featured on later albums, Desafindo, is agruably better than the hit version, as the instrumental section is a lot different, as well as the intro.  It definitely won't replace the vocalist track, but the vocalist track will never be like this one.  The whole album is not very long, especially if you cut out the second cut of Desafino (why would you though), but the time suits it just fine.  It's over quick, but it doesn't have any filler, thank god.Bossa Nova, to the unitiated, may be hard to find, considering most "well known" bossa nova is the garbage you can find on one of those lame albums you can find at any gift shop in Palm Desert, California.  This trascends all of the elevator muzak garbage you can find at the aforementioned gift shops.  If you say you like Bossa Nova, and all you own are one of those lame noveltly albums (the kind in those gift shops that are part of those listening things with the cheap speakers that also sell native american music) or a couple of _______ albums by Thievery Corporation, I advise you pick this andGetz/Gilbertoand experience the real thing.8.0/10
this one is dope and that cover is dope too, lol!overall a good krs album, good for those times when you want that old school vibe in your headphones
The mid-80's was Billy Ocean's heyday, in particular, the period spanning the emergence of his first hit, "Caribbean Queen," the singles from his 1986 Love Zone album, and the first single from Tear Down These Walls, "Get Outta My Dreams."  This collection of hits by Billy Ocean, nee Leslie Sebastian Charles, shows how he specialized in heart-melting ballads on one extreme and high-energy synth-pop anthems on the other.Suddenly, his 1984 album, is represented by four songs.  One is the catchy US #1 "Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)", part of which borrows the syncopated rhythm from Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean."  The sound effects includes eerie laughter similar to Vincent Price in "Thriller" and some suggestive sounds, not surprising in this song about a Caribbean seductress with painted-on jeans.  The highlight is V. Jeffrey Smith's brief sax solo.  The title track is a schmaltzy ballad on how suddenly one wakes up and finds oneself in love.  "Loverboy", co-written by producer Keith Diamond and Mutt Lange, has a wandering pulsing synth beat throughout and a kind of hard-driving chorus, while "Mystery Lady" is a mid-paced dance number."When The Going Gets Tough (The Tough Get Going)" from Jewel of the Nile, topped the UK charts, and nearly did so in the US, and is a feel-good dance anthem with funky synths.  The male backups have a masculine growl on the chorus, while the female singers soften things up some of the refrains.  This hit was co-written by and executive produced by Mutt Lange.  This was also included in Love Zone, whose title track is a leisurely mid-paced ballad punctuated by lush synths and a funky bass.However, the best song from that album and my personal Ocean song ever is the tear-jerker #1 "There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)."  The strings, quiet Clive Davis-like synths, and Ocean's falsetto all combine to make this a winner.  In saying how love songs touch the very heart of someone, Ocean reprises what Elton John sang two years earlier, that "sad songs say so much."Ocean's last big hit was "Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car", another catchy dance anthem and another soundtrack song, from the Corey Feldman vehicle (no pun intended) Licence To Drive.  Some eye-rolling suggestive car-talk involves, "touch my bumper" and "let me take your wheel" but this was big enough to reach #1.  Also from Tear Down These Walls is "The Colour of Love," another attempt at a hit ballad, which doesn't have the same effect as "Suddenly" or "There'll Be Sad Songs."Of the two new songs, "Licence To Chill" fits more in the dance pop category, and is a close cousin to "Get Out Of My Dreams."  Mutt Lange's production touches are evident here, particularly in the anthemic refrain:  "Yeah Billy, yo Billy, way to go Billy."  Ditto for the funky masculine bed-hopping of "I Sleep So Much Better In Someone Else's  Bed."  I can't hardly imagine someone like Ocean singing something so sexist, but that aspect of the song is given by the Fresh Prince portraying the smooth-talking cad and Mimi the put upon woman in a typical lover's quarrel.As this compilation is released by Jive Records, his late 70's hits, such as "Love Really Hurts Without You" and "Red Light Spells Danger," released on GTO Records, aren't included-that is on the Ultimate Collection, released last year.  Still, a tighter and more cohesive package showing Ocean during his peak years.
The best thing about getting old classics, is that they are inexpensive and still worth the listen. I may be 23 but I'm very old-school and when growing up all I'd listen to is Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, etc. But who I loved most of all was listening to Billy Ocean. Takes me back to my happier years and having fun. There are a few tracks that I don't remember but they are still good, takes me back to the Miami Vice theme wearing white pants era.
Born in Fyzbad, Trinidad in 1950, Billy Ocean grew up in England,where he began his career in London dance clubs.  After a few lean years he began to make a name for himself a song writer, and when he recorded the self-authored "Carribbean Queen" in 1984 he suddenly emerged as one of the most popular tropical-inflected performers of the decade.Ocean's best known work of the 1980s is collected in this greatest hit anthology of twelve recordings, which opens with "When The Going Gets Tough," a piece recorded for the film JEWEL OF THE NILE, and then winds it way through alternating dance floor favorites and lush love songs to conclude with "Tear Down These Walls."  In both terms of performance and songwriting skills, each selection shows the artist near the top of his form.Some twenty years after the peak of his popularity, Ocean's best known pop hits are considerably less dated than one might expect--largely because he did not rely exclusively on the heavily synthesized sound so typical of most 1980s performers.  The best of his work, really, is in such ballads as "There'll Be Sad Songs," "Suddenly," and "Love Zone," but several of his higher energy dancefloor cuts also survive extremely well, most notably the sharply cadenced "Loverboy."  It's a nice package, all of it easy on the ears, all of it playing out with good sound quality.If Ocean's music has survived reasonably well, Ocean himself has not.  Ocean was a very consistent performer and writer--perhaps a shade too consistent for his own good, for after several years there was a general sense that his music was repetitive in both style and content.  When combined with changing tastes and a few brushes with the law, it was enough to precipitate a sudden slide from the glory days of fame to an almost complete obscurity; although he continues to write, record, and perform in Europe, he is now largely forgotten by the huge international audience he once commanded.  Generally recommended, but primarily to those recall him from his 1980s heyday.GFT, Amazon Reviewer
From the middle 1970s through the next decade, Billy Ocean was a regular vistor to the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with his special brand of soulful pop. The melodic appeal of songs like Get Outta My Dreams, Caribbean Queen and Loverboy is still there and tracks like When The Going Gets Tough, Colour Of Love and There'll Be Sad Songs sound even better these days when the charts are filled with bland pop and boring rap. There's just one unforgivable omission here, the great song Red Light Spells Danger that was a huge hit for Ocean in the mid seventies. No collection could be considered complete without that masterpiece.
This is a collection of Billy Ocean's biggest hits from the peak of his career.  He had an impressive string of hits, and covers a good deal of ground, from fast rockers, to slow ballads to mid-tempo love songs.  The songs at the end of the collection start to lose steam, and represent the end of Billy Ocean's super stardom, but for the first 3/4 of the collection it's a wonderful blast from the past.
Boogie Down Productions take aim at the media and the mind state that hinders Black Americans on the controversial LP Sex And Violence.  Krs-One practices edutainment as he makes attempts at both educating and entertaining with the same breath.  This album starts off with "The Original Way" featuring Freddie Foxxx as a performance opener with a simple break beat and a bass.  Krs takes aim at sucker emcees with "Duck Down" with a more up-tempo track.  "Ruff Ruff" featuring Freddie Foxxx is 70 feel track with the guitar lick loop.  The story tale of "13 And Good" with an underlying funk track helps this to be one of the album's standout.  Teaching the truth about all aspects of life including religion, "Poisonous Products" has an alternative to what has been taught.  "Say Gal" is a reggae melody as Krs attacks the quote rape victims of stars and celebrities with questions like "...why you go to the hotel..?"  He also takes a swing at the medians such as radio and television on the title track as he flows a hip-hop / reggae style.  It is difficult to mix both education and entertainment, but Boogie Down Productions' attempt was a good one worth lending an ear to.
This album has always been under appreciated but he goes quite hardcore on this album.He also has some beats by Prince Paul.some pretty dope beats and of course his knowledge still reigns supreme on this album.Freddie Foxxx is even on this album.I would recommend this album,battle rhymes and some fun raps and some hard raps on here.Lyrics 10/10 Production 9/10 X Factor 9/10 Classic 8/10 Replay 9Total-8.5 out of 10 Fingers
Leave it to KRS-One to teach what hip hop is supposed to sound like. After dropping the Boogie Down Productions name, Kris comes correct on his 1993 album, Return Of The Boom Bap. The production on here is pretty much on point, courtesy of DJ Premier, Kid Capri, Norty Cotto, and Showbiz. All those dope producers, expect that signature east coast sound to represent.A good number of tracks here are excellent. Tracks such as "Outta Here", "Slap Them Up", and "Sound Of The Police" (if you can, get the 12" that has the B-side "Hip Hop Vs. Rap") are easy standout. "Mad Crew" is an easy headbanger, along with "P Is Still Free". Another favorite of mine is "Brow Skin Woman".Kris missteps here on early points on this album like the boring sounding "Mortal Thought" and the odd concept of himself being a blunt being passed around to various rappers on "I Can't Wake Up". A few others float around, but that doesn't stop that from being a good album. Given that this is one that defiantly needs to be in your music collection, as this one would be in rotation for sometime.

Krs-One returned with a vengeance in 93, and dropped a CLASSIC in the form of Return Of The Boom Bap. This album, like every other Krs-One album, represents him in his truest form, always talking about something positive, claiming to be &quot;the teacher&quot; of hip hop, and saying things to leave you thinking. Here's the review:Album Highlights: Krs-One Attacks, Outta Here, Black Cop, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound Of Da Police, Mad Crew, and Return Of The Boom Bap.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: While NOT as strong as Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary, this is still Krs at his best. Today, he still remains one of the most influential MCs out there keeping his legacy alive. Overall, I recommend you pick up this album.
R. Kelly has always been a great producer and songwriter and at least a plausible if not extraordinary singer. Though numerous legal woes have hampered his success over the past several years, he nonetheless got off to a really great start with his first album, which has a plethora of sexual undertones but still manages to sound more stylish than trashy. Contains the #1 hit "Bump 'N Grind" and the urban radio favorites "Your Body's Callin'" and "It Seems Like You're Ready". There is also a brilliant remix of "Bump 'N Grind" on the single for that song, entitled the "Definition Of A Hotti Remix". This was played a lot on my local radio station, and for those of you who haven't heard it, I strongly recommend. It is more blissful and sensual than the original in my opinion.
there's a couple of tracks that i skip over, but for the most part this was a great debut. another classic to anyone's cd collection.
All right.  I may be the only person in America who hasn't seen the tape and therefore I still declare the man innocent until proven guilty.  As to the songs pertaining to one adult to another then this is a good CD.  If the songs are pertaining to one adult to a child then this is a sick CD.
Born Into The 90s by Public Announcement introduced R Kelly to the world. R Kelly later felt he needed to branch out and do his own solo thing. Smart move because he has been on the rise afterwards. Say what you will about R Kelly but he contributed immensely to R&B; and we have to give credit where it is due. A lot of these groups now are inspired by him(as much as some of them wont admit it).Your Body's Callin and Bump 'N Grind(yeah I said it, the hell with corny a** VH1 and Blender ragazine), Its Seems Like Your Ready, For You, Sex Me(parts 1&2) and the title track are what R Kelly excels at: the slow jams. He does fairly well on fast grooves like Summer Bunnies and Homie Lover Friend. Sadie is the best farewell song to a mother that I've ever heard(his mother had passed on). As much as I like this album I cant give it five stars. I Like The Crotch On You is laughably cheesy. Freak Dat Body has a slammin beat and nothing else and Back To The Hood Of Things should have never been attempted as R Kelly busts cornball verses like /"For real yo, you making me nervous/ and Im about to knock you in your teefes/(!!????!!!!).Regardless of these missteps 12 Play is still a great album by a guy who didnt start making questionable releases until the 2000. R Kelly is one of the artists that defined 90s R&B; so you would do well to have this album.Standouts: YOUR BODY'S CALLIN, BUMP 'N GRIND, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE READY, SUMMER BUNNIES, FOR YOU, SADIE, SEX ME(part 1&2) AND 12 PLAY.
Musical prejudice comes in many different forms. In my own case it came in the form of seeing albums such as this and simply assuming it was just one of the many "new jill" female artists that seemed to be saturating the musical world in the early/mid 1990's. Maybe to a certain degree that was true for Aaliyah in the beginning. On the other hand she was much more than that from the get go. For starters she courted controversy as being the teenage wife to the by this time very adult R.Kelly. So the obvious was on the minds of a lot of people: that her record contract came along with the engagement ring. Only R himself would know the truth about that today. At the same time,he certainly had an eye for a talent in growth and nearly ready to bloom.This album was very much a musical byproduct of R.Kelly's12-Playera. He was still musically running a bit with the crowd and hadn't established his own voice. So it's no surprise that some of these songs such as "Back And Forth","Down With The Clique","Young Nation" and "Old School" are very much artifacts of the new jack/hip-hop soul era,especially in rhythmic terms. On the rhythmically layored slower jam of the title song,representing how the "new jack ballad" genre stuck pretty close to a mid/late 80's sound and "At Your Best",a more live sounding ballad you hear a beauty and charm in Aaliyah's verstile pipes that would very much come to define who she'd be in the future. Kelly had the good sense to present her singing acapella on some of the interludes to showcase her talents.So is this an ideal debut for Aaliyah? No. The album title may have emphasized that age ain't nothing but a number. But her age was in fact at the very key of this album. While she does have a percocious manner about her,Aaliyah is still at this point coming at her songs from the point of view of a high school age person looking to be grown up. In her case on more of an urban street level. Her attitude is not particularly angsty though and that's very appealing. She tends to be enthusiastic and explorative. On a darker note she also came off as endlessly resiliant,with a perception life would be longer than it would be. And in her case,it was inhumanly short I'll tell you. But the small amount of music she released in her short time in life,starting with this told a story of creative growth and earnestness.
Well, I liked this CD a lot. someone that I didn't know purchased it for me off of my wishlist (you can buy me something for me, too if you like!). And when I got it, I listened to it all the way through. I've been an Aaliyah fan since &quot;Back and Forth,&quot; and I'd heard some songs on this album, but not the whole thing, so this was really a treat for me. I liked the CD, and the beats, it really DID have &quot;a 90s swing.&quot; the only thing I didn't like was R. Kelly all over it. I've always disliked R. Kelly, and I think that the best ONLY thing he ever did was Aaliyah. The album, though, and the content was really immature, which wasn't rare for albums that came out in the 1994 period, but I still liked it. It was pretty good. But my favorite is still &quot;Back and Forth.&quot; :D
I'm a 31 year old white guy that normally listens to metal and grunge, but I love this album. I had a roommate in the Airforce back in 1994 who played this alot, and I just came to really like it. It's a good mix of songs, some smooth R&amp;B stuff, and some more upbeat hip-hop type songs. &quot;Back And Forth&quot; was the big song off this, but &quot;Age Ain't Nothing But A Number&quot;, &quot;I'm So Into You&quot;, and &quot;At Your Best (you are love)&quot; are all great as well. My favorite though is &quot;Young Nation&quot;. It's just super sweet. I don't know her other albums at all, and I don't know the genre well, but I do know this disc will make you &quot;Throw Your Hands Up&quot;.
With production by R.Kelly, you had the making of a great album and Aaliyah delivered in many ways; tunes were right and her voice still had not developed the full capability (being only a 13 y.o.) but well done.
Long before Britney Spears asked to be hit one more time, Christina Aguilera was a genie trapped in a bottle, and Rihanna offered her umbrella (ella, ella), there was Brandy, Monica, and Aaliyah. Brandy was the cute girl with braids begging to be dubbed "down" by a crush and Monica was the "too big for her britches" Miss Thang apologizing to her man for trippin' cuz "it's just one of dem days!" Aaliyah was cool and mysterious with dark shades and baggy clothes. The Detroit native was discovered by Mr. Bump'N'Grind himself, R. Kelly. The results are pretty good to meh and a bit creepy, but it was only the beginning.Back and Forth was the song that put Aaliyah on the map with it's summery vibe that made you wanna "throw your hands in the air and wave 'em round like ya just don't care". The sloppy remix tacked at the end is pointless. The title track is one of the best slow jams out there, but it's creepy when you take a look at the lyrics. "Age ain't nothing but a number/Throwin' down ain't nothing but a thing/This lovin' I have for you/It'll never change". Anybody remember when Aaliyah and R. Kelly got married when she was 15 and he was 27? Yeah. The short intro of her writing in her diary doesn't help either.Aaliyah's cover of At Your Best (You Are Love) is the softest song on the set and showcases the ethereal beauty of her voice. She didn't have the widest range, but the angelic pureness of her vocals were her strength. The Gangsta Child remix would've been a better choice for the last track over the Back and Forth mix. Other highlights are the ballad Street Thing, I'm So Into You, No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do (although R. Kelly's "Liyah, you're the only one for me!" is all kinds of wrong), I'm Down, and the jazzy cool Young Nation.Down With the Clique is ok, but nearly ruined by R. Kelly's silly mumbling about it being the 90s. I don't know what he was babbling about. Speaking of which, Old School turns into a song all about him and how he broke into the business. Last time I checked this was Aaliyah's cd. Yeah, he's hovering in the background like a weirdo stalker on the cover, but still. I also could've done without the annoying raps from Tia Hawkins (whoever that is).This album has some pretty good tracks, but Aaliyah would come into her own on her next project, the Missy Elliott and Timbaland assisted One In A Million. The less creepiness from R. Kelly, the better.
Aaliyah's debut CD yielded two Top 10 singles - "Back and Forth" and "At Your Best (You Are Love)" (the later or which was written and originally recorded by the Isley Brothers).  However, the CD is filled with great songs, including a great balance of hip-hip songs (Throw Your Hands Up, Down with the Clique) and ballads (Age Ain't Nothing But a Number).  Almost any of the songs on the CD could have been a hit single.  That said, Aaliyah's voice was not as mature as it would be later, and some of the lyrics are a bit juvenile (if you're not down with my clique/ then you're poop on a stick).The entire CD was produced by R. Kelly (he appears in the shadows on the CD back cover and is name-checked in several songs).  With one producer, the CD sounds very cohesive, but it also is not as varied as her later CDs.  It was rumored that she and R. Kelly were married at the time, even though she was only 15 years old. Her marriage seems to be addressed in the song, "Age Ain't Nothing But a Number," which argues that she is wiser than her years would seem.At times, the album sounds a bit dated (the CD "One In a Million" is much better).  One of the lyrics states, "Aalyiah's got a 90's swing," which is pretty accurate - the CD sounds very much like an early 90's hip-hp CD.  Despite this complaint, I still greatly enjoy this CD.  It sounds great and is a lasting tribute to Aaliyah's talent.  We will miss out on hearing future recordings from this superstar, but will continue to enjoy the music she left behind.
With the anniversary of her death approaching, now seems like an appropriate time to look back on this promising debut. While it has a fair amount of filler and the hit tunes are good but not great, "Age Ain't...." showed great promise and still entertains on many levels. For every half-baked song sketch with bad rapping ("Throw Ya' Hands Up", "Old School") there's a moment of sheer inspiration and joy ("Back & Forth") and a title track that still bumps after 8 years. She was taken from us far too soon, but listening to this first effort reminds us of why we fell in love with her in the first place.
The Vallejo CA sound was started in my memory by The Click. They combine tales of slangin' rock with beats that sound like "Cutie Pie" or "Computer Love". It is straight West Coast but even Eastern rebels can groove to cuts like Bumble, Hillside, and Its All Bad. This is something different, because 40 has a way with the English language that has never been done before this. Hiphop is lacking innovators and E-40 is the definition of the word, Love him or Hate on him.
1995 was The Bay Area's biggest year. Artists such as The Luniz, Mac Mall, and the Hieroglyphics were having big hits that year. Too Short just dropped a near classic album. And The Click was on point, reppin' northern Cali area. 40 Water comes out with his third solo album In A Major Way back in'95. The album has that northern west coast vibe that is guaranteed to get listeners moving. A few standouts include "Ridin' Sidewayz" with B-Legit, and Mac Shon. "Spittin'" has a dope bass line too that will hype you up. "Sprinkle Me" is the album's first single that features 40's younger sister Suga-T (she also sings the hook for "Fed"). Bay Area artists Spice 1, Mac Mall, and Tupac drop in for the dope "Dusted 'N' Disgusted". "Smoke 'N' Drank" is my favorite from the album that will keep you bouncing (that pre-hyphy style song). 40's younger son comes in and drops a few bars on "All Bad" to help close out the album.E-40 dropped an excellent album for '95. In A Major Way is mostly consistent all though out, as it helped represented the west coast. This album vibes like most albums out there and it is highly recommended if you're a fan of their music. 4 stars- Highly recommended. Peace.Lyrics: B+Production: A-Guest Appearances: B+Musical Vibes: A-Top 5 Tracks:1. Smoke 'N' Drank2. Spittin'3. Ridin' Sidewayz (featuring B-Legit and Mac Shon)4. Sprinkle Me (featuring Suga-T)5.

E-40, Forty Water, whatever you want to call him is a bit of an aquired taste, even though I heard his music years ago, it took me until this year to finally check out 1 of his albums.  I first heard him on Aint Hard To Find off 2Pac's All Eyez On Me, and I was thinking who the f*ck is this guy?  His goofy voice and rapid fire flow took me quite a while to get used to, but after bumping Dusted & Disgusted for a long time I decided to pick up In A Major Way.I had to order this from Amazon as there are literally no copies of this album in England, you just can't get hold of stuff like this, and I was surprised by how great it was.  E-40 has long been known as an innovator (something hiphop is sorely lacking), both in terms of his unique flow, and his vast slang vocabulary which so many others have bitten over the years.  This album according to most people is when he was at his peak in both, though I can't comment as this is the only album of his I own (I do intend to buy more though).  My favourite track is still Dusted & Disgusted ft Spice 1, 2Pac & Mac Mall, which is a westcoast classic, but other classics include 1 Luv and the amazing Smoke N Drank.  Pretty much every other track is tight, the only reason i don't quite give it 5 stars is because of a couple of filler tracks (Dey Aint No & Bootsee, which is terrible).  Production is top notch throughout, some classic westcoast beats that really bump.Recommended to any hiphop fans, especially westcoast, if you can get past his wierd voice & flow you will see that some of his lyrics are actually pretty clever.  He raps about the same things most westcoast rappers do, but he does it creatively, if you can't follow him just get a lyrics sheet and listen up, very good album 4.5 stars, another case for half stars at Amazon.
After establishing himself as a strong solo presense on12 Playthis album really does distance R.Kelly from any semblance of New Jack swing that remained on his earlier recordings. Much as with Mary J'sMy Lifethis album is part of a series of recordings that swing the genre of hip-hop/R&B; into more of a fluid groove that showcases a mixture of modern touches as live instruments. As with the "sermon" on the intro this is an album where R.Kelly really began to involve himself in the age old soul music tradition of blending the spiritual with the secular-consistantly pulling a very Al Green style lyric tag throughout this album at the drop of a hat by pleading to jesus and pleading for romance all at the same time. During this era this comes as something of a surprise as often enough the two concepts seemed to play out more seperately than together. Overall,from song to song there's a strong similarity to most of the cuts on this album. Except for some very shallow lyrics on "You Remind Me Of Something" this album largely focuses it's attention on on midtempo songs with light hip-hop beats. It worked dynamite in the day and usually,aside from occasions where it worked better as a single the songs on this album all kind of flow together as one statement. Some songs such as the intricately textured "Religious Love" feature an interesting mix of percussion and modern beats wheras "Trade In My Life" really bought the pretty full on gospel out of the box completely. Of course,to me the strongest cuts on the album are the full blown disco-funk arrangements of "(You To Be) Be Happy) with Notorious B.I.G and that excellent "Thank God It's Friday"-both of which showcase the type of sound that R would begin to explore to a far broader degree (and with a huge creative leap ahead in his musical career) in the albums to come. R Kelly is still not at the apex of his career with this album. There's still a bit of (mildly) dated hip-hop productions here and there but when this album cooks it char broils and is an excellent,if quickly executed beginning to the second phase of R.Kelly's musical career.

It's rare that an artist releases a record with no title. As if to say, &quot;Here I am, baby, this record is so good it doesn't even NEED a title.&quot; Now, in R. Kelly's case, I would say that's a little overestimation, but this is still a very good record.My main issue with R. Kelly is that he can't decide what he wants to be: his songs exude vibes of a sex maniac, a star-crossed lover, even a seriously religious devotee. And it's that multiple-persona problem that makes his albums sound like a compilation more than an actual work. But be that as it may, the collection of songs on this album is more than ample.Kicking off with a Baptist-style sermon, we segue right into the complete opposite end of the spectrum with &quot;Hump Bounce,&quot; the world's Fifteen-Millionth song to sample &quot;The Big Payback.&quot; However, R. rides the track to R&amp;B/hip-hop perfection. &quot;R. Kelly&quot; is laced throughout with a distinctively more urban/hip-hop feel than his debut, &quot;12 Play,&quot; and it works to his advantage much more so than on slightly clunky numbers like &quot;12&quot;'s &quot;Back to the Hood of Things.&quot; The best example of this from the new record is &quot;You to Be (Be Happy),&quot; where R. pairs with the late Notorious B.I.G. who kicks a memorable verse indeed over a bouncy bass-laden track.There are, of course, the syrupy-sweet ballads like &quot;Step In My Room&quot; and &quot;Love is On the Way,&quot; as well as the more R-rated songs like &quot;You Remind Me of Something,&quot; where R. croons &quot;You remind me of my Jeep/I wanna ride it/Something like my bank account/I wanna spend it.&quot; Words fail me.All in all, this album works very well, and is a good addition to your R&amp;B collection.
After releasing his best album of his career 12 Play..  R.Kelly drop  another  incredible effort in 95.. This CD was kind of a departure from  the sexual overtones of 12 Play.. The material here concentrated more on  love and romance and spirtually.. However there are a couple of tracks here  that finds Mr. Kelly going back to the formula that work for him on 12 Play  on such tracks as  You Remind Me Of Something and  Tempo Slow these two  songs could have easily been on  12 Play.. The best moments on this CD  is  when  it concentrates  on love that evident on such tracks  Religious Love,  If I , Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby these songs Mr. Kelly sings with such  heart  and conviction..  Other note worthy selections  Be Happy( You To Be),  Step  In To My Room, Thank God It's Friday,  a great effort from one the best in  r&amp;b today..  If you missed out on this the first time.. Do yourself a  favor  pick it  up..  You dont know what you're missing
U.G.K.'s 1996 album "Ridin' Dirty" is a great showcase of Texas hip hop that would prove very influential. Rappers Pimp C and Bun B were already two albums deep when they dropped this one, and in my opinion it's the best album they've ever released. "Ridin' Dirty" is an album that's centered around simple yet very appealing production. The laidback grooves are bass-heavy and funky, but without the synths, horns, and extra instrumentation you might see on a g-funk album of this era. They're rolling beats meant for top-down cruising and chilling, and nine of the album's thirteen tracks are five minutes or longer. Most songs are pretty hooky, and the choruses are either rapped or delivered by a female singer, this can add or take away from the given song on "Ridin' Dirty." Former Rap-A-Lot in-house producer N.O. Joe is very involved here, and he's one of the South's finest producers ever. I don't think anyone would ever call Pimp C and Bun B lyrical geniuses, but for the most part what they lack in pure lyricism they make up for in style and character. Their tales of crime, violence, and women or their talk of cars and materialism are not out of the ordinary for a gangsta rap record at all. However, they both have very distinctive deliveries and unique drawls and accents that could not be mistaken for anyone but Texas natives. They have good flows and chemistry, working very well together. "Ridin' Dirty" has a few truly classic cuts, and the rest of the songs are pretty good, there's only a very few that I don't really like, so it's actually a pretty consistent work. I don't believe it's a classic on the level of some of Scarface or Geto Boys' work, but it's one of the finest albums to come from the hot Houston scene of the mid-90s. I highly recommend "Ridin' Dirty" to fans of southern or even west coast rap, it's a great album for the car and the summertime and it's very entertaining.After the intro comes one of my two favorite songs on the album, "One Day." Using a classic Isley Brothers sample and the album's greatest rolling, bass-heavy beat, Pimp C and Bun B deliver some of their best rhymes in a laidback manner. The depressing subject matter and perfect production make this song a true southern classic. "Murder" is tough and upbeat but still has the heavy riding quality of the slower songs on this album. "Pinky Ring" is fast and funky, it's not my favorite because the flossy lyrics don't really go anywhere and I don't like the hook. "Diamonds and Wood" is a showcase of the excellent slow and funky production at its best, it's great to just let it roll for over five minutes. "3 in the Mornin'" comes next, a solid track but not one of the best, the production is simple and the hook isn't great. The 3-2 collaboration "Touched" is very good, it's got some mid-tempo, catchy funk to make your head nod, and this is the song with the infamous "Now once upon a time not too long ago, a n...a like myself had to strong-arm a h.." verse. "F... My Car" is about deceptive women, some basic gangsta rap. The N.O. Joe aided "That's Why I Carry" is nice, and I also like "Hi-Life," a profile of the crime-ridden life of a successful hustler. The nice but not too memorable "Good Stuff" comes before the absolutely classic title track. I totally love this song, it's one of the most laidback, chilled-out rap songs ever. The production is just awesome, and the lyrics and hook do it perfect justice. The outro is almost ten minutes long and not worth listening to more than once even though it has a nice beat, because it's just spoken shout-outs.In my opinion, "Ridin' Dirty" is the best album U.G.K. ever put together, and it's a really fun listen. It's not perfect by any means, but it's certainly worth owning for any hip hop fan. The deep grooves, rough styles, and southern drawls will have most listeners coming back for more I'm sure. If you like this album, I might also recommend U.G.K.'s first two albumsToo Hard to SwallowandSuper Tight..., as well as Scarface'sThe Diaryand E.S.G.'sSailin' da South.
Positives: A really laid back album that'll keep you in a relaxed mood. Both members of Underground Kings have really distinct voices and tight Southern accents. An all around nice album to bump when you just want to sit back and chill.Negatives: Nothing here for those who want inventive or &quot;meaningful&quot; topics in their rap. This isn't exactly Dead Prez or Common. These guys don't have the lyrical skills of someone like Pac, Eminem, or Canibus.
I got Backstreet's debut album a couple years after it came out, but I still thought it was pretty good.  &quot;Quit Playing Games&quot;, &quot;As Long&quot;, &quot;All I Have&quot;, &quot;Everybody&quot;, and &quot;Never Break&quot; are all enough to make you want to buy this album.  Although BSB is adored by millions of pre-teen girls, you shouldn't totally dismiss this album.  However, this is their first album and they have gotten much better over the years.  I never understood how this music is considered &quot;pop&quot; when all it is R&amp;B.  But that's all a part of a critic's job- to neatly place everyone in a particular musical category.
THE WHOLE POP CULTURE WAS REALLY KINDA DEAD FOR A WHILE,THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A BUNCH JUMP ON THE SCENE SELLIN RECORDS TO THE MASSES BYE THE MILLIONS.THEY SEEM TO BE STILL COMING BUT IM TELLIN YA NOW 2-3 YEARS DOWN  THE ROAD ONLY A COUPLE WILL STILL BE HERE HERE AT LEAST SELLIN RECORDS  ANYWAYS.HOWEVER I DO THINK THE BACKSTREET BOYS WILL BE ONE OF THE FEW STILL  STANDING.IM NOT SURE ABOUT 5 YEARS THOUGH AT THAT POINT POP CULTURE WILL  SLOW BACK DOWN AGAIN ,THEN REPEAT ALL OVER.NOT BECAUSE OF TALENT BUT  BECAUSE OF POP MUSIC BEING SO TRENDY.IF U LOOK BACK TO SOME OF THE PAST POP  STARS OR EVEN R&amp;B STARS U WILL SEE THERE REIGN ON TOP IS SHORT WITH  ALWAYS A FEW EXCEPTIONS.IF U LOVE THIS MUSIC DONT WORRY IF THE GROUP OR  ARTIST YOU LIKE FALLS OFF OR STOPS SELLIN CUZ THIS MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY  WILL FIND SOMEONE TO REPLACE THEM,AND IT WONT BE A LONG WAIT I  PROMISE....THATS JUST HOW IT WORKS. HOWEVER I DO FEEL THAT THIS RECORD IS  ALOT TIGHTER THAN A LOT OF OTHER POP RECORDS THAT HAVE COME OUT IN THE LAST  COUPLE YEARS.QUIT PLAYIN GAMES WITH MY HEART,AS LONG AS YOU LOVE  ME,EVERYBODY AND SET ADRIFT OF MEMORY BLISS R ALL GOOD SONGS.  THIS IS A  GREAT ALBUM FOR ANY COLLECTION THAT IS FILLED BY R&amp;B AND POP...
So I admit that I was a huge Backstreet Boys fan when they came out...but then again so wasn't anyone my age.  To say now that they suck would be unfair to the genra of music that they profess.  They are bubblegum pop, and in that effect they deliver decent bubblegum pop.  THis is not their best album, for it was their debut and their sophmore album was much more polished but the hits turned out by this album were plenty and this album did solidify them quite the fanbase thanks to whiny "girl come back to me" type lyrics and Nick Carters just plain whiny voice.  Not sure what the hype is there for him but oh well...The Backstreet Boys had it all...they had the young cute one ala Nick Carter, they had the talented one ala Brian, they had the drug addict ala A.J., they had the funny looking one ala Howie and they had the creepy older guy ala Kevin.  And they could carry a note for the most part.  Thus the Backstreet Boys were born and teenage girls everywhere went crazy.  I admitt that I liked this CD even though my friends thought I was nuts, all but a few, but how can you resist songs like "Quit playing games with my heart" or "As long as you love me?"..."Everybody" was huge and so was "All I have to give" and the balance of the CD wasn't to bad either.  No, it's not in my CD player right now, and no it won't visit anytime soon, but for what it was, for the time it came out and for the fan base they were after, Backstreet Boys came, saw and conquered.
Backstreet Boys broke big in Europe and Asia before they finally broke the US market. Their debut album was released internationally in 1996, but it would take another year before it was released in the US. Nevertheless, it is amazing to me that it's been 15 years since this was released."Backstreet Boys" (12 tracks; 52 min.) starts with an incredible infectious "We've Got It Going On", what an opening track! It is followed by the pleasant mid-tempo "Quit Playing Games With My Heart" and the ballad "As Long As You Love Me". But then things get even better with the rebel-rousing "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)", the best track on here, and the best BSB track ever, period. Not that BSB was away as this was their first album, but hey, who's minding. Great tracks follow one after another, such as the pensive "All I Have to Give", and the dance-alongs "Hey Mr. DJ (Keep Playin' This Song)" and "Get Down (You're The One For Me)", but truth be told, there are no weak tracks on here and sounds like a greatest hits album.15 years on, this album stands the test of time, and it is amazing to me how fresh it still sounds (compared to say, the Spice Girls a few years later, who now sound very dated). This is the best BSB album period. I saw the BSB in concert once in 1999, at the peak of the BSB/*NSYNC boy band craze (I went on a date, to be honest), and what a great show it was. Meanwhile, this album was and is a MAJOR musical guilty pleasure.
I still think that Backstreet Boys' US debut is still a solid pop debut.  The Max Martin-dominated songs like Quit Playing Games, As Long as you Love Me and others are still superb pop songs.  There are some funky numbers like Hey Mr. DJ and We've Got It Going On.  I still love the breezy ballad Darlinwith its lush landscapes and bridges.  It was smart that they added Everybody to the album in early '98--made the album have more energy to it!  This helped start the boy band trend of nearly identical male groups, even a rival group which I won't say here.  The singing's very good, as AJ McLean and Nick Carter's twin leads along with Brian Littrell's inclusions make the songs entertaining.  Kevin Richardson and Howie Dorough provide good background singing.  I still love Good Girl/Bad Boy and its rocking closing to the album!  It has that AC/DC type feel to it with its naughtiness.  This is a landmark album of many proportions!
this album is decent, by no means his best work, but it still has a fair amount of songs that can easily be concidered classic material, I dont think that it is as concistent as his previous release like all eyez on me and me against the world but is stilla great listen with few weak tracks. The best songs are as followshell razordo for lovei wonder if heaven got a ghettolie to kick it
This double disc released after his death contains material from 92-95 (before his death row days).  It has some good songs and no real weak ones on here.  Features some of his old homies (Big Syke, Spice 1, Outlawz) but it's mostly just 2Pac.  Has a few classic joints and is a definite for all fans.  It's good Afeni & Suge didn't mess w/ the beats and guests like they did on all the rest of his post-humous material.

This album is good, but not Pac's best. This album is probably worth getting. It's the kind of album that some people like and some people don't.
Came out in 1997, the records were recorded during the years around "Strictly" time. I didn't get this until last year because I couldn't find it anywhere and it took me a while to grow up on it and after all these months, I finally did. Since it came out in 1997, it leaves me asking the question why its releases were never featured on 2pac's Greatest Hits album. After all, the releases he released were all great tracks and deserved to be on his Greatest Hits album. Many people didn't like this track because it sounded different from all of 2pac's other work but to me, it sounded like the work 2pac would usually do, just in his younger days. This CD provides many great unreleased tracks that are groovy to listen and dance to and has the most party tracks I've seen 2pac release on an album. Some of my classics on this are- Hellrazor, I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto, Nothing to Lose (the best song on the CD), Lie to Kick It, Hold On Be Strong, Fake Ass Bithes, Do for Love, Nothin but Love, When I Get Free II and Only Fear of Death. I would recommend this to true 2pac fans as it will take a while to grow on it since its the present, not the past (many people don't really like listening to old music now but I find I enjoy it) but it is definately worth a listen. Peace to Rap's finest rapper, R.I.P.
Though, this album was rushed out after the sucess of the Makeveli album, it still contains some gems on it.  Unfortunately, the production (lack there of) is average at best.Disc one starts off nice with "Open Fire" "R U Still Down" and "Hellrazor" (which is a headnodder and lyrically tight), I like both versions of I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto but prefer Disc 2's version slightly better w/Brownstone singing backround.  "Nothing To Lose" is definitely the best track on Disc One.  That track along w/Hellrazor is typical 2PAC at his best.  The next three tracks on Disc One however, needed better production period.  I loved the fact that they added "Definition of A Thug Nigga" (which was previously only available only on the "Poetic Justice" soundtrack which is one of PAC's hardest joints.Disc 2 "Do For Love" and the hip hop version of "I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto" were the chosen singles to be released for radio the obvious bangin track is the reggae flavored "When I Get Free pt 1" which is the slamminest track on there.  Takes me back to A Soldier Story Pt. 1 days.  Too bad it isn't actually PAC's voice on there rappin but the track is hot nonetheless.  "16 On Death Row" is typical politcal PAC w/a hidden message of course, "When I Get Free Pt 2 was okay but compared to the first version on the same side, it's no comparison.  and "Only Fear of Death ends the Disc 2 nicely.  The song almost gives you an insight into PAC's state of mind before his death.This album had the potential to do much better with better production but PAC's songs like always, seems to supercede even weak production.
i do agree with a earlier reveiw that the first disk is verry good.if they took do for love,ready 4 whatever,and the second version of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto,along with loosing my mind,when i get free and the interludes and cramed the in the first cd this would actually be a tight cd.but it still deserves 4 stars even though its not a single disc.
A very pleasant album, immaculately produced, perhaps a masterpiece of British folk. The songs are nice and pleasing, very pleasant to listen to: relaxing. Drake's delicate acoustic guitar work is fine and suits the songs perfectly, augmented by fine string and wind arrangements (though they can be slightly overbearing at times), and bright splashes of piano. Drake's own lyrics are beautiful examples of understated emotional poetry. His vocals are distinctive, very English, and a good medium for communicating this poetry, especially with this musical backing. It's a nice package. Certainly a hallmark recording for anyone interested in British folk.
Nick Drake-Five Leaves Left ****Of all three of Nick Drake's albums only one of those ever struck me as fantastic, made me absolutely fall in love with it, and only one of those three ever felt like it truly lived up to the hype. That album is Pink Moon. That damn thing haunts me and I think about it at random times and feel an urge to listen to it immediately. A Love Supreme is the only other album that does that to me.Five Leaves Left however would come next. For me it doesn't live up to the hype and I don't particularly love it. There isn't a single bad or weak track here, they are all great in fact. Drakes lyrics are easily the most personal and best written here as against the other two albums. His guitar playing is a virtuosic as always, but something about this album just doesn't feel right. Maybe because Pink Moon was my introduction into Drake's music it will always be the standard for me to which I compare the rest of his work. It may sound quite jaded but it isn't anything I can help.Only three songs on Five Leaves Left really hit me as classics and as brilliant. 'River Man' being the first. The somber tone in Drakes voice accompanied by the slightly out of place string arrangement is the sort of thing John Lennon and Paul McCartney tried to do with 'A Day In The Life' but didn't quite pull of. The second being 'Three Hours.' This to me might be the greatest song Drake ever wrote next to 'Pink Moon.' In at a staggering six minutes in length, which is like the equivalent of 'Mountain Jam' for the Allman Bros. it is truly a mini-epic. Lyrically it is unparalleled by anything else. The mood is dark as usually but I can't help but feel hope in the songs melody. The chugging bass line accompanied by almost renaissance guitar give an uplifting feel. The song is pure genius. The third being the lyrical genius of 'Fruit Tree' in which on his debut album Drake confesses that he knows his music won't reach the acclaim and recognition it should until his life has ended. Poetic bliss.As for the rest of Five Leaves Left nothing stands out, nothing strikes me as blaam! Though nothing else is bad. It just simply plays, and plays well. For a debut album, Five Leaves Left is incredible, but it still showed that Drake had more ground left to cover.
My favourite tracks on this debut album are those with a fuller instrumentation, i.e. Time Has Told Me with its beautiful electric guitar, piano and bass; Way To Blue with its melancholy mood elegantly expressed in a complex melody and sensitive string arrangement, and; Cello Song, a hypnotic love song with a magical interplay of cello, bass and congas. I also like The Thoughts Of Mary Jane and Three Hours, a brooding little number. As with all Drake's work, the overall mood is one of sadness wrapped in dreamy melodies, where the poetic lyrics take the listener to far-away places.
Bryter Layter is Nick Drake working with expanded orchestrations.Five Leaves Lefthas subtle string, but here, horns and even female singers  are added.This almost sounds likeForever Changes, except that Love album ratiated Authur Lee as mastero, calling the shots. Drake seems to be a lone guitar player surrounded by adoring musicians on Bryrer Layer. His singing is mournful and self-effacing as ever.Which makes the album so effective. The musical buffer around Drakes subtle voice only highlights his poetic modesty as a singer. The contrast of his insinuating singing and the big shell of the arrangements works wonders. Listen to "One Of These Things First,"or "Chime of the city clock.""Poor Boy" is a bit much. When the singers sing "poor boy, feels sorry for himself," towards Drake, it underminds the depths of his sadness. The whole piece is a little mellowdramatic and insulting to Drake, who was struggling with a serious mental illness.But even this song is a good spin, and the album as a whole is top notch.
The closest thing to a mainstream album that Nick ever recorded. There's even a near-rocker ("Hazy Janey II"), albeit one in Nick's usual somber style. I actually don't think this is nearly as good as the previous record or the next one: a bunch of weak instrumentals (title track; "Sunday"; "Fly"), and "Poor Boy" is the closest to overproduced Drake gets. Regardless, there are several fantastic songs: "Hazy Janey II" and its psychedelic-folk counterpart, "Hazy Janey I"; "At the Chime of a City Clock", which is some good jazzy stuff; "One of Those Things First" is charming but slightly rambling; and "Northern Sky" is one of the most resonant pieces in Drake's catalogue, which is saying something. So it's slightly uneven, but the best songs make it very worthwhile.
Steeper, breezier arrangements on BL compliments his other bare-bones melancholia, rarely smothering the elemental sadness and acoustic excellence prevalent in near everything Drake composed.
Definitely Nick Drake's most mainstream release in his all too brief discography, Bryter Layter is filled with more somber guitar lines, Nick's expressive vocals, and even drums/flutes/other instruments! Wow!Those elements are a turn off for those who like more of his raw and unpolished music, but a lot of the songs on this album are just as emotional as those on Pink Moon or 5 Leaves Left, though some of the songs can do without the overproduction.Still worthy of a listen, and of a purchase.
After the rainy mournfulness of his debut, Five Leaves Left, Nick Drake's second album, 1970's Bryter Layter, presents a warmer, jazzier treatment of his sensitive songs. Flutes and saxophones replace the somber violins and cellos and many tracks take a more uplifting feel, moving Drake's sound closer to Van Morrison's Moondance than Fairport Convention's Liege and Leif. "I never felt magic crazy as this/I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea/I never held emotion in the palm of my hand/Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree/But now you're here/Brighten my northern sky," he sings on "Northern Sky," and one can almost see a humble smile on the handsome, schoolboy face of the shy singer/songwriter. In fact, all songs, except the woeful "Hazey Jane" saga, seem to be more contented than Nick's previous work. He manages to be sweet, buoyant and peaceful without sounding generic, oversentimental or boring. The only way in which Bryter Layter is a step down from Five Leaves Left is its instrumental tracks. Drake's ability to pierce emotions does not transfer well into this format. The title track and "Sunday" dither into weightlessness. Besides that, the more Bryter Layter is as golden as Nick Drake's other work.
It took me a while to decide whether to tack on that fifth star or not. It feels unfair to give any Drake album a rating less than perfect, but this is the only release where the production and arrangements didn't entirely mesh with Nick's vision. He was first &amp; foremost a brilliant songwriter (if I may be forgiven for making such a simplistic understatement) with a talent for beautiful folk melodies and lyrics that read like fine poetry. He used odd guitar tunings and chords nobody else had even thought of, yet made it all sound completely natural. Every time I bought a 'new' Drake album I hadn't heard, I couldn't get it out of my stereo for at least a week or two. Every person I've played them for has completely fallen in love with the music and gone out to buy copies of their own. It never fails. Though Nick lived a short life and left precious few recordings behind, they remain as universal and personal as anything I've ever heard.Ultimately though, I give just four stars here. Bryter Layter is overridden with even more trimmings and embellishments than his 1969 debut. On Five Leaves Left, the strings and backing musicians added nicely to Nick's gorgeous songs without being overwhelming. Here they tend to drown out the beautiful simplicity of the songs on offer.. and consequently make the whole thing seem somewhat dated. It's as touching and personal as anything Nick ever did, but this release has always been the one I listen to the least. (This is all a matter of personal taste, true, but then so are all opinions on music to begin with.) Robert Kirby's string arrangements are well-done and sweetly soothing, but adding them to the degree heard here is like drowning a canvas in layers on layers of paint when just one simple coat would be just right.So what else is different? This is the brightest and, dare I say, happiest of Nick's four releases. &quot;Hazey Jane II&quot; has the most pep and energy of all Drake tunes, even going so far as to ride on a steady drum beat and include an upbeat sax solo. Three strong female voices give &quot;Poor Boy&quot; an extra backup before it flies away with the humbly hopeful &quot;Northern Sky.&quot; &quot;One of These Things First&quot; glides over a sunny piano; &quot;Fly&quot; is a simply-perfect songwriting gem that makes you close your eyes and dream of happy places far away. A couple string-drenched instrumentals round things out before an ending that comes all too soon.As much as I love what's on offer here, I still prefer the simple power of Nick's velvety voice and unique guitar.. alone.. and I find myself listening to the bare-bones Pink Moon more than all his other albums combined. If you're merely curious, go for that or Five Leaves Left first. There's a compilation (Way to Blue), but once this music touches you, you'll only want them all anyway. Look up Bryter Layter later once you're already hooked. Then join the rest of us in wishing there had been more...
Recently, it has become fashionable for artists (particularly in the alt-country movement) to record spare, stripped-down albums featuring mostly just their own voice and and accoustic guitar.  Richard Buckner's "Devotion + Doubt" and Patty Griffin's "1000 Kisses" are two excellent recent examples of the style.  But Nick Drake's "Pink Moon" was the grandaddy of the all.  Given the sheer talent that burns on this record, it makes his subsequent overdose and death all the more unfortunate.As for the songs, the title track is the signature song and thanks to Volkswagon is now Drake's most well known song.  Almost as good is the second song, "Place to Be."  Also outstanding are "Which Will" (later covered by Lucinda Williams) and the instrumental "Horn."  After that, the going gets a little rougher.  "Things Behind the Sun," for example, is a bit too rambling and at a mere half hour, the album feels a tad slight.Nevertheless, it is still a substantial and chilling work from an influential and tragic musical pioneer.
So stark, minimalist, and underproduced, it makes Plastic Ono Band look like 1984. This is what makes Nick Drake one of those artists everyone's heard of, but few have actually heard. Unless you can imagine any of this getting radio play, that is. Only one song, the album's title track, features an instrument other than his acoustic guitar - a piano. The whole here is much more than the sum of its parts. I suppose that was the idea here, since only two songs run seriously over three minutes ("Things Behind the Sun"; "Parasite"). Those two are two of my favorite songs on this album, coincidentally, though that's just because Nick is such a good lyricist, using metaphors and cooking up a stew of complex emotions (title track; "Which Will"; "Harvest Breed"). His baritone is warm, inviting, and sounds very good. This is a very good record, though it's so minimal it can wear just the slightest bit thin at times: hence, I've rated it a full star below my favorite Nick Drake album, Five Leaves Left. All three of his albums are excellent anyway.
Brief, sparse, warm yet haunting...Drake's folk classic has stood the test of time. His playing is masterful, concentrating on relatively simple melodies but putting amazing, unpretentious riffs in between. And that voice...has love and fear ever been articulated vocally like that?
I have listened to "Pink Moon" again for the first time in a year. In fact, I let it cycle through three times, feeling compelled to try and grasp the fleeting music before it fades away to silence, for this, at times, the music of quiet. Perhaps it is the vocals, often a hoarse whisper that cannot compete even with the solo acoustic guitar, or perhaps the hollow wisdom of youth trying to lament honestly life's shortcomings. There are moments of unfathomable insight and heartbreak encapsulated here.The title track is a delight, but the interplay of piano and guitar makes me yearn for more instead of less, so that after a few songs with just guitar and vocals my attention drifts. Each flows and melds into the next, never quite forging a separate identity, one extended thought shrouded in neither black nor white but a gray, hazy and vague. Still, the effect for me is much like trying to make a meal from a stash of communion wafers. Each song ushers in a promise of something more, something beyond the pall, but few fully satisfy. (I prefer his other work on "Five Leaves Left" and "Bryter Later.")Desolation and isolation may permeate the songs, but Mr. Drake still displayed his mastery of the acoustic guitar with a touch and flair that both keep the whole recording from drowning in melancholy and testify to his considerable talents. Hence, "Pink Moon" seems as a fitting requiem for Nick Drake.
The most popular and probably widest revered of his catalog, Nick Drake's "Pink Moon" is a stripped down guitar-and-voice record, with only occasional overdubbed piano.  In response to this, the production is much drier than on previous albums, lending a natural fragility to the record rather than the warmth on the previous two albums.  The album has a sparseness to it, emphasized further by its short length, but a great power as well.  I don't think its quite the masterpiece its often thought of as (I'd reserve that for Drake's debut, "Five Leaves Left"), it is a fine album.What it excels at is being delicate-- check the instrumental "Horn", a simpel and beautiful guitar line, or the famous "Pink Moon" (featured in a Volkswagon commercial) and the stunning "Things Behind the Sun".  The material is brilliant, its just that there's not terribly a lot of it, and some of it would have benefited from a stronger production and arrangement.Still, its a beautiful album, and well worth investigation.  Recommended.
"Pink Moon" was the third and last album that Nick Drake managed to get released in his all too short lifetime. The album differs somewhat from the previous two; first and foremost through the fact that the songs are only accompanied by Drake himself on his acoustic guitar, apart from the title track which has a nice little piano line also played by Drake.The songs are generally simple and short, and in some cases they may seem a little unfinished, with only one verse and a slightly raw sound on the guitar. Drake's well known and strong songwriting is present on most tracks, and when a first disappointment may have subsided, you will discover several fine songs on a par with Drake's very best.The title track "Pink Moon" is perhaps the easiest to tune to fall for; a very melodic and catchy song, ywhich you may easily find yourself go humming. A nice variation with the nice piano-part.There is as of the first two albums a sad undertone to most songs. This applies not least "Place to Be", one of the few songs with longer lyrics. "Road" is a nice little song that could well sound like a Donovan song. "Which Will" is also a song that wins on closer acquaintance, while  "Horn" is a nice little instrumental which showcases  Drake's original guitar style."Things Behind the Sun" is another of the album highlights; a song which seems completely finished, unlike the next track "Know", which in both sound and form appears rather unfinished - a little bluesy thing.The sad mood get an extra shot with "Parasite" also one of the most memorable songs. "Free Ride" may also appear a little unfinished but still quite charming Another fine Donovan-like song.b"Harvest Breed" is a very short little song with just a single verse - it has a fine typical Drake melody."From the Morning" is a worthy end to a nice little album which may nevertheless appear somewhat unresolved, and one can easily come to feel that the album could have deserved a little more time in the creation process and maybe a little variation in the arrangements. The cover art, though, is by far the most  interesting among Drake's three albums.
This album is just guitar and voice with a smattering of piano here and there. It contains classics like "Radio", "Which Will" and the well-known title track. "Know" is almost bluesy with its simple guitar and haunting voice, while the jangling guitar of "Parasite" has an almost hypnotic quality. "Ride" has a lovely pop melody and has been covered by other artists, I think. "From The Morning" is another pastoral gem. Although delectable in its minimalist elegance, Pink Moon is not my favourite Nick Drake album. I just enjoy his voice more with a fuller instrumental backing. Still, this remains a minimalist classic.
If you are in a party mood, this is definitely a record to play. The variation between tracks is not that great but that is not the most critical issue hear because most of the songs are really good.  The extra  tracks add soemthing sepcial especially the last three acoustic ones as I  never pictured Elvis as an acoustic artist.  He does quite well in that  realm.  However, Pump It Up, Lip Service, and No Action are my three faves  on this one.  Elvis really puts alot of effort into this one and that will  make it a good deal for most record collections.
Pop rock at its late 70's heights shows a thinking man's Bruce Springsteen continuing to harness amazing energy and tight interplay out of proportion to many of his peers, furthering an already torrential amount of praise only after this sophomore release. Undeniably rock-solid, but only a handful of  entries sound entirely brilliant.
Costello's second album, This Year's Model, took the potential shown in 1977's classic My Aim Is True and ran with it. Elvis Costello's punk sensibility, melodic yet tight guitar, and sharp political commentary was now paired to a great backing band, the Attractions (Steve Nieve on keyboards, Bruce Thomas on bass, and Pete Thomas on drums). Far from a sophomore slump, This Year's Model might be Costello's best release, and has probably aged better than anything else he's done.In punk fashion, Costello's songs are short and forceful, hovering right around 2-3 minutes. However, don't expect Clash or Sex Pistols-like aggression and buzzing guitars. Costello's early work is about as "rock 'n' roll" as one can get--melodic, tuneful, and irresistable. Costello's acerbic and humourous lyrics comment on a great many things--the fashion industry on This Year's Girl, Orwellian paranoia on Living In Paradise, and a pan of commercial radio on Radio, Radio (made famous by Elvis Costello's controversial guest spot on Saturday Night Live).If you can enjoy Costello's quirky vocals (I happen to really like them) than This Year's Model will definitely have appeal. Punkers looking for something different will probably really like this album. His other early albums (My Aim Is True, Armed Forces) are in a similar vein and also worth purchasing.Note: For the most part the Rhino reissue is really nice, with great liner notes penned by Elvis himself and one of the best remasters I've heard in recent years. However, was the bonus disk really necessary? Big Tears and Stranger In The House could have been included on the first disk as bonus tracks, while the rest of the bonus material is made up of middling demos and live stuff that is only of interest to completists. All the bonus disk does is jack up the price of the album. Not a big deal, but more thought should've been put into this.
Coming off the very good second effort of "This Year's Model", "Armed Forces" represents a slightly more mellow Elvis albeit with the same biting, hard-hitting lyrics.  The synthesizer comes more into prominence on this album which sees a departure from the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers'-type sound of the previous album and the sound is less edgy.  Although not quite as good as the second album overall, this third album is no slouch either.This version of the album which comes in a mini-lp sleeve design which has an almost origami type cardboard outer cover which contains a booklet with both Japanese and English lyrics as well as 4 picture postcards has one of the best album covers I've ever seen; the artistic representation of a herd of elephants is simply stunning to behold.  The remastered sound quality is very good too.This is a real treat for all Elvis Costello fans and is certainly a collectors' item.
Costello's signature airtight pop-rock is wrapped even tighter with his third, AF. Although a bit of over-effort takes away from a little memorability, the disc sounds about equal in quality with his previously two universally praised albums, if anything supplementing the raw energy with compositional agility.
On his third album, Costello's lyrics are just as sweaty, cynical and paranoid as ever, but the music was opening up very steadily. No one would confuse this with the sort of songs he was releasing ten and fifteen years from now, but there was an unmistakable sense of flowering pop. In fact, there's hardly any hint of his ahead-of-its-time post-punk style on here (excepting the lyrics, of course).But "Armed Forces" doesn't suffer from it; in fact, its very trademark transition is what makes it rank nearly on par with his first two near-masterpieces. "Senior Service" and "Accidents Will Happen" are the two best, but check out the R&B; funk of "Moods For Moderns" and the sharp lyrics and attitude of the potential-disaster-turned-marvel "Party Girl." Although he'd rarely be as good as this again, he out-lasted some of his populist influences (the deadly punk movement and Buddy Holly), and not just because he managed to, um, live.Best cuts: "Senior Service," "Accidents Will Happen," "Moods For Moderns" "Party Girl," "(What's So Funny `Bout) Peace, Love and Undersanding," "Sunday's Best," "Oliver's Army," "Green Shirt," "Goon Squad"
Elvis has long admitted to being a Beatles fan, of course (going as far as calling them the greatest band ever in Rolling Stone). And this is the closest he got to embracing the Fab Four's occasional dipping into "classical rock" (that is, rock influenced by classical music - I'm not trying to invent a new phrase for "classic rock"). The result is an odd, but mostly satisfying effort. I say "mostly" because sometimes he goes totally overboard in places, making You Little Fool, Town Cryer, Pidgin English and ...And Every Home sound treacly, overloading them with harpsichord, strings, Baroque piano, flutes, clarinets, bassoons, lutes, hautboys, kazoos... (okay, I made a couple of those up).Overproduced? Well, yeah. But that's part of its charm, I guess you could say. And more often than not it's a classic: Take the cynical Beyond Belief or the ballads Almost Blue and Man Out of Time. Shabby Doll, Tears Before Bedtime and The Long Honeymoon (which has the only accordion part I've ever heard that I can honestly say I like) aren't as prominent as those three, but they have the same feel and are just as good. And Costello's lyricism and immortal melodicism are diminished.However, there are at least two better Costello records out there. Maybe three. My favorite Elvis albums are the first three (and this one), and I can honestly say at least This Year's Model and Armed Forces (and probably My Aim is True) are better. So this is quite good, but don't start here.
Listen to the opening lines of "The Loved Ones" and you hear Costello at his best. Snappy lines, sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit. Then we hit the piano "noodling" and the song starts to drift away from me. The CD is filled with moments like this; great lyrics and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornments. Stripped down, this is some of Costello's best stuff; songs that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect. But every time I feel like I get close to the heart of the song, I feel lost in the middle of music that serves no purpose. This is definitely worth a listen and I still enjoy popping it in the machine, but I feel some of his other works is more deserving of the high praise given IMPERIAL BEDROOM.
I had some trouble sharing others' enthusiasm for "Imperial Bedroom" when it was first released in 1982. The album was, of course, in many ways a return to Costello's original starting point, after the, for me, very disappointing "Almost Blue" album. Compared to "Trust" and "Get Happy" , though,  the numbers are generally more produced, and stylistically the album spreads out over many genres.However my original appeal against "Imperial Bedroom" was that I thought there were only few really good tracks. Later, I have had to revise my opinion, because there are actually more great songs.I remember that the only tracks that really made an impression on me were "Shabby Doll" and "Long Honeymoon". I still think well of "Shabby Doll", while "Long Honeymoon" has not lasted for me. On the other hand, there are a handful among the other songs that stand out positively. "The Loved Ones" is a catchy song that well could have stemmed from Costello's perhaps best album "Armed Forces". The same description could fit "Little Savage" which probably is my favorite track on the album."Man Out of Time", "You Little Fool" and the somewhat heavily-produced ballad "Town Cryer" also stand out.There are also a couple of real disappointments. The two Dusty Springfield pastiches "Almost Blue" and "Kid About it" can be hard to swallow.Conclusion: In several ways an uneven album that contains fine numbers, but which as a whole does not measure up to Costello's best. To be fair, It should be mentioned that Costello vocally is on top and he shows great versatility.
A solidly enjoyable return to rock after several years of weirdness. It kind of reminds me of This Year's Model: four-piece rock with a funk edge and lovably cheesy keyboards. And it's good. ("Uncomplicated"; "I Hope You're Happy Now"; "Honey, Are You Straight or Are You Blind?"; the jangly "Next Time Around"). The difference is, there are a few longer tracks that are great, too (the ominous rumble of "Tokyo Storm Warning"; the torch ballad of sorts "Home is Anywhere You Hang Your Head"; the possessive "I Want You", a slow, creepy build-up of a song). And Costello's undeniable songwriting skills make even weak songs like "Blue Chair" (stupid harpsichord...) and the rather unspectacular "Crimes of Paris". Other than "I Want You" none of these songs are exactly classics, but it's an all-around good album, though the fourth extended track ("Battered Old Bird") is a bit much, and the spaced-out intro to "Poor Napoleon" annoys me. Still, a very respectable album, one of Costello's best.
After the extremes of "King Of America," "Punch The Clock," and "Imperial Bedroom," Elvis Costello made what he probably suspected people would conceive of as a typical "Elvis Costello and the Attractions" album. Nick Lowe came back on board and they threw subtlety to the wind for "Blood And Chocolate," Elvis Costello's angriest album since "This Year's Model." Fueled by his recent divorce and a few rancorous Hollywood romantic disasters, Elvis himself described the inspiration for most of this material as "Messing up my life so I could write stupid little songs about it.""I hope you're satisfied with what you've done." That opening line sets the tone of "Uncomplicated," and the oncoming barrage for the album. EC unleashes wave after wave of vitriol backed by The Attractions' and Lowe's artful distortion. The distorted sound matches the emotional content of many of the songs, and one of Elvis' most brilliant performances of all time is here. On "I Want You," he drags you into a hellish confrontation that moves at half the album's general pace. With more than a passing nod to John Lennon and The Beatles' song of the same name, Elvis vents with derisive passion, till the sounds slowly drop away and with little more than the sound of him deeply breathing the title over and over, the song comes to a close."I Want You" is reason enough to have "Blood And Chocolate," but if you need more, there's the bizarre Dylanesque travelogue of "Tokyo Storm Warning." Next to "Hurry Down Doomsday (The Bugs Are Taking Over)" from "Mighty Like A Rose," it's one of EC's weirdest songs and contains the wonderful line about the "Japanese Jesus Robots telling teenage fortunes."Perhaps it's in the fact that the recording of "Blood And Chocolate" was done as quickly as possible with as few takes as necessary, but for the most part, this was Elvis most relentless CD since "This Year's Model (With Bonus Disc)." Just don't let that stop you from getting this CD...it's a boxful of some very angry candy.
One of Costello's most riveting albums, Blood and Chocolate isn't quite as consistent as earlier outings but is, nevertheless, one of his most powerful. One could argue that, emotionally, it's one of his most personal albums as well. This is about as raw as EC gets.The remastered sound is great and the booklet very informative (much more so than the version released with the Ryko reissue). Is it worth picking up again? Frankly, yes because of the second disc. While EC has relocated the bonus tracks to the second disc, he's also added a handful of previously unreleased or rare tracks that make this an essential edition to any fan.The Attractions have never sounded this brutal before. The songs are direct and played without the flourish that one had come to expect from the band.A quick note for fans--the initial batch release has the discs mislabeled. The &quot;bonus&quot; disc is actually B&amp;C. This is also the case with Brutal Youth (another underrated album in EC's catalog and, yes, essential).
Although this lighthearted version of Sinatra doesn't appeal to me as much as his darker side does, there's no denying Riddle knows how to make anything swing, and the Voice delivered a tune--virtually any tune--better than jsut about anyone, save Ella Fitzgerald.And, while some of these tunes are a tad too cutesy for me, &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; is perfection, &quot;It Happened In Monterey&quot; shimmys seductively, and Sinatra's quiet approach to &quot;Anything Goes&quot; is charming.
My Dad was a Sinatra fan. We twice thoroughly enjoyed watching a tape I made of a PBS Great Performances broadcast of Sinatra's best television appearances (sadly unavailable on DVD). My own appreciation of Sinatra has grown over the years. When our library purchased this CD, I was eager to audition it.I agree that Sinatra was at a peak vocally when he recorded this album. Some of his live performances are more loose, but in later years his voice was not up to par. It's a matter of taste. I am perfectly happy with the subtle yet expressive variations that Sinatra uses to perform these songs, many of them classics.I was less happy with the Nelson Riddle arrangements. They seem excessively busy. They call attention to themselves when they ought to lay back and let the focus be on the soloist, i.e. Sinatra.Riddle infuses his charts with little ornamentations, flourishes that strike me as a bit hokey, even clownish at times -- invention and variety for its own sake, rather than supporting and deepening the underlying rhythm, chord structure, and melody of the composition. My description here perhaps makes them sound a little more annoying than they actually are. Certainly some songs on this album evidence these flaws more than others. I am far from having encyclopedic knowledge of the big arrangers of the era gone by, but I've heard many by Claus Ogerman, and as a point of contrast, I think he was more serious and at the same time laid back in his charts. Here again, it is a matter of taste. I thought the orchestra called too much of the wrong kind of attention to itself too often on Songs for Swingin' Lovers.In the final analysis, with great songs and Sinatra himself in great form, I still have to dock one star off a perfect five for the arrangements, which distract me from time to time with their obtrusive, pointless, sometimes silly little flourishes.On the topic of sound quality, although I have not heard the original CD release, the remastered version truly does sound sub-par. Sinatra's upper registers, brass, strings, all seem to suffer from some subtle distortion that smudges detail and creates a sort of odd, artificial electronic haze. Really, hearing-impaired  people should not be involved in mastering classic albums. Whoever did the job on Songs for Swingin' Lovers should probably be doing something more suited to his talents, like driving a cab. Although it is hard to put your finger on it exactly, there is something most definitely "wrong" with the sound. I'm fairly familiar with what recordings from the mid-50s sound like, and I can't believe the original master tape of this Sinatra record ever sounded as bad as this. I may buy this album -- its reputation as a classic is deserved (with my reservation about the arranging) -- but if I do, I will seek out the early release, not the later remastered CD.
I note that a couple of reviewers are unhappy with the sound of this CD transfer.  It didn't sound too bad to me, considering its age, but I take the point about some shrillness, especially in the trumpet high parts.  I think too that the timing is short measure for a CD, but I got it cheap, so I can't complain!  Otherwise, I loved it.  I got because I had been listening to a lot of the Grateful Dead and had come to the conclusion that it it is in some ways a jazz band.  So hell, I said, I'll try the real thing (my main interest is classical and opera).  I'm glad I tried it it -- this disc goes mellow beautifully, and it swings, though not too hard, appropriately.  Adderley's sax is a wonderful soulful sound, and Davis plays inventively and appealingly.  Hank Jones isn't featured as much as I might like, but he's a lucid and witty pianist.  The bass and drums are rock solid.  The whole thing is just a delight.  So why only four stars?  Mainly for the short measure.  This should have been combined with another recital.
I've always been a big Steve Winwood fan and although I only first heard him during hisArc of a Diverdays subsequent research led me to his early days and this early offering released in the same year as the legendary Beatles'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Remastered)and borrows ideas from that andRevolveryet exudes a very unique vibe of its own.  While the presence of Mason's sitar and Eastern voicings and the psychedelic leanings can be attributed to the Beatles' influence, this album has a mood of its own and listening to it transports me into an incense-filled room and in fact the music sounds as if it is struggling to break through a thick smoke-filled room to get to your eardrums and yet it is very addictive and holds you spellbound.  Whether intentional or a product of less than optimal sound production the effect is quite fascinating making it an overall very rewarding listen.Recorded in mono, the sound quality is a little patchy with some tracks sounding okay and a few not so good with uneven volume levels and varying amounts of muddiness but this is possibly due to a poor master source.  Although this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release has been remastered and a heroic attempt made to clean up the sound let's just say that it wasn't a total success.  Sound quality aside, this is an admirable mlps release coming well designed and assembled though a little difficult to get the cd out meaning you have to be careful not to tear the cardboard but coming with a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese this will satisfy the collectors if not the audiophiles.Overall this is a decent mlps release of a unique 60s classic that rewards repeated listening.Recommended!
Whereas this recording is not Traffic's best work, it is very unique with the blending of many different flute, sitar, harp, organ, and more.  Not to forget the superb Guitar work by David Mason.  The song arrangements aren't  as developed as on the classic John Barley Corn and Low Spark Recordings  but the elements of folk, jazz, and rock make this a very listenable  record.
Asia was the first band I called "my favourite one". Via Asia, I got to know my later and present favourite Yes.The influence of Yes shines through in this first album of the band. It is especially obvious in the  afterplay to Cutting It Fine.But this is mainly a rock album. Some  call it prog rock - who knows why - indeed, it is true that there is more  to it than just plain 1980's rock. It has a touch, it has more soul. It is  bombastic rock without even being close to hardrock. Well worth listening  to!My favourites on this debut album are Wildest Dreams, One Step  Closer, and of course the first single Heat Of The Moment.
When this album first came out, I have to admit I was surprised.  Some of the tracks were really quite ... dare I say it, catchy.  And there was even a Top 30-friendly single on the album ('Only Time will tell').  But wasn't this Carl Palmer -- he of the 70s triple album and serious devotee of classical percussionist James Blades?  And wasn't this also Steve Hose -- he of another 70s triple album and several serious solo albums.  And hadn't John Wetton starred on the seriously serious 'Red' in 74?  How could the three come together yet produce this Adult-Oriented stadium Rock?Let's not forget Palmer's beginnings in the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Atomic Rooster.  Or Wetton's bizarre phase with Uriah Heep.  And Geoff Downes was nominally half of 'Buggles', whose minimal output was unashamed pop.  The style of this, Asia's debut album wasn't a million miles from UK's eponymous LP of 1978, although it was distinctly more mainstream.I like this album, the best of all the Asia output that I've heard.  I would have preferred the music to be a little more ambitious; there's a sense in which it's all been concocted to maximise the commercial return, which you couldn't say of UK.  But it's a good, undemanding listen.
Many people drubbed this album when it came out.  They didn't like the "sell out" mentality of it.  Mind you, this was the same set of critics who kept giving the progressive rock groups bad reviews, calling them pretentious and pompous.  So, is this a good album?  Absolutely.  It is certainly more commercial than ELP, Yes, or King Crimson, but you don't get the feeling of a blatant sellout.  This is really the only Asia album you need.  This is their best.  They pretty much collapsed after this album, making only one more album with the original lineup, then splintering off into various offshoots to the point no one knows who's really in the band anymore.  I've always loved Heat of the Moment and Only Time Will Tell, and Wildest Dreams is good too, with Carl Palmer getting a chance to show his chops (he's subdued on this album in comparison to his ELP workouts).  This is Asia's best, and the only one worth having.
Asia is the grandest superband on earth. But why Asia? They tried to show that this is no traditional British progressive rock nor American progressive hard rock and it lies somewhere between. Heat of the Moment, Only Time Will Tell, Sole Survivor are super-excellent. Particularly interim keyboard bridge part of Soul Survivor has been embedded in my memory for so long. Rest of the tracks are very dynamic as well and showing the longtime legacy of British prog a bit. John Wetton's clear voice is another of the band's appeal. Recommended for wide range of melodic rock and progressive rock fans who may like Dream Theater.
I really only like the first 3 songs here but what incredible songs they are!  &quot;Supergroups&quot; usually are bands of big name stars trying to outdo each other.Not in this band,no way.They could've really gone into  overblown territory but everything stays in check.A solid piece of music  start to finish.
...and with it a legendary career in rock,balls and good taste.His 1984 opus,even though a product of that(golden,by the way)era,is a combination of wit,intelligence,social awareness,poetry,all topped by supreme  songwriting skills and one of the best voices in biz.
Of the ex-Eagles doing solo material, I so far have only gotten Don Henley's second solo album, Building The Perfect Beast.  He gets a lot of help from guitarist Danny Kortchmar in music, songwriting, and keyboards.  This is a nice exercise in light rock that still has hallmarks of the mellow California sound popularized by his ex-bandmates the Eagles, J.D. Souther, Karla Bonoff, and Linda Ronstadt.  Even though Glenn Frey had more notable hits than him, Don Henley's reputation is more intact, as Frey meandered into poppy soundtrack music that alienated his old crowd."The Boys Of Summer" having been covered recently by DJ Sammy and AFI, makes me appreciate the original all the more.  I mean an oontsa-oontsa remix or a punk cover clearly can never capture the wistful pain of trying to forget a lost time on the beach.Another variation on the wealth not being able to buy love is told on the leisurely "You Can't Make Love" featuring Lindsey Buckingham on guitar and harmonies and the HeartbreakersBenmont Tench on keyboards.  There's an added dimension to the theme, that one can make a promise and walk down an aisle, and "make a life for her that fits like a glove" but--you get the idea.The rocking "Man With A Missionwith a 50's rock-and-roll sound, of someone out to have a rowdy partying time, such as running a few red lights, starting some fist fights, drinking a few beers.  I was surprised this didn't make it on the Fast Times At Ridgemont High soundtrack, because thematically, this would fit.  Charlie Sexton helps on guitar, as does Belinda Carlisle on harmonies."You're Not Drinking Enough" has a trace of the country rock that popularized the Eagles. The idea here is trying to forget a woman and if "you still wanna hold her/you must not be drinkin' enough." The way he writes how men get stomped caught my eye:  "She passed on your passion/and stepped on your pride/turns out you ain't quite so tough.""Not Enough Love In The World" is a timely song that has shades even today.  "I know people hurt you bad/they don't know the damage they can do, and it makes me sad/how we knock each other down just like children on a playground."The tribal drums and chants of the title track is a jab at creating the ultimate person with motifs of the gods of Olympus and Methuselah.  "Relieve all pain and suffering and lift us out of the dark/turn us all into Methuselah/But where are we gonna park?is a cheekily humorous question to the age old quest for immortality.  Patty Smyth, J.D. Souther, and Martha Davis of the Motels contribute to the chants.The fuzzy bass synth in  "All She Wants To Do Is Dance" makes this one of the most familiar songs by ear on the radio.  Martha Davis and Patty Smyth help out here again.The tearful "A Month Of Sundays" is by far the best song here, on the reflections of a farmer now on hard times, a familiar sight during the Reagan era.  The generation gap is shown with the more left of center grandson and the son-in-law, a Vietnam veteran who's dismissive:  "That little punk, he never had to serve" The last few verses alone make a melancholy sunset."Sunset Grill" is a social commentary on the mean city and the soul-draining effects it has.  The subject here wants to leave, but here's the tragic joke:  "What would we do without all these jerks anyway?  Besides, all our friends are here."Henley gets a lot of help from varied musicians, such as some Heartbreakers, a woman from a Motel, and a woman who causes a Scandal.  The light style rock does still give out that peaceful easy feeling of his former band, but his solo album shows he was the lynchpin of the Eagles.
This is probably former Eagles drummer Don Henley's best solo effort, with &quot;The End Of The Innocence&quot; coming in a close second.Perhaps a bit too much synth for my taste, but that's a minor complaint, and &quot;Building The Perfect Beast&quot; does feature some of Henley's best and most melodious songs, such as the MTV hit &quot;The Boys Of Summer&quot;, &quot;You Can't Make Love&quot;, &quot;Not Enough Love In The World&quot;, &quot;You're Not Drinking Enough&quot; and &quot;All She Wants To Do Is Dance&quot;.Henley's voice is strong and soulful (he was always The Eagles' greatest singer), and with the exception of a few minor tracks, the songs are of high quality, both lyrically and melodically.
Don Henley is truly a great singer, and this album does not dissappoint.He definitely has his own style. This has some absolute gems on it." The Boys of Summer" is a classic all time song. The perfect hit song that is timeless." Sunset Grill" is also great and " Driving with your eyes closed"This is a mainstream album, and many music fans would enjoy Henleys workTop music!
Henley seems to take a lot of flack from people with similar musical tastes as my own, but I have always thought he was a great songwriter.  Yes his music is fairly pedestrian, and he appears to be an average drummer, but I think his lyrics are often extremely clever and he has always been a great singer.  Up until the early 80's Henley was best known for being the drummer, singer, and songwriter for The Eagles.  After The Eagles broke up in 1981 Henley went solo and had a very successful run of radio hits and platinum albums.  "Beast" is his second solo record and although I think his next one was better this one was still solid.  Several huge hits came from this album including "Boys Of Summer", "All She Wants To Do Is Dance" two songs that though massively overplayed were pure pop gems. Other highlights include the country tinged "You're Not Drinking Enough".  The title track "Building The Perfect Beast" is full of patented Henley social commentary.  My favorite song on the album, "A Month Of Sundays" is a song about a farmer loosing his livelihood in the Regan era 80's.  This is the kind of track that Henley does best and it really works here.  "Sunset Grill" is another great song and serves as a kind of sequel to "The Sad Caf&eacute;" from The Eagles "Long Run" album.  Henley gets plenty of help on this album from well known musicians including most of Tom Petty's band, Lindsay Buckingham, Charlie Sexton and others.  This is not Henley's best album, but it has quite a few really good songs on it.
David Coverdale said once that'John(Sykes)and I sat down and rewrote rock history in 15 minutes'.Far from being a bombastic statement this summarizes a rock album now legendary-those who called Whitesnake a Zep clone are  oblivious to the fact that Coverdale comes from the same blues tradition  -while those who want to see how it's done,they'd better listen to this!
This is one of the best heavy metal albums to come out of the 80's and it made Whitesnake international superstars.The video's with the vixen of Tawny Kitaen and the hunter of David Coverdale will forever be a part of our memories as the the captivating sensual imagery just sinked its teeth into our limbs and souls.The music of course is what matters here and it sizzles from start to finish.Songs such as "Still of the night" though derivitive hit hard due to the passion and conviction put forth into every note.It is a bonafide heavy metal classic filled with pounding drums and machine gun guitar solo's courtesy of former Thin Lizzy axeman John Sykes.John Sykes was obviously a crucial factor in the success of this album as he helped to write a big chunk of it.Just listen to the sexy prowling groove that carries the classic "Is this love" complemented by the romantic intense lyrics sung with such eloquence by David Coverdale.This is a timeless classic rock ballad that still tugs at your heartstrings no matter if you hate metal or not...it speaks to everyone.There is also a heavy blues influence as witnessed in the swaggering "Give me all your love" and the thundering rage of "Crying in the rain" which contains a blazing blistering guitar solo and some hair raising vocal acrobatics from Mr. Coverdale.Of course we can not forget the anthemic "Here i go again" with its catchy chorus and the unforgettable images of Tawny doing the spread eagle on that oldsmobile.The whole album is just a big plate of sophisticated polished metal that is irresistable and just too darn tasty to resist.Whitesnake sinks its fangs in deep and does'nt let go.Don't forget to catch  Whitesnake live this summer!!!!The new lineup David Coverdale has put together is a monster of a band and they will smoke everyone in their path.o.f.
How do you know when you are listening to commerock?  When a self-proclaimed hard rock/heavy metal band suddenly releases an album that your wife or girlfriend likes better then you do.  I guess even "hard rock" bands have to make a living too.As far as commerock goes though this is a pretty good representative of the genre; I liked the unabashedly commercial tracks i.e. "Here I Go Again" and "Is This Love" but I found that I liked the other tracks even better!"Still of the Night" is my favourite and you have to give guitarist, John Sykes, a lot of credit as he plays some fantastic guitar on this album which makes me wonder why he was replaced soon after.  Have to admit though that many of the riffs he uses he "borrowed" from Jimmy Page's Led Zeppelin days (in fact, "Stil...Night" is a prime example of this)but still he pulls the guitar parts off very well.I hope they do remaster this album and even release it in a mini-lp package format as that should make the whole thing sound and even look a lot better.  Even in this unremastered version, I thought the sound was pretty decent enough so overall if you are into commerock, this is a good disc to get although you may want to imitate me and wait for the remastered version that hopefully will come out someday soon.
This may not be their best album, but it's easily their most popular. The casual fan will find their biggest hits on here. This was released in 1987, and includes &quot;Still Of The Night&quot;, &quot;Is This Love&quot;, and the huge hit &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;. However most of the other tracks are nearly as good. &quot;Crying In The Rain&quot; and &quot;Children Of The Night&quot; are two other favorites. Overall they were one of the better hard rock/metal bands of the era, and had great taste in hood-ornaments too. Also better than &quot;Great White&quot;, and &quot;White Lion&quot;.
Whitesnake's self-titled album was one of the better ones of the hair metal era and it's easy to see why. Most of the songs have something positive to offer as lead singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes molded Whitesnake from a classic rock band with a bluesy edge to a hard rock band which balanced songs based on memorable riffs with heartfelt power ballads with equal aplomb. And this album, while very good, is one of its era: very slick and tailor made for radio. Having said that, I do favor this album's versions of "Here I Go Again" and "Crying in the Rain" as they have a passion and energy that was lacking on the originals that were on the Saints & Sinners album. The aforementioned "Here I Go Again" and the ballad "Is This Love?" would became huge hit singles and deservedly so. "Still of the Night", while representative of Led Zeppelin, was a killer and songs like the riff heavy track "Bad Boys" and "Give Me All Your Love" were nearly as good. The closing ballad "Don't Turn Away" is another strong power ballad that was better than "Is This Love?" and would have been another hit single if released. The remaining tracks, "Children of the Night" and "Straight from the Heart", were okay but suffered from clich&eacute;d lyrics. All told, Whitesnake is a strong album that brings back a lot of memories and has a lot of great songs. Newcomers who want to hear them at their best might want to pick up Slide It In, an album with better songs overall and a sound that has aged more gracefully.
Whitesnake's self-titled album, was great when it came out in 1987, but it has sled a little since.  The bluesy Whitesnake had become part of the hair rock scene in 1987.  David Coverdale, Aynsley Dunbar, John Sykes, Neil Murray and Adrian Vandenberg (who had a hit in '82 "Burnin' Heart").  Their 9th studio release broke this band like wildfire.  This album gave us, the rockers "Children Of The Night", "Crying In The Rain", tremendous track, the Zeppelin clone song "Still Of The Night",#79, still one of my favorites from these guys.  The melodic rockers in, "Give Me All Your Love", #48, and the ballads that got played to death "Is This Love", #1, and "Here I Go Again", #2.  They would release "Slip Of The Tongue", in 1989.
Most fans of Whitesnake consider this to be the band's best album.  It was certainly their commercial peak and many of the songs are staples of classic rock radio to this day.  I remember when this came out in the late 80's it seemed to be to be a good old fashioned hard rock shot in the arm compared to much of the music that was on the radio at the time.  Since it's formation, other than David Coverdale, the Whitesnake lineup has always been in flux, but this album featured one of the better versions of the band with John Sykes ( Thin Lizzy, Blue Murder) on guitar, Neil Murray (Black Sabbath, Coliseum II, National Health) on bass, and Aynsley Dunbar (Frank Zappa, Journey, Jefferson Starship) on drums.  Instrumentally this band was a force to be reckoned with as all of the member turn in outstanding performances.  Coverdale's voice was never in better shape and soars over the roaring music of his bandmates.  The songwriting is decent enough, pretty much typical late 80's hair metal subject matter, but for the most part it all works.  For me "Still Of The Night" remains one of the great songs of this era and is the centerpiece of this album.  This line up of Whitesnake would disintegrate shortly after this album was released, which is too bad as it would have been interesting to see where the Sykes / Coverdale partnership could have led them.
THE END OF THE INNOCENCE was Don Henley's third solo album and his second since he signed with Geffen Records. His first solo album I CAN'T STAND STILL was released on Asylum in 1982,the same label that his band The Eagles recorded on. In 1984,Henley signed with Geffen and released BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST. Five years later,this album was released. Henley had two previous megahits with The Eagles,their albums HOTEL CALIFORNIA and THE LONG RUN. Now for the songs:the title track,which is the first hit from this album,features Bruce Hornsby playing the piano. The track was written or co-written by Hornsby. Other hits include THE LAST WORTHLESS EVENING,I WILL NOT GO QUIETLY,THE HEART OF THE MATTER and NEW YORK MINUTE. GIMME WHAT YOU GOT features Geffen Records labelmate Edie Brickell singing background(I want it,I want it). NEW YORK MINUTE also appeared on the Eagles' reunion concert album HELL FREEZES OVER,released in 1994. All the other tracks are good.
Easily one of the best albums of the eighties,'The End of the Innocence'still shines brilliantly.Henley has one of the most recognizable voices in business and on this record he took his great songwriting skills  to the limit;what makes this CD so great is not the star studded cast(Bruce  Hornsby,Axl Rose,Wayne Shorter,to name a few)but rather the exceptional  quality and maturity of the songs;they are utterly cinematic and  compelling,e.g.'New York Minute',as if each one encompasses a novel-they  also exude a certain timelesness making them sound fresh even today.Music  like this is hard to come by!
When I first heard some of the tracks on this record, my feelings were,&quot;Just what I needed.  More bland pop music.&quot;  However, time has definitely made me change my tune on this batch.  These songs are all written with heavy emotion.  Whereas the tone is quite sad and disillusional, it rings of many honest and true sentiments.  New York Minute is the real gem here as anything can truly change in the blink of the eye. Heart Of The Matter has a captivating hook and Bruce Hornsby adds the right touches on the title track. The touching horn and keyboard arrangments really make Don Henley's music stand up when compared to his former band mates work.  And his lyrics are so original and real that it balances out some of bland moments. This collection is definitely worthy of my respect.
I bought this album when it came out, a friend of mine recommanded this one to me.  I have to say that I still enjoy listening to it, every song a pleasure to listen to, no filler.  Great from the beginning till the end.  My favorite tracks are "The end of Innocence", "The last worthless evening", "New York minute" and "The heart of the matter".  A very good addition to any cd collection.
Following the breakup of the Eagles, Don Henley would embark on what would slowly become a very successful solo career.  In the 1980s, Henley would release three albums.  His first effort was 1982's "I Can't Stand Still".  This effort would produce a classic tune called "Dirty Laundry" in which Henley poked fun at the "pretty faces" doing the TV news.  Two+ years later - in 1984, a more successful follow-up "Building the Perfect Beast" would produce three more singles "All She Wants To Do is Dance", "Sunset Grill", and "The Boys of Summer".  "The Boys of Summer" was a mega-hit for Henley that was boosted by an award winning music video.  Following "Building the Perfect Beast", Henley would take nearly 5 years to make his next effort.  The 5 year effort made by Henley would not disappoint - his 1989 effort entitled "The End of the Innocence" would become his most successful solo effort to date.  Each of Don Henley's solo albums would be more successful from both a commercial sales and criticial acclaim standpoint.  "The End of the Innocence" marked the peak of Don Henley's solo career and broke him out of the mold of the Eagles and put him on his own two feet.There are three factors that make "The End of the Innocence" a great album.  First, from a songwriting standpoint - Henley and Company do some of his best work.  Second, from a production standpoint.  Danny Kortchmar was brought in as the a co-producer with Henley for 7 of the 10 songs.  Kortchmar had collaborated with Henley on his two previous albums as a songwriter.  Kortchmar continues to collaborate with Henley on several tunes, but now moves into the role as the main co-producer.  Kortchmar's previous work with Henley makes him a natural fit as he is able to get the most out of Don Henley's talents.  Finally, as with his previous studio albums - Henley brings in an all-star lineup of musicians - past, present, and future.  This lineup of musicians help augment Henley's talents even more and make this such as great release.  The lineup of musicians includes: Bruce Hornsby, Mike Campbell (from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), Patty Smyth (Scandal),  Axl Rose (Guns N Roses), Jeff Porcaro and David Paich (Toto). The lineup includes three woman who would become big stars in the 90s: Melissa Etheridge, Edie Brickell, and Sheryl Crow.Bruce Hornsby is co-writer, producer (this is the one of non-Kortchmar produced song), and pianist of "The End of the Innocence".  Hornsby's trademark piano playing combined with Henley's vocals make this a classic.  The lyrics make a lot of use of metaphors.  Although a much different sound than 1984's "The Boys of Summer", the song still has much of the retro-qualities of "Boys of Summer"."How Bad Do You Want It" is a very underrated tune.  It probably is one of the best songs of the album and is co-written by Henley, Kortchmar, and Stan Lynch.  There is some great horn work and terrific drum work.  Patty Smyth plays a key role with the background vocals that fold in perfectly when needed.  Although not as strong a song as "How Bad Do You Want It", the third track "I Will Not Go Quietly" makes good use of background vocals as well.  Another Henley and Kortchmar collaboration, this strong uses Axl Rose on background vocals and he goes perfectly with the hard rock edge of this song.Despite Kortchmar's solid influence, the collection's best track "The Last Worthless Evening" wasn't a Kortchmar collaboration from a songwriting or production standpoint.  Mike Campbell and John Corey (Corey and Stan Lynch wrote and produced this with Henley)  provide some terrific guitar work.  The acoustic sound makes this song special.  In this song, Don sings this song to himself about a woman who has broken up with someone and Don feels he can fill the void in the woman's life.  The best part of the song is the bridge in the middle of the song that goes "Time Time Ticking...".  This song is a classic."New York Minute" was written in 1989 by Henley, Kortchmar, and Jai Winding.  It is a truly great song that features Toto's Jeff Porcaro on drums and Toto's David Paich on piano.  This song has a terrific haunting quality.  What nobody would realize is how this song would almost become a soundtrack for the state of New York City following the World Trade Center attack.  Lyrics such as "Harry Got Up....Went Down to the Station; And He Never Came Back" and "Lying here in darkness; I hear the Sirens Wail" are examples of this.  Paich also contributes piano on "Little Tin God".  "Little Tin God" deals with Evangelists and Healers.  This best way to describe this song's sound is a folk-like quality applied with a harder Rock edge.Edie Brickell and Melissa Etheridge contribute background vocals on "Gimme What You Got".  Because of Kotchmar's guitar, this song has almost a John Fogerty sound to it - much like you hear on "Centerfield".  Sheryl Crow contributes background vocals on "If Dirt Were Dollars".  This song also has a Fogerty like quality.  Both songs may have a Fogerty sound, but they also explore Fogerty-like topics of materialism and greed.The collection wraps up with "The Heart of the Matter".  This song almost seems like a perfect "wrap-up" like song.  Mike Campbell plays guitar and keyboards and is a co-writer and producer with Henley on this track (also Kortchmar co-produces).  Don sings about a lost love and he explores to see what went wrong by getting to "The Heart of the Matter".  Campbell's work on guitar and keyboards will really be the foundation to this song.The liner notes of this collection contain the lyrics to all of the songs.  The production and songwriting credits are also included.  The collection also does a nice job at listing the studio musicians.  Overall, this is a solid effort by Don Henley - highly recommended.
Forty percent of this CD is really top-notch stuff. "The End of the Innocence," "The Last Worthless Evening," "New York Minute" and "The Heart of the Matter" are as good and poignant as pop rock music gets; no wonder they were released as singles. Don Henley is one heck of a lyricist, and he knows how to write a catchy tune. The title track leads off the album, piano laden, sentimental and beautiful. Like all the aforementioned songs, there's a sadness to the lyrics, in this case the loss of childhood and teenage innocence. "The Last Worthless Evening" is an easygoing Eagles-like ditty that, through its lyrics, perfectly captures the hardships of romance and remaining alone as one grows older. "New York Minute" is even more woeful. It begins with a starry-eyed string section and keyboards, which lead to Henley's grizzled voice singing about suicide, street violence and the precarious shortness of life. The somewhat haunting chorus of "New York Minute" is as beautifully harmonic as it gets, and ultimately, the song ends on a positive note, lyrically. Truly, it's one of the best songs Henley has ever been associated with, and that includes his work with The Eagles.Henley is also defiant and angry in spots. "How Bad do You Want it?," despite a cheesy sax, overly loud drums, hymnallike background vocals and a dark lingering synth, possesses genuine spirit that is commendable. Meanwhile, it's priceless to hear the thin voice of Axl Rose performing backing vocals on the somewhat forced "I Will Not Go Quietly," a song in which the pseudo-sounding metal bite is less than its valiantly attempted bark.Besides the gritty "If Dirt Were Dollars," the forced tunes leading up to the album's last track, "The Heart of the Matter," don't do a lot for me. But that's OK -- "Heart of the Matter" contains some of the best breakup lyrics ever written. Henley couldn't have written a better, more astute song, or chosen a more perfect tune to close out the CD."The End of the Innocence" may have a touch of radio-ready, late-1980s AOR gloss to it, but the songs are admittedly immediate and memorable. And, as mentioned, the four good songs on this album are better than just good; they're excellent.
I bought this compact disc twice without realizing my error. I liked this compact disc and when it was in audio cassette. I love the songs like the Heart of the Matter, the unforgettable New York Minute, and the classic End of the Innocence. I didn't like Shangri-La but this compilation of Don Henley's hits are worth the price if you buy it once or twice. It's still worth hearing again.
gza of the wu tang clan releases a classic hip hop album with bad ass beats courtesy of the reliable producer,rza of the wu tang.the lyrics are intelligent and complex.the album starts off with &quot;liquid swords&quot;,which has a continuous bass line and gutitar that makes it a favorite of the album.thats rza's secret,throwing in unexpected beats that make his style one of a kind in the rap scene.from guitars to piano and even bombs going off are used.as usual members of the wu tang clan guest appear making the album more enjoyable.especially on the song &quot;4th chamber&quot; where ghostface killa,rza,and killa priest get down.other great tracks are,&quot;duel of the iron mic&quot;,&quot;living in the world today&quot; and &quot;i gotcha back&quot;.an excellent album.
This album is deep the beats are ill, His lyrics are crazy. There are a few really good songs and some of them are now classics. 1)shadowboxing 2)dual of the iron mic 3)b.i.b.l.emy favorite track would have to be b.i.b.l.e b/c it's like religious and in order to understand it you have to be familar with the old testament,go buy it...
Gza is the most calm and probably least animated member of the Wu-Tang Clan. So don't go into this album expecting all-out head nodding beats and energy like on Wu-Tang albums. Gza is the most cerebral and lyrical member, as he recites his lyrics almost without emotion like he's reading them off a page. That can be a good or bad thing, but it's what sets him apart from other Wu members. He doesn't yell and get in your face, like say...Ol' Dirty.This "Liquid Swords" LP may be underwhelming when you first listen to it. However, it requires many listens to even halfway descipher what he, and other guest Wu members are saying. Rza amazes once again! His superb beats helped immensely to make this album so revered. The beats perfectly fit Gza's laid-back style. It doesn't seem like Gza's on this album all that much though. He features every Wu member(even Killah Priest) at least once, and the songs that he does solo were mostly two verses taking up two minutes or less in time. And the last track is so amazing too! Enlightening and empowering! The song really makes the album complete, and makes you want to bow down before the Genius until...wait, that's not even his song!!! It's Killah Priest on that track! Okay, well I guess Gza wasn't AS untouchable as I thought, but I'll say that he still does drop great material, and a bunch of other dope songs, on this LP. You just can't understand how mad and perplexed I was when I found out that "Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth" wasn't Gza's doing!This whole album may not have the energy of the "36 Chambers" album, but it definitely feels like a Wu-Tang album with Rza's beats and the skits and all. Every song is essential here, the only one I wasn't feelin' too much was "Killah Hills 10304," but I know that one appeals to other listeners. I would have to say that "B.I.B.L.E." is slightly my favorite here, even though it ain't Gza. Otherwise, my personal favorites are "Gold,"(with a 'golden' beat) "Cold World," "4th Chamber," "Investigative Reports," and "Swordsmen." The "4th Chamber" is an excellent collab with Ghostface, Killah Priest, and Rza(who drops an absolutely amazing verse). "Cold World" features Inspectah Deck and has appropriate singing. "Shadowboxin'" was cool too, but I would of liked to hear more from Gza and not so much Method Man. Every song on this album is quality though.I recommend this album to experienced Hiphop listeners out there, possibly even newcomers. It's a dark experience that just keeps growing on you the more and more you listen to it. I'm still catching new things as I listen, and it's been in my stereo for an extended amount of time. That's rare for me! I'm still trying to get over the fact that the last song was Killah Priest, not Gza, but I still give this one at least 4 stars! I think I'm going to check out a Killah Priest album before I buy another Gza joint however.
This is an incredibly fluid and swift album with incredible lyrical precision and RZA-freaked beats. How could you go wrong with album? This is not only one of the essential albums of the Wu-solo efforts, but it's also one of the essential hip hop albums of the '90s.
The Eagles' reunion, welcomed by most, shortcircuited the solo career Don Henley had to that point. With the Eagles, Henley played  southern California's John Lennon to Glenn Frey's poppy Paul McCartney; solo, he  delivered pointed observations on decaying morals and lifestyles while Frey  delivered drive-tape raveups like &quot;The Heat Is On.&quot;  (If the  call-girl expose' &quot;You'll Never Make Love In This Town Again&quot; is  to be believed, Henley knew that decadence first-hand.)With stellar  backup including members of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers, Toto, Bruce Hornsby  (on the gorgeous &quot;End of the Innocence&quot;)Sheryl Crow (her backup  vocals on the preposterous &quot;Garden of Allah&quot;) Take 6 and even  ex-Eagles, Henley guides us through a decade gone wrong. He spotlights ugly  Americans overseas (&quot;All She Wants To Do Is Dance&quot;), street crime  (&quot;New York Minute&quot;), insensitivity personal (&quot;The Last  Worthless Evening,&quot; &quot;Heart of the Matter&quot;) and  media-generated (&quot;Dirty Laundry,&quot;). Throughout, Henley writes  with character detail and empathy missing from Eagles' chestnuts like  &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Life In The Fast Lane.&quot; The two new  songs notwithstanding, &quot;Actual Miles&quot; serves as an audio photo  album through the decade of Gordon Gekko and Ollie North, and establishes  Henley in front of the drum kit as a first-rate singer-songwriter.
Despite the cynical (and hilarous) cover, this is really quite an adequate Greatest Hits albums. It includes almost all of the best songs from Don's solo career. I like Don Henley's music because he's honest, he's not fooling anybody, and he tells you what he really thinks in his songs, instead of just catering to the audience like so many others. This is rare in an artist today; you have to dig through an awful lot of boy bands and sell-outs to get to the Don Henleys, Roger Waters, and Bruce Springsteens. Anyway, this has most of Don's best songs that are both lyrically cynical and honest as well as still managing to be melodic. Dirty Laundry, The Boys of Summer, New York Minute, etc. are all great tracks, and The Heart of the Matter (one of my favorite ballads), The End of the Innocence, and others are flat out masterpieces. Buy this album if you want a good overview of Don's solo career, although it is missing a few songs, which is why I have it 4 stars instead of 5.
Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits being Henley's greatest hits compilation release 1995 and contains hits from 1982 to 1995. The album contains classic Henley tracks such as "The Boys of Summer", "Dirty Laundry", "The End of the Innocence" and "The Heart of The Matter".  The booklet is strange of used carsales man and I do not know what the point of this is. Only one track has the lyrics included but we do get linernotes written by Henley. We do get a list of the muisicians on each track but not what they play on each track. 4/5.
A missed track or two, but otherwise your basic &quot;best of&quot;. A good helping of songs from &quot;End of the Innocence&quot;, including the title track. Also important is &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, and &quot;Sunset Grill&quot;. My personal favorite would be &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; though. I just love the way that song starts out. His cover of Leonard Cohens &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; isn't bad, but it's hard to beat the original. The new songs are good, just not &quot;greatest hits&quot; good. The only thing that could make this any better, is if it was released in 2002 so it could include &quot;Everything is Different Now&quot; from &quot;Inside Job&quot;. That's his last greatest hit.
Well, my dragon escaped. Yes he did. This is what happens when your Metamorpho is called away to do publicity shots. I tell ya, that David Hemmings sure knows his way around a camera. Anyway, when I arrived home from London, I went to feed the dragon and found that he wasn't there. To my total chagrin, I realized he had pulled a Shawshank Redemption stunt on me. The evidence was there. Looks like he breathed fire on the stone to weaken it, and used his claws to create an escape hatch. Of course, I did not suspect anything. But what a clever dragon! Hiding the hole with a big poster of Playdragon of the Month over it!Anyway, I had a private investigator get on his tail immediately. I found out that he took the chunnel to France. From there, he puchased a used car from a salesman that looked like Don Henley. The authorities then contacted me and said they had him cornered in the Cave of Lascaux. Of course, by this time, the car salesman was looking for him too. I guess he didn't like being paid in Drachmas. But, I ask you folks, what other currency would a dragon carry?Anyway, on my trip through the Chunnel to fetch that snakey, surreptitious serpent (3 X fast people!), I started on this review of Don Henley's Greatest Hits called "Actual Miles". I wonder where that idea came from? Mental note to self: massive mental meditation (3 X fast again) needed.Mr. Henley, as we know, is no stranger to the pop-rock arena. And with all the hooks he employs here, he solidifies his status as a true craftsman. Well, what do you want people? If I had been an Eagle instead of a Seer, you'd be buying my music instead of me giving away free reviews! So have some respect, please!But, back to the point, this is a fine collection of music. Mind you, it is not perfect, but for the most part, it is well done. Most of the tunes here are taken from his first 3 solo albums, with the bulk of the material coming from "The End of the Innocence". As with Henley, and a box of chocolates, you'll never know what you'll get. He can give you social commentary with the looping organ parade in "Dirty Laundry", the mild suggestion of reconnection in "The Last Worthless Evening", the somber and sobering reality of "New York Minute". But, take heart! He also gives you many deadhead stickers on a cadillac (I have one!)in his megahit "The Boys of Summer" (listen for that almost imperceptible echo of the word "Crazy" on this). Also, a camraderie of good feelings down at the "Sunset Grill".The thing about his music is how effectively he marries the mood with the message. The hop-jump sound of "All She Wants to Do is Dance", totally makes sense, even as they drive poor Mr. Henley out of town. The semi-sweet piano of Bruce Hornsby is perfect for the breaking of fragile glass reality in "The End of the Innocence." Digging even deeper in the dust, Henley pulls out the crown jewel of all his songs with "The Heart of the Matter." What makes this such a remarkable achievement is that he sheds off all the illusionary garb that we all possess, and goes not only into the heart, but the soul of the matter. Knowing his own imperfection, and his own part in the matter, he reveals what is essential for any human failing. Forgiveness. But, not necessarily for her, but himself. That is the true value and insight this song brings to people who need to hear  it.Unfortunately, I could have thought of a lot of other, worthy songs to fill out this c.d. He includes 3 new recordings, which, although interesting, somehow don't seem to gel. I am sure some social commentary is behind "The Garden of Allah", but it has never intrigued me enough to find out just what. The sarcasm and bitterness of his composition "You Don't Know Me At All", and the defeatism of Leonard Cohen's "Everybody Knows" is just too blunt and doesn't let you leave with a good feeling.Henley's forte is to write a balance between wit, irony, lyrics and music to make the journey worthwhile, or somewhat relevant on many levels. For me, unfortunately, the songs sound dark and whining.In conclusion, a fine collection with a few drawbacks - thus the 4 star rating. Now, I better get back to business here. I am now outside the cave with the Henley look alike. He is lurking, leering, lambasting me (3 X fast people!) as I am trying to lure the dragon out of the cave. He's not happy, I'm not happy, and the dragon's not happy. But, be honest people. You're happy because I finally wrote this review! Don't be shy - admit it!Stop dragon my heart of the matter around --------- Metamorpho ;)
When The Eagles broke up in the 1980's, two members landed outstanding solo projects. One of them was Don Henley. Actual Miles blends all three of his studio albums, into one great package. The songs feature his hits Sunset Grill, and The Heart Of The Matter. It also features three new tracks.The Garden Of Allah, is the so-called sequel to Hotel California. I thought it was even more frightening and enjoyable, than its prequel. You Don't Know Me At All brings classic rock and excitement in its depths of hard core Henley fanatics. Everybody Knows is a remake of a Lenord Cohen tune. This song was off the 1995 album Tower Of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen.While fans still look foward to his songs with The Eagles, Don Henley proved to break down the walls, and tell haunting and understanding stories of pop music in each of our lives. It is not the end of the innocence. It still is continuing on.
I'm not really sure why I picked this up.  I already have 9 of the 12 songs on the original studio albums.  Only the big hit "Dirty Laundry" and the two new tracks "The Garden Of Allah" and "You Don't Know Me At All" are tracks I did not already own.  The two new tracks are both very good, with "The Garden Of Allah" particularly a standout track.  Henley plays the devil in modern day Los Angeles.  This is great stuff and an example of Henley at his best.  "You Don't Know Me At All" is another solid tune.  There is also a cover of "Everybody Knows" thrown on to the end of the album, although it does not appear on the back cover.  I don't know if this is worth buying for the new songs alone if you already have Henley's 3 studio discs up to this point in his career, but this is a nice compilation if you are just looking for an overview.
Shoulda included at least two of the following - "Johnny Can't Read", "I Can't Stand Still", "Drivin' With Your Eyes Closed", "If Dirt Were Dollars", and possibly "How Bad Do You Want It?"  Shoulda left out "I Will Not Go Quietly", a stupid funk-metal number I never heard on the radio which only seems to be included here because it's basically a duet with Axl Rose (and two more incompatible voices you will not find).  However, these missteps are more than made up for by the inclusion of "New York Minute", an absolutely beautiful ballad that most non-Henley fans didn't even know existed until the Eagles covered it for "Hell Freezes Over".  I'd have to say that the Eagles did it better with their perfect backing vocals and a great string section, but only marginally.  As for the two new songs, "The Garden of Allah", featuring Sheryl Crow prominently on background vocals, is a funky (but too long) commentary on THE story of 1995, the O.J. Simpson trial.  The highlight of the piece is the vocally-altered spoken-word commentary by "the devil".  The other new song, "You Don't Know Me", is kind of a throwaway (a ballad would've been a nice complement to "The Garden of Allah"), but doesn't detract from an otherwise decent compilation.
After the Eagles' first break-up, Don Henley and Glen Frey went right into solo-ville, and it was apparent who the Lennon and McCartney personalities in the band were. Frey exited straight to sappy love songs and high-energy/low-calorie rock, while Henley's first singles were the socially targeted "Johnny Can't Read" and "Dirty Laundry." While Frey had the first hits, it is Henley's solo albums that have stood the test of time.When his second solo album, "Building the Perfect Beast," was issued, there was an instant classic with "The Boys Of Summer." Written about those for whom life in the fast lane had become a driveway full of SUV's, it contained a bitter melancholy and the striking lyric "I saw a deadhead sticker on a Cadillac."  This was the kind of thoughtful rock that The Eagles occasionally slipped onto their albums, but in a more wizened and weathered point of view. "All She Wants to Do Is Dance" continued that social malaise, but the self-depreciating "Not Enough Love In The World" backtracked when it came to relationships."I'm not easy to live with,I know that it's true.You're no picnic either, baby.That's one of the thingsI love about you."Axl Rose, who was at his GnR finest even snarled along on "I Will Not Go Quietly." No saccharine here, folks. The followup album, "The End of the Innocence" is a masterpiece and much darker than "Beast." "New York Minute" follows urban violence while "Sunset Grill" chronicles urban decay from the first person. But the kicker was the title song, with the stately Bruce Hornsby piano line supporting a grown man's look back with longing. Not the usual longing, because the collapse comes from such issues as the lawyers who "dwell on small details since Daddy had to fly." It paints one of the most succinct picture of The Reagan Years in a small cluster of artists who tried. (Another favorite of that period, David + David's "Boomtown.") "Innocence" was such an amazing album that Henley took almost 15 years before he issued "Inside Job."The new songs are OK, no big deal really. There are a few MIA tracks, like "Johnny Can't Read" and Henley's version of "Sit Down You're Rocking The Boat." But that is a small complaint. With music as uniformly good as that on "Actual Miles," this is one late model CD that you will be fine with on your road trips.
Although &quot;Don't Speak&quot; was terribly overplayed on the airwaves, (so much so, that after a while I used to change the station whenever it came on) this album as a whole is excellent. I enjoy it more now than I did when it first came out. Gwen has a voice that is different from the run-of-the-mill girl vocalists these days. And the band is very talented, the songs are melodic with great riffs and hooks throughout. No Doubt are one of those bands that write, play and sing their own songs. True talent. The booklet contains all lyrics and lots of photos.
The best thing about this CD is that its original. If there are other bands like it I havent found them yet. Its cool.Still, at first I thought this CD was weird. I had to teach myself to like it. If you read my other reviews, youll see that this isnt like anything else I listen to, so thats part of the reason. I had to listen to this CD 3 or 4 times before I started enjoying it very much. I was used to headband music, and I had to learn that you get a different kind of enjoyment out of this CD. But I did learn to enjoy it. Gwen has a great voice, and the band itself is pretty talented. The songs are nothing really special, since they're usually cute love songs, but the lyrics are still usually clever, if not masterful. I like almost all the songs. Chances are you've heard Im Just a Girl. Not all the songs are like that, but thats pretty much what No Doubt is like. They're sort of punk, sort of reggae, sort of I dont even know. But they're cool. Bottom line:if you're a headbanger, dont touch. If you like punk or reggae with a different twist, buy it.
No Doubt is probably the best alternative band out there, with second runners up by Garbage. My favorite tracks listed on TRAGIC KINGDOM are &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Just A Girl&quot;, and &quot;Don't Speak&quot;. I could actually really care less for the other songs on this CD, but I still enjoy No Doubt which was the reason why I gave this 4 stars. Anyway, if you love bands like Garbage than you should definitely get TRAGIC KINGDOM. Also get RETURN OF SATURN, which is No Doubt's new CD-release. Highly recommended.
Some of you kids out there are not familiar with NO DOUBT. Its hard to believe, even you kids who are fans of the most recent GWEN STEFANI record, have no clue. At least not this album, which, is easy for me to say, the best record of her career.Ten years now, its been since this one got released, and man, did they stir up some pop radio waves. JUST A GIRL hit radios hard in late '95 early '96, when pop culture was undergoing serious changes. Rock and marijuana hip hop were on top still, but sugar pop and boy bands were coming up the ranks (we had no idea.) This song was very crazy sounding, a mix of ska, punk and pop. It was completley unique, and this is when most of us were introduced to that blonde firecracker, GWEN STEFANI. Sure she's still bangin', for sure, but back then this chick was part of the rock world, and was surely putting a young Wally Gator into a frenzy of hormonal insanity. I purchased this disc in 1996, and really enjoyed it. SPIDERWEBS is another song that rocks the pop envelope to the hilt. The rest of this album is well written and much more stripped than anything else that would follow. If you have never heard this gem and are a fan of GWEN you outta check it out, it will blow you away. The sound and feel of this album has never been matched by anyone, even that sweet chick who wrote it.
This is a really cool cd.  Very mellowed-out, seductive, chilled-out, whatever you want to call the style.  A great example of trip-hop/downtempo tunes, especially the title track and &quot;Heat Miser&quot; which are my favorites.  Recommended.
This second album from the pioneer group Massive Attack entitled "Protection" is a very good but also a very uneven album in it's own right but compared to their other stuff, "Protection" is an unfortunate victim to their later two albums "Mezzanine" and "100th Window" in my opinion.One thing that really stands out though is that this album has a very hazy summer evening kind of mood, kind of like those hazy sunsets: that's what the music on this album evokes. Most of this album is very lightweight compared to "Mezzanine" but on it's own "Protection" has plenty to offer.My favorite tracks are the title track, "Karmacoma" and "Weatherstorm".The title track is easily the best track on this entire album. This track to me is one of the best mid 1990s chill-out tracks featuring a very nice hip-hop beat, and Tracey Thorn's absolutely crystal clear vocals which dominate this track. Wow! She sounds absolutely incredible on this track. This album is worth buying just for the title track alone. "Karmacoma" is another favorite track of mines with an excellent blend of chill-out dance and some reggae elements. The somewhat subdued rapping is actually quite good.ALthough no bad songs by any stretch of the imagination, this album starts to kind of go all over the place and somewhat meander aimlessly in places."Weather Storm" is actually quite a fantastic and a great romantic relaxing song to listen to while basking in the sun on a summer evening but even though I really love this track, this one belongs on a smooth jazz Cd or on a smooth jazz station. I could actually recall hearing this on a smoothe jazz station one time a while back but had no idea that it was actually Massive Attack. But because I love smooth jazz, I actually enjoy this track but it feels way out of place on this album. Still "Weather Storm" is a great track and one of my favorites so it's completely forgiveable. It's just that "Weather Storm" felt like someone else's recording was accidentally put on this album. That's all.The album picks back up on "Spying Glass" which is a really cool trancy dance song with a slight reggae-ish edge to it and great, if somewhat, weird vocals by Andy.This CD starts to meander off from here forth. I actually found "Better Things" to be bland and unremarkable despite having the crystal clear vocals from Tracey Thorn. The beat is weak and the song feels unfinished almost like a demo tape. Still, not bad but nothing to write home about.Although the remaining tracks are enjoyable to an extent, they aren't a lot to write home about either. The live version of "Light My Fire" though is interesting.It's really ironic how this album showcased almost nothing of the darkness and dark inner psyche that would ultimately culminate in what I consider the greatest trip hop album of all time "Mezzanine" three years later."Protection" may be their weakest album but don't let the word "weakest" I typed here deter you from getting this album. Do not look for anything in the vein of "Mezzanine" nor "100th Window" but if you are willing to check it out on it's own merits, this album will be better than what most have made it out to be, perhaps even more than I have written it out to be.
&quot;Protection&quot; is another classic Massive Attack album that breaks the mold in what trip-hop/dub music is.  Not as strong as their debut &quot;Blue Lines&quot; or the phenomenal &quot;Mezzanine&quot;, &quot;Protection&quot; still impresses with its sinsiter grooves, nigh-disturbing lyrics and poignant vocals.
While &quot;Protection&quot; might not be as good as their first album &quot;Blue lines&quot; and a bit overshadowed by other albums it's far from a bad apple in any way, actually one of my favorites with a distance. It's a bit unever though, some songs are close to perfection but some feels forgettable by now. The first song, the title track &quot;Protection&quot; is sang by Tracy Thorn from &quot;Everything But the Girl&quot; it's this albums best song and was a hit back them aswell. Tracy's haunting lyrics and voice fits the hip hop beats and samples perfect. The hook is also memorably good. &quot;Karmacoma&quot; is the normal Horacy Andy trip hop with rapping. &quot;Three&quot; is rather odd, decent song sang by Nicolette but could have been better. &quot;Weather Storm&quot; is a song to remember since it's slow jazz, completely diffrent from the rest of the songs here, it really showed the many influents Massive got. &quot;Spying Glass&quot; is reggae. &quot;Better Things&quot; is another Tracy Thorn song, it sound like a train, it has good beats and beautiful sound. Defenitely one of the highlight to not miss out. &quot;Eurochild&quot; is yet another rap song. &quot;Sly&quot; is with Nicolette, beautiful sound. &quot;Heat Miser&quot; is another highlight, it starts with fast piano playing and the sound of someone breathing deep. It got this mysterious feeling, great for a horror movie. Those kind of song is partly what makes Massive so pleasant. The album closes with a live remake of the Doors &quot;Light My Fire&quot; quite allright actually. Overall this is a very good album, forgotten by many but it has many highlight's worth taking a look at. A very good variety of sound and genre's and many songs with the great mysterious Massive sound. Recommended for anyone that likes something diffrent.
Forever Your Girl by Paula Abdul is the ultimate pop dance album of the '80s. Paula's voice has never been strong but her delivery and execution of these songs is amazing. Songs like Knocked Out, Opposites Attract, The Way That You Love Me, Straight Up!, Forever Your Girl, and Cold Hearted were all hit songs and Paula's dance ability didn't hurt either thanks to her videos. Check this trip down memory lane cd out sometime!
Though Paula Abdul first gained notoriety for choreographing Janet Jackson's CONTROL videos, her debut FOREVER YOUR GIRL managed to thrust her into the pop stratosphere, firmly taking a place right next to...Janet Jackson. How's that for karma?  Of course, it helped that she was fully armed with an album full of strong dance-pop tunes--'Straight Up','Cold Hearted',and you know the rest. Even the non-singles here are terrific, particularly 'State Of Attraction' and 'I Need You'.  The only real sore point is the album's sole ballad 'Next To You', which did nothing but remind us that singing was never really Abdul's strong suit. Otherwise,this is a nice reminder of what an engaging and sincere performer Abdul was, and why current  pop princesses like Britney and Christina don't hold a candle  to our Paula.
There was a time when &quot;Paula Abdul&quot; was a cheerleader for the &quot;L.A. Lakers&quot;. There was also a time when she was as popular as &quot;Madonna&quot; and &quot;Janet Jackson&quot;, and that was because of &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;. The album was huge when it came out, and seemed to produce an endless supply of singles. Included is probably her biggest hit &quot;Straight Up&quot;, plus &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;, &quot;Cold Hearted&quot;, and &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;. All the other tracks are almost as good, and a favorite of mine is &quot;Next To You&quot;. She does actually have a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; out as well, and six of these songs are on that, plus &quot;Rush Rush&quot;, &quot;Promise Of A New Day&quot;, and others. It's too bad that now she's mostly known for judging &quot;American Idol&quot;. Some people will never know she used to make videos with animated cats.
I got this on tape about ten years ago, and I loved it then and I love it now(though I don't listen to it as much because I listen to my CDs). I like all the songs, though I don't like the versions of &quot;Forever Your  Girl&quot; and &quot;Cold Hearted&quot; that are on this CD. Get this if  you LOVE the music of the last two years of the decade('88 and '89).
I still like &quot;Forever Your Girl!&quot;  I still play it every year, namely during the summer!  I finally bought the CD in Atlanta in 2002 after 13 years of having the cassette.  This album set the tone for the dancing and choreography that dominated the next decade in videos and live performances.  It doesn't sound dated like some '80s albums--the music is heavy on the rhythms and the beats! Very fun, danceable, escapist and so very funky!!!!  I still love &quot;Knocked Out&quot;, &quot;Cold Hearted&quot;, &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;The Way That You Love Me&quot; and &quot;I Need You&quot;.  I like the other songs too like the ballad &quot;Next To You&quot;--it sounds very Atlanta-like in its landscapes.  I believe that it was the benchmark to what Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jennifer Lopez are doing now. Paula's voice is girlish and a little squeaky on some songs, but she did sound good on all of them. Janet Jackson was already hot too in '89-'90 (though Paula's album came out in June 1988), but Paula really gave Janet some stiff competition. Paula's recent judging on American Idol makes this album far more respectable now! Her recent visibility will make more people and newer listeners to buy this album.
Say what you will about Paula Abdul--she doesn't sing very well and her music is often derivative--but one thing is certain: she came out with some of the catchiest songs of the 1980s. This album has all the ingredients of a hit: sharp beats, slammin' grooves, and Abdul's whiny voice, which, in a strange way, sounds good.  Standouts include &quot;The Way That You Love Me,&quot; the Babyface-penned &quot;Knocked Out,&quot; and the memorable &quot;Cold Hearted.&quot;  In the age of pale imitators like Britney Spears, we need an artist like Abdul more badly now than ever.  She was never remembered as a &quot;deep&quot; artist like poseur Alanis Morrissette, but she delivered some well-crafted pop tunes in her day.
Sadly,Roy Orbison did not live to experience the success of this,his last,album. A heart attack claimed this talented musician's life in December 1988. He did live to experience the success of THE TRAVELING WILBURYS,VOL. 1,released two months earlier. The conception of the cover is weird. The title appears upside down and so is a copy of a photo of Orbison at the lower right. This album spawned two hits. YOU GOT IT,which was later covered by Bonnie Raitt for the 1994 movie &quot;Boys On The Side&quot;, and SHE'S A MYSTERY TO ME. A LOVE SO BEAUTIFUL,written by Orbison and his fellow Traveling Wilbury Jeff Lynne,was covered by Michael Bolton which was a hit for Bolton in 1995. All the other songs are pretty cool. I dedicate this album to the memory of Orbison.
Mystery Girl is an inconsistent CD, with a couple of -- for me -- very weak songs, In the Real World and A Love So Beautiful.  But while nothing matches his best work on Monument in the late fifties and early sixties, Roy's voice was still fabulous here, showing not a trace of age or doubt as he hits those wonderful high notes.  And some of the songs, particularly You Got It, Careless Heart, and the title cut, approach earlier classics like Pretty Woman and Only the Lonely.  The Comedians, written by Elvis Costello, is Running Scared with a different denouement.  The snare drum even sounds like RS.  And Windsurfer reminds me why Roy's music sometimes drew comparisons to opera.  Like opera, in this song he takes a centuries old helping of plot corniness -- guy can't get girl, so he dies for her -- and through some lovely music (OK, you don't get drums very often in opera), a chorus for witness, and, especially, his soaring tragic voice makes the cliche both moving and fresh again.
This was Roy Orbison's last album, which came out shortly after his death.  It went on to become his best selling album ever.  No doubt the publicity surrounding his death helped sales, but a lot of it had to do with "You Got It", which was Roy's last hit single.  "You Got It" is a great song, and there are several other fine songs here.  I especially like "She's a Mystery to Me" and "The Comedians".  This album makes a good final testament to the greatness of Roy Orbison.  Recommended to Roy's fans.
This was a great point in Roy Oribon's career b/c he was resurrected out of obscurity by his inclusion with the "Traveling Wilburys" supergroup.Back in the later 80's, all of the Traveling Wilburys had albums that came out at around the same time with each other of the friends helping each other out.If youy like the Traveling Wilburys (and who could not!) then you would have to enjoy this work. I think that Tom Petty, George Harrison and Roy all had their cds produced by former ELO frontman Jeff Lynne. This cd is an extention to Petty's "Full Moon Fever", Harrison's "Cloud Nine" and Lynne's "Armchair Theater".Of course, the trademark sound of Orbison's yearning vocals, twangy guitar, hook filled choruses and rockabilly themes are still there.Some highlights of the cd is the often heard "You got it", plus the gems of "Shes a mysrtery to me", "California Blue" and "Dream you". The rest of the songs are great and there is definitely no filler on this final tributory album.There are a lot of collaborations/assistance from other noted artists but, unlike the Santana nonsense ( I hate it and see it as a corporate raid into otherwise sacred rock music), the help is very subtle thereby preserving this as a true Orbison work.This cd has the essense of a true classic and should always remain timeless.
Maybe not so much now, but when this album came out Lenny was the man! If "5" isn't his most popular album, this is. The title track and video was everywhere, rightly so. I like the first two albums a bit more, but this is still solid. "Believe" was another cool single, and I really think "Heaven Help" is a smooth song. No hits in the back of this album, but I still think it's almost as strong as the first half. I think the following album Circus was good too, but this was so huge it made Circus seem like it failed. Anyway, groovy album man.
The only other album besides his previous MS that will stand tests of time. Slightly more consistent than before (keeping material solid the whole way through seems to be a problem for him) although perhaps lacking more of his best compositions, it is argued as the consummate classic rock borrower's finest assimilation.
to me this is his best album and where he was making a statement. the title  track alone  made him appear to be on to bigger and Brighter things. musically he continued what he had started on his first couple of albums and just fleshed it out more. he always wore his Influences  and Heroes on his sleeves left and right, however he was on point with this album.  this set has rare outtakes and interview and other rare things on it.  his music Collaborator  Craig Ross held it down on guitar and Cindy Blackmon threw down on drums. back then Lenny  had a tough band behind him. he started to find a groove on this album and while his 5th album blew him up, to me this is his best album and to me he never reached those heights of where he was going quite again, however this album worked real good for  him as a  Artist.
Are you gonna go my way was to me the album in which Lenny Kravitz finally  came into his own. Before this it seemed as thhough he was trying to hard  to be like his influences. Which isn't all bad except you really didn't get  a the entire picture as to who Leny Kravitz is. Was he trying to be a  modern day Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon or Curtis Mayfield or even Bob Marley.  I also think he took himself a little to seriously at times before this  album But on AYGGMY  you really can see where he really started to come  into his own musically. I mentioned the above names as influences that I  picked out from listening to this cd. The difference is that on AYGGMY  Lenny seems more confident in his own talents and only allows the  influences to guide him musically instead of trying to copy them.  The  title track is simply a good ol' fashioned fun rock song. It simply rocks  and knows it. It's loud and arrogant. It screams to be turned up to a high  volume. Very hendrix-like circa are you experienced. Suprisingly AYGGMY is  musically funky cuts like come on love me ,black girl and sugar sound like  they could've been done by Curtis Mayfield. The ballads; believe, Heaven  help me and sister are suprisingly very well written and very good songs  that  have meaning to them. Even  the last track eleutheria which sounds  like a reggae experiment works. Overall AYGGMY is a great rock/funk album.  it works because Lenny Kravitz finally lets loose and controls ihis musical  influences instead of letting them control him.
&quot;Ultra&quot; is the difficult album that Depeche Mode made after the drug-addiction period that lead singer Dave Gahan went through and the absence of former band member Alan Wilder. Despite the changes that the band suffered, this is still a great return and a very worthwile record, focusing the group in an exciting creative moment.&quot;Ultra&quot; has a dark, contemplative, nocturne feel to it, presenting deep and complex songs that may take awhile to get into. Gahan`s vocals are better than ever, the electronic elements are contemporany without being too edgy and are not used in a way that makes them the dominant component of the songs. Most of the moments here are obscure and atmospheric ballads with powerful, creative songwriting and mature lyrics. The singles &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot; are three of the best pieces of the album, an example of the band`s strenght and genious. All in all, this is one of Depeche Mode`s best records, and that is saying a lot. Impressive and addictive.
It's something of a miracle that Depeche Mode's 1997 album even saw the light of day.  Since their misguided 1993 release "Songs of Faith of Devotion," the group lost key musician Alan Wilder, and singer David Gahan had a very public meltdown and battle with drugs.  Impressively, Gahan was able to clean up his act and reunite with Martin Gore and David Fletcher for "Ultra," which finds the Mode returning to their synth roots after they tried (and failed) to be a rock band on "Songs of Faith and Devotion."  Yeah, guitars pop up here and there, but this is an electronic album all the way.  The album's best cut is easily the single "It's No Good," which features rubbery, agressive bass set to Gahan's trademark moan.  "Useless" has funky drums, abrasive guitars, and bleeping synths.  A favorite track, "Sister of Night," is a near-ambient gem that radiates in its quiet beauty.  Gore hasn't lost his touch as a songwriter, and he comes up with lyrics that reflect Gahan's personal tribulations in the single "Barrel of a Gun," which vaguely refers to his battle with drugs.  "Ultra" isn't one of my very favorite Depeche Mode albums, but it's an impressive return to the spotlight considering the hurdles this trio faced during its making.
This album seems like an album people both love and hate. For me, I am closer to the love side, but then again, it's DM, and some of these tracks make the album more than worth owning. Martin sometimes sings on some of the weaker tracks, but not on this album. His two tracks are some of the strongest on the album. The only thing that brings the album down a little bit is that the instrumentals don't really do much, even the closing (unlisted) "Junior Painkiller." It has my favorite DM song, "Freestate," which has this kind of worldly and trippy feel, and shows a great maturity of the band. I think I prefer "Violator" and "Songs of Faith and Devotion", but as it stands, those are my two favorite DM albums (but I also like a few others more). While it may not have the kind of lively energy that made everything from "Black Celebration" to "Songs" great, it works perfectly fine on this record. Some mourn the loss of Alan, but for me, this group never put anything bad, and while I feel he is what turned DM into a great band, I wouldn't disregard everything else in particular. Totally worth a listen.
This is one of those ominous recordings that manages to somehow steal the spotlight away from some of the more in depth work of the artist due to this album's attempt at "getting everything right". Don't ask me to explain what that means, all I know is that there are many albums that achieve legendary status due to their pitch perfect recipe that delivers all of the prescribed ingrediants in the right order. Somehow that formula for sucess yielded many jazz classics, but overshadowed more personal, detailed work. This applies to most artists then, and as a general forwarning into gageing many composer's true strengths when it comes to buying most recommended titles. They are often ideal first purchases when discovering someone, but usually misleading as well.This album itself is perhaps 1/2 dominated by the man of the hour, giving way to yes..some brilliant corners. There are some amazing musical concepts going on brought on  undoubtedly by a total collaboration at times with some pretty free form plotting by all players. As exciting as some of the swingin tunes can be, the problem of overshadowing genius cannot be remedied when tunes like "I surrender Dear" are played, the depth of that writing on display towers over the majority of the disc's mood of playfullness.  Nonetheless, this is one of his more popular albums for a reason, each track on this album has stood the test of time and will continue to represent such a special hybrid of piano induced, frenzied yet organized beauty in it's 5 eclectic compositions that go everywhere from avant garde to ballad to bee bop to solo.
A good place to start if you are not terribly familiar with Sonny Rollins.  It was nice to see this disc showcased on Ken Burns' &quot;Jazz&quot; special on PBS last year.  Some argue this is not Sonny's best work, but it seems to be one of his best known works.  The opening track has a great ambiance to it and &quot;Strode Rode&quot; is also a great piece of work.  Nothing weak on this album-it's all good.  Recommended.

"Toni Braxton", an eponymous debut of one of the sultriest (and prettiest) popstars of the day, is one of the defining albums of the mid-1990's -- the era when charts and radio were ruled by tracks penned and produced by Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds.Together with soundtrack to "Waiting to Exhale" film and TLC's sophomore effort "CrazySexyCool", Toni's first full-length album perhaps is best in capturing the smoothness and class of Babyface-handed music (here aided especially by Antonio "L.A" Reid).The best three cuts are the first three, Toni's breakthrough "Another Sad Love Song", tender ballad "Breathe Again" and more than six minutes' long jam "Seven Whole Days" -- all three boast splendid arrangements. Then the quality of songs somewhat drops and gets higher with track number 7, "Love Shoulda Brought You Home" from 1992 movie "The Boomerang". Again a typical Babyface composition, as well as "You Mean The World To Me", which followed "Another Sad Love Song" and "Breathe Again" as the third single from this album."I Belong To You" was the fourth single, appearing in late 1994, and the radio remix edit was definitely better than the album version. Conversely, "How Many Ways" original version appearing here is better-done than R. Kelly remix from 1995.The album is wrapped up by Toni's own song "Best Friend". The European version of this CD also contains a mix of Braxton's first hit ever, the Babyface duet "Give You My Heart", also from the "Boomerang."The album had not that big chart success as it would deserve, especially because of its timing -- released in fall of 1993, it could not compete too well on the charts with Mariah Carey's "Music Box" and Janet Jackson's "janet." However, its quality is undeniable.Not a groundbreaker, but surely a fair shot. If someone once asks you what was like to turn a radio on in mid-1990's, play this CD to him.
Toni Braxton is super sexy and with an equally seductive voice. Her debut was a perfect introduction to the R&B; world. While I think Secrets is her best work Toni Braxton is also impressive.Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again are super hits. Enough said. Love Affair, Seven Whole Days, Love Shoulda Brought you Home and my fav You Mean the World to Me are all highlights.The reason I rated this 4 stars is the other songs are okay I guess but I usually skip. The Cd can get moody and depressing without a true uptempo song.If your looking for Classic Toni look at Secrets!
What a good album. "Another Sad Love Song" is upbeat while "Breathe Again" is sensuous and cherubic. "Seven Whole Days" is for people who miss their special partner. There are 5 singles from Toni Braxton's debut! "Love Affair" has a nice beat. "Candlelight" is breathtaking. "Spending My Time With You" is energetic. "Love Shoulda Brought You Home" has great piano. "I Belong To You" sounds merry. "How Many Ways" brings up the idea of different love techniques. "You Mean The World To Me" is fantastic but serious. "Best Friend" is a slow jam with piano. Enough said.
When her debut album was released, Toni Braxton was heralded as the next big thing in black pop. Strikingly attractive with a sassy short hairdo and a soulfully deep voice, the public was introduced to her with a duet she did with Babyface for the Boomerang Soundtrack.Very soon, she broke the Top 40, and her proper debut single Another Sad Love Song also took a big jump on the singles chart, make top 10 and was certified gold. Her star then rose and she scored the platinum-selling #3 hit Breathe Again, which ibn my opinion, is her best single ever and a classic soulful song. She scored one more Top 10 with You Mean The World To Me before releasing the last double A-side single How Many Ways/I Belong To You.A classic debut that introduced a pretty face and soulful voice that was somewhat different from many others. A slew of songs that were written by various people and helmed by then R&amp;B masteros Babyface, LA Reid and Daryl Simmons, the Stock-Aitken-Waterman of R&amp;B.Unfortunately, Braxton felt prey to commercialism and the tempations of being routine with her second album onwards, doin' herself injustice by recording songs by Diane Warren. It really spelt the end of what was to be an amazing career. One bankruptcy later, Braxton was less able to reclaim her lost crown years later.Nonetheless, this album is one hell of a good debut for the 90's.
Toni Braxton burst onto the music scene with the smoldering debut LOVE SHOULDA BROUGHT YOU HOME from the Boomerang soundtrack.  I love the story of how she got her shot in the business - this song was originally presented to Anita Baker who passed but suggested that the woman who sang the demo (Toni) sing the actual song! Toni got the shot and the rest is history as they say.This album was a very successful debut earning Toni multiple top ten r&b; hits and subsequently grammies & other awards.  The most wonderful thing about this collection is the collaboration between the singer and the writers/producers, LA & Babyface.  All were definitely in the creative zone when this debut was put together because virtually every song was a hit but moreso, timeless since I still have this disc in heavy rotation.I've continued to buy her albums because she is one of the most distinctly unique vocalists still in the business who when given excellent material turns it out!  Of the 12 tracks there are only 2 that I think are just ok and don't listen to frequently, CANDLELIGHT & LOVE AFFAIR.  And of the others my favorites are: BREATHE AGAIN, YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME, BEST FRIEND, SEVEN WHOLE DAYS, HOW MANY WAYS & LOVE SHOULDA BROUGHT YOU HOME.I'd highly recommend this cd as one of the best debuts by an r&b; female vocalist from that era because it still stands the test of time.
Once upon a time, L.A. Reid and Babyface wrote a song for the &quot;Boomerang&quot; soundtrack titled &quot;Love Shoulda Brought You Home,&quot; intended for Anita Baker.  Schedules didn't match up, however,  and the tune was instead handed to LaFace's recent discovery, Toni Braxton.  Newcomer Braxton had some large shoes to fill indeed, but as it turned  out, her ashen alto fit the blue, done-wrong-by-love lyrics to a T, and an  R&amp;B hit was launched.  Will an entire project from a newcomer live up  to such success?Hell yes, and then some.  Toni's self-titled debut  reached out and touched not only R&amp;B audiences but pop fans as well,  with her heartfelt renditions of love's torments having the strongest  effect.  &quot;Another Sad Love Song&quot; is a woeful tale of a girl who  can't even turn on the radio without being haunted by the one that got  away, and &quot;Breathe Again&quot; finds our heroine resigning herself to  life being all but over once her love affair is.  These songs, laid over  hip-hop and pop grooves respectively, have a melancholy element of blues  riding underneath; &quot;Seven Whole Days,&quot; however, is borderline  jazz in both musical backdrop and vocal delivery.As on almost anyone's  debut, Toni's steps toward artistic self-discovery occasionally stumble:  &quot;Love Affair&quot; is too similar to &quot;Seven Whole Days&quot;  stylistically, and &quot;Days&quot; never suffers from too-hip lyrics like  &quot;I ain't down with O.P.P.,&quot; the likes of which are destined to  sound drastically dated down the line.  Furthermore, &quot;Best  Friend&quot; features a sleepily predictable chord progression and lyrics  about losing a lover to a best friend that are more melodrama than drama.  Still, Toni proves that she can hang loose with the best of them &quot;How  Many Ways,&quot; a driving ballad that Mary J. Blige would no doubt love to  sink her teeth into, and even keeps up with a danceable groove on &quot;I  Belong to You.&quot;Flaunting a maturity and intimacy that some of her  later work wasn't privvy to, Toni Braxton's self-titled debut remains a  significant effort in modern R&amp;B.
Since Laface Records started in the early 1990's, very few artists made a mainstream cross into the music industry. The first was TLC, and the second was Toni Braxton. Although Toni was the first to be signed to Laface, her music charted a whole new view of women in R&B; music.Toni's 1993 self-titled debut album, recieved a glowing firestorm of critical reviews that were just shocking. Everybody wanted to go Toni's way. The music was a batch of smooth R&B;, Hip Hop, and a dash of Adult Contemporary. From Breathe Again, to Another Sad Love Song, all the way back and forth to You Mean The World To Me, it was a landmark album. At the time, many fans were looking for another Whitney Houston. Houston was starting her movie blaze with The Bodyguard, and rocketed all the way up. As for Toni Braxton, her grooves just started to get it on.Although Toni bloomed further with her other albums, Secrets and The Heat, the album still continues to inspire true female R&B; diva, and that isn't another sad love song.
This is the debut from Toni Braxton, a daughter of a fundamentalist preacher.  Truth be told, Braxton's rise to fame happened by accident.  Producers LA Reid and Babyface gave her the song that was rejected by Anita Baker but would later appear on the soundtrack to &quot;Boomerang&quot;: &quot;Love Shoulda Brought You Home.&quot;  This smoothed-out ballad put Braxton on the map, and soon after her debut album surfaced.  It's a fine collection of mid-tempo numbers and sap-free ballads.  &quot;Breathe Again&quot; is one of Babyface's most inspired songs, and Braxton's gusty voice gives it the urgency it demands.  She succeeds similarly in &quot;You Mean the World to Me&quot; and &quot;Seven Whole Days.&quot;  But my two songs of choice are the perky love ditty &quot;I Belong to You&quot; and the very popular mid-tempo &quot;Another Sad Love Song.&quot;  This album went on to sell millions and established Braxton as a multiplatinum r&amp;b singer.  A promising debut that will make a nice addition to your collection.
Before Andre 3000 and Big Boi were world-famous multi-platinum recording artists, they were a couple of teenagers making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik.  This was before they were taking listeners on journeys of the mind with "Aquemini" and even before their UFO sounds of "ATLiens".  No, they were just another couple of rappers, rhymin' about smokin' weed, ridin' in Cadillacs, pimpin', and not much else.  And did they ever do it well!"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik" is for the hip-hop fans who love beats.  That's what this album is all about.  Beats, beats, and more beats.  Lil' Jon should be taking lessons from Organized Noize, the production team in charge of the beats on this album.  Go to any track (except for a skit), and you'll notice how ill the beat is.  The only thing that makes those beats better are the two dope MC's riding that beat.  You know who I mean.  Dre and Big Boi, right out of high school on this album, drop down-south classics like the pimped-out "Player's Ball", the title track, "Ain't No Thang", and "Crumblin' Erb".While all the songs are more than solid, there's one song on this album that stands out above the rest.  "Git Up, Git Out" featuring Cee-Lo and Big Gipp of Goodie Mob rip it up with Outkast on this mid-tempo classic about doin' something with your life.  The lyrics on that joint couldn't get better, and Cee-Lo's verse is one of the best hip-hop verses I have ever heard.The only complaints I have with this album is the overall raw-ness Outkast displays.  Some of the songs sound alike, which isn't a bad thing most of the time, but it would be nice to see a little more variety on this album.  Although they sound almost the same, "Hootie Hoo" and "D.E.E.P." are both excellent songs with bangin' beats.If you like your hip-hop raw, with slick flows and beats that make you wanna roll down your windows and play them really loud in your car, then "Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik" is definitely for you.  But if you only jumped on the Outkast bandwagon in the past year, then you might want to pass on this one, and get "Aquemini" instead.  I know I'M "Outkast-ed" after listening to this album.
Two words: LaFace Records.  Do they put out junk?  No.  Outkast is the first hip-hop group that has the LaFace stamp and they made sure their ducks were in a row.  Style, presence, mood, and attitude of the dirty  south represented by two lyrical showmen.  Southern hip-hopper's take heed.  This should set the standard.
A bit more of a stereotypical rap album than the group's later work, which is probably why I didn't like it much the first time I heard it. I'm not a fan of stereotypical G-Funk, see, and that's all I heard in it the first time through. God, was I wrong. It's deeper than that, even though it's not fully immersed in the "alternative" thing yet. So even the more "playa-business" oriented tracks - "Ain't No Thang," "Myintrotoletuknow," "Call of Da Wild," "Claimin' True," "Crumblin' Erb," "D.E.E.P." - has OutKast's trademark dark, quirky, layered production. And the classic songs kick as much butt as the best of OutKast's later albums do. The title track is a condensed Isaac Hayes epic with hip-hop beats; breakthrough hit "Player's Ball" has a great rolling beat, charismatic rapping, and a brilliant falsetto chorus; "Funky Ride" is laid-back and has a gorgeous psychedelic guitar solo; the lengthy "Get Up, Get Out" is a bit preachy but has a solid chorus and fantastic guitar parts; other than its annoying intro, "Hootie Hoo" is dark and creepy, with more sweet beats. So the only real problem I have with this, other than its less creative nature than future albums (which makes sense, because it was a debut) and the skits (which are dumb), is the general "sameyness" of the whole thing. Outside of the five tracks I mentioned as classics, everything on this album sounds the same. Now, I like the sound it's got going for it, so it's not too bad, but a bit of diversity would've been appreciated. It makes the album exhausting. Oh well, still great, though not as great as the next three.
This album is amazing for a debut and also is impressive considering the fact that Andre and Big Boi were practically teenagers when they made it. It's a lot grittier than the Outkast albums to follow it; the lyrics are basically the duo talking about how they grew up, what street life is like, and what they learned. Even though that's the main topic matter, Outkast makes a point of showing their intellect and they explain how certain aspects of thug mentality are negative. They try to incorporate a backbone of rising above the hood and looking for a brighter future.The beats are very funky with that G-Funk lean that reminds me of Dr. Dre or Snoop fused with a jazzy Funkadelic type sound almost. There's also some guitar and other instrumentation that you wouldn't expect to find on a rap album.The interludes are what they are, I can take or leave them. There are a couple songs that don't hold up as strong as they could ("Call of Da Wild", "Claimin True", "Funky Ride"), but all in all Andre and Big Boi are in top form here. They lay down their rhymes with passion and it almost sounds effortless when they're on the mic. The members of Organized Noise (the crew that they founded that includes Goodie Mob), do a decent job when they guest on their spots but they never out-do Outkast themselves.I've never heard the guys speak out so much on social issues and they do it in a way that makes you think; they're introducing themselves to the world basically saying that they came up from a hard place but don't judge them because they are intelligent and have lots to offer the world.I wanna give this 5 stars but I cant because of the interludes and the couple songs that don't come together completely. This group would go on to outdo this album but I definitely don't think it should be overlooked.For newer fans of Outkast, you may not remember or even like the old days when 2pac was popular and Wu-Tang had just dropped their first album, but if you give this album a chance I definitely think you'll find some songs here you'll appreciate (might even end up loving the whole thing).For old Outkast fans, you definitely hafta pick this up if you own "ATliens" or "Aquemini". Don't even think, just buy it.
Highlights are You're Making Me High, Talking In His Sleep, Find Me A Man, Let It Flow, Why Should I Care, Come On Over Here and I Love Me Some Him.Filler? Not a lot, but Un-break My Heart comes close and In The Late Of Night/Toni's Secrets is OK and nothing to speak of. So I guess that means no filler! ^_^;;Cover Art: A-Songwriting: B+Vocals: B-Vocal Emotion: A-Production: B+Overall: 4.3754.375 = 4.384.38 stars.
Toni Braxton,by all measures has a terrific instrument because that's what she has for a voice! Okay I'll admit;sometimes she does venture a bit heavy into that torchy,melodramatic Whitney Houston/Celine Dion territory but somehow,here Babyface got it right production wise. These are two people who both have that torchy quality and for both it could end up with mixed results. I always rather liked Toni,and when I couldn't I tried but Babyface was not someone I was too into musically at the time. Same thing goes for today. It's also true that the LA Reid/Babyface sound that could get tired fast is all over this album. There aren't many uptempo cuts here because the focus is always strongly on the ballads. "Unbreak My Heart" is a good example of the sound of most of the songs here. Which also brings to mind another point about this album. Not that it isn't a big part of romantic soul anyway so much of this album finds the vocally gifted Braxton lamenting on how one man did her wrong after another and than her recovering from the experience. It seems like and endless cycle but the funny thing is her tone is never whinney;it's actually quite bitter and resined in most places. On the upside much of the material such as "I Don't Want To" actually have a good,potent blend of acoustic soul and this orchestral R&B thing. And it doesn't matter what other reviewers say:as R Kelly's only contribution it's very vital and significant to this albums theme.Otherwise this is maudlin and a bit to big sounding in many places but it's a refreshing change of pace from some of the blandness that even this production team who,I'll admit seldom fare poorly on the songwriting front,were often bogged down with. There are some significant changes of pace though. The Tony Rich penned opener "Come On Over Here" presents a nice 90's style variation on the soul/funk front and on an uptempo type of song. "You're Makin' Me High" is rhythmic and acoustic-just a tad of that Babyface blandness is present but for the most part even he manages to work around that here. "Talking In His Sleep" is a really great jazzy funk number. No this album is not all it could've been or,more subjectively everything I'd have liked it to be-I don't think it's time frame really allowed for that. At the same time I would say for those looking to have some Toni Braxton in their collection this would be pretty close to a wise bet for making that happen.
If you can...tell anyone you know about this CD!Toni has outdone herself: most of the tracks produced by Babyface (including the Summer 1996 # 1 hit YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH), but with support from David Foster (UN-BREAK MY HEART, written by Diane Warren and one of the best selling singles ever...), R. Kelly (I DON'T WANT TO), Soulshock &amp; Carlin (I LOVE ME SOME HIM, extra nice tune to me...) and Toni Rich Project (COME ON OVER HERE).Add some studio help from Keny G. and a soundtrack tune (LET IT FLOW, from WAITING TO EXHALE), and the 3 bonus remixes of all of the singles off the CD - including the dancefloor anthem for UN-BREAK MY HEART...You will come up with one of the best R'n'B albums ever
Toni's sophomore set continued her progression from an excellent debut.  This is a strong collection of songs where Toni's vocal phrasings and the song melodies are beautiful from one track to the next.  On the Babyface productions, it's like he & Toni are both halves of one brain - and although more Adult Contemporary than straight R&B;, the songs are still memorable, melodic and beautiful.I saw Toni on a commercial recently which prompted my little Toni-athon and rediscovered singles that I hadn't listened to in a while: THERE'S NO ME WITHOUT YOU, WHY SHOULD I CARE, IN THE LATE OF NIGHT and FIND ME A MAN in addition to the "hits" that I love: LET IT FLOW, I LOVE ME SOME HIM, UNBREAK MY HEART & YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH.Overall this is a great second offering from one of my favorite vocalists who we need to hear more new music from!  Please come back soon, Toni!
When any artist's first album is so on fire as Toni Braxton's debut was, it's a pretty safe assumption that subsequent releases will have a hard time living up to it, and that, to a moderate extent, is the case here. She still had some fire left in her, as evidenced on the hip-hoppish but respectable hit "You're Makin' Me High" and the emotional ballad "Unbreak My Heart". Also good are the ballad "Let It Flow" and the sultry, teasing ditty "Talking In His Sleep." Unfortunately, before she had a chance to make a third album, the bankruptcy set in, and since then she has been just a shell of her former self on every album she's made after this one.
After a sultry and stylish debut album that helped earn her a Best New Artist Grammy, Toni Braxton steps up to the follow-up plate and hits anything but a sophomore slump.  Full of warm musical backdrops and Toni's  trademark sexy alto, &quot;Secrets&quot; lives up to the expectations her  debut set in place.Every now and again you'll find a singer whose  interpretative gifts mesh perfectly with the producer or songwriter at  hand.  Such magic can be found when Toni takes on one of Babyface's  acoustic-based, almost-folky pop tunes.  &quot;Let it Flow,&quot;  &quot;There's No Me Without You,&quot; and &quot;Why Should I Care&quot;  are all gorgeous ballads with acoustic guitars in the forefront and the  heat set on slow-burn, and Toni more than rises to the challenge.  Of  course, these songs were all solely written and produced by Babyface, so  the argument may be made that the artistic vision isn't truly Toni's.  The  final audio result, however, is truly fantastic.Unfortunately, R. Kelly  doesn't serve Braxton as well; Babyface and Toni often seem two halves of  the same whole, while R. Kelly's composition &quot;I Don't Want To,&quot;  which he also produced, merely sounds like Toni singing along to an R.  Kelly karaoke tape.  And even Babyface can fall short now and then, proven  on the sleepy ballad appropriately titled &quot;In the Late of Night.&quot;  &quot;Unbreak My Heart,&quot; however, is one of the rare moments in  R&amp;B that manages to build a bridge to pop and still maintain soul in  the recording.  No shock that this soaring ballad sealed Toni's  then-pending true crossover success.Even more of a payoff comes when  Toni tries something new, as is found on &quot;You're Makin Me High,&quot;  a hardcore-esque number that boasts lyrics as hard as its groove, and  &quot;Talking in My Sleep,&quot; a scorcher of a ballad that finds Toni  purring her verses in spoken word form.  But the main focus here is on  achieving classic, romantic soul moments, and in that sense Toni Braxton's  &quot;Secrets&quot; is a home-run.
Toni has the pipes and has had a resurgence with her show with sisters and that is great as she is a great entertainer and performer...this album is smooth, shows her voice.
I have lots of CDs and Toni Braxton is one of the few artists who always has a good CD, and "Secrets" is no exception.  "Secrets" is definitely some of Toni's best work and is already a huge success.  The album includes the hit singles "I Love Me Some Him", "Unbreak My Heart", "Let it Flow", and "You're Makin' Me High".This album is mostly mid-tempoed songs.  There are lots of ballads as well.  There are no really fast songs on the CD.  Toni shows a farily angry side of herself on this CD.  She called it "Secrets" because its about finding things about your man you didn't know, like the fact that he was cheating.  "Talking in his Sleep" is a song many women can relate to.  Toni basically talks on this track, but it's a good song.  Toni includes the fun songs "You're Makin' Me High", "Come on Over Here" and "I Love Me Some Him".  "Let it Flow" is one of my favorite Toni songs of all time.  The songs message is if a man brings you pain, don't be afraid to leave him, because you will be OK.  Toni did a really nice job on this song. I love it.  Toni also includes "There's no Me Without You", whch is about a woman who is way too deep in love with a man, and if he leaves her, there's no point for her to even exist.  The song's message is deep and most people have been through that in their lives.Toni Braxton explored different moods on this CD.  All of Toni's CDs are a must for any R&B; lover.

Toni Braxton waited 3 years to release her sophomore effort, Secrets, which follows the same formula as its predecessor while managing to sound fresh and new. The big ballad "Un-break My Heart" is the obvious smash hit, but other classics include the sultry "You're Makin' Me High" and the relaxing "Let it Flow." Smooth album cuts like "Why Should I Care" and "Come on Over Here" ensure that the album moves with a soulful, slow-burn feel from beginning to end. Secrets is the rare sophomore album that outdoes the artist's debut. 4 Stars.
If you want an album to share with your love one?, well here it is, Secrets by Miss Braxton is one of the sexiest album ever!, if you don't believe please listen to this sensual tracks "You're Making Me High" & "Talking In His Sleep", in this tracks Toni invites you to take a further step on love, and make it enjoyable...wow, one of the things that Secrets offers their fan followers is bittersweet ballads that sound timeless like "Un-Break My Heart" no wonder that song spent 11 weeks on the number 1 spot back in 1996.  The R&B area is not forgotten here "I Love Me Some Him", what a song, this album covers love at the maximum, why the rate is not 5 stars, well there are some cuts that I personally don't like, "How Could An Angel Break My Heart?" wich even though I ditch, was an international hit. This is a total classic album, sadly the cover is poorly well done.
All Most of this abum is balled orientated you have to say that Tony does them all justice.  The opening track Come On Over Here is just a little taster for what is about to unfold.  The album contains the hit singles, You're making Me High, Un-break My Heart, How Could An Angel Break My Heart and I Dont Want To, its easy to see why Tony has build up an impressive fan base so quickly.
Another jammin release from Miss Toni.  I heard this cd after the fact but it still translates into a good album (although I wish there were more up tempo songs on it).  My faves are "Come On Over Here", "Talking In His Sleep", and "In The Late Of Night".  This is a good, romantic cd to play in the background for ambiance.
With their eccentric style and originality,  Outkast has set the standard for southern rap. PERIOD!  Welcome to their urban realm.  It's one hell of a ride, and you love every freakin' second.
All the songs are good but to me the clear stand out track is 'Atliens'.The rest sound very similar because the beats are very basic but overall production is good.Good lyrics, no gangster rap here.But, I can't help but wonder how much more I would've liked it if I had got it 15 years earlier when it was fresh.
yeah it's good.  i wish i had a nice sub so i could say it put the fonk in the tronk.  nevertheless, i can imagine.  p.s. if you're looking for hey ya you've got the wrong album mister.
I like this, but it is not a southernplaya.....  It's hot and a must have if you like the OLDSCHOOL OutKast.  Not this Roses, Prototype bullcrap they got out now.
Before I start my review, let me you know something. I'm not one of those people who prases Tupac like he's some kind of god or something. I understand he was highly talented and everything, but to me he was just another emcee, just like everyone else. Also I don't put him into comparison with people like Malcom X and Dr. Martin Luther King, because those people are in a whole another league than Tupac Shakur was. I know that sounds a little ignorant, because I don't believe whatever you want me to believe in, but that is how I see him, a highly talented emcee, and thats it. For you people who can't accept the fact on the comment I just made and cannot accept my rating, just click the "No" button at the bottom and save yourself some time.*You can take the previous statement however you want*Anyway here is my review:Pac was a big name back in 1996. Everybody knew who he was, and what he was all about. Around that time, he was also facing some huge problems, aside from the beef with Notorious BIG. When he got into the studio, recorded and released "All Eyez On Me" that became a huge multi-platnum selling album. I didn't get a chance to hear this until about 5 years ago, and hearing this album was so refreshing to my ears.Disc One was more of the commercial side of Pac. Most of his songs were shooting for mainstream status, with well success. The biggest Pac hit he had was "California Love" with Dr. Dre. (still sampling Roger Toutman) Now the album has the remix with a more relaxed west coast style beat, than the one many people are familiar with (even though there was a video for both songs). Aside from that, one of my favorite joints is "How Do You Want It" with Jodeci. The disc will also contain most of his other hit songs from the album: "It's All About U", "I Ain't Mad At Cha" (a different version with the same beat is on the video), and "2 Of Amerika's Most Wanted". Some of the guests would shine on here also. The Dogg Pound and Redman and Method Man would join in for the song "I Got My Mind Made Up". Speaking of Method Man, parts of his song "Bring The Pain" would be the hook for Pac's song "Bring The Pain" with more of a gangstafied feel.Disc Two had a little gangstafied style to the album. A highlight would be the song "Wonder Why They Call U B***h" dedicated to many women who go around hanging out with guys for sexual activities. It feels like Pac switched styles when he hit the second disc on this album, because this mood is more different than the first disc. Another song that I like is "Check Out Time", as well as the gangsta love type track "Run The Streets". Production is pretty straight. Guest appearances are okay on this disc. Kurupt and everyone who appears on "It Ain't Hard 2 Find" with E-40 and more are pretty dope. Some of the no names on this album like Big Syke aren't as good (listen to "All Eyez On Me" title track for instance). Other than that, it's okay.So this is very unfortunate. Pac wasn't around long enough to see his album sell 9+ million copies. I enjoyed both discs, and I'll pop em in every once in a while when I want to hear some rhymes with a gangsta feel behind it. I'm pretty sure every Pac fan has snatched this up. If you don't have this, I recommend that you get it also. Also check out "Me Against The World", because I like that one better than this one here.Tupac Shakur...Rest In Peace...Disc One: (8 out of 10)Lyrics: AProduction: A+Guest Appearances: AMusical Vibes: A-Overall: ADisc Two:(8 out of 10)Lyrics: A-Production: AGuest Appearances: B+Musical Vibes: B+Overall: A-Chandler (Infamous) and I'm out...Peace Everyone!!!!
The last song on Disc 1 (Whatz ur phone # ?) could've been left off for sure and several songs on Disc 2 (Thugs Passion, Check Out Time) are terrible considering this is 2 Pac.Other than that this is good stuff if you can take 2 Pac in bragging gangster mode. Not much substance here. Not much, if any social awareness. This is the birth of what popular gangster rap would become in the 2000's.
I remember when this album first came out in 1996: Dang, another 2Pac album? Man, I'm still trippin' over "It Ain't Easy" from his Me Against the World! Usually, when rappers release an album less than a year after their last album drops, it's weak. This wasn't really the case for Pac though.All Eyez On Me starts off with a bang. "Ambitionz Az A Ridah" has Daz dropping a catchy piano riff as Pac's flows show people that he feels right at home with his new Death Row family. Speaking of family, he wastes no time promoting his new family, because they are all over the album: Dre on "California Love", Snoop on "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted", Daz and Kurupt on "Got My Mind Made Up" which also features Method Man and Redman. While we're speaking of ol' Meth, 2Pac uses his opening line from "Bring the Pain" to create the chorus of the album's highlight, "No More Pain". Even filler like "What'z Ya Phone #" can make you nod your head.Well, that's the end of an almost flawless Disc 1. Thirsty for more? Well, unfortunately, Disc 2 may still leave you thirsty. Like on so many double albums that followed this one, there's a lot of aiight tracks that surround the doper ones. "Can't C Me" sounds like a prolonged funkfest that didn't make Dre's "The Chronic" album, "Thug Passion" is where the "Computer Love" music is sampled for the umpteenth time while Pac and the gang drop some rusted jewels, and virtually every other song features okay lyrics over played-out samples.This album would really be a classic if 2Pac only released Disc 1. He should have used the "less is more" approach, but you can't blame him: he just got out of jail around that time and dived head first into Death Row Records, and he just wanted to show his best work. And it's not like Disc 2 is wack, it's just that he sounds exhausted on this disc after putting in his all on Disc 1. Oh well. Though Me Against the World remains Pac's best work, All Eyez On Me has enough memorable moments to keep you bumpin' this album until it's time to replace your speakers. R.I.P. Pac
All Eyez On Me is certainly worth of all the praise and record sales it has amassed(well over 10 million, thank you very much), but to say this is his best album is blasphemous; that honor belongs to Me Against The World. Though his signing to the hip hop dynasty Deathrow records was a stroke of briliance of the part of Suge Knight, it ultimately corrupted him from his natrual self; on Me Against The World, he was a troubled and eloquent street scholar trying to make it another day, but now the accesses of life have truly consumed him. Nevertheless, this a truly memorable album; Deathrow's current stars(Dr. Dre, That Dogg Pound, Nate Dogg, Danny Boy) make his step his game up and the results are eartshattering. How many classics are on this album? California Love(which samples EPMD's "Knick Knack Patty Wack" and Zapp's "Computer Love")? How Do U Want It(with K-Ci and Jo-Jo of Jodeci)? 2 Of Amerika's Most Wanted(featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg).? Even the lesser songs are hot; All About You, Rather Be Ya Nigga, Go My Mind Made Up(HOT posse joint featuring Tha Dogg Pound, Method Man and Redman). This is one albunm for the books; go get it if you alredy don't. R.I.P, Mr. Shakur.
Basically it's an album of contrasts.  On the first disc Tupac displays his talent brilliantly and flawlessly.  The beats are infectious and the science he drops is noteworthy.However the second disc is, on the whole,  quite sub par and typical of so much of the rap being put out by the 90's  era of rappers.  Musically boring and lyrically/creatively run of the  mill.Personally I felt that Tupac was on the road to megastardom both as  a rapper and as an actor.  Both fields in which he had tremendous talent  and perhaps even more potential.Nonetheless, this album is definitely  well worth a purchase just don't expect very much from Disc 2.
2Pac is, as a rapper, near the height of popularity, so the exaggerated title of this album isn't too far off. All "Eyez" aren't on him, but a mixture of vanity and paranoia probably makes it seem that way from his point of view. It's still Me Against The World, in other words. Everyone else is just waiting to see what his next move is going to be. And if we're looking, we're listening. So this album is for the whole world.It will be heard by the rap music crowds more than anyone else though. And in that category, it holds its own. 2Pac isn't the best rapper or anywhere near the best, the thug poet rarely has anything clever or particularly creative to say, but there is something to be said for his distinct sing-songy flow in which he randomly emphasizes words by stretching syllables and putting an exclamation mark at the end.If it's not impressive enough on its own, and I don't think it is, it sounds a lot better over a sleek array of well-produced hip-hop beats. There are also a lot of decent guest rappers, almost every song has one, but it's the guest singers that really stand-out. When one provides a catchy hook, that song instantly becomes one of the best and 2Pac, the rapper, shines more than he could probably ever shine on his own.The second half of this two-pack, a double album as far as CDs and cassettes are concerned, is superior in that regard. Run Tha Streetz is catchy and romantic, or at-least as romantic as 2Pac songs get, and Thug Passion is all you really need in the bedroom. Even when he's calling out enemies in a violent rage, daring them to Holla at him, a singer is right there instigating it with melodic taunts of her own.With that, the album, like most double albums, would do better as one set of, say, its best fourteen or thirteen tracks. That means weaker songs like When We Ride, Hearts Of Men and How Do U Want It; not all the singer hooks do well; would have to go. But even as is, there are enough interesting things happening in the way of side hooks, ad-libs and monologues, to hold your attention from beginning to end.marcellee.com
"All Eyez on Me" is a very nice album, especially the first disc.  Disc two is filled with mediocre to good songs, but nothing exceeds good.  As a unit, this album is easily a rap classic.  2 Pac gives a strong delivery and thought-provoking lyrics on most every single song.  He is so many people's favorite rapper, me included.  He has a technique which captures listeners from the first line.  This album features classics such as "I Ain't Mad at Cha", "How Do You Want It?", `All About You", and the album's strongest cut, "Life Goes On."  I wish Pac would have left his friends off of this album for there are way too many guest appearances and many of them were apart of his group, The Outlawz.  They are alright as rappers, but they don't hold a flame or candle to 2 Pac.  Other guests include Snoop, Dr. Dre, George Clinton and K-Ci and Jo-Jo.  Each of these artists do a wonderful job with their contributions.  Most of the production on this album is very good.  It's one of the reasons this album faired so well with meRap fans, this album was released on February 12, 1996, so Lord knows it should already be in your collection, but if for some reason it is not, do add it immediately.  4 stars.Mikeisha's Top 51.

Me against the world, Makaveli The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, where way better than all eyes on me. its funny how everybody says this was his best album, seeing as this was 2 albums on his contract i ask heads out of all his albums which one was his best, they say "all eyes on me" then i say witch disc, they all have different disc's or say their both great im like shure, trick. this album had more fillers then Me against & makaveli combined, but those albums had more heart and more poetry than this. THIS ALBUM HAS MUCH MORE DEATH ROW THAN 2PAC.He tells u who is on the beat and on the track almost on every track, but aside from all dat BS, he murders most beats and stays on a higher level than everybody else except on some track's (very consistent). and delivers from his heart on a couple of tracks.1.

Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find 4.4 really good, just sit back & take lessonoverall great album would have given it a 5 and trust me its a 5, i just want more pac than any other rappers on hear. ithink pac would have done better if he was on most of the songsby himself but maybe im wrong, dont know dont care i think this is rally good album.
All Eyez On Me is a classic west coast album, but should be enjoyed by more than just west coast hip hop fans.  This is the peak of 2Pac's career and just may be the best album he has ever made.
Let me start off with this : Tupac is a storyteller. If you want a party album,do not get this.Everyone already probably knew that,though. The second cd is better than the first one. Best song on the first cd : &quot;Only God Can Judge Me.&quot; Best song on the second cd : &quot;Shorty Wanna Be A Thug.&quot; Lets see,all in all, a whole lot of good songs, but not nearly enough to make it &quot;the best rap album ever&quot; as some of the reviews say.Even though its not the best rap album ever,it is still worthy of the money that it costs. Buy this. You won't be dissapointed.
The first true double album in hip hop with LOTS of historical significance. Pac raised the bar with All Eyez On Me, basically saying, &quot;look, I have so much tight stuff here, that one CD isn't enough.&quot; Pac truly set the standard for all double albums to follow and this was no fluke. Here's the review:Disc OneAlbum Highlights: Everything on the first disc is NICE, but do skip &quot;What'z Ya Phone #&quot; and take your time with &quot;Life Goes On.&quot;Production: Thumbs Up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs Up.Originality: Thumbs Up.Disc TwoAlbum Highlights: Sadly, this may be the WORST second disc ever, as the ONLY true stand out song on this disc is All Eyez On Me. Everything else is absolute filler. Pac could've done much better.Production: Thumbs in the middle, things got a little lazy.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs in the middle.Originality: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards down. Did Pac REALLY need E-40, and all them other WACK rappers on his album?The Last Word: You'd think that with SO much filler on the second disc that this album would'nt get a four star rating, but with the historical significance on this album, the precedent it set, and the EXCELLENCE of the first disc, the four star rating is justified. If you are a true Pac fan, buy this album(be prepared to be bored with the second disc), otherwise, I slightly recommend this one.
The music on "What's Going On" is masterful and thesongs bleed together superbly.That comes to fruitation on thehit tital song "Mercy,Mercy Me" and "Inner City Blues".But thelyrics to those and every other song here are so sad,bleak anddepressing as to be mentally draining.Marvin goes into depth about the horrors of war,unemployment,police brutality,pollutionand hoplessness-themes not condusive to partying."What's Going On" can be taken two ways;one it's music is flowing,beautiful,imaginative and catchy but the lyrics (unless your born-againenough to appreciate it's message of salvation) seem utterlyhopeless,especially today seeing as many of the ills disgussedhere are all too prevelent today."What's Going On" is not apleasant album.I baught the deluxe edition hoping for a masterpiece but upon hearing it wanted to crawl under my bed.It's important to say these things but Marvin's message of hopeshould have been more inclusive for those who arn't harcorechristians.For those looking for a happy and/or sexual Marvin Gaye album this IS NOT the place to come.Be prepared!
The many reviews on this CD seem to hail this work as a classic.  I am listening to this CD with an open mind.  There are some touching lyrics that talk about all the struggles in the world.  Marvin wants to Save The Children and thats an admiring quality.However, I have mixed feelings musically about this record.  Whereas there are some nice instrumental touches particularly around the percussion, flute, and strings, the rhythms vary ever so slightly.  It seems as if all nine songs utilize similar chord sequences and stylings.  What's Happening Brother is a nice song but it is way too similar to What's Going On.  Flying High In The Friendly Skies is barely different from What's Happening Brother.  A little slower yes, a little bit more atmospherics yes, but almost the same song.  Whereas the song blends are a little creative somehow I would have liked a little more of a change of pace.Nonetheless, I respect the message that Marvin tries to send in his music.  And I really like Inner City Blues(Makes Me Wanna Holler) a great deal.  Three and a half stars seems about right but since I'm in a good mood I'll round it up to a four!
My father loves Marvin Gaye, so, growing up, I heard a whole lot of him.  Unfortunately, Marvin isn't the kind of artist that most eight or nine year olds like typically, but now that I am a full-fledged adult, I have come to appreciate his creativity and innovation as an artist.  If you listen to enough of his music, it would be evident to you that he pushed the envelope plenty of times throughout his musical tenure.  Racy songs such as "Lets Get it On" and "Sexual Healing" and socially conscious numbers like the ones found on "What's Going On?" such as "Mercy Mercy Me" and "What's Going On?" all have controversial lyrical content.  I enjoy his voice and delivery more than anything.  He puts just enough soul into his music; never too much, never too little.  He mastered the art of singing in my eyes.  As a unit, this album is satisfying in many ways.  It's not too long, the lyrics are great, and it is simply enjoyable all the way around.  My few gripes are the fact that many of the songs sound alike production-wise and some of the songs are kind of eerie,  perhaps because these songs were so far ahead of their time.  If you were to listen to this album today, you would see how relevant his lyrics are to happenings of today.This album consists of mostly mid-tempos and ballads, all very touching and emotional.  I have heard "What's Going On?" numerous times in my life, but today was the first time I listened with my undivided attention.  It's a great song.  The falsetto, hook and lyrics are all stand-outs.  The song is about trying to come up with remedies for social problems.  A lot of artists attempted to ape what Marvin did here by creating a socially-conscious album, but he is one of the few singers who was very effective.  "Mercy Mercy Me" is also a nice song.  Although this album has a strong 70s vibe, it doesn't sound dated.I highly recommend this album to R&B;, soul, neo-soul and pop supporters.  The content here will stick with you long after you have turned the album off.  4 stars.  This one is a classic.Mikeisha's Top 5"What's Going On?""Save the Children""God is Love""What's Happening Brother""Mercy Mercy Me"
Since this is a very old album by now, if you listen it for the first time it could sound a little bit "out-of-time". However "Innervisions" is a key album to appreciate Stevie Wonder in the peak of his greatest performances. A 'must-have' for every 70s Soul fanatic collector!
This is the most consistent Stevie Wonder ever was, in my opinion.  Just about every song is a masterpiece, and all are very different in arrangements, while maintaing an album vibe where the songs fit together well.Too High - contains elements of jazz fusion, but also doesn't forget to be a very good, original song!  Nice electric piano riffs and funky minimoog bassline, cool vocal effects buried in the mix too.  Like Steely Dan's 'Babylon Sisters', it opens the album with some stunning playing and arranging.Innervisions - I must be the only person who doesn't especially like this song.  It's just bland to me, it needs (but doesn't have) a strong melody.  It's a ballad, mainly voice, guitar, and standup bass, playing quietly.  British acts like Elton John, Paul McCartney, Moody Blues, have done this sort of thing more effectively.Living For the City - an excellently written song, with strong hooks, and a funky groove.  The keyboard line that comes in between the verses is one of the best (and oddest) lead synth lines ever written.  Very strong and angry words to this song about racism, but the last verse sorrowfully calls for compassion not bitterness.Golden Lady - another EXCELLENT song, astoundingly tuneful, this guy was a genius!  A very catchy song, written like a Lennon/McCartney song with its superb verses building, and suddenly springboarding into a breezy chorus.  A bit of a cheerup to the mood after the previous song.Higher Ground - a classic funky song, well played, well written.  Very accurate use of the wah pedals to enhance the sound of this recording, it doesn't lumber like a rock song, it just chugs along.Jesus Children Of America - Another excellent jazz fusion style song.  Very neat bass synth sound in this song.  Lightweight lyrics about honesty in religion, TM, perils of drug addiction, standard themes of the time I guess.All In Love Is Fair - another ballad, this time it's the grand piano style.  It's a bit of a stronger song than Innervisions, and nicely played and sung, but still a little bland.Don't You Worry About A Thing - a very good song, like Golden Lady, very tuneful, the lyrics are lightweight and cheery.He's Misstra Know It All - good song, gets a bit repetitive after a while, but nicely played, nice harmonies, strong hooks.  Lyrics are supposedly about Richard Nixon but it's not particularly specific.
If not the continual quantum shift forward from the brilliant arrival point of TB, this is as solid as mainstream classic R&b got on record.
Stevie Wonder created a true masterpiece with Innervisions.  The beautiful Golden Lady is a highlight, followed by the extended version of &quot;living for the city&quot;.  While others may not like &quot;He's Mistra Know it all&quot;, it finishes the album off nicely , in my opinion.  This album is on equal par to his 1972 album &quot;talking book&quot;.  Both have been digitally remastered in recent years and sound even better as a result.
This is definitly stevie at HIS BEST!! But there are some filler like the instrumentals but the rest are wonderfull. I recommend it.
Not only is this a great concept album by Stevie, it's also his best effort and it also stands the test of time to emerge as one of the best albums of all time. As they say, "the cream always rises to the top" and this is surely the case for this album. This gatefold mini-lp sleeve cardboard replica version is also the best version of the album that is out there at the moment. The sound quality is good due to the remastering job they did although not great which is understandable given the state of the 1976 original master and so some tracks have higher volume levels than others. However, the tracks are things of beauty and stand the test of time. Although there is "single" material in here, the only way to truly appreciate this work of art is to listen to the whole thing at one go. For the record, the "single" stuff that still sound good today are: "Sir Duke" and "Isn't She Lovely". The other standout tracks must be "Pastime Paradise" later ripped off to great effect for the "Dangerous Minds" soundtrack "Gangster's Paradise" and "Black Man" is a fantastic study in slap bass that would make Mark King of Level 42 proud. There is also a track on disc two that sounds a lot like Lionel Ritchie's "All Night Long." It's obvious that many, many artistes have been inspired over the years by this album and I sure many, many more will be over the decades to come. Very highly recommended.
