I never understood what's the BIG deal behind this album. Yes, the production is wonderfull but the songwriting is childish and rubbish. Brial Wilson definitly can not write great lyrics like Bob Dylan sometimes do. "God Only Know" and "Wouldnt Be nice" are indeed masterpieces...but the rest of the album is background music..
As a child and young adult when I tended to believe that all "alternative" music was basically noisy, unlistenable grunge likeNirvanaorEverclearorThe Presidents Of The USA, the pop songs of my 1980s childhood occupied my attention because they were the most readily available alternative. I used to adore the big hits on "Greatest Hits" and said they were my favourite songs.Today, however, as an experienced music listener, it is very clear to me that the material here is awfully dated and shallow. The huge beats on "When The Going Gets Tough", which was his only #1 hit, and his second biggest hit "Get Out Of My Dreams" were really catchy and even enchanting to me as a child, but if I listen to them now in the library at Melbourne University they seem awfully dated. The same is true of the earlier "Carribbean Queen", whilst "License To Chill" is even worse in this respect.The slower material, to which Billy's "big" voice was never suited, comes off as even worse. I always thought "Here's To You" and "Loverboy" were terribly soppy, and it's easy to imagine how I would feel about them nowadays.This is something I want to note as something I have given up, and it is so dated with its big beat dance track and so soppy on the ballads that one should steer clear of it.
The commercial failure of KRS1s didactic venom is a tribute to the good taste of American rap fans. He has done better.
It's amazing how these guys keep fooling people. I ask you: do they write their songs? Or some clever professional songwriter do that for them? I have absolutely nothing against ballads and pop, but when that sounds a  complete fake, that pisses me off!
Talent-Less in every sense of the word.The music is Dated New Jack&amp;The vocals are plain boring.all of their music is Formula.Avoid at all costs.just like all the other boy bands.
Altoough the musicians involved in this album are all great British accomplished guys (Sykes, Murray and Dunbar), it's a shame to hear COverdale,one of the most authentic rock voices of all time, turn into  Californian mainstream glam metal. Sad..  Anyway, there are great pices of  musical hability.
How bad is this. During the late 80s the whole big hair thing and ballad thing was the new and everyone loved it. Whitesnake compared too great bands of that era(metallica or guns n roses), is nothing compared too them. Sure they wrote Here I Go Again but all that is is just another power ballad that was so over used that era. Every single song Whitesnake pretty much has ever writtien is a freaking ballad i mean sure one or two songs but the whole album? come on. Way too much synth and ballads too be called a metal album. It just doesent work Here i Go Again isnt even that good and Is THis Love is the worse song of all time. Dont buy horrible band horrible album would give zero starts. By far not the greatest album of all time in fact its one of the worse
Together with the other guys in Eagles, Don Henley assured his immortal place in rock history. I wonder - how can a man who was a part of something so great as the Eagles release such a [bad] bunch of songs? I just don't get it! I owned this album for many years but when it was time to "weed out" my cd collection I decided that this one have to go. But before I sold it, I wanted to record the best songs from it, but I must admit that I couldn't find a single song I really like. So, now it's gone, and I have not missed it for even a split second!
I hate Gwen's yelling, screeching vocals and all the songs accept for "Don't Speak."  The dance/pop band Clueless does a decent cover of "Spiderwebs," but it just sounds like a lot of noise by No doubt.
a good poet he was.but a average rapper.he was a better actor than anything else.his music doesn't move me like public enemy or rakim.i find him to be way overrated.a few alright songs on this two-disc set but alot  of filler.he ain't no legend to me.self-destructive more likely.this album  is pure garbage.
you wanna feel the godfather buy the box set which includes 80 hardcore jams made by jb and his disciples of funk.
Seriously, folks...this band SUCKS! Every one of these hits (Dancing Queen, Sugar Sugar, Mamma Mia, Take a Chance on Me) is dated, sugary, and awful as awful gets. How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me. KEEP AWAY!!!!!!!!
Howdy fellow muzik fanz!  I love listening to easy going music like the next guy but these ABBA folks are really starting to irritate me! I was up at 3am the other night (i have insomnia LOL!) and woke up to an infomercial of an old geezer trying to sell ABBA cd's because they are supposedly 'one of the best' Euro-Pop bands ever... ha! I fell for his trick and actually bought this album.  What a complete disaster! The vocal talent of the vocals in this band don't even compare to the legends Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj! The instrumentals are just irritating... why can't they include dubstep bass drops or lil wayne type hip hop beats??! Lastly, the lyrics are just awful! "money, money, money" is a completely disturbing song about envious people who wish they had money... trying to make the 1%ers look bad! Well guess what ABBA? 1% of the world owns 90% of the wealth... and they did it all legally...(I.e. Halliburton, Wallstreet, Oil Companies)... "Dancing Queen" is sooo lame.. they don't shake their booties like the girls in 50 Cent videos....... and "Take a Chance on me" is sooo cheesy! I can't believe anyone would actually support these shams!!For good female vocalist... stick with Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, and the ever so talented Milli Vanilli!
First off, I am an EJ fan.  I own everything he's recorded.  Nevertheless, I also try and be objective and this review is more for the casual/beginning fan who may not be familiar with Elton's entire catalog.  That said, Empty Sky is very much an album for Elton enthusiasts.  It's a  sort of curio piece (or artifact) that only rabid EJ fans will find  listenable.  In truth, Empty Sky's only value is the glimpse it shows  listeners of Elton's origins.  Skyline Pigeon, is the one worthy track on  this thing.  From failed psycadelia (Empty Sky) to dull, cheerless, false  antiquity (Valhalla, the Scaffold), this is an effort that reflects the  times (late 60's) and Elton's attempt to compete with all of the other once  popular (and now utterly forgotten) &quot;time capsule&quot;,  mock-atmospheric oddities such as Procol Harum or the Moody Blues.  Elton  was very much trying to find himself, musically, and he hadn't yet realized  his true gift: the ability to pen unbelievably catchy pop songs.
It is amazing how quickly Elton fell from the heights of great pop music (Goodbye Yellow Brick Road) to the depths of this garbage.  Totally unlistenable - and it does not get much better for a long long time.
Come On Over by Shania Twain sold millions and millions of albums but I despise this cd with a passion. Shania is one of the worst singer-songwriters I have ever heard, especially in the genre of country/pop. Her voice is completely unoriginal, there's no fire, range, or accessiblility. I can't believe how truly awful her songwriting is! Terrible cliches, junior high filled lyrics and child-like melodies. Songs like That Don't Impress Me Much, Man I Feel Like a Woman!, Don't Be Stupid, and You're Still the One just gives me the willies. The only two tracks that have any emotion in them are From This Moment On and You've Got a Way. Come on Over is a horrible and silliest record of the '90s. Stay clear from this over-rated mess!
what is so special about Shania Twain? she is a country Jennifer Lopez.all hype and no talent.Lee ann Rimes is a better vocalist but when she tried to go pop all Hell broke out.Shania is pop.her songs and material have more in  common with celine dion than Patsy Cline.that don't impress me much is as  pop as addicted to Love.she is great at marketing but her music has no  roots.Still the one was catchy as is the case with some of her other  material but considering her overall impact she is way  overrated&amp;overplayed.
This album is depressing.  After the astonishing comeback and return to form of 'Made in England' this album was a big let-down for me.  All the songs sound like they were made with an Elton John songwriting program, there aren't any interesting melodies or modulations, the arrangements are uninteresting, underplayed, and by-the-book, and even his voice, which can lend viability to substandard fare, sounds detached and bored.  Except in the hit, "Something about the way you Look tonight", where he sings with a bit of REAL soul.  That's why the album actually deserves one star, it is a good song in his  finest tradition.  To be fair, he lost a number of friends in distressing  circumstances in the period this album was made (putting it mildly), the album seems to have a  mournful underlying mood, when there's any mood at all.
John Mellencamp is one of my all time favorite singers. I love his all American rock and roll, the feel good vibe (most of) his songs possess and pretty much everything else. That being said, "The Best That I Can Do: 1978-1998" is a single disc collection that does not do this great singer justice.Now don't get me wrong, I love every song on this collection. Basically what this is is a sampling of all Mellencamp's big hits, including "Hurts So Good", "Jack And Diane", "Pink Houses", "Authority Song", "Small Town", "R.O.C.K. In The U.S.A." and "Cherry Bomb". These are all true American classics, but this group of songs doesn't even come close to including all of his best work.For a lightyears better collection of Mellencamp's best work, try picking up "Words And Music", a two disc collection which includes all the songs here (with the exception of the new recording "Without Expression"), plus many other great classics such as "This Time" (a personal favorite), "Peaceful World", "Wild Night", "Human Wheels", "Pop Singer", "Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First)", and thankfully, "Rain On The Scarecrow - Blood On The Plow".Overall, this cd really isn't worth it unless you just want hits (remeber these are all five star songs). Most people should buy the aforementioned "Words And Music" or seek out the original albums.
Every album The Moody Blues has released after &quot;Long Distance  Voyager&quot; has been fairly worthless.  For some reason, I used to like  this lame stuff back when I was in high school.  As I've grown older and  wiser, I have come to realize the error of my ways.  &quot;The  Present&quot; is a thoroughly mediocre album from a bunch of washed up  hippie has-beens that barely has enough energy to power your speakers.  Stick to classic Moody Blues material instead.
Just so you know where I'm coming from, I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era. I am less familiar with their post-1981 output, but much of what I've heard is likeable.  I'm glad you are interested in the Moodies and encourage you to explore their first five albums.  With that said, I cannot recommend Seventh Sojourn (1972).  Every song is either plodding and dull or sticky sweet. The worst offenders are John Lodge's two offerings on Sojourn. "Isn't Life Strange?" is like gooey treacle.  Compare it to the unsentimental beauty of John's "Eyes of a Child" on "Children's Children".  "I'm Just a Singer in a Rock 'n Roll Band", with its forced energy and "is it over yet?" conclusion gives rock 'n roll a bad name.  Compare it to the natural-sounding energy of John's "Ride My See Saw", on "Lost Chord" or "To Share Our Love" on "Threshold".  Even ace songwriter Justin Hayward flops here, with little cream-puff ditties and inane lyrics: "All we are trying to say is we are all we've got".  Compare them to the passion of his "Gypsy" on "Children", The Actor on "Lost Chord", or the perfect rock 'n roll gem "It's Up to You", on "Question of Balance".  Mike Pinder seems to be the only one of the bunch who's really putting effort into his songs, but the results are ponderous and do not wear well.  Do I blame the Moodies for running out of ideas or cashing in on this album's enormous sales? Of course not. Obviously they pleased many people and they deserved the recognition. But because there is not one song in this collection that I enjoy, one star is all they're getting from this loyal fan.
Most Moody Blues albums are spotty, usually containing a mixture of good  and bad songs.  But on &quot;Octave,&quot; they forgot to include any good  ones.  Released the same year (1978) as Yes's worst album,  &quot;Tormato,&quot; it may have had something to do with lumbering  dinosuar art rock bands failing to compete in the brave new world of Punk  rock.
This "Tom Waits" guy sucks. What a horrible voice! He sounds like a piece of raw meat ran over by a truck. Listen to REAL music like Nickelback or St. Anger by Metallica if you want a truly enjoyable listening experience.
Sure he was important, but he still [stinks]. This album is Rocky Horror meets Barbarella meets well, funk. F
Weakest of all his works including no limit, maybe 2 or 3 good songs. this was when Snoop sold out Pac'. Never respected him since then. Sell out.
Primus sucks! I'm serious. They do. Do they even have a bassist? Oh, yeah, they do. Les Claypool or some redneck name like that. It's so hard to hear him! All you can hear is extremely simple basslines. Do yourself a favour and check out "St. Anger" if you want some killer bass.
This was a huge let down out of the 13 songs 2 are good. And the songs that are good really arint that good in the first place! 'Here Comes The Bastards' and 'Jerry Was A Race Car Driver' are the only good songs. This is a really really really bad record, Les Claypool should be banned from ever singing. The guitar work isnt bad, and thr Drumming is all right. The only really good thing about this bad is Les Claypools bass playing I mean I can name maybe two or three better bass players and that is it! But no matter how good he plays the bass it would never make up for how bad this record is!!! Dont Waste your money, I mean you would have really really high to get into this, and you still wouldnt think it was good you would think it was funny.
Back in the day, no one took the Beastie's seriously; they were portrayed as brainless frat boys who wished they had been born black. Nowadays people regard them as genius innovators. Frankly I'm inclined to agree with the original assessment
All of Bob Dylans music just blows and it sounds worse nowyour voice is boring and your voice is ignoring.
Boz Scaggs, who had been in the music business for a long time and even made a record with Duane Allman in the 1960s, had recorded some fairly unsuccessful solo albums during the early part of the 1970s before "Silk Degrees" make him into a pop superstar.Today, there is relatively little criticism of middle-of-the-road music from the 1970s vis-&agrave;-vis what came out of the 1980s, presumably because the production is not generally so dated or because it is seen as having fewer associations with "rock". Boz Scaggs, however, must be said to be as bad as any of the modern MOR stars who became critical targets when commercial radio tightened its playlists during and after the "punk revolution". In fact, it can be as difficult to listen to most of the material from "Silk Degrees" as it is to any material on the blandest 1980s pop albums which I grew up with in the ultraconservative suburbs of Melbourne. This is seen at its worst on "Lowdown", where the chorus is as flyweight asMichael Bolton's "Said I Loved You But I Lied" even if a little faster. More than that, the ultra-catchy choruses of all the slower songs on "Silk Degrees" stick with a listener in the worst kind of way - especially I will say for a person like myself who tends to have very unhealthy obsessions. "We're All Alone" reminds me, as my review title suggests, of songs by Mariah Carey that I used to listen to as a child.The faster songs on "Silk Degrees", like "Jump Street", hold up a little bit less badly because there is genuine drive in them, but still one sees all the worst traits of commercial music of the 1980s. "It's Over", the other fast piece, is much less memorable and shows the effects of the soft production much worse.All in all, this is an unmemorable pop album that at times sounds like it was made in a time-warp, clearly predating the worst aspects of commercial music of the 1980s. Indeed, "Silk Degrees" could be seen as a perfect model for commercial radio stations forced to tighten their playlists during this period.
I kind of liked some of the songs these guys had on the radio. The one about Africa and Roseanna were cool songs, so I gave this a listen. I didn't realize that these guys were quite so disco/tech oriented. I felt like I was listening to some kind of goofy version of a black jazz disco group or something. The song Georgy Porgy was so grating that I wished I could take a ballbat to the broad singing backup. Man, this is a painful listen unless you are a fan and have some connection to this stuff from the past. I didn't have the cushion of old memories with this outdated music so I had to take it full bore in the year 2008. I apologize to the people that love these guys, but I didn't know what I was getting into. Warning - Syn-tech-disco to the max with irritating vocals strained through a funnel.
This album is worthless. What's up with the hype. I could not find one song that I liked...Horrible album bes avoided. Rock With you is a decent song but the rest is terrible.
This may be the second worst Priest album after Ram it Down. Rocka Rolla can be excused because the band hadn't found its sound yet, Turbo and Point of Entry are excuseable because the band (and the fans) looked at both albums as experients. There's no such redemption here, this album is every bit as bad as Ram it Down. Granted, then first two tracks (Freewheel Burning and Jawbreaker) are awesome songs, the rest are all completely forgettable. Even look at the stupid song titles (Love Bites, Heavy Duty, Turn On Your Light). Love Bites is a mind-numbingly awful track with stupid lyrics about Vampires (Vampires are awesome but not here). Heavy Duty and the title track both stink, in fact both are the two worst priest songs ever. Some Heads are Gonna Roll has a good solo but that's it. Eat Me Alive has a good intro, and then goes downhill from there.And another thing, the lyrics are TERRIBLE. Yeah Painkiller had stupid lyrics too but it could get away with it because the music was so damned awesome. There's no such redemption for that too, the lyrucs are stupid. With dumb lyrics like "We're gonna rock you till your metal hunger's fed", "Let's all join forces- rule with an iron hand- and prove to all the world- Metal rules the land" as well as "With animal lust they'll devour your life- and slice your word to bits like a knife". This is especially shocking since Halford wrote the lyrics. Wasn't Halford supposed to be the "Metal God" or something? As for the production is terrible too- the guitars sound like keyboards, the drums sound like Holland is banging on a plastic cup, and the bass is too loud. THere are noticeable volume drops on the album too.How this trash got the reputation of "Best Priest Album" is beyond me. Cut your teeth on "Killing Machine" or "Sad Wings of Destiny" or even "Painkiller" instead, if you must.
The disturbing thing is that they did.
This was Alice's big comeback album.  The single "Poison" got him back on top 40 radio for the first time in years, and the album was a huge success.  Cooper was back to playing big arenas in front of sold out crowds.  But......I think the album stinks.  The music is cliche ridden hair metal and most of the lyrics are just plain stupid.  Compared to most of the Coop's other work this dreck just does not hold up.
Aic's best and it sounds exactally like every other AIC album....problem is AIC are not a good band and have yet to release a decent album...
This stuff is horrible!!!  The mix is all wrong and the recording sucks!!! I cant even hear the gitar!!! Get Bodge's version instead!!  Get ANY-THING by Bodge instead!!!
In the 1990s, the Country Music began to go through some transitions. Country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music. As a result, the sound started to change. By the end of the 90s, Country Music had full blown established music superstars in Shania Twain and Faith Hill. But back in 1992, this metamorphosis was still in the early stages. I personally, have been intrigued by country music - but I would admit I am not a purist. I enjoy the fusion of different genres of music with country that would eventually lead to these new superstars.. Thus we come to Mary-Chapin Carpenter's (MCC) 1992 smash &quot;Come On Come On&quot;. This album doesn't quite mesh with the mainstream - it is more pure country and has much more of a folk-ish twist to it. The bottom line is I don't think this is a very good album.Perhaps I bought this album for the wrong reasons. I had been pleasantly surprised when I heard the remake of Lucinda Williams' Passionate Kisses on Don Imus' radio program. Yes it was different than the original, but MCC's version did something to interest me. She has a very good voice. As a result, I felt it was an investment in the collection that contained this song would be worthwhile. I had also heard that this album had some of the &quot;fusion&quot; elements - particularly with the folk sound. I immediately discovered two problems with this album: 1) The &quot;fusion&quot; element I felt was very lacking. Many of the songs of this album still have a traditional country sound. I did mention, I am not a country purist and I wouldn't rip an album for that reason alone- so the next reason; 2) The Songs are just not that good. There is little on this album that helps lift it to the next level. Despite MCC's great voice I heard on &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot;, the remainder of the songs don't do as much to put MCC in the category of a great female vocalist.There are a couple of interesting things that I discovered as this album has sat in my CD rack for the better part of a decade. Country Star - Roseanne Cash (Johnny's daughter) does background vocals on opening tack &quot;The Hard Way&quot;. On this very country-ish track, you really don't get a good much of Roseanne's voice and it almost is a complete waste of a good talent. Another background vocalist is Shawn Colvin (who would eventually become a mainstream star in the late 90s). Colvin uses a folk-sy style in her works, so looking back in hindsight she might have been influenced on this album. Colvin actually does the background vocals on &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; - which isn't a very folksy song. Again, you aren't going to get a lot of Shawn Colvin - this was very early in her career so you won't hear her distinctive sound on this track. Country artist Joe Diffie does a decent duet on &quot;Not Too Much to Ask&quot;, but the song is pretty dry and doesn't do much for me. Finally, Amy Ray and Emily Sallers - pop artists from the Indigo Girls appear on the track &quot;Walking Through Fire&quot; - this is a pretty decent track and actually one of the better cuts, but this isn't a song that is going to make me do handstands.Another song which is worth mentioning is &quot;The Bug&quot;. This is a country version of a Dire Straits song. It was written by Mark Knopfler who has always had somewhat of a country/folk element in parts of his music. Dire Straits actually released this song around the same time as MCC's version. MCC does a very nice job with her rendition of this. I still think the Dire Straits version is superior - but this version definitely holds its own and is one of the better cuts.For fans of MCC and this style, there are some nice liner notes included with the collection. All of the lyrics - with all of the appropriate credits are included with the collection. The version I have of this CD does have this in a fold-out format as opposed to a booklet (which is annoying, but not terrible). The back of the foldout includes a big picture of MCC.I think if you are a MCC fan, my review probably isn't going to influence you. But if you are more of a genre-neutral music fan and are going to invest in this album - think twice. This album isn't going to do much to capture your imagination and will most likely sit in your CD rack like it sits in mine. You probably will find more luck elsewhere.
first off this album lacks imagintation its unbelivable admittedly they have a good guitarist in the form of tom mellero but otherwise they are a load of crap this is the worst cd in my collection and i have never brought another ratm record since if you want to hear political rock i sugest system of a down this the worst cd in my collection now there are some who may like this if you like rap you may do but the rap element isnt perticullary good quality even by the standard it has been set so unless your a fan of rap-rock (crap rock) then buy thisnow i only borrowed this album from someone who said it was brilliant it is probably worth borrowing if you like catchy guitar riffs ruined by some crap rapper
No its not them its me from sampling this bull!@#$!!! I wouldnt buy this if it came with a Peurto Rican Chick that the only word she knew in English was Yes or if Bush helped the Gas Prices Go Down!!!!!!!!!!! Do Not Buy Dont Listen To YO
This release drew the line for me with Aerosmith. There music on this and the following material up to date contain complete chaos.  Aerosmith lost their rhythmn they once possessed on the prior four cds that were all five-star efforts.  This album along with the latter day Aerosmith stuff is just noisey as far as I am concerned. I have the first four releases (Aeromsith, Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic and Rocks all 5*****), but they no longer impress me except maybe for a track here and there.  Or maybe I am just old!
I have no problem with greatest hits packages, but when they butcher the songs with 45 editing, you get half-ass versions of songs that were meant to be heard in their entirety.Add to this poor decision that they included two songs that need not be here, Kings and Queens and the ridiculous Remember (Walking In The Sand). There are at least a dozen others songs that deserve to be included here.All that aside, if you really want to introduce yourself to this band, buy Toys In The Attic or Rocks or one of the other scads of hits packages they've greedily dumped on the consumer over the years.Save your money.
THIS WAS ULTIMATELY THE WORST AEROSMITH ALBUM EVER RELEASED!! AND IT'S ONE OF THE WORST ROCK ALBUMS EVER RELEASED!!! NONE OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD AND THIS WAS MADE AT THE WORST TIME OF AEROSMITH'S CAREER. 2 OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS HAD LEFT THE BAND AND BY THE TIME THIS ALBUM CAME OUT, AEROSMITH HAD ALMOST BECOME FORGOTTEN. BUT, A FEW YEARS LATER THEY MADE A MIRACULOUS COMEBACK BY COLLABORATING WITH RUN-DMC FOR A REMAKE OF THEIR CLASSIC ''WALK THIS WAY''. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM LIKE I DID. YOU'LL REGRET WASTING THE MONEY TO GET IT AFTER YOU LISTEN TO IT.
It seems like Jeff Buckley attempts to sound like a crossing between Elton John, Gary Moore, Montserrat Caball&eacute; and Muse, with a twist of progrock.He does not succeed in any of those attempts.His very little voice - whining and weeping, turning to distorted screaming during the refrains - is only partly compensated by the all but original acoustic guitar play, and only little more by the progrock inspired drums and electric guitars.Therefore, Jeff Buckley is at his best when he doesn't sing.But he does. So...The only OK song on 'Grace' is the final 'Dream Brother'. And still, it is only OK, not exactly brilliant.
Only one word can describe this album-- Atrocious.  Jeff Buckley?? Ha--more like Jeff Suckley.
I went shopping for some tapes at the local thrift store. Some dopey looking teenager was working there and asked if I was looking for anything. I said "Yeah, do you have any cool punk tapes? Like a Good Charlotte bootleg?" and he just laughed. He said "Girl, this is real punk!" and handed me some tape with a tranny on the cover called "Raw Power". It was only 25 cents so I bought it. And YUCK! This album is pretty much as run-of-the mill as you can get. Nothing special about this album at all. Real punk is Green Day's "American Idiot", not this untalented crap made by ProTools. Don't listen to it, EVER.
This is garbage because of one thing ... the production and mix are truly awful. It sounds like you are listening to this through a transister radio, underwater and 100 yards away. It was purposely recorded that way.This is 3 chord rock and there is nothing special about them. With other punk/garage bands, you heard the same chord progressions and time signatures infinite times but with better recordings.I like some of Iggy Pop's material but I do not get it with this one. I know that this is regarded as a classic by a lot of critics I just don't get it.You should stay away because I cannot imagine anybody having repeated listenings of this.
Just another run of the mill teenager depressing whine feat from AIC.  Sucked then sucks now nothing special move on...,.
A couple of months ago, a jury was right on the money with their finding that Bolton unconscionably copied the Isley Brothers in his &quot;creation&quot; &quot;Love is a Beautiful Thing&quot;.  This CD (like all of his others) makes clear that Bolton has shamelessly tried to copy a style of music, standards, melodies, and claim it for his own.  But it becomes painfully obvious after about ten seconds listening that he cannot.Every dime he ever gets close to for this drivel should go to musicians from as far back as some forty years ago from whom he stole.Want to hear this music actually performed the way it is supposed to be played and sung?  Purchase some Ray Charles, some Otis Redding, Al Green, Soloman Burke or Percy Sledge.Shamelessly derivative
Michael Bolton, (I first knew him mistakenly as Michael Dutton from a radio announcement) was the singer behind a vast number of major hits that dominated commercial radio during the 1980s and 1990s. He first came to prominence with the sudden high entry of his version of "Dock Of The Bay" (I used to sing it as "Top Of The Bay") onto the charts in 1988.In 1990, Bolton began to dominate the airwaves with a vast string of hits, of which the upbeat songs like "How Can We Be Lovers" and "Time, Love And Tenderness" were rather painless to listen to though they certainly were extremely pompous, Bolton's voice certainly appeared to convey some real emotion. They were also undeniably catchy and could bear hearing on commcercial radio.However, as time went by, Bolton moved onto softer and softer, airier and airier ballads that really did make his voice sound painful, grating, even tuneless. The early "When A Man Loves A Woman" is barely distinguishable from a version by Australian Jimmy Barnes but really has little tune, whilst the flyweight "Said I Loved You But I Lied" is even harder to listen to as Bolton mumbled through both verses and chorus in a way that ought never to impress."How Am I Supposed To Live Without You" was more of the same, but the then-new tracks are just awful even compared to Bolton's earlier output. There is not a single memorable hook in the new tracks, and Bolton's voice, really best designed for hard rock or heavy metal, falters trying to sing a tune with any gentleness in it at all, yet alone such flyweight songs as these.Pleasant, yes, memorable, anything but. Look elsewhere for something that will keep you listening.
what greatest hits? upset stomach variety? he can't sing.i wish he would stop trying to tarnish R-N-B music.doing dock of the bay? you have to be kidding? Bolton is a okay writer.but that straining gives me a  headache.that's not Soul that's toneless for a whole Decade.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Bruce Springsteen's music very much.  Many of Bruce's other CD's are filled to the brim with passion and emotion.  However, this Ghost of Tom Joad CD leaves me very cold.There are twelve songs on this CD's and they all seem to move at the same lethargic pace. The bleak tone surely does not help. On many of them it is extremely difficult to make out what Bruce is singing or more appropriately, mumbling.Worse yet are the songs themselves.  Most if not all of these songs lack a good melody.  Youngstown and the title track are the only ones which seem memorable after three listens. A few others catch me for a moment but then fade away due to an overly repetitive pattern and a strong lack of instrumental definition.  The guitar playing is way too quiet that it barely adds any impression to the disc.  The ocassional harmonica blasts are the only thing that keeps from dosing off from boredom.It's not that I dislike it that Bruce decided to make another all acoustic recording.  Whereas Nebraska was bleak and limited to a guitar/harmonica instrumental accompanyment, at least Bruce actually put some creative stylings into those songs.  And each of those tunes moved at distinctive paces and several of them had strong melodies.  The Ghost of Tom Joad on the other hand is dull, dismal, and boring.
I bought this based on rave reviews not long after it was first released. I played it twice and gave it away. I just don't get it. I like his first three records, (the acoustic folk and protest ones) and "Highway 61 Revisited" and "New Morning" and a few others in his extensive catalogue, but the people who rave about "Time Out of Mind" and "Blood on the Tracks" are dwellers on a different planet. I found this one boring and bleak, personal but pointless.
Turns out everyone who bought a copy of this album made a major mistake. Thankfully, that mistake can be fixed. All you gotta do is return your copy to whatever record story you bought it at and ask for your money back.Now what about the music? Well, I gave it one star, so that should be a sign it sucks. Any album with Witchy Woman, Desperado, Peaceful Easy Feeling, Lyin' Eyes, Take it To the Limit, Best of My Love and One of These Nights would be worth one star already, but they lose even more points by ruining a great Jackson Browne song (Take It Easy). Skip this.
Everything this band ever released was horrible. Fooled by the masterpiece tune &quot;HOTEL CALIFORNIA&quot;, I went out to buy a compilation from them. Uau !! awful. &quot;HOTEL CALIFORNIA&quot; is a thousand miles ahead of all other songs they ever wrote, in terms of sheer quality. THe rest is a bunch of cheesy and souless music. The only merit is the drummer who can sing, which is very rare. Blergh !
It's been a while since I bashed the Eagles, so I thought I'd get back in action. Anyway...Three of the most annoying Top 5  ihts of the '70's can be found on this disc: the title track, a crappy uptempo/pseudo-dance song that's even more annoying than Hotel California; the brainless Lyin' Eyes; and especially the sophoric, overly-orchestrated Take it To the Limit. I don't know how ANYBODY can put up with this group, but if I hear one more Eagles hit on the radio...
Previously the Eagles' success baffled me, but I think I've got it figured out now: they brought the right stuff (dull pointless pedestrian soft-rock) to the right place (California) at the right time (the '70s). Their continued popularity today is probably more out of nostalgia and/or peer pressure ("How can you NOT like them?" say the fans. "Greatest Hits 1 is the biggest-selling album ever! If you don't like the biggest selling album ever, you don't have good taste!") than anything else.But what's the music like? Well, I've heard the band themselves hated this album. I hate it too. For one, there's the '"legendary" "Hotel California". A #1 hit like anything else they put out at a certain point. But it's embarrassing. Every element that gets praised even today is an element of it I dislike - I see the syncopated reggae rhythms as this forced, "Look at us, we can do REGGAE! We're DIVERSE!" thing; the lyrics as either pretentious ("We stabbed the beast with steely knives") or unintentionally hilarious ("You can check out anytime you want, but you can never leave" - what is this, the roach motel?), and the famed guitar duel near the end puts me out like no anesthetic ever could. And if Don Henley is ever picked as the voice of rock 'n' roll over Mick Jagger, Roger Daltry or John Fogerty, that will be the day I stop listening to rock 'n' roll. At least it isn't bad as their other attempt at reggae, "New Kid on the Block", another #1 hit (god, did these guys have a payola  deal going? And while I'm conspiracy theorizing, they probably locked up all the executives of the Billboard charts in their basement and played them their music until they agreed to move their records up to #1).But wait - there's more! The addition of Joe Walsh somehow convinced the Eagles that they were a sleazy boogie-rock band, like ZZ Top! Only they saw themselves as too smart to right about tube snakes and pearl necklaces and girls with legs who knew how to use them. No, instead they gave us their takes on either the frailty ("Heartache Tonight"; "Victim of Love") or longevity ("The Long Run") of love; cliched damming of rock-star life ("Life in the Fast Lane"). Problem is, they can't play boogie-rock; the vocals are painfully oversung, and the band sounds stiff and awkward. "Heartache Tonight" (or "Headache Tonight", take your pick) is especially painful, though all four of 'em are disgraces.And can they write a memorable lyric that has not, in fact, been beaten into the ground? Glad you asked. No is the answer to that question. Let's count the songs that pretty much do the same thing as "The Sad Cafe"; "I Can't Tell You Why" and "After the Thrill is Gone". Let's see.... one, two, three, four... 9.5x10^28, 9.6x10^28, 9.7x10^28...This right here is a fine example of why sometimes you can't trust the masses. The fact that George W. Bush was elected for two terms in office was another example. This might've sounded great in the '70s - I wasn't around back then, I wouldn't have a clue - but the music of the Eagles has aged like cream cheese. Oh yeah, they've got a new album out. You know what that means, right? That means I will never turn on the radio again as long as Don Henley, Glen Frey, Timothy B. Schmidt, Don Felder, Joe Walsh, Randy Meisner, and Bernie Leadon live. At least Felder, Meisner and Leadon had the good sense to jump ship. Wait, wait, their music wasn't any better with them on board. Never mind.
THis band has a lot of greta songs, but none of them is even closer to the sheer quality of &quot;HOTEL CALIFORNIA&quot;. That's why they keep on releasing compilation after compilation featuring the EAGLES. Blergh !!
This "audiophile" gold CD is ruined by the "mastering engineer" Steve Hoffman's decision to ignore the original pacing,presention and intent by the band and producer Mutt Lange by adding unnecessary gaps between the songs.On the original LP,tape and CD,the songs flowed without interruption.Secondly,the HDCD(means "high-definition CD")encoding causes audible popping and clicking sounds at the end of each song.And lastly,the sound isn't even that much improved over the old 1980's CD which you can buy for only $6.99-7.99 at most retail outlets.Don't waste your money on this bastardaztion of an 1980's rock classic,which get 5 stars in its original CD form.
My this is a toothless old affair. Easily their worst album. The real Rush was over after &quot; Hold Your Fire&quot;. If this was anyone's first experience with the band I don't see how they would find them interesting.  By this time they had moved so far away from what put them on the map  anyway. If a group debuted with a record like this I doubt any self  respecting label would give them a shot to do it again. For fans of tired  millionare rock only
Bad effort by RUSH. A IRon Maiden, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Ozzy and others artists, they just can't be so great anymore.
Tori Amos is, to say it politely, a hack. Yes, comrades, a hack. She is simply a talentless Britney Spears knockoff. All of her songs have computerized vocals and lame dance beats, making it blatantly obvious that she is desperate to be on MTV. Sorry hun but you'll NEVER be good enough to make it on MTV. Skip this junk and listen to a Britney Spears or Lady GaGa album. PS- "Me and a Gun" is hilarious!!
I'm an old RUSH fan. I survived and enjoyed fully when they changed their sound, adding a lot of keyboards, synthesizers, etc, forever. It was a new way, but the point was: the energy of true rock and music was always there, always at their side in all kind of songs. But in this COUNTERPARTS it seems everything went wrong !!!!! It's &quot;cold&quot;, heartless, overproduced, flat. Of course there are few tunes, but production (by Peter Collins) ruined the good part of them. If you wanna know, I gave (for free) my copy of COunterparts to a friend of mine. I really tried to enjoy it, but that was not possible, so bad that album is.
This was one of the most boring albums that I got to listen to!  I can't believe that Phil Collins made this album in 1993! After all those classic '80s albums, he comes up with this album that put me to sleep during much of it.  &quot;Both Sides of the Story&quot; is very hip-hoppish in terms of the beats, but that's the only good song on here.  The rest of the album is a bunch of bland ballads, badly performed songs that don't rock and just uninteresting songs to me. Just drags for much of its 68 minutes!!!!!  Phil can defend this album, but I just don't like this one.  His later albums were far better than this dull effort!
I wouldn't be surprised if this was the worst CD in my collection. For some odd reason I thought it would be a good idea to get my first Jewel CD and this one should be it. I don't understand how anyone could sit through this whole CD because it's boring, pointless and a big waste of time. Not to mention 13 or so bucks down the drain.Who Will Save Your Soul and You Were Meant For Me are this CDs best tracks. Foolish Games isn't bad either. But sadly, it wasn't enough to save us from the other tracks' suckage.The worst part is that almost all of the songs sound the same.1 star.
I bought this album based on the first single &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul&quot;, which was a good song.  I think the 2nd single had also come out but I hadn't heard it yet.  I figured it to be an enjoyable listen based on that first single as well as my enjoyment at the time of other varied female artists like Alanis Morissette, Natalie Merchant, and No Doubt's Gwen Stefani.  Well, after one tedious listen I was disgusted that I had actually spent money on such drivel.  I sold it back within a week of purchase.  The songs are whiney and pretentious, and it amazes me how many people think that based on these songs this woman is an &quot;angel&quot; of sorts.  Here's what an angel she is:  my wife (fiancee at the time) was working at a record store in New York where Jewel was promoting a book of poetry.  A fan said &quot;I love you, Jewel&quot;, and she responded, &quot;Shut up, you punk!&quot;  As a result, several people returned their signed copies of her poetry book for a refund.  When Gwen Stefani sings, you can tell she feels what she sings.  Jewel is just a phony, and her &quot;sweet voice&quot; is overrated as well.
I just didn't like this album....and I had been a fan for about 5 years when I bought it.  To this day, I still just can't get into it...and I have been a fan for 12 years now.  It just seemed sooo....soft.  PRESTO, ROLL THE BONES, SIGNALS, or MOVING PICTURES are so much better.  Like another reviewer said, don't start with RUSH through this album.  Their older stuff is much better...and the newer things since 1996 are too.  Put this one in your collection...but be guaranteed that it will collect dust much faster than the other RUSH albums will.
I have been a Rush fan since the mid 1980's, and was actually turned onto them by a OOP record called album called "Archvies" which was a 3record set of the first 3 Rush albums. From there I was hooked. Since I decided to take this CD for a Spin again for the first time in many years, it still does the same thing for me when I first purchased it. NOTHING!  I understand that true Rush fans will look into the work of the musicanship, and some fans based positive reviews for that aspect alone. Hey, don't get me wrong, there are some cool things here (some nice drum work, some good solos..but that is about it. The song writing is really lame. Dogyears is the cheesiest thing I have ever heard from Rush (except maybe roll the bones) and the rest of the album does nothing. I understand that Rush has turned away from its epic storytelling over the years and we will never again here anything like 2112 again. But thats no excuse to write such a poor album, espically to follow up Counterparts (which is in my opinion the best Rush record since Grace under Pressure, and definalty the heaviest. Stay away from this..Rush can do better then this..and since I had such a bad taste in my mouth from this album, I ignored Vapor Trails, but I have heard some cuts off of it, and it sounds a whole lot better. Why any true Rush fan would love this album is beyond me. Maybe the fans who grew up with their mid 80's work and really dont listen to the older stuff might like it. But I really doubt any person who thinks Farewell to Kings, Hemisphers, and  2112 were the best albums they did, would find this remotly interesting. DO yourself a favor..Avoid this and just pretend it didnt happen
Phil Collins at his worst &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; is awful. The title song is a joke and sounded very forced, like he rushed to make and bring out a song from the subpar album. The single &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; has no rhythm much less a hook. If people thought his album &quot;Both Sides&quot; was bad and I am not one of them, then this album will make the think again, when was the last time a Phil Collins album only produced one song. The thing that is a shame about this album is &quot;It's In Your Eyes&quot; a song that could have done well if it was a follow up to a bad song, and wasn't released right away. This album is a far cry from the &quot;...But Seriously&quot;, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; days. &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; is one of the worst albums I own, and I own some bad ones, thank goodness Phil redeemed himself with &quot;You'll Be In My Heart&quot; from &quot;Tarzan&quot;. Phil will release better material than &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; let's hope, from one of the best male voices in music.
Okay, I don't think My Chemical Romance could churn out a song as banal or inane as "Speed King" if they tried, and that's the second-best song on the album. Anybody else seeing a problem? This erases all the effort by superior acts like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix to establish rock as a legitimate art form. Take "Bloodsucker". It's even duller than "Speed King", believe it or not. Three of these songs run at epic lengths, including one ("Child in Time") being stretched longer than ten - "Child" has got to be the most painful song Purple ever recorded, a blundered attempt to combine opera (listen to Gillan's shrieking vocal histrionics and Jon Lord's painful haunted-house organ) and hard rock (listen to Blackmore's unspectacular, clumsy, loud pentatonic twiddling). Sounds interesting in theory, but it's a good thing virtually nobody else tried this. I can't call it the worst song on the album because it gave me a good chuckle (which I'm sure wasn't intended), but it sure comes pretty close. The other two ("Flight of the Rat", "Hard Lovin' Man") are basically just your average Deep Purple songs (or, should I say, sub-average Deep Purple songs) dragged out as long as possible. Ouch. "Into the Fire" is everything I hate about Deep Purple: soulless and derivative, with Gillan wailing away as usual. I'm sorry, but I don't like his voice. At all. Now I do like "Livin' Wreck" - cool riff, interesting drumming - but it's almost ruined by Ian's shrieked backup vocals. This is insipid, soulless, and overrated. So's Deep Purple. Go figure.
led zeppelin was much much better! i don't like this album at all! this was a commecial album! no good songs!
When I bought this Seals & Crofts' "Greatest Hits" few years ago, I expected to get the whole package of hits, including "My Fair Share" and "Get Closer", among other great S&C; songs that are not included in this compilation.Now these 'funny' guys at Rhino, just reissue the same album with a slightly 'masked' edition... The same songs, nothing extra... What's wrong with you, Rhino guys???...
THis is the wortst Van Halen album. 29 minutes long, filled with covers and second-rate compositions by the band. But fans are fans and forget to see how this is a product clearly released in a hurry, just to satisfy record deals with the record company. Except LITTLE GUITARS, ... . For your information, I sold my copy of this "thing" a few days ago.
If you have tha bad luck of owning this CD by VAN HALEN, there's still time to sell it... THis is the worst VAN HALEN album in the DAvid Lee Roth era, simple as that. Only two good songs here: LITTLE GUITARS and SECRETS. The rest is discardable.
ZZ Top you hate em or you love em. I dont hate these guys but i just honestly dont like really any of the songs on this album except three, Sharp Dressed Man, LA Garange, and Tush. Every other song on here i really hate ecsepcially, "Planet Of Woman", or "Legs". ZZ Top all they do is sing about hot women and getting some. Thats there whole basis for there band thats it every song thats what they sing about. Arrggg whats next Journey, "Be Good To Yourself", come on people pick up Dark Side Of The Moon instead of this shameless music
One of the most polemic Madonna`s albums, &quot;Erotica&quot; is also one of the weakest, providing some controversy due to its taboo subjects (at least at the time it came out) but failing to engage and surprise on a musical level. Madonna`s image and attitude usually come before her music, and in &quot;Erotica&quot; this is more than evident. Although somewhat stylish and with a cool atmosphere, this record is too flat, linear, unsurprising and forgettable. It seems like a collection of fillers and b-sides with two or three decent songs that appear randomly (the title track and &quot;Rain&quot;, the latter being completely out of place here). Most of the moments here are weak and dated, consisting of quasi trip-hop rythms, club-oriented tracks and pop/jazz/spoken word whispers that recall the early nineties dance scene but aren`t very engaging or captivating songs. Most of them are too cold, distant and create little or no effect. The record is also too long and by the middle of it all the songs seem to sound the same, generating a bland and generic pop album. Despite the shock factor and (anti)hype, &quot;Erotica&quot; is a weak and uninspired effort, a product of its time that doesn`t make much sense today, both musically and thematically.For fans only, but overall devoid of interest.
For all The Fuss About this Disc it didn't Match the Hype at all.Deeper&amp;Deeper is the Only song worth Remembering here.very bad Club Music.This Album is Very Lame.
this is a terrible album! the riffs are bad and the lyrics are bad! there's better albums! try somethin' like led zeppelin!
This is supposed to be techno? If that's the case, then 'N Sync must be a hardcore punk band. I've listened to the tracks and there is no bold reinvention, no meaningful lyrics, no substance at all - just a somewhat technologically-advanced version of the adult contemporary pap Madonna has always recorded. She somehow managed to turn what should have been 15 minutes of fame into 15 years, but it wasn't her music or singing that did it. Her voice is still painfully thin and often nasal, the music is nowhere near as entrancing as REAL techno, and the lyrics rehash the same themes.  Take this example: Apparently Madonna has a fleeting interest in becoming a neurosurgeon, as we've concluded from these lyrics - you've got &quot;You're frozen when your heart is not open&quot; from &quot;Frozen&quot;, and &quot;Your heart is not open so I must go&quot; from &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot;. Many of the other lyrics also sound like a self-absorbed pat on the back, but that's to be expected from Madonna. Anyway, most techno sounds better without lyrics/vocals unless they add something bold and interesting to the songs (like Underworld and Apollo Four Forty) - that's not the case with the dull and predictable Ray Of Light. Trust me, once you get into some real techno (not some adult contemporary act who's desperately trying to make teenagers think she is cool) you'll forget this ever existed.
this disc is one of the most overrated ever.her voice sounds as bad as ever and the music has been done back in the 80's.the group garbage did a better job at the eletronica thing.remember erotica? did it already and it  wasn't good then and isn't good now.her first album and bed time stories  are far better.and awards don't make a lasting album.
this is for lost teenagers who want to experiment drugs, and promiscuous sex.
I'm amazed at the reviewers below who state that Leather Jackets is not one of Elton's best, but nevertheless give it 5 stars anyway.  The purpose of writing these reviews, after all, is to help potential buyers make  choices; this is not an Elton John fan forum.That said, to anyone who  might be contemplating buying this album, I have two words of advice: Stay  Away!  Take it from an EJ fan who's familiar (and objective) with all of  his work.  This one's a real stinker.  Even the borderline-hit Heartache  Over the World is mediocre; it only sounds decent because the songs  surrounding it are sub-par.  The only winner on this album, in my opinion,  is Hoop of Fire, a really lovely R&amp;B ballad.  The rest of this record,  though, is mechanical, synthesizer-driven, boredom.  The picture of Elton  looking tough as a motorcycle gang member is awful funny, but it ain't  worth the price of the CD.
Words cannot describe my intense dislike for Jimi's guitar "skills". This guy is a HACK. All songs sound exactly the same, the drummer is weak, does the bassist even exist? Listen to some REAL music that actually requires talent- like Nickelback!
When you start with cheesy, synthesized, over-blown, boring, soulless music arrangements it doesn't much matter who's singing...and no one singing on any of these songs does Elton John any favors...and Elton does himself a huge disservice singing such garbage.  Not one decent song exists on this CD.  One might ask, for example, &#34;Why not include the original terrific duet 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' with Kiki Dee?&#34;...because that would have made every other song sound *obviously* like complete and total junk.Elton John has made so many worthy albums in his career; do yourself a favor and avoid this one, please.
I was at the CD store at the mall and the cashier asked if they could help me find anything. I said that I wanted to get a live album so he said "You got to hear Live At Leeds by The Who!! It's the greatest live album ever!". If you've read my previous reviews I have expressed by dislike for The Who and how I think they're generic classic rock for aging hippies, but I decided to give them a second chance. Bad idea! The singer's voice was cracking throughout the album, the drumming is sloppy and all over the place, there is WAY too much talking between songs, the guitar is below mediocre and the bass sounds ridiculously bad. All of the songs are boring, unoriginal and all sound the same. I'm returning to the mall tomorrow to trade it in and use my money on another Nickelback poster.For some REAL great live albums you should listen to these instead:Live at Sturgis 2006- NickelbackLive Trucker- Kid RockWhere The Light Is- John MayerThe Final Riot!- ParamoreTonight Not Again/Live at Eagles Ballroom- Jason Mraz
I got this album as a gift. Thank goodness cause all the tracks on the album is BAD. Very bad. It's unlistenable.
When I first bought this album in 1983, it had an excellent 5:20 version of &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, the highlight of the whole album (next to the title track). When the first CD of &quot;Rio&quot; came out, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; was much shorter (like they wanted to hurry up and get it over with). This shorter version killed the appeal of the whole CD for me. I hoped someday they would re-release &quot;Rio&quot; as &quot;the original vinyl version.&quot; I thought that day came this past July 3rd, 2001. I was let down again. The same short version of &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, but now remastered. Sad! Would anyone like to take this lame CD off my hands AGAIN? Never mind, I'll go trade it for something else somewhere. The closest we're going to get to the original vinyl version of &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; is on the &quot;Night Versions&quot; collection. Not exactly the same, but close.  Since Capitol created this confusion back then, why didn't they just feature the alternate tracks as &quot;bonus tracks&quot; to make everyone happy?
This is my introduction to APP. I don't recognise anything vaguely like prog-rock or concept album. Sure, the lyrics are all about the moral degradation of society, but that does not make for a concept album and this is hardly original subject matter. And as a collection of pop songs, neither does it work. It all sounds too much like low-grade Supertramp. Shrill vocals, predictable boring pop beats, nothing at all noteworthy in the musicality of the band... only diehard fans would make apology for this. As a newcomer I find this such a poor album that I doubt whether I want to hear any more of APP. IF you want 80s pop rather get the real stuff like Thompson Twins or Yazoo. Utter disappointment all round and I would give this 0 stars if the site would allow that, meaning that I rate it so poorly that I think it should never have been recorded.
When Whitney aproached to make her third album she stood by some old time friends, but she managed to team up with the famous producing team of Babyface and LA Reid, somehow that came as a tragical direction for Whitney...she sounded like she wanted to fit in a musical style that wasn't her...but great tracks came as a result &quot;My Name Is Not Susan&quot; although the title is corny and stupid...the song chorus and beat managed to stay in a great taste that captures the late 80's beats, &quot;I'm Your Baby Tonight&quot; first single managed to reached #1 , gracefully because it was a Whitney Houston but it was really far from Whitney's classic upbeat songs, &quot;All The Man That I Need&quot; is one of the songs that really stand aside from the filler cuts that crowed this LP, and surprise this wasn't produced by Babyface....so this album should be call the album that &quot;almost&quot; killed Houston career, saved later by The Bodyguard smashing soundtrack.
how did this group ever blow up in the first place? point of no return&amp;let me be the one are just the same song formula.with the weak  take that goes for Latin pop today they would be huge.
The oversampling is poor and teh compressin is all Wrong in the left channel so i can only give this a One star.  Wait for the SACD to come out to see if they improve the sound.  Seriously, how can anyone with ears listen to this mess of a production?
Before he became a first amendment hero John Denver was an exponent of tortuous schmaltzy schlock country like this album. If Tipper Gore had suggested banning music like this the country would have made HER president.
LIZ PHAIR "Exile in Guyville" is at best a demo disc -- mainly aimed at stoned-out hippies and 'rug munching' feminists who blame men for their problems.  Maybe "Lizzie's Lezzie Laments" or "I Gotta Lotta Chips on My shoulders" would have been more appropriate album titles.To begin with, it's unlistenable -- the vocals sound like someone practicing in the bathroom -- off key, not well structured, and sloppily delivered.The instrumental parts sound so generic, trite and un-inspired, that it's probably best that they're mixed down a bit.  They remind one of summer camp sing alongs or the lame folkie-stuff they play at 'progressive' churches.The lyrics alternate between whining about others (the first 2 songs, anmong others), to whining about being unappreciated ('Canary', [...] And Run', etc.) to generic whining (most of the other songs).If Liz Phair is an exile in guyville, then it seems it is by her own deliberate choices.It's obvious why she's been sidelined, and why no one (except dorky music critics) thinks she's even close to being cool. No ROCK Fan will find anything redeeming about this collection of reject-songs. They were ignored upon initial release in 1993 -- and deservedly so.Addumdum:based on the feedback, it seems more people read (and raacted to) this review than bought the actual CD.  The fact that people can't even get $0.01 here on Amazon.com speaks volumes -- the public agrees with this review, and has not bought the hype (or the CD).
This is the only place in the world where a fat,ugly drug dealer can become a star.His voice is mediocre and he wouldnt of got anywhere without poop diddy.The beats to the songs on this album are okay but are nothing special.Overall, this album lacks substance and creativity.Too many sampled parts in the music and poop diddys voice is annoying.He glorified violence and ignorance so thats what led to his demise.He is way overrated like 50 cent and eminem.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
STOP OVERRATING THIS CD BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALL OF THAT! THE BEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME IS TUPAC. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR REAL MUSIC, CHECK OUT TUPAC'S CDS.
about this being the greatest double c.d. and all that other [stuff], "all eyez on me" was and still is the greatest double album and in fact album period. i only like "notorious thugs" in this whole album, westcoast for like man, 2pac is still ballin homies.
This album is way too overrated by all the controversy surrounding it.The fact is that this album really sucks and is a poor excuse to make money by poop diddy.There are only 5 good songs out of 26 total songs on the album.All the rest are only filler material.This rapper died because the rap world is full of criminals,materialism,greed and jealousy.This guy is no angel himself because he used to sell crack for his own materialistic ends and never really helped his own community when he could have.DO NOT BUY THIS SUCKY CD!!!
Im a big hip hop fan, my favorites being Drake, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, Limp Bizkit, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer... but lately ive noticed alot of folks seem to dislike good musicz. Back in the 90s MC Hammer and Vanilla ice created Hip Hop & Rap. things were great before fakes started taking over the scene! Studio gangsters like NWA, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Ice Cube, 2Pac, and Notorious BIG became famous and everyone forgot about good music like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice.Anywho..this Notorious BIG guy faked his death to make more money! I mean comon, its sooooooo obvious hes not dead. If he were dead than why would his album still be for sale?  Not to mention he cant rap and his beats suck!! Stupid songs like "Notorious Thugs" and "hypnotize" have STUDIO GANGSTER written all over them!For good hip hop stick with Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Akon, and Lil Drake.
Puff dud or poop diddy whatever his name is must really be desperate for some fast cash with the release of this garbage.What an opportunity to exploit his friends death and make some money by stealing the police song every breath you take and renaiming it &quot;ill be missing you&quot;.Everybody knows that puff daddy was never really friends with biggie and used him only to make more money.P diddy was responsible for the deaths of 9 people for failing to do his job as an event promoter and he let his so called friend go to jail for him.People you must ask yourself if this is the type of of self centerd and greedy human being you would want to support with your money.This man has absolutely no talent as he steals other hits and calls them his own.To conclude,Im very surprised no one has sued p diddy for beat jacking and I would really give this cd 0 stars if I could.Have a nice day.
Puff Daddy came from nowhere and become on of the most selling rap artists of the remaining decade after this cd was released, but was it really that good?. "No way out" got to be one of the most commercial and overhyped albums of the 90's. Most of the songs were samples nah i rather say covers and Puff is far from a songwriter and producer as he claims to be, neither he is a very good rapper. He has to thank Biggie Smalls for the huge success of "I've been missing you" cause if it wasn't for his tragic death i don't think Puffy's, sorry diddy's career ever would have kicked off. "I'll be missing you" was more of less a cover of The Police 1983 hit "Every Breath you take" only diffrence was diddy's rap. And the Rap was as commercial as it could be, i think i've learned it word by word after hearing it twice, but that's the plan ofcourse. The easier a song get's in your head the better it sells. Diddy continued with other "covers" such as "Been around the world" based on the hook from Lisa Stansfield's "All around the world" from 1990 and David Bowie's 1983 hitt "Let's dance" as the melody, Diddy and Mase teamed up here more annoying then ever. "Can't nobosy hold me down" was a remake of the classic 80's rap song "The Messeage from Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, not very fun when a rap song is beeing remade by other artists but diddy hadn't had enough here cause he later covered Public Enemy's "Public Enemy #1". We hear Lil Kim on "Don't Stop What You're Doing", and boring "it's all about the benjamins", I liked "Senorita" though but the good part is the melody not the rap. This cd sure helped Diddy and his bad boy's friend earn some cash and fame but it never gave anyone of them the reputation as good musician, Mase retired when people got annoyed by him, Puff Daddy, i mean P. Diddy is still around but his success has decreased, still he's "producing" and appearing on pretty much stuff but i doubt his popularity will ever be as big as it was when this album came out and thanks god for that.
i wish he would stop ruining records that i grew up on.he can't rap the music is cheesy and is embarassing.how do so many bums today get record deals? not an ounce of originality in there pinky.playing over songs is not  creative.where have the standards gone? he gets the most blame cuz he is  the most influential rapper out there period.until folks stop all this  endless sampling then puffy is there leader.a mind is a terrible thing to  waste.
Puffy is the worst rapper ever! Correction: Puffy's ghostwriters are the worst ghostwriters ever! Puffy's delivery is deadly dull and the beats ruin every timeless classic he sampled. It's true that other producers sample beats but the difference is that they make you appreciate those classics Puffy makes you hate those classics. Standout Tracks: Every song featuring Biggie might have been a standout track if puffy wasnt on them! Filler: Pain, Cant nobody hold me down, Friend, Is this the end, Been around the world, Dont stop what youre doing and the rest of the album! Puffy is where hip hop went wrong so unless you are ready to hold him responsible for his actions(opening up the door for hip pop icons) dont bash jafool into oblivion for participating in hip hop's destruction!
despite going over to ruff ryders who are as terrible as puffy when it comes to that stuff they call music this group is weak.they have no flow or feeling in there work.puffy tried to give them character and they still  stunk up the disc.and now with the way overrated ruff ryders  production&amp;crew it will get even worse.
This is so wack Common ripped them so bad . Yo Common told Mack 10 he ain't no Mack 10 he's a 22 .Ice cube just got shredded and after his first album it was a wrap . He was better of getiing his money snatch by Eazy E and Jerry Heeler .When I get my deal they will get dissed so nasty but not W.C because I like his music
Yet another crap cd by a crap producer slash whatever.This cd has no rhythm and is chalk full of the same stereotypical nonsense which is expected from hip hop.Only a person with the intelligence level of a fourth grader would buy this garbage.I cant wait for the demise of this trend called hip hop which is rotting our ears on the radio on a daily basis.Its only a matter of time that this genre of simple minded music gets exposed for how unoriginal and ridiculous it really is. .....
I had forgotten all about this crap until I was watching &quot;I Love The '90s&quot; last night, and &quot;Make 'Em Say Uhh&quot; was one of the vid picks. All the commentators were basically making fun of it (DMC from Run DMC saying Master P probably came up with the lyrics while on the john). What did you expect? People PRAISING this? People even COMPLIMENTING this? Hell no! This was the official declaration that real, respectable rap was dead and buried, and annoying, unimaginative dreck was here to stay!Back in 1998 (I think), this was the new low for not only rap, not only music, but American pop culture as we know it. I mean, we have the same stupid &quot;DUN DUN! DUN DUN!&quot; beat going the whole time, and then the brilliant lyrics: &quot;MAKE EM SAY UHHHH! UHHHH! NA NA NA NA!&quot; Compared to that, &quot;On Top Of Spaghetti&quot; rivals anything from Maynard James Keenan. This was a total &quot;style-over-substance&quot; kind of... erm, &quot;album&quot;. I could come up with a better song in my sleep. And people actually bought into this? And the rest of No Limit's god-awful catalogue?? Yeccch! Sorry people, but a shiny cover with lots of pretty colours does not a good album make. It's because of &quot;Masta PPPPPPPPPP&quot; that we have unlistenable crap like DMX and Ja Rule. So thanks, Master P. Thanks for contributing to the official downfall of respectable rap music as we know it. (At least Cypress Hill and the Beasties are still going strong.)Eric &quot;Eazy E&quot; Wright must be spinning in his grave.Shhhh... now here comes my favorite part... this is where the offended mental midget clicks the &quot;Not Helpful&quot; button...
This piece of ignorant trash single-handedly ruined rap music, misled a generation, and destroyed the hip hop culture. These five fakers exploited the pathology of ghetto culture that NONE of them really lived in, and brainwashed many impressionalbe young people (many whom I've mentored at my job) who had no one else in their homes or hoods to teach them any better,into thinking that gang life, violence, and disrespecting women were cool! Thanks, NWA, for making a bad situation worse while laughing all the way to the bank! May hell be your next spot and may your CD's be used for skeet shooting!
The fact that Ice Cube left N.W.A to make trash like this only speaks about his crediblity. He should just stay acting and stay off the music buisness.
This mess marks a low point in rap lyrics. While it is musically tight, the crude rants against Whites and Jews (True to the Game) women (Nappy Dugout), Asians (Black Korea) and speeches from the late super-lunatic madman supreme Khallid Muhammad, one can hear Dr. Martin Luther King spinning in his grave in Atlanta. In 1959, the good Dr. warned against Blacks &quot;stooping to the low and primitive methods and rhetoric of our enemies&quot; and this is it! However, while Cube was supposedly all 'fight the power&quot; and militant, he was also a spokesman for St. Ides Malt Liquor and songs like &quot;Nappy Dugout&quot; did nothing to uplift Black people. The fact is, this kind of garbage sold well among confused and misguided Black people (and some equally maladjusted Whites) with no direrction in the early 90s and when the market for such junk (mercifully) died out, Cube went back to gangster rapping. Hypocrisy or hatred, take your pick.
When BTNH came out, they were still attached to Eazy-E and the only difference in the dumb NWA-style "gangsta" rap and theirs was the speed.  This may be a "classic" rap album, but to make it onto a "classic rap albums" list, your CD has to be absolute trash, so I don't like this one.  The newer stuff is better.
It would seem that Weezer's recent track "Beverly Hills" is one of few I like from the group, for this album didn't really appeal to me at all. In many cases, especially for track #9 (Holiday), the lyrics are hugely lame, sometimes trying to fit the word "anyway" into one syllable, or choosing the topic of destroying sweaters. Despite this, I was able to mildly enjoy two tracks on this C.D., one of them being "Buddy Holly". This tune is a blend of hard guitars and a melody somewhat similar to Waltzing Matilda. Once again the lyrics are pretty uninteresting, but the progressions and all are fairly good. This song  and many of the other tracks are actually very similar to The Ramones, for the chord progressions used are often simple, and when combined with the vocals have a very comparable feel. I would definitely not recommend Weezer's blue album, for what this band is doing on it isn't all that exciting.Recommended tunes:Buddy HollyUndone- the Sweater Song
I mean what the fudge is this, you call this spit hip hop.... I wasted my dollars.  I am not feelin or have any comprehension for this style of dark, fake Dr. Funkinstein or whatever.  I tried to have an open mind and listened a second time but I could not find a song title, track, beat, rhyme, flow or concept that I could get with and I am an openminded individual, trust.
Wings specialty was the blandly innocuous; the band was basically the Huey Lewis of the seventies, but without the sense of dumb fun. On this album, McCartney makes some stabs at Hard Rock, this makes it worse than the average Wings album, is it the worst one ever? Perhaps, then again, who cares?
I dug His Anger about The Problems Facing Brothers&amp;All but the Music was Super Wack.and the only Gem is Brenda's Got A Baby.He Would Get Better with the Music&amp;the Words.but this Album Compared To Ice Cube's  Amerikkka's Most Wanted is Tame.he was going for the same vibe&amp;results  but he comes up empty except for Brenda's.
I know a lot of you might say this album is hot or classic because it's Tupac but you have to be real with yourself.  This album is one of his weakest.  Brenda's Got a Baby is the only great track on this album.  Nas, Jay, and Biggie all dropped classics on their debut but it took Pac 4 albums to finally get there.  He's a legend no doubt, but just because you love Pac don't lie to yourself and say this album is great.  Though Pac didn't do too well on this album, it is nice to see that he was trying to rap way back in '93.  Once the east/west war started though, that's when he finally got popular and started making decent music.  RIP Tupac.
OKay rza did his job as far as the beats on diz album ? Classic but the lirycs ? Awfull... I got diz only enjoy the beats but cappa is horrible @ rhyming. Skip & copy gza's liquid swords or ghost's ironmman...
i am not sure what it is but after BFP i think tori is cranking out the same old same old.  her style has NOT chnaged at all and this album just added to the mix of mediocrity.  her best work remains her 1st album LITTLE EARTHQUAKES.  everything after that is ok but her magic is gone and the quality get worse with each album.  if you want some vintage tori see also the CRUCIFY EP
What has the rap world gone to? I am a big rap fan and I own like, Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Master P, Dr. Dre, etc., and this is just terrible. I own this cd. It sucks. That's just the way it is. The only good songs on there are Beware, Still not a Player, and Punish Me. The rest is just ... trash.  I don't like it one bit. Don't buy it.
I've heard Big Pun as a guest artist on a few cuts and have liked those cuts very much but I was extermely disappointed with Capital Punishment.  All I can say is that it's standard fare from today's group of  rappers.Hopefully his future efforts will be more musically engaging.
I dug Still Not a Player but the Music&amp;the vibe didn't really hit home.but Pun was A Cool Cat.he deserved better Material than the stuff he got.Maybe given sometime down the Line His Stuff Might have Gotten Better  but this Album&amp;His Last One are Typical Industry Projects.He had some  flow but the overall Feel goes Nowhere.
I LIKE MAXWELL BUTTHIS ALBUM WAS BLENDEDTOO MUCH YOUCAN BARELYTELL THE SONGS APARTFROM ONE ANOTHERTHAT'S WHY I GAVE ITONE STAR IF ONLYTHERE WAS SOME DIVERSITYHERE WITH THE TRACKS I WOULDHAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS.
First off all snoop is a big sellout now and this is where it started.He used to diss the eastside of rap and now hes with the eastsidaz and working with master p.What a hypocrite and a sellout.The beats on this album are lame and theres probably only one good song on the entire album.It wouldnt surprise me if he started working with poop diddy since he is a sellout.Snoop needs to retire and become a comedian because he sure is one funny looking guy.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
Snoop had the voice in the early to mid 90's.He was Rap's Version of Michael Jackson and Dr.Dre was The Quincy Jones.but after Dre Left Death Row Snoop was Forced To Play 2nd FIddle to 2pac and Never Recovered.The  Dogg Father was Wack but not as Bad as This Mess.No-Limit &amp;Their  Beat-less Crew make a Mockery of Snoop here.Gin&amp;Juice11&amp;Woof are  some of the Worst Tracks Snoops ever Recorded.well this Album is The Worst  on a Whole.His Last Album was a step back in the Right Direction but he is  one of those Artists that You Wonder What if?Instead of Getting Watered  Down.for a while He was The Voice but you have to wonder how many more  Albums Like This Before folks are thru with him?
Positives: I'm hard pressed to find positive things to say about this record. Snoop is one of the greatest and Doggystyle proved he can make premium rap music.Negatives: This album proved Snoop is also not afraid to fall flat on his face. I don't know where to begin on this album. Any tracks that aren't &quot;No Limitized&quot; are just too soft. Snoop has that kind of soft flow but tracks like &quot;Show Me Love&quot; &amp; &quot;Doggz Gonna Get Ya&quot; are not his patented gangster rap norm. I don't know how I managed to stick with Snoop after this attempt. Every other record Snoop has ever and will make is better than this one.
If I ever hear another song from her again, I'm just going to go freakin crazy!
Rob Zombie seems to be more of a Gimmick than real Artist.it's loud&amp;brash fit for MTV but just listening to this as a whole is a bad joke to the mind&amp;ears.
This is the only country in the world where people with no talent can brag about what other people give them and make lots of money.The cd probably has only 2 songs worth listening to and the rest is pure filler material.The beats are simple as could be expected and the lyrics are even simpler.Its commercial hip hopers like this clown who are eventually going to lead to the demise of hip hop one day.I cant believe people are not tired already of the same mindless drivel from these commercial sellouts.People are just throwing their money away and supporting their rich lifestyles.DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING FROM HIM AND VOTE FOR MY REVIEW.
Most overrated rapper of all time!This album is wack!All the beats are simple and the lyrics are boring.All he raps about is money,cash,hoes,cars,and how tough or great he is.That Hard knock life song was garbage!Joe camel gets worst and worst as time goes on.Save your money and don't by this garbage!
this group is way overrated.one beat and the same song over&amp;over again.if you put beck into the group could you tell the difference? it's mindless weak boring music.
Let me just say that I'm not a hater of boy bands or pop music.  I like pop actually and some boy bands' songs.  I just happen to think that this particular band makes really boring music with no beat and no really special vocals.  Nothing about this CD sets it apart accept for it's extreme blandness.
another one trick pony group.no talent at all.they do run of the mill music and it is really bad.you can put all the boy bands together and you might get one good song? no you won't.
I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this crummy CD. 98 Degrees is the worst group EVER! They are the only group I ever have given 1 star, and the completely deserve it. They are so boring and sound like a bunch of girls on this CD. Their only bearable song ever was &quot;Give Me One Night (Una Noche)&quot; if you like it, though, DON'T buy this. It's not like anything on here.
Though a child of the 1980s, "An Innocent Man" always sounded to me like an album of no substance merely because it seemed to lack the power that I found back in the 1990s in almost all of Billy Joel's other works.Nowadays, it is clear to me that a good deal of the apparent power in 1980s music is pure pomp. This, though, makes "An Innocent Man" look even more like an album made for the pre-rock masses still very much an important presence during the 1980s.Indeed, it is fair to say that most of the songs on "An Innocent Man" do not have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. The title tune, which has at least some weight in it, sounded really slushy even at the time it was released because of the way in which Joel's voice was put so far up front - at least during the chorus.The other hit single from this album are much, much worse."The Longest Time" was undoubtedly one of the worst moments in pop music history: a hit single so lightweight that it was and is incredibly plain that no melody existed in Joel's near-spoken voice: he never had any pretensions to be a poet, and no song could show this better. "Tell Her About It" and "Leave A Tender Moment Alone" were also flyweight in texture and had not a single memorable hook line or melody. Even the soulful "Tell Her About It" was redeemed only by its extreme catchiness, but catchiness is something to be expected from a singer who was the most popular musician in Australia for fifteen years. The song itself was lacking in emotion compared with Joel's other albums, and it has dated so much that it is seldom played even on classic hits radio.If you don't want to stay in the 1980s, there is no need to buy this even if you like some other Billy Joel album.
If this is her big comeback cd, she should be afraid, very afraid.  Listening to this stuff, and the techno remixes of it in the clubs was was like a combination of waking up from a huge hangover and watching a movie, but the second and third reels of the film are missing. I was left really confused at hearing this stuff. This is Whitney Houston's new career saver and new sound? Sorry, but your time has come and gone, and that time was back in the 80s and early 90s.  You've lost that great voice that once couldn't be topped, and now she's doing forgettable junk that sounds like throwaways that other artists passed on.  Honestly, her last greatest cd was The Bodyguard Soundtrack. What a waste of a talent. Guess that's what happens when you marry Bobby Brown: you hang out with a loser and sooner or later you become one. Whitney is no winner with this dud. I'm only rating it one star for the song I Learned The Best From You. I rest of the cd is so forgetable i couldn't recall it if i tried.
Ice Cube was yet to release a bad album when this came out. I decided to buy it since Ice Cube is one of my favorite artists, but there isn't 1 good track on this entire CD. It is truly the only album I own that I would give a 1 star rating to, and I have some other fairly bad albums. Please do not listen to this if you want to hear good Ice Cube, any other release from him will do, but not this. His lyrics have gotten to be stupid at times, but by far the worst aspect of this album is the TERRIBLE production. I am not feeling the whole rock vibe at all, I mean it's cool Cube is expanding his musical horizons, but this isn't that way to do. Thankfully Cube's nex release, Volume 2 The Peace Disk was much better.
Baby,all you're diary entries can't be songs!Alanis is surely one of the most pretenious,boring,annoying,andself-absored women in pop.No substance and no sense of humor.Howin the world does this woman sell records? Does Madonna and the folks at Maverick persaude Madonna's huge fanbase to buy it or something? I'm not trying to down all of Alanis' fans because like another pretenious,dull singer/songwriter I dislike Tori Amos a lot of people have healed to her music.This isn't a diss to Alanis' fans but to Alanis herself.Hey,since she's so self-important maybe she'll take a trip to India(which inspriredthis album's first single &quot;Thank U&quot;) again and she'll become so&quot;inspired&quot; that she'll quite singing and I don't know...write a book.Yeah do that Alanis,anything to stop you from making records!
Truthfully, i find Alanis Morissette to be one of the most overhyped, overrated females in music today. I don't care that she has a new cd out called Under Rug Swept which all the fans are gushing over. That song Hands Clean was one of the most overplayed songs on FM radio that summer it was released. What many of her fans seem to forget is that long before she came out with Jagged Little Pill, and long before she started putting her last name on her cds, she was simply known as Alanis and was doing clever and original-sounding dance pop that was fun and exciting, not angry self-absorbed, whiny trips to the psychiatrist's couch, which is what most of her songs now are. Back then she had two excellent dance cds and a promising career as a pop artist. PLUS, check out the photos in the cd booklets of those two early dance cds and you'll see a totally different-looking Alanis. You wouldn't believe the way she used to look. Gorgous as hell, compaired to the dog she is now.  She looked NOTHING like she does now. Man, she was a total babe back then, compared to the way she looks now with her long greasy-looking hair plastered to her head that looks in need of a good shampoo. If you saw the sensual way she used to look you'd think she was just a victim of being lazy about her appearance now.  She totally abandoned her dance pop roots in favor of doing songs that are half  singing and mostly talking over an acoustic guitar riff, with barely any of the lyrics rhyming. I mean the song where she is reading the unsent letters written to her different ex-boyfriends is beyond stupid! She might as well open up the phone book and half read/half sing the names and phone numbers and it would be just as interesting. How about putting in some words that rhyme now and then, Alanis?Otherwise you just come off as some self-indulgent, self-absorbed artsy fartsy who thinks the world wants to hear about all the guys you dated and failed miserably with. I hope Madonna's record company, Maverick, drops you eventually for boring and frustrating us with your whiny rantings. If you're the best Canada has to offer in the music industry then i'm ashamed to say i live in Canada. Go back to the 90s and stay there.
Juvenile is the perfect example of a rapper who waste great beats. He has great beats some better more talented rapper can use but he takes them for his amateur, elementary lyrics. His flow and his delivery is horrible. He has no originality and cant rhyme worth a damn. He just uses "aye" "yeah" "yo" at the end of each line to make it rhyme.Only good thing about the trash is the beats and throwing distance.
The music's terrible.  The lyrics are weak and not creative at all, the beats don't flow like they should, and the background music on all of the songs are annoying.  However... it makes a wonderful object to throw around the house.  Play catch with your dog, it will love it!  Also makes a good hammer too.  The CD will be trashed afterwards... but that's not a bad thing, now is it?The CD actually sounds like it makes sense when it's all scratched up.  It even sounds decent.  Give it a whirl, why don't ya??!!
Listening to this album made me furious!I mean,the Cardigans were once  known for being a 60's style pop band with a special talent to write dreamy  pop songs.Along with the Sundays,Saint Ettienne and Cinnamon,they were one  of those groups which proved that being innocent is not necesserily a bad  point in the music world.So their development was really heart breaking for  me.There's nothing like &quot;Carnival&quot; or &quot;Fine&quot; here.Most  of the tracks are full of loops and enervating refrains.No chance to find a  snare or a xylophone,that's for sure.The &quot;Life&quot; album seems to be  long forgotten by the members of the group.Ofcourse &quot;The first band on  the moon&quot; showed a slight new direction but i could never imagine what  would follow.The thing is that bands like Morcheeba and Garbage can  write  this kind of music surely much better than the Swedes and i also think that  Nina's voice is loosing all it's magic and beautiness by singing all this  electro-junk.This is definetely the biggest dissapointment i ever  experienced as a music fan.
Im a big hip hop fan, my favorites being Drake, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, Limp Bizkit, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer... but lately ive noticed alot of folks seem to dislike good musicz. Back in the 90s MC Hammer and Vanilla ice created Hip Hop & Rap. things were great before fakes started taking over the scene! Studio gangsters like NWA, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Ice Cube, 2Pac, and Notorious BIG became famous and everyone forgot about good music like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice.Anywho..this 2Pac faked his death to make more money! I mean comon, its sooooooo obvious hes not dead. If he were dead than why would his album still be for sale? Not to mention he cant rap and his beats suck!! Stupid songs like "2 of Amerikas Most hated" and "Hit em up" have STUDIO GANGSTER written all over them!For good hip hop stick with Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Akon, and Lil Drake.
Terrible, Terrible. What a waste. These songs sound like they were done overnight. It almost sounded like he had nothing to say. There is prabably 1 good song on the album. This is nothing like the first.
This album is proof that time yields better results.  This sounds like DMX made it in one day.  It really ain't good at all.  Their are a few dope songs, but as an album, this one is garbage.  Dark and Hell Is Hot is leagues and bounds better than this [one].
This album is one of the weakest albums in all of music history.This overrated and weak rapper steals nas's style and the beats are just boring.Same old tired lyrics and production.There is only one song worth listening to.People should just accept the fact that hip hop is headed to the grave and heavy metal will once again rule the world.HEAVY METAL RULES FOREVER!!!
this disc is very flat.i saw it coming when Too Short got down with Jermaine Dupri.this album is nothing but a Commercial Project.it's a sad day when an Artist that has defied the Industry and done his own thing  stoops to this Level.he has lost his edge&amp;flow.
Timbaland ruins this album beatwise. The beats are just weak and Ginuwine's whiny voice just doesn't complement it. There are no standout songs and the album just wanders aimlessly from track to track. No  coherence.
The song Here With Me compelled me to get this album though I wish I didn't. The songs all sound the same: same boring synthesizers and dull vocals. There is no range at all on this CD and the lyrics are basically all about lost love. Dido has a lot of potential but I think this release is boring, uninspired, and not too different from what's already polluting the air waves.
This is the same old ja rule on this album.Weak beats and ridiculous lyrics with an annoying voice.He claims to be gangster but in reality he is just a black justin timberlake.He needs to retire from music and movies because he stinks.DO NOT SUPPORT HIM ANYMORE!!!
Ja Rules best work sounds like Chingy's worst work. Well yeah Chingy is crap as well but at least he doesn't lie to everyone and steal Pac's words and try to act like him. Ja, stop thinking that Pac would roll with you. If Pac was still here he'd diss you, oh no wait. If Pac was still here you wouldn't even be in the game so shut up.It's no wonder 50 disses you so much. And stop talking like your so gangsta, Everyone outside your blind legion of fans knows that your a fake. How dare people have the nerve to call this rubbish straight hip hop. You want straight hip hop?

This album is horrible. It's all over the place. There's no coherence. The music is overproduced and sample heavy. Ja Rule's lyrics are inane and laughable. This album should be canned. Not recommended.
Ja Rule is a freakin disgrace to the rap game! Anybody who buys his album needs their head checked!
they sing and play about peace and love! why? that's terrible! i don't like the vocals either!
i like the first two alright and parts of the third one but this sounds tired and predictable.it sounds rushed and uninspired.i love good 70's sounding music when i hear it.the stevie wonder meets roy ayers thing was  cool but it's become stamped and that's not original.thus far they have put  out better singles than discs for me.
way Too Many people get Deals today.this is a Bad Joke.&amp;HOW DARE HE DO A REMAKE OF RICK JAMES'S COLD BLOODED? RICK James Is THE MAN.Only GOt Your Money is Worth Listening to.it Only makes sense at How Overrated he is cuz  The Whole Wu Tang Clan are Overrated as well.Avoid at all Costs.
I Cant believe i rushed to get this album when it first came out was pretty hyped after the superior debut Return to the 36 chambers.. This album doenst even come close to the production, the wit, the tight but off  the wall rhymes that made his first album  a pretty good effort.. This is  like a slap in the face  oh my god!  why is he trying to sing .. his  remake of the old Rick James classic Cold Blooded is embarassing.. The only  track on this album  is  Got Your Money  avoid this one at all costs  get  his solo debut if you dont have it ..
BLACK ROB HAS GOOD LYRICS I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.BUT THE BEATS ARE WEAK YOU CAN'T POUND YOUR HEAD TO HIS BEATS CAUSE THEY STINK SO BAD.ALOT OF HIS SONGS HAVE THE SAME BELL SOUND BEAT TO IT.HERE'S THE ONLY GOOD TRACKS 2,3,9 AND THE REST STINK.HE SHOULD RETIRE FROM HIS LTTLE SHINE FROM WHOA AND LIFE STORY AND BAD BOY.DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM BADD ENOUGH I REGRET GETTING IT,YOU WILL TO.
Black Rob hit really well with Whoa! but the rest of this disc is forgetable.also way too many Guests to Show off his skills.There's Too Much Puffy Vibe going on.there is a Reason why this Album was in the can for so  Long it's Not very Good.Bad-Boy has Been thru and this is it.
Brian Mcknight has talent but this disc doesn't reflect his own idenity.the material sounds too much like 2nd tier Babyface&amp;R.Kelly.personally i don't think that he is as talented as  those guys.his first album is still his best.
what has happen to Sting? bad enough singing with Puffy and that's pretty low but this 2nd rate rehash? The dreams of Blue turtles&amp;Nothing Like the Sun are brillant.but since then his albums have continued to slide  down.the only song i like is Brand New day with Stevie Wonder on  Harmonica.this material was done better on Nothing Like The Sun.he has  gotten too mellow and predictable.i was hyped with Branford back.but this  is another let down from a talent song-writter and Bass Player.i hope Puffy  hasn't taken away his originality? perhaps getting back with the Police  wouldn't be a bad idea? his music has gotten to be too much of formula.
In this pathetic excuse of a cd and this band is nothing more than a public enemy/RATM (Which I Don't like either except their first album), Rip-Off without the honest truth of the worldIf this band is against america, then play someplace elseDull and uninspired.Nu Metal is Garbage
The music critics that hail Serj Tankian as a great thinker and poet must have a brain about the size of a peanut.  This is supposed to be poetic and socially-conscious?  Well, sure the system isn't perfect, but if they hate it so much, they are more than free to go back to whatever third-world pit they came from.  All they're doing is making absolutely awful &quot;music&quot; with no orchestration, minimal talent, and stupid lyrics.  Okay, so there are three or four songs that are listenable.  The rest is just noise.  Nothing more, nothing that a fifth-grader couldn't do.  This is the epitome of why nu-metal is a gargantuan load of defecation.  It's music by drug fiends, for drug fiends, in a similar vein as rap is.  The American music industry is all too willing to shove garbage like this down people's throats, but they never give any kind of attention to talented bands, even American artists like Iced Earth.  No, we have to listen to three idiots yelling and screaming over shambled noise about why they hate the government and why their lives are a waste.  And there are people out there who find this to be good music.  That's what I call closed-mindedness and poor taste.  I'm all for people's choice in music, but I honestly don't understand what one can find entertaining about this horse dung.
This is the sellout album from dr. dre, remember backin the days of NWA and Death Row he used to be so good and anti-commercial pop, but now he's with pop rap stars themselvesthis album is a mess, poor rapping, good beats aren't enough to save this wreck, Dr. Dre you may have gain respectfor the 106 &amp; Park/TRL Crowd, but you have lost your original 101 proof and respect of 110% percent hardcore gangsta rap and fansand ever since he supported the R.I.A.A And sued napsterDr. Dre has turned into the greediest sellouts since metallica.Take a look at their former co-hortsSpice 1, Kurupt, Scarface, never sold out of their fansthey play at small clubs and give good music to true fansunlike going multiplatinum (with trash) to poser fanslike dr. dre has didDre is nothing with the late tupac shakurwho's probably rolling at his grave sitein north carolina with his ashesDre is nothing without Eazy E And Tupac Shakurnot even close
The Chronic 2001 is one of the worst dr. dre albums ever produced, this is another reason why dr. dre hasn't been the same since he left death row, the production is not as good as it was in the chronic from 1992, although there are a few good songs, but the rest is just godawful, he started paving way for feminem (aka the most overrated rapper of all time) and other stuff to come.It was the major downfall of his career.(Notice the napster thing)Sorry Dr. Dre you are no longer my favorite producer of all time, in fact you been no longer since 1996Just Blaze takes that spot now.Dr. Dre has sold out and forgot about his long time fansIf you want a real dr. dre album, pick up the chronic.
the way she has been written about i thought she might be talented as Tori Amos? wrong.she is more closer to a bargin basement version of Jewel.this cd showcases nothing.weak vocals,lyrics&amp;run of the mill music.
Sadly, Chris Wallace was killed in a hail of gunfire. Releasing a half @$$ed album that tarnishes his reputation is not going to bring him back, and only compounds the tragedy.Frankly, this album is full of half made tracks that never should have been heard (with a few exceptions.) And if you ever want to see an opportunist, look at Puffy. He used his &quot;friend's&quot; death as a spring board to his own superstardom. This is the quintessential sell out in action. Biggie's body wasn't cold before he released several &quot;tributes&quot; which give people the wrong impression of Biggie.One bright spot on this bleak album is &quot;Dead Wrong.&quot; That song is a pretty good intense song.The most tasteless track is &quot;Who Shot Ya.&quot; Do we really need a new Tupac diss AFTER hes already died? Why did Puffy decide to propell this rivalry after it had cost both Tupac's and Biggie's death? Money.Buy &quot;Ready to Die,&quot; or &quot;Life After Death&quot; instead.I'd say &quot;RIP Chris Wallace&quot; here, but after this disgrace, I don't see how thats possible.
I cant believe poop diddy would exploit and profit off of his so called friend by releasing this garbage.Bad boy simply put this cd out just to make more money off of biggie fans.There are too many people featured and biggie doesnt even rap on some songs.Alot of the lyrical content is simply sleazy and filthy.The worst part about it is that poop diddy actually sings on most of this cd because he has an over inflated ego.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
Biggie is one of the greatest east coast rappers to ever come out and his 2 previous albums, Ready to Die and Life After Death, were just 2 timeless classics that will never be forgotten. However, when Born Again came out, it was a whole different story.This album is truly one of the worst rap albums ever put out and it's not Biggie's fault, as many have quoted, but because Poof Diddy was selfish and just wanted to make more money off Biggie. I'm going to keep this short and simple: most of the songs are just complete trash, there are only one or two tracks that are actually worth listening.1. Notorious B.I.G.- 3, not too shabby but not too great, it would have been MUCH better if Lil' Kim and Poof Diddy were left out2. Dead Wrong- 5, great track however I don't think Biggie would have made a track with Eminem3. Hope You Niggas Sleep- 3 and a half, Biggie's verse is tight but when the Hot Boys and Big Timer joins in, it just ruins everything. The Hot Boys and Big Timer are two of the most stupid rappers ever to be put out4. Dangerous MC's- 2, one of the worst songs on the album. The lyrics don't even go with the tune on this and the beat is completely out of time. Every rapper, even Biggie, don't shine on this track. Skip5. Biggie- 4, an alright track with Junior M.A.F.I.A. The beat is average6. Niggas- 2, another horrible track. Do I need to say more?7. Big Booty Hoes- 2, uugggh, truly a track that belongs at the junkyard8. Would You Die for Me- 1, f*ck i hate this track. This is the worst track ever to come out. I hate Lil' Kim so much, she totally ruins this track. The track is just horrible and the lyrics are stupid9. Come On- 2, *yawn*10. Rap Phenomenon- 4, another alright track. Method and Redman shine out here and Biggie completes another great lyric page11. Let Me Get Down- 2, complete utter trash12. Tonight- 3, this is alright. Would have been better if Joe Hooker was left out13. If I Should Die Before I Wake- 5, this is by far the best song on the album. The beat is dark and gritty but incredible, Biggie uses his verse from Big L's track 'DEADLY COMBINATION'14. Who Shot Ya- 5, timeless classic, I love this track to bits. The dark piano piece is one of the best I've heard15. Can I Get Wit Cha- 2, no16. I Really Want to Show You- 4, I can get down with this17. Outro- 1, one of the stupidest outros I've heard. We can find out about Biggie's life on the netAs you can see, this is the worst album to be put out by Biggie or Bad Boy. Bad Boy Records was a disgrace, their only true classics were READY TO DIE and LIFE AFTER DEATH. Do not, and I mean DO NOT, get this album. It is not worth your money. ... Biggie was a classic, this album just shows that Poof wasn't keeping it true to his homeboy. ...
I would like to say that this album is incredible, but I can't. This album was a BIG waste of time and production. Puffy took sampling too far on this album. Only three songs I liked, &quot;Dead Wrong&quot;, &quot;Dangerous  MC's&quot;, and &quot;Rap Phenomenom&quot;. Puff CANNOT rap, Kim is too  full of herself, and that &quot;Notorious&quot; is so wack, AND the remix.  This album would make BIG turn over in his grave. Peace to the Wu-Tang Clan  (The ILLEST MC's of all time! ), and the Bronx. (I'm so disgusted!)
puffy trying to cash in quick unloads this mess.the genius of B.I.G is smeared a bit by this unwanted material.it sounds dated and out of place with some of the duets.not on par with what the man was trying to do in the  long run.
This album was horrible. If it wasn't for the &quot;Anything&quot; track by Jay-Z this album probably wouldn't have sold.
Mac Man was a Tight cut.the Problem with Beanie Sigel's Album is that it's his in Name Only.Jay Z takes over and the whole vibe feels Like He wanted to Put another Album Out but couldn't so he did it thru Sigel.Roc A Fella  has Only One Bread Winner that is Jay.and The Source has Got to Be Jivin'  this is NoWhere Near Ice Cube's Amerikkka's Most Wanted? Cube for One Thing  Would Never RIde on Somebody that He Could Blow Away.and Old Ice Cube would  Make a Meal out Of Jay Z on a Full Belly already.that Means Sigel wouldn't  have half a chance.
I like this album. No man, I LOVE THIS ALBUM! I got to Wild Out, This Album is Banging all across North Trenton to West Philly, to Orange Newark, and to the Back of Liberian Yonkers. A Section like North Trenton. We listen to this music and not to diss my man Jadakiss but you shouldn't point fingers, thats why 50 Got you. What goes around comes around. But I stay on your side, and not because i'm from Yonkers and live in North Trenton. Nah dog, I got respect for you. They making money, wheather they got your flow or not. At least they didn't steel your beats and Rhymes, that's the most important part. Both of you are raw so I don't have to point fingers to who's annoying. Oh NO!1. Truth  - (THIS IS MY SONG ON THIS ALBUM)2. Who Want What - (With Memphis Bleek) (YEAH, THIS SECOND SONG IS RAW)3. Raw & Uncut - (With Jay-Z. This Song Is Raw, Reminds me of Sammy Davis Jr)4. Mac Man - (Freestyle Song)5. Playa - (With Amil) (Is yall Players)6. Everybody Wanna Be a Star - (Who Can Dance to this Song)7. Remember Them Days - (With Eve) (Blasting all Across North Trenton and Newark, and Yonkers)8. Stop, Chill - (This my Song)9. Mac and Brad - (With Scarface) (GOOD COLLABORATION)10. What a Thug About - (Heard this Song a lot of times, I like the Instrumental)11. What Your Life Like (This MY SONG RIGHT HERE, The Flow Comes from A Different World)12. Ride 4 My - (Big Pun ****)13. Die [*] (THIS IS THE SONG RIGHT HERE)14. Anything (A deleted song that Jay-Z made for himself, but would thought will be good for Beanie Sigels album) (But if Jay-Z does release a Deleted Song album or Mixtape then THIS IS THE SONG RIGHT HERE ON THIS ENTIRE ALBUM)Beanie Sigel -- Dwayne Grant -- 1974 -- Phillidelphia, Pensivaniya
I'm not filling this one at all. It's maybe one or two tracks that's worth the effort of searching for, but the rest are commercialized and wack. I still give him the respect of being a pioneer of his style and one of the  greatest lyricist. Maybe he used the tracks that didn't make the &quot;I  am&quot; CD. It was a supprise to see him release 2 CD's 5 months apart.I'm hurt Nas!oNe
What was Nas thinkin when he made this cd his second in 1 year.That was a stupid thing to do . Come get me is the best song by far . After that not much. Don't get it unless ur an absolute Nas fanatic and need to have everything he puts out . My friend burned it for me thank god i didnt waste my 13 bucks on it .
This is the worst and hopefully the last whack Nas album;lucky for him he redeemed himself on Stllmatic.
Nas' latest opus is very disappointing to the ears. Don't get me wrong, Nas is a great MC, but on this album he showed lack of skill he once posesed on the first two albums. Nas must take it back to the streets with  the next album, because you can hear his sytle for the worst.
nas has continued to sink.after each passing disc his work gets weaker&amp;weaker.he was once said to be the heir apparent to rakim? that was when his rhymes&amp;skills were on point and not rushed like now.he  came back to soon on this disc.he should take more time before rushing  2nd&amp;3rd tier music out.
Nas just went commercial on this weak piece of trash.  It was sad to see a Pure top of the game MC turn into garbage.  Nasty Nas was the Nas we do and still respect; Escobar was his 50%Ill, 50%hollywood form that was so-so.  Nastradamus is his P Diddy clone that made him pure garbage, and I'm glad he wasn't Nastradamus or Escobar on Stillmatic, or I wouldn't buy that one either.  Well this album is a shame, and a 100% discrace to hip hop.  I guess when Jay-Z told the truth about him, I guess Nas did what we wanted him to do, go back to his Ill skills and battle back.  Anyway, do not get this, cuz Nas changed his flow, and out all his energy to good waste.
First let me begin by saying that nas is a poet and he's words are the truth and im a huge fan of this nugga but nastradamus ? Was awfull even wid some good production he still had wack songs and lirycs... Almost ruin his career and his cred as a street mc wid songs like you owe me?Sounds like somethin 50 cent would do or some commercial rapper but not the nas i kno and apreciate as an true mc...Well for good nas albums ? get illmatic, it was writtin, lost tapes and even stillmatic. But his other albums are all garbage.Still nas can pretty much destroy these new up & coming "rappers" any day when he wants too.
Didnt sell, wonder why! Sells tell a lot about a album
Cash Money makes the No-Limit crew look like there's hope.Juvenile is one of the wackiest rappers ever.the whole Cash Money crew must have been influenced by Uncle Luke&amp;the 2 Live crew.if making Loot is what you all  about then cool but this is some of the worst music ever put out.
Ever heard of phony rappers? Well heres your example Juvenile and the Cash Money Millionaires.  Their beats are all the same, the lyrics mean nothing and they are fake fake fake.  You want real hip hop try Talib Kweli, because this is WHACK.
This is bullcrap and it is mostly the production.  Swizz Beats and his Ruff Ryder production team is just no good.  The beats are WACK. Maybe a couple nice tracks but overall the album is forgettable and whoever said this album was more than three stars is smokin something serious.  DMX could be great because he has a lot of personality and pours emotion into his songs, but with Swizz Beats........It's sad to say that will never happen.  Party Up with its mad exposure is so played out it makes you wanna jump off of a cliff.  Unlistenable.  other ok songs include One More Road To Cross, DXL, What's My Name and uh nothing else.  Please save your money and bypass this horrendous display of production.  DMX is an above average rapper though.
how in the world did dmx ever get a deal?  this dude can't rap at all.all that barking and wack music is embarassing to the rap world.this disc is weak.i can't believe that people actually buy this junk.a friend of mine  said you have to hear this for a laugh.and it was a bad joke.
JAY-Z IS A PHONY.HE COPIES MAKAVELI IN MUSIC VIDEOS ,QUOTES,ECT.THE ON LY GOOD THING IN THIS ALBUM IS THE TRACK FEATURING DRE,THAT CUT IS ILL.
I cant even begin to descibe to you how much this cd sucks.Same repetitive beats on all the songs and the only song worthy listening to is big pimping.The lyrics are all pointless and stupid as can be expected fom this clown.Do yourself a favor and download big pimping because thats the only good song on the album.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
After the massive sucess of the hugely underrated Hard Knock Life Vol.2, Jay-Z was decoming the new mainstream darling of hip hop, and deservedly so. I preordered Vol.3 a month in advance, expecting to hear some more classic Jigga bravado. Instead I heard , to summarize, absolute junk. I can't believe how bad this album is; Big Pimpin with UGK is great, but the rest of it is total trash! Avoid this like the plague!
Well there is not much to say about an album that was pretty weak.  Jay-Z was riding extremely high after the platinum In My Lifetime Volume 1, and the multi-platinum Hard Knock Life.  After these extremely hott bangers, anything with Shawn Carter's name on it would have sold so it didn't really matter what was on there.  Being the avid Jay-Z fan that I am, not even I could withstand this album.  The first two singles that got massive radio play were very weak tracks, those being &quot;So Ghetto&quot; and &quot;Do it Again&quot;.  Do it Again sounds so overproduced that it is extremely unpleasant.  The lyrics sounded like they were recycled from one of Jay's notebooks that he found in the garbage.  Nothing much happens from here on in except for &quot;Dope Man&quot; which is a stellar track that goes extremely well with the newscast during the song.  Save for &quot;Big Pimpin&quot; which is the best song on the track where Jigga saves his best verse and best beat.  Definitly the best song on the album, but not enough to save this weak album.  But everyone is allowed to have one weak album when you've had as many successful ones as Jigga has had.
I'm glad I listend to this album first by friend. Jay-Z IS THE MOST OVERRATED RAPPER OF ALL TIME ALONE WITH BIGGIE,LIL WAYNE,AND EMINEM!This album sucked! The beats were boring,his lyrics are wack! All he raps about is MONEY,CARS,HOES,DIAMONDS,etc. All Jay songs have a catchy hook with some known sample and thats why he sells,that song Big Pimpin' sucks. The only Jay album that was good was "Reasonable Doubt" everything is else pure garbage. When Mtv named him the greatest emcee,lol.... that really proved my point a decade ago Mainstream hip hop has died.
no wonder jay z&amp;mariah carey are buddys they both write the same topics over&amp;over again.all jay z writes about is diamonds,cars,&amp;money ever heard of race?class? how long does it take  for him to come up with lyrics? and his rapping is a joke as well.but it  makes sense since he discovered foxy brown? let me guess vol 4,5,6,7,8,9,  will have money&amp;diamonds as well? what a great mind that jay z? not!
Jay-Z is just like Puff Daddy! He got no real talent! Don't buy this, please! I'm begging you!
The Lox were wack with Puffy and now they are wack with Ruff Ryders.both are Lame.Puffy&amp;his Bad Boy crew Recycle any and everything.Ruff Ryders&amp;Swizz beatz are Lame.every alum release by them all sound the  same.the raps are wack&amp;the music sounds like a Poor mans Casio.the only  cut that works comes from a outside Producer Ryde or dye by Timberland.who  is very overrated.yes he has beats but what else? don't be surprised when  Ruff Ryders play out that you see The Lox going to Cash Money or whoever is  hot.
As a friend commented when hearing this album 'Is that the Verve'. Travis is yet another band that sounds like another band. This album is so lifeless and dull, it makes me wonder why record companies are pushing  bands like this when there are so many good bands out there that are  itching to get a recording deal. 'Driftwood' and 'Why does it always rain  on me' sound ok but need some magic pumped into them. The world needs more  happy cheerful music, not this stuff that makes you wonder what is  happening to music. An unwise purchase on my behalf.
there's nothing new that hasn't been done already.the beats have been done before a thousand times.this disc is 2nd rate Badu&amp;Bliege.Amel has a good voice but this Material is Lacking anything New.
Ice Cube is a Rap Legend Period.but his recordings after 92 have just gotten worse&amp;worse.I'm tired of Hearing Cube just getting by with 2nd Rate Tracks.you get a song hear&amp;their that sounds Familiar to his Peak  but other than that it's Melted ICE.He Lost his edge.
Was this album a dissapointment!! I love Toni Braxton's voice and I especially liked her first album and the second one(although not as much as the first one) but this one is a bore.  The only good songs are: He wasn't man enough for me, Spanish Guitar and Never One for a Ring.  The rest is just plain terrible.  I hope her next offering is better.  Don't waste your money on this one.  With that voice, she can do a lot better.
The overall concept behind &quot;The Heat,&quot; Toni Braxton's third album, can be found in the album's first ten seconds.  After a four-year absence from recording, the first word out of Toni's mouth is  &quot;Darkchild,&quot; nickname for trendy producer-of-the-moment Rodney  Jerkins.  True, her own name is said directly after, but the message is  clear: trend first, artist later.Playing Catch-Up with the current crop  of navel-baring, radio-ruling teenage divas may be to Toni's commercial  credit, but the actual music that's involved in such a move also leaves an  artistic debit.  Of course, seeing as how Babyface wrote and produced most  of her previous hits, it may be argued that it was never clear how much of  Toni Braxton's music was her own artistic vision.  But Babyface's acoustic,  Eric-Clapton-with-a-drum-machine musings were certainly a better compliment  to Toni's sultry voice than the by-the-numbers R&amp;B she's subjected to  here.&quot;He Wasn't Man Enough,&quot; the album's opener, contains all  of the elements of a Rodney Jerkins Hit Single: chunky groove, synthesized  harp, and a lyric that's probably meant as modern feminism but instead just  sounds bitchy.  As radio fodder goes, though, it's acceptable: as  repetitive as it may be, at least it's still built around a hook, whereas  most of &quot;The Heat&quot; focuses on The Beat.  That wouldn't be so bad  if modern R&amp;B hadn't gotten so erratic; nowadays kick drums are often  doubled-up and snares are assigned to odd, half-measure counts.  But Toni  willingly obliges such whims on &quot;Gimme Some,&quot; a song that could  have easily become the soundtrack to cruising around in an open convertible  on a hot Summer night in 2000...alas, its jerky rhythms make it nearly  impossible to find the groove and join in.  Equally trendy is making the  ballads as slow as possible, and as a result, &quot;Never Just for a  Ring&quot; plods along so slowly it almost flatlines.Unfortunately, this  isn't to say the album's production is disguising any great writing.  Even  a major songwriting talent like Diane Warren, the brains behind Toni's  megahit &quot;Unbreak My Heart,&quot; is recruited here merely to repeat  herself.  Her contribution this time around, "Spanish Guitar," is pointed  out on the album's cover sticker, just in case the song itself isn't enough  to impress you;  however, the songs are so musically similar, the average  listener probably could have figured it out.  But an innovation of the  cheapest kind is still managed: the lyrics, which have Toni pining for a  troubador, provide a window of opportunity to include a flemenco guitar  solo and a bridge both spoken and sung by a Latin male...another trend  conquered.Marring both composition and production simultaneously is  &quot;Maybe,&quot; a song that suggests &quot;ballad&quot; with its strings  and fingersnap-laden rhythms...but Toni's rapid-fire vocal delivery  suggests something else altogether, and the result is chaos.  The  first-verse lyrics are unintelligible without the lyric book, but  second-verse lyrics like &quot;had me weak between the sheets/will he say I  was a real big freak?&quot; make you grateful for small favors like  incomprehension.  &quot;The Art of Love&quot; even goes so far as to not be  written at all: instead of lyrics Toni whispers a few come-ons, and instead  of melody we're given a sleepy, repeated keyboard loop, providing a new  genre altogether: R&amp;B for Elevators.Most disappointing of all,  however, is the fact that Toni's vocals don't rescue the material; her slow  purrs and Babyface-inspired yelps (&quot;whoo!&quot;) have become so  predictable they're trite.  And while a drowsy vocal style was always her  trademark, an increasing lack of diction is just too much; on the first  verse of &quot;Just Be a Man About It&quot; she sounds like Cher on  sleeping pills.A couple of decent songs did manage to sneak in, however:  the title track does manage a catchy hook and a surprisingly jazz  progression, and &quot;Fairy Tale&quot; is another one of Babyface's  classy, drop-dead gorgeous acoustic affairs...too bad it's the only moment  he's allowed.  True, this record will surely ignite radio and MTV...there  hasn't been so shameless an artistic sell-out since Whitney Houston's  &quot;My Love is Your Love.&quot;  But from a mature and musical  standpoint, the only way "The Heat" will start a fire is if someone decides  to burn some trash.
Toni Braxton has her own special brand of schlock R&amp;B, not that it's good, mind you, but it does sound a little different from the undifferentiated legions of wanna be divas out there. It's sort of like slowed down fast music, with crackley vocals. The Spanish guitar in `Spanish Guitar' was good, although the song is marred by the presence of, well, Toni Braxton.
Browse through a decent number of reviews and you'll find lots of folks...even those who gave this good star ratings...talking about how Richard Carpenter has overdubbed new piano parts at times ("Sing" in particular is cited) and the CD has been extensively re-mixed. The monkeying is probably most noticeable in the extra reverb added to Karen's voice and the way the drums are pushed forward in the mix more than the originals.If you don't release the 45RPM version...without re-mixing it, adding extra parts, taking away other parts to "modernize" it..then you have NOT released the singles. These changes are not "remastering"...they are re-recording. If Richard desires to do that, it should be released as "The Carpenters' Greatest Songs...Re-interpreted!" or something similar. Those who want to hear that could still buy it..and those seeking the songs they remember AS they remember them would be spared the deception.BOTTOM LINE:Don't buy into the revisionist history. Stick with the "1969-1973" version instead. (ASIN B00000HY5F)
