It is mind boggling all the hype surrounding this badly overrated CD. I like many of the Beach Boys big hits but this CD just doesn't cut it. On the version I borrowed, out of sixteen songs only the four lead tracks-Wouldn't It Be Nice, Caroline No, God Only Knows, and Sloop John B are of high quality. I Know There's An Answer, Here Today, and You Still Believe In Me are slightly captivating among the remaining songs. The problem here at least to my ears is that the songs all have a similar arrangement. Not slow and romantic like Surfer Girl or Warmth of The Sun or fast and jumpy like Fun Fun Fun and Surfin' USA. Its all mid-paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effects.It boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this CD as the third greatest rock n roll album of all time. Geeze Louise, this album barely even rocks!  There is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef!fects. It trudges along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end. The harmonies all sound the same after a while and Brian hogs most of the lead vocals.  The lyrics may have some special meanings but that's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music.  How anyone can compare this to even the weakest of Beatles records is ludicrous.In my opinion, stick with a good compilation of the Beach Boys. California Girls, Help Me Rhonda, I Get Around, and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping. I have three of them and they all work fine. However, when Brian Wilson attempted to get too deep and stray away from grooving surfer rhythms, the result is a stony bore. Borrow it from a friend but save your money as this music just does not cut the mustard.
this disc is okay but it doesn't show the talent&amp;depth of this man.from 76-82 he was grooving.then he came stateside and was watered down.this set hardly does the man justice.he is a very talented artist who  deserves better.
Aaliyah is not much of a singer but she has a style about her in her delievery that makes her credible.i really liked Back&amp;fourth.R.Kelly dominates all thru this disc.she has a certain it about her that  Brandy,Monica,Myia,etcc.. don't.
I HATE E-40,BUT THE TRACK WITH 2 PAC IS GOOD.THE 2 STARS ARE ONLY FOR THAT SONG.DON'T BUY THIS JUNK TRUST ME.
The Only Reason I gave this C.D a chance was because my Girlfriend Happens to love these Moronic disgraces of Music. 4 songs on this 12 song album were Decent! the rest Were shoddy Production and too Poppy. &quot;quit Playing Games with my heart&quot; a great song has an rnB feel to it. &quot;As long as you love me&quot; Great Lyrics and the groove is catchy!. &quot;all i have to give&quot; fairly decent i have to be in the mood to listen to it. &quot;everybody&quot; the only reason i like this damn song is because i saw the video so many times i have the lyrics imbedded in my brain. The rest suck. Im sorry But after Artist like &quot;Prince&quot;, &quot;Stevie Wonder&quot; , &quot;Michael Jackson&quot; Paved the way for these young swill Merchants. You think Anyone Would make good music.  Well These Puppets for the record companies Suck no Punn intended. if you like this kind of music go listen to Savage Garden at least they have Talent. these morons don't and Im out!
Say what you will, but it's patently unfair to say that the Backstreet Boys `suck'. Granted, those of us who have been raised on rock and roll will find it difficult to ascertain the musical appeal of five performers posing as a band, singing pseudo-soulless versions of pre-packaged pop emotional swill, but we aren't their target audience. These guys, or rather the people who have manipulated them into the image that they represent, have targeted them straight at the heart of pre-teen youth culture, and as such, they have done a better than admirable job. For those of us who might have selective memories, there have been other, MUCH worse examples of teen-based music that pre-dates the Backstreet Boys - Would anybody care to remember the Osmond Brothers? Leif Garrett? Fabian? In comparison, the Backstreet Boys are downright respectable. While music by the aforementioned has been thoroughly forgotten, I think that the Backstreet Boys have done their job well enough to survive the ravages of time. So, for all the naysayers who dismiss the Backstreet Boys as irrelevant, I'll try not to say I told you so when you find yourself humming along nostalgically to "Quit Playing Games With My Heart" in another five years, or "As Long as You Love Me".

this was my least favorite 2pac album.  that doesnt mean it wasnt good.  it was.  but i thought it was a dissappointment. some of the songs were pretty whack.  there were a lot of songs that i really liked.  disc 1 contained most of the good songs like open fire, r u still down, where do we go from here, ... i wonder if heaven got a ghetto, nothng 2 lose, and my favorite on disc 1 hellrazor.  that song was deep and real.  disc 2 songs were pretty bad with the exception of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto remix, when i get free II, ... enemies with me, ready 4 whatever and my favorite only fear of death.  i think i would have been better if 2pac hadnt of changed his voice like that.  when i first bought it i listened to it for about a week then i went back listening to other 2pac cds.  overall i think afeni shakur did a poor job producing the album.  i think if suge knight had produced it with her it would have been A LOT better.by 2pacs #1 fan
This guy got passed me back in the day, even though I basically bought every album that came out back in the 60s and 70s. I was listening to sattelite radio and heard a cut from this one and I liked the moodish thing going on and the hint of drug influence in there somewhere, so I checked out a few websites on Nick Drake. His tragic story kind of hooked me so I bought this CD. Quite frankly I find this to be interesting, but not something I would recomend to everybody. The mood of depression stays so heavy that every song sounds the same and makes me feel like I am watching one of those pulse readouts in a hospital room, and it is a flatliner. I suppose that some people dig this mellowed out sort of "I wanna leave this world stuff" but I get enough of it quick. Drake's guitar work was a bit unique in it's time, but as many times as I try, I just can't quite get with this program. It is good to listen to and then take a nap.
I love E.C., I love the Attractions, I love Nick Lowe, so I was SO excited when this came out, as it was so hot on the heels of King of America. I was actually disappointed with King of America (it has improved with age, like  a fine wine), so I saw this as an obvious attempt to return to the  fantastic form of his pre-Punch the Clock days. As I listened, I was so let  down. I thought this album was a noisy mess with weak songs. As time  passed, I thought perhaps I'd been subverted by my own high expectations,  so I bought the Ryko reissue and gave it another chance. Well, my opinion  hasn't changed. It's still a struggle to listen to this album, possibly  even more so as my ears have aged and the mid-range heavy production grates  more than ever. I hate to say it, but I'd rather listen to Goodbye Cruel  World than this album.
I remember when this cd was released in the 80's...the supergroup made of some great musicians of prog music....this album got immediate success, everybody liked it.  Now listen to this cd again and realize how this was a poor cd.  I did and I can say that this album is really poor and I won't listen to it for the rest of my life, this is the kind of pop prog for the mass and has nothing to do with real prog music.  Instead, look for what these guys has made in the 70's with their respective bands and you'll see the difference....
This is a case in point about what was wrong with the 80's, my least favorite decade musically. In the 70's, you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching, jaw dropping prog rock.  But in the 80's it only amounted to overproduced, manufactured for mass  consumption, calculated FM corporate rock. There is nothing prog about  Asia. Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in  their better days of glory with UK, Yes, ELP,King Crimson. My opinion on  this one will never change with time. File with GTR under 80's bad idea  supergroups.
terrible supergroup schlock.  If this is their best cd, I wonder how terrible the others are.  mind alteringly dumb lyrics that are mindless pervade this cd, by the official "prog rock supergroup."  supergroups tend to suck hard, and I would say that this band blows more than most.  Avoid at all costs, there is much better prog music out there.  I was previously a fan of the work these guys did in other bands before, and I am extremely dissappointed that something so aseptic could be brought forth by them.  Maybe they didn't have that much talent in the first place.
Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated. The songs released were pretty good but after all these years, this album is dated and annoying now. This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular, no wonder they had to change their sound after this album. Don't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it. The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning, great hook and chorus. This album is considered their masterpiece, but I've heard better.
This overrated album doesn`t do much for me. I don`t really see what`s so special about it, and I believe it`s the band`s worse record. The title song is a good opener, and &quot;Karmakoma&quot; is a great moment as well, but after the third track, &quot;Three&quot;, it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record. The last song, a cover of &quot;Light my fire&quot;, is particularly weak and just puts me away.A disappointig and souless album, &quot;Protection&quot; is alright as background music, but not much else.
I remember how big a deal this disc was back in the late 80s, but I just never got it...or her. The &quot;Straight Up&quot; and &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; songs were awful pop tunes and that &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; video was just plain awful with the obnoxious animated cat. Then the allegations surfaced that she never really sang leads on the album. I did like the &quot;Way That You Love Me&quot; song. Now that was pretty sweet.
I decided recently to pull out my old vinyl of Paula Abdul and spin this baby.Well I have noticed since I am now about 11 years older I realized Abdul's voice now gets on my nerves, and that her songs though they had  their place and time in 1989 just don't hold up well today.Songs like  &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;Knocked Out&quot;, and &quot;The Way That  You Love Me&quot;, just don't infect me like some old pop songs do like The  Emotions &quot;Best of My Love&quot; or Lovin' Spoonfuls &quot;Summer in  the City&quot;....get the picture?Unless your an Abdul fanatic, all I  can say is this is really run of the mill pop with some infectious  hooks...I think if Madonna, or Deborah Gibson (who have stronger voices)  sang these dittys they may hold up better.
It's a shame 'cause Depeche Mode used to be such a great band - it was even THE band back in my gymnasium times.What a pity to release such a sleepy album. The instrumentation on 'Ultra' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness. You simply get sleepy, 'cause they're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun' is embarrassingly boring. Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It's No Good' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of' compilation, and 'Freestate', especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style. It can work. But it'll TAKE some work!A big compliment though for sending 'Ultra' out on vinyl too!!
Watching BET's Walk Of Fame tribute to Stevie the other day inspired me to write some reviews here.I don't have the &quot;perfect&quot; view of this album that most Stevie fans have. Aside from Living For The City, Higher Ground, and Jesus Children Of America there isn't anything I like on this album.There is just something about Stevie's languid, rather sappy, elevator-music ballads that I can't stand, and this cd has a bunch of them.Having said that, I absolutely love the great stuff on this cd, with Jesus Children Of America being the highlight for me. That alone makes it a disc worth owning, to me. Overall though, I think I am going to look into getting that multi-disc Stevie box-set that came out a few years ago or whenever it was. There just aren't enough Stevie tunes I love per-disc to make buying all his albums worth it to me. I don't own any of those &quot;greatest hits&quot; types of box sets but depending on whats on that multi-disc Stevie set, I may buy it.
In Square Circle had some of lame '80s product on it, but this whole album is lame '80s product. It doesn't help its cause that there's only one unqualified success on it. "Skeletons" and "Get It" were both hit singles, and they're fun, but routine, funk, but the fact is you can find better songs that do the same thing on virtually every other Stevie Wonder album from 1972 on. (The third hit, "You Will Know", is awful. Unbearable. I dunno, pick a negative adjective and run with it). The song I'm talking about is the stomping, long funkfest "My Eyes Don't Cry". Now that's a total classic! I love it! Especially the percussion and keyboard riffs. And the melody. And the chorus. And everything else about it. Everything else is a zero. The funk ("Dark `n' Lovely"; "In Your Corner"; "One of a Kind") is forced; the ballads ("You Will Know"; "With Each Beat of My Heart"; the space-soul, "Rocket Love"-like "Galaxy Paradise"; "Cryin' through the Night") are overwrought. Stevie was in sad shape here.
Stevie, Stevie, Stevie!! Where has all the brilliance gone? There are exactly 3, count 'em, 3 good songs on this album and they simply aren't enough to salvage what amounts to a piece of pedestrian product and half-hearted attempts at sounding comtemporary. The opener, &quot;You Will Know&quot; with it's simple message of hope and lilting fairlight melody, &quot;With Each Beat Of My Heart&quot;, his least syrupy ballad in years and the skeletal groove of &quot;Skeletons&quot; and it's indictment of liars, cheaters and cover-ups (Corporate America should really listen to this one nowadays) are the only worthwhile tracks here and it breaks my heart to listen to the rest of the garbage that makes up the remainder of this release. Filler is one thing, but this is ridiculous.
Stevie Wonder is one of my All-Time Favorites Period.He is a Musical  Genius.but This isn't his Genius here.Only two songs stand Out Sensuous  Whisper&amp;Cold CHill.His Writing is hurting on this DIsc.The Music is  Lacking that Stevie Edge.After His Live Set I was Hyped for this Disc but  it wasn't Happening but you can't take away The Man's Genius.
See, here's the problem with Caribou: It isn't very good. There are hits, oh yes - what Elton album would be complete without hits? Those are good. "The B*tch is Back" is a funny heavy rocker with a full brass section and is not sexist, unlike... oh, I dunno, everything else Bernie Taupin ever wrote: the "b*tch" is the singer, you see. "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me", meanwhile, is one of Elton's many classic love ballads with another one of those soaring refrains. "Stinker" is a rewrite of "The B*tch is Back", but I don't care - it's a damn good time. And "I've Seen the Saucers" is cool in its eeriness. On the other hand, I really wish Bernie Taupin would stop parodying country, since "Dixie Lily" just may be worse than "No Shoestrings on Louise", which is an impressive feat; "Pinky" and "Grimbsy" are yet more cheesy ballads; "You're So Static" is more unwarranted misogyny; "Ticking" has no reason to exist; "Solar Prestige Whatever" is a painful sequel to "Sun King". Oh, and the cover image makes Captain Fantastic's look like a Da Vinci.
Of his 70s classic output, this LP is probably John's weakest. Named after the studio where this was dashed off in the middle of a tour (a little over a week of studio time), it's obvious the stress was getting to Elton and Bernie. There simply aren't a whole lot of memorable songs here.The one most will know is ballad "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on me", one of the most enduring tunes in Elton's canon. "The Bitch is Back", while relatively slight, was a big hit for Elton as well. "Ticking" portrays an armed standoff that could have come from today's newspaper clippings. After that, the good stuff is slim pickings."Pinky" is pleasant enough, but alongside Elton's other love songs clearly a lesser effort. "Dixie Lily" is an homage to a Mississippi riverboat. "You're so Static" is "Sweet Painted Lady" part two.."I've seen the Saucers" is a nice look at life through the eyes of the folks who claim to have met with aliens. "Grimsby" is a heavily fictionalized look at an English seaside town.The nadir of the album and possibly Elton's catalogue is "Solar Prestige a Gammon". Yes, I understand that he wrote it to mock critics for "reading too much" into his lyrics. But when John Lennon did the same thing, he came up with "I Am the Walrus" and at least the wordplay was clever. "Stinker" is also pretty aptly named.As far as the bonus tracks go, you get a decent Christmas tune ("Step into Christmas") that still gets holiday airplay Stateside, "Pinball Wizard" is the song from "Tommy" first done by the Who and probably should've replaced "Solar Prestige" on the album. A good cover is better than a misbegotten original. "Sick City" is a jibe at New York City. Again, it's better than a lot of the material on the album. "Cold Highway" was a B side to "Bitch" that also should've made the cut instead of some of what did.In summary: Only completists will need to own this, but if you're a pretty big Elton John fan it's worth getting for "Ticking" and the bonus material. All others should go grazing elsewhere.2 1/2 stars
The 1974 album 'Caribou' is a fairly enjoyable glossy pop-rock album.'Caribou' is not a bad album, but it is not a great one either.Admittedly, most of the songs are enjoyable while this piece is playing. 'Dixy Lily' is a country / show boat tune that is fairly enjoyable, though, honestly, if I heard this on the radio, I probably wouldn't realise it was Elton, doesn't sound like him. 'Solar Prestige a Gammon' is better than you've been told, it's slightly jazzy, and Ray plays the Marimba's beautifully. However, it's hardly memorable. There's a pair of ballads, the sickly sweet country-flavoured 'Pinky' and the more psychedelic / sci-fi 'I've seen the saucers', that sound so great as they start (both have a nice bongo-drum flavoured beat), but they soon fail, despite the good arrangements and nice melodies. Even the jazzy rocker 'You're so static', feels sloppy, though it is enjoyable.If there is a song I dig on this thing it's 'Stinker', a funked up blues-rocker that has real rock 'n' roll soul, mixed with English eccentricity and an hilarious lyric, as well as perfectly appropriate vocals from Elton. 'Don't let the sun go down on me' is a gorgeous and melodic ballad, not quite as heartfelt as it pretends, Elton sounds quite happy as he's singing this song, but it's still a very memorable song. It has a very rousing chorus and plenty of spine-tingling melodies. The choice of trumpets was a wonderful addition to the arrangement. 'Ticking' also has great melodeis, a haunting ballad about a mass-shooting, but the song focuses more on the psychology of the young man with the gun. The melody is great and there are some hooks in it as well. 'The b* is back' is a sly rocker that is performed at break-neck speed, but is still fun, though I personally prefer 'Grimsby' I think it has a good, memorable chorus and is quite a fun song.So there is some good material, and most of the rest of it is enjoyable, but hardly memorable.
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...it's hard to determine a rating on this box set because although it shows that Elton had great non-album tracks, the best stuff in this box has been added as bonus tracks to his albums. So you probably want to skip this in favor of buying the expanded editions of his early 70's albums.
aside from Dancing Queen&amp;Fernando there wasn't much to ABBA.formula Production&amp;Music.catchy but forgettable for the most part.
I have always had a soft-spot for 80s rock. I grew up on Van Halen, Motley Crue, Poison, Def Leopard, RATT, Skid Row, etc. So you'd think I'd love Bon Jovi, right? Wrong! I have always hated Bon Jovi.I actually think they are a talented band. Ritchie Sambora is a talented player and can definitely write catchy riffs and solo. The rest of the band is competent enough. I think Bon Jovi had the potential to be a good band. So, what is my main problem with them?First, although the band has written some catchy songs-the band, along with Desmond Child (who is the kiss of death to anything cool) finds a way to ruin it; by making it overly glossy, radio-friendly and assessable. Bon Jovi's music is completely wimpy and lightweight and lacks any real substance.Second, I utterly hate Jon Bon Jovi. He has a good voice, I'll give him that. But he is a lightweight, candy-ass who isn't a tenth as good as Diamond David Lee Roth or Axl Rose, or even Vince Neil or Brett Michaels.Bon Jovi's music is corporate pap aimed at 12 year-old girls. If you want to get into some good 80s rock-pick up Guns N' Roses "Appetite For Destruction," Van Halen's "1984" or Motley Crue's "Shout at the Devil." If you must buy a Bon Jovi album (and stink up your collection) then buy this.
Elton is a great artist, a real one.  He made fantastic album in the 70'sand in the 80's, but good things never last forever.  I think he did great stuff but his star has faded.  This album isn't great but Elton still is.
I'm sorry, but this album is horrible.  The drastic drop in quality from the brilliant, affecting &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; LP makes it clear, in retrospect, that this is where Elton made the tacky transition from &quot;Artist&quot; to &quot;Entertainer&quot;.  Sure, &quot;Daniel&quot; still sounds great; but &quot;Have Mercy on the Criminal&quot; is just horrid, and &quot;Midnight Creeper&quot; is quite possibly the most embarrassing Rolling Stones imitation of all-time.  And the rest just reeks of early-70s tackiness -- all dressed up in baby blue polyester suits with nowhere to go....
This is where it all started..well, if you don't count &quot;Empty Sky&quot;. I love Elton John's music, I have for a long time, and this album is essential, but it's not one of my favorites..&quot;Your Song&quot; is still a nice touch, while &quot;I Need You To Turn To&quot; scores more points(check out the &quot;Live In Australia&quot; version), but &quot;Take Me To The Pilot&quot;, this version of it is pretty horrid. It doesn't sound as catchy as it would on different live releases. &quot;No Shoe Strings On Louise&quot; is one of the better songs on here, with a definite Stones influence; &quot;First Episode At Hienton&quot; makes me feel like jumping out of a window; &quot;Sixty Years On&quot;, while not a terrible song, the strings are too much at times; &quot;Border Song&quot;, again, sounds better live; &quot;Greatest Discovery&quot;, a touching song, but one I don't find myself indulging in too much, &quot;The Cage&quot;, filler; &quot;The King Must Die&quot;, there is something somewhat moving about this one, but it is still overblown. As for the bonus tracks, &quot;Bad Side Of The Moon&quot; is overproduced; &quot;Grey Seal&quot;, I kinda like it, though I can't tell you why; &quot;Rock N'Roll Madonna&quot; is a catchy, Jerry Lee Lewis type rocker. To sum it all up, I think all of Elton's &quot;Classic Years&quot; albums are worth having, including this one, but this is my least favorite, with the possible exceptions of &quot;Caribou&quot; and &quot;Empty Sky&quot;. I think the strings present the biggest problem on this album..just overly dramatic in a lot of places, and a little hollow at times as well. If you want to hear the strings put to good use, check out &quot;Madman Across The Water&quot;.
Well, this is where it all really started. &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, 1969..If I could, I would would give this album another half star, because though it is lacking, there is still something rather charming, and enjoyable about it. At first, I listened to this album very little, and wasn't impressed, but all the sudden, I would be in class, or doing whatever, and I would have &quot;Val-Hala&quot; stuck in my head, a very haunting song. The title track is probably my favorite, I'm surpised it doesn't get classic rock airplay, or performed live. &quot;Western Ford Gateway&quot; is a catchy one, along with &quot;Sails&quot;(watch out for the lyrics on that one, though). &quot;Skyline Pigeon&quot; is a great song, but I am more partial to the versions on &quot;Here And There&quot;, or &quot;Rare Masters&quot;, and why oh why, did it have to be about a pigeon...  One thing that I don't understand about this album, why was there a non-album single, &quot;It's Me That You Need&quot;, released right before, but not included on the lp? There for, the album has no singles, this never really made any sense to me.  Overall, I would say this is a decent, experimental album, a little rough around the edges, but any true fan has to hear where it all started.
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...this is Elton's first album and it's rough around the edges. A good producer could have improved this project and there are a couple of decent tracks including the title song.
Okay, people tend to overrate this one and I'm not sure why.  I think it has to do with the legendary, almost mythic, status of EJ circa 1970, wowing 'em at the Troubadour in L.A.  Thus, this live album is supposed to  be evidence of his ivory-pounding roots.  But live albums have always  tended to be product (like Greatest Hits albums) and this one's  disappointing because it catches Elton on a bad night and reveals, perhaps,  his biggest problem as a live performer: his penchant to get a ridiculously  smarmy (see his embarrassing MTV unplugged performance for proof).  Instead  of simply performing his songs and letting the compositions stand on their  own, Elton tends to go over-the-top.  His vocal antics on Honky Tonk Women  are flat-out silly, and why would he ruin Burn Down The Mission by turning  it into a medley?  Throw in the fact that Elton and his band don't sound in  top form (nor rhythm) and I'm ready to move on to Dylan's Before the Flood  or Warren Zevon's Stand in the Fire, two truly outstanding live albums.
I really really really tried to like this album but it just doesn't do much for me.  The songs are mediocre and the performances don't sound that great (much like Leon Russel Live).  He tries hard but too much yelling and piano bashing, and the end result is mediocre at best and annoying.  Do not reommend this one.
This live album was only mediocre.  Buy the studio versions.  Some of the tunes on this go on and on until you have to move onto the next track.
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Elton live is rarely a good thing. This CD is no exception and if it weren't for his better than average version of "Take Me To the Pilot" this wouldn't even get 2 stars.
Ok,maybe I am wrong but this is for me the worst Elton's album. The songs are not catchy. Someone said here that Elton's tank runs out of gas. And that is true. GYBR is great album and also Caribou and other albums from 70'es but this just isn't. Only good song here is Island girl(that is something like Crocodile rock). Dan Dare sounds like ugly interpretation but it's funny.In all this rock songs there are not even a good song like Pinball Wizard or Saturday...! Only good thing is that this is Elton's last album with songs like here. I don't want even to imagine how will be sounded Rock of the Westies(part two). I know that almost no one will be agree with me but don't shoot me ,I am just a guy with my opinion!
This was a disappointment but it did turn up a few gems. "Billy Bones and the White Bird" was a great rocker with thundering drums, a must-have for any Elton John fan. "Island Girl" was a textbook Elton John single for that era, and "I Feel Like A Bullet In The Gun Of Robert Ford" was a first class Elton John ballad; don't settle for live versions of the song that appear on compilations. Of the remaining six songs only "Feed Me" would be worth downloading.Imagine the shock of hearing an album open with not one but two awful songs before rolling into the single. This had been unheard of for an Elton John album up to that point. "Grow Some Funk Of Your Own" was a grade Z single at the time and in retrospect is better left forgotten.The few memorable songs make this the last hurrah of Elton's seventies classics. One can't hold his subsequent recording history against him too much though given the string of great music he gave us in the early to mid-seventies.
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...This is Elton's transition album into his worse musical period. The difference between this and his next release "Blue Moves" is we don't have to tolerate his mistakes through two CDs!  "Grow Some Funk of Your Own" is another classic Elton song and the last great song for the rest of the decade.
First Band on the Moon by The Cardigans had the potential to be a great pop album but there are only 2 good tracks, Lovefool and Been It. Most of the time I don't care for the songs that were huge hits but the rest of the songs are boring and lifeless. The Cardigans have a great sound but too bad they couldn't churn out timeless songs.
Cardigans` third record is, well, not all that different from their previous ones. This time the lyrics get a little darker and cynical at parts, although the songs remain poppy, acessible, and, unfortunately, a bit forgettable. This is easy listening, which isn`t too bad but it`s not that exciting either and becomes a somewhat repetitive album. This meld of pop, lounge and kitsch is mildly entertaining but &igrave;sn`t enough to make a solid record. Still, there are some good songs here, like the pretty &quot;The Great Divide&quot; or the catchy &quot;Been It&quot;, even if the rest ends up sounding the same. Cute and listenable, but that`s it. The bands` next release, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, is a more consistent and ambitious offering, stepping in a new and darker direction.
Well, let's not deny the impact Shania Twain's looks have on record sales. Twain is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I've seen and she can also sing - that's good but not essential for success. "Come on over" is mainly country-pop of rather harmless character and songs like "Man I feel like a woman" and "Don't be stupid" is alright. The big hit "That don't impress me much", which by the way isn't sounding anything like country is a great song, but the rest of the material is very mediocre. I guess country music as a genre were in need of something to still be appealing, but I doubt this commercialization is the right way to go. To me it sounds a bit lifeless and without soul. I put my hope to the likes of Steve Earle and Jayhawks instead.
It's no secret that Shania isn't really country. Infact, she tries to be just about everything besidescountry. She done like alot of artist do... Start outinnocent,then as time goes along she sells out moreand more to please the masses.What is it? It's production and marketing. I mean, ifyou are going to sell out why not try and reach outto everybody? She comes with the ballads, a few slightrockers, pop songs... Just about everything. She evencomes out with the international version(which is theone I have)that sounds at times like dance music.She's like a new version of Madonna to be honest. Youcan't say she's ALL bad... But alot of her seems tobe about the attention and money. I bought into itwhen I was younger and I'll admit that... but about5 years ago my tastes started changing and "artists"like Shania pushed me to soul music. It's somethingthat Shania really doesn't have alot of.If I had to say which tracks on this album are thebest I'd go with: You've Got A Way and Rock ThisCountry! and From This Moment On. The rest is prettymuch just catchy and cheap pop songs. Her secondalbum "The Woman In Me" is actually the betteralbum than this one.
There are worse albums in Elton John's catalogs than 1998's "The Big Picture" - I've already reviewed several of them. However, while it doesn't quite sink to the level of "Leather Jackets" or "Victim of Love," "The Big Picture" is Elton (and Bernie Taupin) at his most generic and uninspired.Unlike those previous efforts, there's no real underlying factor (drug abuse, attempting to stay relevant) to why "The Big Picture" is a subpar effort. It's not terrible, and it's certainly more listenable than the other two atrocities I listed (not to mention superior to "A Single Man" and perhaps "Ice on Fire"), but it suffers from a combination of maudlin lyrics and uninspired melodies and syrupy arrangements that do little to distinguish one track from the other. Several really good songs ("Recover Your Soul," "Live Like Horses," "Wicked Dreams") lose their potential due to being smothered by garish, overbearing electronic arrangements that overshadow their more organic elements.The album's best remembered track, the mega-hit "Something About the Way You Look Tonight," (the lead track on the double-single that brought forth the all-time bestselling "Candle in the Wind 1997"), is trite lyrically but is sold by Elton's passionate vocal and a subtler arrangement than the rest of the tracks. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly bombastic, but not nearly as bad as some of the other tracks here."The Big Picture" is not a classic by any means, and is undoubtedly one of Elton's weakest efforts.
First of all, The Big Picture isn't a bad album. It's just not what one would of hoped it would be. This album is a disappointment. Especially coming off a string of good albums like "Sleeping With The Past", "The One", "Made In England", and the greatest ballad hits collection, "Love Songs". This album is fairly low tempo. There are a few mid tempo songs, but not many. That's alright. It's just the low tempo ones are a little too long and unmemorable. There are high points. "Something About The Way You Look Tonight", "The Big Picture", "Wicked Dreams", "If The River Can Bend", "Love's Got A Lot To Answer For", are the high points. The rest aren't bad, they just don't seem to hit the right notes. Elton, by the way, sounds great. He always does. This was just a disappointment. Not that great. Could of been so much better.
The Big Picture for me was as a step down from the achievements of the previous release, Made In England. The main problem is the over production by Chris Thomas who gives these songs a dense, wall of sound production that drains the melodies dry. The songs themselves however are not that bad. In fact, it's a shame that several didn't escape to surface on a future album. Opening with Long Way From Hapiness, it's a fitting opener in lieu of Elton's recent personal tragedies, the death of Princess Diana and his good friend, Gianni Versace - though the album was recorded prior to those events in the summer of 1997.Taupin returns for another round of lyrics that are his least ambitious in recent memory. Partly based on a loose concept of writing big old time ballads that the likes of Sinatra would sing, the album never quites hits it mark. Most are too simplistic and lack his unique narrative to tell what amounts to basic love stories. Love's Got A Lot To Answer For is perhaps the best example of this: "love's got a lot to answer for, I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore".Others like, Something About The Way You Look Tonight, which appears to be a grand attempt at a classic ballad, only succeeds due to Elton's powerful delivery. The melody and lyric however are routine at best.And that's the problem with the rest. Live Like Horses is a powerful ballad about the death of Taupin's father but is mired by an over use of synthesizers and unnecessary effects (if you ever heard this solo, it's a great song). Meanwhile, The End Will Come and I Can't Steer My Heart Clear of You simply don't go anywhere. Most of these songs are slow to mid-tempo with the only real upbeat song being the closer Wicked Dreams. That one, while probably the most interesting lyric, simply never excels into what could have been a great rock song. It's just simmers, never boils.But all is not lost here. If The River Can Bend is a wonderful gospel rave-up with a fantastic piano solo. January has a melody that changes and shifts dramatically along side one of Taupin's most romantic lyrics. The title track also has some nice moments, including a wonderful opening of just Elton and piano.As you can see, I struggle with Elton's albums where I'm torn. I just can't outright not like it because there are some great songs here and Elton sings with great passion throughout.My biggest complaint is the production. It would make a great bookend to The One, another over produced album. But this was five years since The One and Chris Thomas brought nothing new to the table for Elton and these songs. Elton and Thomas had disagreements during the recording according to a recent biography by David Buckley and Taupin complained that the album sounded cold and too technical.The Big Picture falls squarely in the middle of pack of Elton's albums. And for me, that's frustrating.Best Tracks: Live Like Horses, If The River Can Bend, January, The Big Picture and Something About The Way You Look Tonight.
This Elton John release just is not up to par by any means.  Yes there are some "good" songs: Long Way From Happiness, Love Like Horses, Something In The Way You Look Tonight, and The Big Picture.  These songs are indeed well crafted.  However, they fall a bit short of the best of Elton's Classic 70's period as well as from other top releases like The One and Made In England.The remaining tracks aren't terrible per say.  However, they just drag on and on without having anything meaningful to say.  Coupled with the fact that most of them are over five minutes long, its a real chore to listen to this CD in one sitting.Furthermore, the pacing and stylings of the record are limited.  Way too many ballads and mid tempo pieces that lack excitement and verve.  On top of that, the arrangements are so identical.  Must every piece have a synthesizer string arrangement?  Elton's trademark keyboard runs just aren't present enough in the overall mix.  Yes there are some good solos, but once the solo is finished Elton's piano playing more often than not falls into the background behind the strings.  The guitar, bass, and drums don't do anything exciting on any of the tracks.A few good songs here and there, but I would recommend passing on this collection.
Maybe, as another reviewer noted, Elton was going through a difficult time when recording this album.  Or maybe he'd been devoting the majority of his time working on songs for Aida and El Dorado (both projects, according to  EJ, were five years in the making).  Whatever the case, this John/Taupin  effort is awfully lukewarm.  I wasn't particularly fond of Made in England  (sappy self-help songs), but at least that record sounded like EJ put  effort into it.  The Big Picture however has the feel of product--the  perfunctory Elton/Bernie release to keep their giant wheel turning.  It's  also not a good sign when the only bonafide hit off this thing, Something  About The Way You Look Tonight, is a weak single.  Like Healing Hands or  You Gotta Love Someone, Something is soft-rock, adult-comtemporary  complacency.  The song does have wonderful, soulful verses, but the chorus  is dull and cliched.  The two best songs on this CD are Long Way From  Happiness and Recover Your Soul, but neither are classic EJ cuts.  Long Way  is especially burdened (as is the whole album) with drum machines and  grandiose electric keyboards.  Gosh, how wonderful this song would have  been if Elton had recorded it entirely with his piano.In fairness,  though, the production is top-notch and Elton's singing does sound strong.  Now middle-aged, it seems Elton's songwriting skills have dropped but his  sense of how to use his voice have improved.  Nevertheless, I'd recommend  passing this album by (or, at worst, purchasing it VERY cheap online).  Oddly, I recommend The Road to El Dorado, a soundtrack that features EJ's  best work since the early 80's
I've been an E.J. fanatic for a long time.  I've owned everything he's put out with the exception of Victim Of Love (I think I can be forgiven for that).  I find this this album to be adult contemporary elevator music at it's worst.  I wanted so much to love this album---and I tried---I really tried.Yes, the single, "Something About The Way..." is catchy and is the saving grace of this album.  Another great song is the haunting, "Long Way From Happiness."  Other than that though, I find this work completly forgetable.  It is nowhere NEAR the same league as some of his earlier releases like "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" or "Honky Chateau."Luckily, from his next album releases, "Songs From The West Coast", "Peachtree Road", and now "Captain & The Kid", we now know Elton hadn't totally lost his edge.  After first hearing this dud, I feared he had.  If you have a hankering for some newer E.J. masterpieces, avoid this CD and go for one of the previously mentioned.
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer..."Recover Your Soul" is decent and adding the duet version of "Live Like Horses" would have been a slight improvement. The big single "Something in the Way" was only big because of the song it was paired with cuz it's nothing special.
I truly don't like John Mellencamp.  His music was always some of the most offensive classic rock that came from the 80's because he hardly ever had any interesting musical ideas.  Generic country rock with unmemorable vocal melodies.  A weak Creedence Clearwater Revival ripoff.  That's my impression of his work.  It was always straight-forward, predictable commercial country rock/hard rock that never really did anything for me personally.This collection of tracks captures every single overplayed moment in all of its glory.  A disc you truly don't need to own because even today all you have to do is turn on your radio to ANY classic rock station and find most of the songs on the disc featured there, making this disc entirely pointless.The songs I particularly dislike would be "Pink Houses" and "Lonely Ol' Night".  "Jack and Diane" HAS to be one of the most overplayed songs of all-time.  It was great the first time you heard SOME of these songs, but not anymore.  Overexposure can ruin a musicians career in the long run.I have warmed up to "Small Town" over the years though.  "Hurt so Good" has to be one of the corniest attempts at a ballad ever.
Well shame on the people involved in this "SACD Deluxe Edition" project. Oh, maybe that's a little harsh.First off, as another Amazon reviewer noted, the sound has been aggressively compressed, which means, by the time you've reached the later stages of the album, you may experience some ear fatigue. The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics. I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix, which is a sign of over compressing. The song, "House Of Four Doors" comes off really well, actually. It's never sounded so powerful. I didn't even know their was a kick drum on that song! But, then a song like "The Actor," has a strange moment, Justin's vocal is almost buried by the normally mellow background, which is led by the mellotrons flutes. Has the music industry gone compression mad? Or, were the Moodies worried that their back catalogue (the holy seven) lacked musical muscle, and super charging it with heavy compression is the answer? Or even both?Another thing about aggressive compression, about a year ago I bought the EMI "re-master" of Deep Purple's 1973 "Who Do We Think We Are" album, and by the time I got towards the end, my ears were tired. So, recently I bought the gold disc version which avoids over compression, and it not only sounded better, but my ears weren't tired by the end. But, since the Moodies don't play as loud as Purple, it shouldn't be a real problem. Now that I got that off my chest...Secondly, the "SACD Deluxe Edition" bonus track enticement, just ticks me off. Sure, there are some good rarities here. For example, "Dr. Livingston" is actually more convincing than the official version. So then, why not release a "Rarities Collection" instead? Maybe they thought the material isn't strong enough to stand on it's own? I don't know. But, it does make for good bonus track material.Thirdly, as another Amazon reviewer noted, the great cover artwork has been ruined by the people in charge of reproducing the cover! The cover images have been reproduced way too light so that nearly all the detail has been faded! But, the booklet is really good, with rare photos, stories and lots studio information.In conclusion, after hearing a number of these "SACD Deluxe Editions," I'll be keeping my old (1997) re-masters, after all, they still look and sound great. But now I have two versions of each album, great, just what I needed?!
This is a typical late 60s Moody Blues album.  Take a couple of good  songs, in this case &quot;The Question&quot; and &quot;And the Tide Rushes  In,&quot; and surround them with a bunch of super pretentious filler  material.  You're better off with a Moody Blues anthology album.

It seemed to help at least a couple songs "The Balance," where the bottom end was a lot more in control and "Never Comes The Day," which sounded really clear and focused. But, overall, has the whole music industry gone "compression" crazy? Or, are the Moody Blues worried that their back catalogue (the holy seven) was lacking musical muscle, and are super charging it with heavy compression?Also, another reviewer talked about the bass being too quiet for the surround sound mix, but I felt the bass wasn't as strong on the "regular" mix, as it is on the other "SACD Deluxe Editions." It's reasonable, but not as breathtakingly boosted as the others in this deluxe series.Another thing about aggressive compression, this also happened about a year ago when I bought the EMI "re-master" of Deep Purple's 1973 album "Who Do We Think We Are."

Even though it had been six years since their last album, the boys had been very busy. All members released at least one solo album, and Hayward and Lodge recorded together. So it's not like they had a huge backlog of songs that had piled up, and it shows here. The song selection is weak, and the band seems to be going through the motions here. The first side of the album is pretty solid, but the second side is abyssmal. Skip this one and go right to the much better  Long Distance Voyager.
I was never a big Moody Blues fan but this does have one great song..."Steppin in a Slide Zone". I like it because it rocks much harder than their typical works. "Driftwood" and "I'll be Level with you" are also good. After that, the quality severely wanes.
After the Moody Blues' superb album "Seventh Sojourn," fans had to wait another six years before the band's next album, having to be content with wading through various solo projects, and the decent, but uneven, "Blue Jays" album (a collaboration between Justin Hayward and John Lodge).  Unfortunately, it was clearly not worth the wait, as "Octave" proved to be, far and away, the band's weakest album to that point (later "outdone" by the dreadful "Sur La Mer" and "Keys of the Kingdom").The album starts out promisingly enough, with the lively "Steppin' in a Slide Zone" written by John Lodge.  A closer listening though, reveals how thin this song is, and how it relies on gimmickry more that musicianship.  Still, it is one of the albums best songs, and far better that Lodge's other contribution, the cloying "Survival."The two songs by Ray Thomas are over-orchestrated, boring, and immediately forgettable, all the more surprising in that every preceding album has at least one (and sometimes two) strong Thomas contribution.  Edge's "I'll Be Level With You" is noisy but without much substance, and Pinder's "One Step Into the Night" is simply awful, with the worst Moody Blues' lyrics ever written (i.e. "the one thing I can do, is play my mellotron for you").As far as Justin's four songs, I suppose "Driftwood" is the best one, but that isn't saying much.  I find "Top Rank Suite" annoying, and "The Day We Meet Again" just too long.Luckily, the next album "Long Distance Voyager" would be a significant improvement, and, I suppose, that since "Octave" was the first album the band released after I "discovered" them and became a huge fan (I think in 1975), it will always have a certain amount of sentimental value for me.
Other than Layla, there isn't much of interest here, just more British white boy blues, I'd stick to the comps.
How is it that so many people think this album is great? I'm a fan of the Go go's and I finally got this album. I've heard some tracks here and there throughout the years. After listening to the complete album, I must say, the only reason I think they actually got their status was due to them being young female rockers with elements of pop. In my opinion, they didn't master their sound until after the broke up. This is evident on 'Return to the Valley of the Go go's'. You can hear in the arrangements of the music and vocals that the texture in the playing, along with Belinda's vocal performance was more refined and listenable.As for Beauty and the Beat, I'm completely disappointed. Belinda's singing is awful on some of these tracks, very pitchy and off-key. A lot of the band's work is also slightly out of tune. Their wasn't the best harmony in their debut. Belinda even said it, along with the others, that they were pretty much self-tought, and some of their playing/singing was off. She also stressed that because it was the 'punk days' they could get away with not knowing how to play, because 'it was punk'. Well, let me just add to that, she tells no lies. It's necessarily the songs or lyrics. I think the songs could've been better if Belinda was more vocally trained, and the band was more in shape. Their most developed sound were the three new songs from 1994's Valley of the Go go's , and 'Bless the Go go's from 2001. I think if they were in this shape while recording this album, it'd be so.much better. As for this album, I could do without it. Everytime Belinda trys to hit those high note's I cringe and squint my eyes. I can't be the only one who knows that 'We got thee beat' is played too high for Belinda's vocal, you can hear that she sounds forced as if she's struggling. I'm pretty sure she was out of breath and winded after that recording session...I also noticed how some of the songs have a very pop-country sound to them. Belinda sings with a twang as well throughout this album. Fading fast isa great example of this
This album is a little too sluggish at times. While I like What's Up, the rest of the album struggles to find an identity. Too many of the songs sound like ripoffs of every alternative band that was hot in 1992.  But the strong standout is Linda Perry's strong vocals. She sounds like she's not having it! Linda wins on the singing alone on every cut. But the music doesn't really match up. Perry right now is a very hot producer and songwriter for singers like Christina Aguilera, Pink, Gwen Stefani, Kelly Osbourne and countless others. Her Beautiful song for Christina even won a Grammy!  She has really come a long way from this already forgotten band,and I'm sure some of the members are in other bands or quit music. Don't ask Linda to be on a One-Hit Wonders show (which VH-1 is so obsessed about these days) about this band--she's too busy making hits for the masses and I'd rather hear her do that now!
This is the only Jay-Z album that I don't like. Jigga sounded like he was riding on the Puffy sound too much.  And it's obvious with the ones that Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy producers produced for this album.  They sound like rejects from Puffy's own No Way Out album.  The one that he did with Babyface is not that good. The album's songs don't fit with Jay-Z's rap style one bit and the album sounds so very uneven.  The '98 album he did after this one was really his best to me. This second album is really his worst, full of lame songs!
Reasonable Doubt was probably the best CD Jay-Z ever put out so we all expected In My Lifetime to be just as good or better right?? WRONG.  With 1 less track then Reasonble Doubt (not that it matters) this CD just doesn't sound good coming out of an extremly talented rapper, even the beats aren't really that good.  If you want to hear this CD don't buy, download it or just download &quot;A Million and One Questions (the intro), city is mine, and where i'm from and those are the best songs on the CD, if there is any.  I think if Jay stuck with the same formula he used in reasonable doubt in all of his CDs we wouldn't be hearing junk like Blueprint 2 or In my lifetime.
This cd issssssssss nothinggggg there are only 2 good songs that i like on this album maby the ppl over at weast side love this kind of music but east coast isint down with this g funk garbage warren g isint all that with his lyrics this cd isint worth buying trust me.
This is the beginning of Warren G's slump of sub par albums. The highlights on this album are few and far between, with one hot track, "I Shot the Sherriff". Unless you absolutely need to hear more Warren G, I would steer clear of this. Warren's lyrics are pretty bland and meaningless, which was ok on Regulate...The G Funk Era because they were accompanied by tight beats, but here the beats don't make up for the poor lyrics. Warren's worst album.
I dont care if someone think I am ignorant or anything but I never felt this was a great Dylan album. Many call this his best but I beg to differ. Definitly NOT his best...but not his worst either. Average album with 3 great songs...the rest are ok..not great.
Call me crazy, but when is an artist in our lifetime going to write something of substance?  Not since Creed's last masterpiece in 1997 or so have we heard any music that matters.  This one from Bob Dylan doesn't reverse the trend of sappy pop and meaningless lyrics that infiltrate the radio waves.  Some of Dylan's acoustic work is good, and I give him props for his work at the controls, but where is the heart, where is the soul?  Where is the topnotch singing?  This guy sounds crusty and somewhat feeble.Now, if you're looking for good rock, check out Bush 'n' Creed.  Those are bands that make Dylan look like a washed-up geek.  Speaking of geeks, does anyone know when Coldplay's fourth album will hit stores?KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK...AND KEEP CHECKIN' MY SITE!!LATER!!!!!!!!!!!
I am trying to appreciate the creativity and imagery of Bob Dylan. Whereas I do admire the atmospherics on such cuts as Your A Big Girl Now and Tangled Up In Blue, too many of these songs are excessively long winded. Heck that Jack of Hearts number must have twelve or thirteen verses all at the same pace with absolutely no change in instrumental definition. This is oh so grating.Also annoying is Bob Dylan's voice on several songs. Some people may find Idiot Wind to be an emotional performance. And the lyrics are indeed quite good in that vein. However, Dylan is so off key in many instances that it is a really pain to listen to especially over the course of seven and a half minutes.In general many of these songs are overlong and way too repetitive. Way too many verses which just don't do anything special for me most of the time. I know Dylan's aim was to return to his acoustic roots. However, the lack of an electric presence on more than the bluesy Meet Me In The Morning just hold this CD back.Tangled Up In Blue is a pretty cool song, Meet In The Morning has some nice guitar, and some of the other tunes have good atmospherics. However, I prefer other recordings by Mr. Zimmerman such as Blond On Blonde, Nashville Skyline, and The Basement Tapes....
I don't know what the guy in the product description is talking about but clearly he know's little about music!  This album albeit borrows heavily from the ideas of Led Zeppelin (hey, so did myriads of other musicians)is a brave second effort from Heart and I think is their best album.  "Barracuda" is a classic rock standard while the other tracks are also very good and it's hard to find a weak track here.  The album flows like a good album should and the end product is clearly greater than the sum of the individual tracks which is rare indeed.  It also sticks to a theme and pulls it off very well (Gypsy-style, exotic music).  The only reason this gets 2 stars is that the sound quality is not good and this clearly needs a major remastering job.  I recommend not getting this version but by all means get the remastered one which would get 5 stars from me.
This is the perfect example of a mediocre album.  I bought this record(not cd)many years ago used when I was in high school.  I liked the album oriented tracks, Love Alive, Barracuda, Little Queen, and Kick It Out as  the guitar licks and arrangements are quite ear catching to this day.  Other than these &quot;lead tracks&quot;, there isn't much else.  Say Hello  and Treat Me Well have interesting riffs but are not as complete as the  aforementioned &quot;lead tracks&quot;.  And the rest of the music sounds  like they were trying to record enough music to fill the length of the  record.  Go On Cry merely consists of Anne Wilson yelling these words  throughout a meandering riff.  A bargain bid purchase is all this disc is  really worth.
I must go against the grain of the other reviews posted here and say for the record that &quot;All'n'All&quot; is far from EW&amp;F's best work.  Although it boasts some amazing cover art and the group's musicianship is  as proficient as  ever, the overall sound is overrefined, slick, and  heavily disco-oriented.  The album starts out OK with &quot;Serpentine  Fire&quot; and then quickly  hits rock bottom with &quot;Fantasy&quot;, a  perfect example of the kind of super-cheeze ballad that permeated the late  70s.  The rest of the album follows the same pattern, with overworn  grooves, cliched lyrics and excruciatingly overblown string arrangements  designed for all the hip disco clubs of the time.  Only the instrumental  &quot;Magic Mind&quot; reminds one of the group's previous experimentalism,  and is the one highlight of the record besides &quot;Serpentine Fire&quot;.  Don't get me wrong--I have nothing against commercialism per se, as I love  both &quot;Open Our Eyes&quot; and &quot;That's The Way Of The World&quot;.  But the songs here follow a very rigid, overly produced formula that  bleeds all of the heart and soul out of them, so that all that is left is  the cheeze.
Were David Gilmour not a member of Pink Floyd, there's no way this album would still be in print after 22 years.  Gilmour's an excellent guitarist and a fine singer, but he has none of the songwriting vision of his former bandmate, Roger Waters.  It was Waters warped worldview that gave classic Pink Floyd its edge.  Gilmour's undeniable talent may have added to Floyd's sound, but on his own he has nothing much to say.  The songs on his debut album are mostly interchangeable.  They are also pleasent enough, but dissipate before they can make an impression on your frontal lobe.  That Gilmour could release an album of lumbering dinosuar rock in the midst of the punk explosion and not be ridiculed is some kind of testament.  But its no reason to indulge him these many years later.
This is a huge disappointment.  Every song goes absolutley nowhere.  David sounds like he is just learning how to write songs (where is the melody??) and what is here is very empty and meandering.  Some of the guitar playing is good but overall there is not one good song or melody here.  Skip this and get his 2nd solo album About Face which is excellent!
Billy Joel sounds great to middle aged women and lovelorn agnsty preteens, but his shtick gets old pretty fast. Critics have suggested that Joel is not rock, and while this is not true, his debt to the Brill building is obvious. It's easy to imagine his songs being the basis for a snappy Broadway musical. I admit that I was a fan back in my own misspent youth, given as I was to soggy sentimentality, but unlike Billy, I grew up. You will too. Till then, you will probably love this album.
Why am I giving this Michael Jackson masterpiece only two stars?  I have a serious issue with the remastering -- it's way too bright on my high-end (and otherwise very flat with no tone controls) stereo system.  Who the heck maintained the boosted treble?  I'm sure this would sound great equalized on an AM radio station, but it's hurting my ears.  The sound quality of the original album is remarkably crisp...stinging, in fact.So, this is just a warning for those expecting the remastering to have corrected the riding-the-treble-gain problem.  I recommend those without the usual treble/bass tone controls who still have their hearing avoid this particular release.
When an album sells somewhere around 30 million copies and it is the biggest selling album in the history of the music business, it does garner my attention.  Therefore, separating out Michael Jackson's personal life from his music - I decided to review his 1982 release "Thriller".  Looking at this album strictly from a creative musical standpoint, I do think this album is overrated.  For this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones assemble a powerful team of musicians.  These musicians - while very talented probably weren't the reason why this collection became the monster-selling album that it became.  Simply put, this album sold because it came along at the right time - and was marketed very well to fit in with the times.The musicians that contribute to this album are big names.  There probably aren't many names bigger than Paul McCartney.  McCartney is well known for his  entertaining duet with Jackson on "The Girl is Mine".  However, there are many other big names that contributed collection as well: James Ingram (background vocals on "Wanna Be Starting Somethin'", songwriter of "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)"),  Toto's David Paich (an arranger on "The Girl is Mine", Synthesizers on "Human Nature" and "The Lady in My Life"),  Mega-producer David Foster (Synthesizer arrangments on "The Girl is Mine"), Vincent Price (provides the famous sinister 'rap' on "Thriller"),  Eddie Van Halen (a guitar solo on "Beat It"), Toto's Steve Porcaro (Songwriter of "Human Nature", Synthesizer on "Beat It", "Human Nature", and "The Lady in My Life"), Toto's Steve Lutkather (Guitars and Bass on "Beat It", Guitars on "Human Nature"), Toto's Jeff Porcaro (Drums on "Beat It",  "Human Nature", and "The Lady in My Life"), and LaToya and Janet Jackson (background vocals on "P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)"  Finally, acclaimed keyboard player and studio musician Greg Phillinganes (who worked on Lionel Richie's "Cant' Slow Down" and Donald Fagen's "The Nightfly" - two outstanding albums in this era) contributes to several of the tracks on the collection.  As for the Toto band members, I do feel their contributions are overlooked.  They had only one year ago released their own critically acclaimed album - "Toto IV" and now they were working on "Thriller" and Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow Down" - two of the largest selling albums of this time period.I don't feel it was Michael Jackson's vocals or any of the outstanding talent that helped this collection become the blockbuster seller that it became.  This album was released in December, 1982.  This was a time the music industry was undergoing change.  This was the beginning of the age of music video.  I give Michael Jackson and his management team credit.  They take what I consider a mostly average set of songs, but they marketed it with some very clever music videos.  Say what you want about Michael Jackson's music - but he did make the most of this medium.  The videos basically became a marketing machine for this album - and it resulted in seven Top 10 hits of the 9 songs on "Thriller" in the United States. (The title track "Thriller" is probably the best example of this).There are several reasons why this album is "average" at best:- The Percussions are awful.  Despite having one of the best drummers and musicians in the business in Toto's Jeff Porcaro, this album basically takes a bunch of music and puts a disco dance beat behind them.  There is very little in the way of any solid drumming on this album.- There is little in the way of any cohesion on this album.  Yes it did have a mixture of styles (the Rock-edge on "Beat It" to the R&B; Style of "Baby Be Mine" and "The Lady in My Life" to the campy "The Girl is Mine").  A lot of times this happens when there are "too many cooks in the kitchen" - while there was a vast array of talent, I do feel that eventually this impacted the final product (even Quincy Jones couldn't fix that).- There is nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album.  Yes, the music videos were groundbreaking - but not the music.- One thing I discovered is that Michael's songwriting didn't really shine.  I thought it was the songs written by "outsiders" that were better.  The Steve Porcaro "Human Nature" penned song is probably the strongest effort on the collection.  Rod Temperton is very underrated on this album.  Many people don't realize that he wrote the "Thriller" track (while it isn't my favorite, it is probably the only innovative track of the collection). Temperton also wrote the two underrated R&B; tunes - "Baby Be Mine" and "The Lady in My Life".As for the positives:- The strong points are the contributions of the Toto band members.  As mentioned, "Human Nature" is probably the strongest track.  While I've never been a fan of "Beat It", there is some good instrumentation in there.  I actually feel if "Beat It" was just done as an instrumental without the disco beat - it would sound good.- Eddie Van Halen does give a terrific solo on "Beat It".- If you are a Synth-Pop fan, this album (with the exception of "Beat It") is going to provide plenty of it.The liner notes include all of the lyrics and do a good job at providing musician and songwriting credits. Overall, when I look at this collection - I just don't think it is the greatest album of all time.  I would even say that for the year it was "Album of the Year" that The Police's "Synchronicity" and Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow Down" were miles ahead of "Thriller".  The bottom line is that if there were no music videos, this would have been just another 80s Synth-Pop album.  If you are curious on what all the hype is - then you may want to get this collection - otherwise I don't recommend it.
I think even Michael Jackson doesn't understand how this average recording turned out to be the best seeling record ever. It's an average albun, not bad at all, but nothing special. There are three or four great songs, the  rest is plain boring.
There's no shame in PRIEST releasing this album. If their only option was to sell out, use puffy hair and thing like that, they even managed to release a stisfactory pop-metal album. I must remember you that this was not a &quot;phenomenom&quot; that occured only with the mighty Priest, during the middle eighties: it also happened with SAXON, SCORPIONS, MICHAEL SCHENKER, RAVEN, ACCEPT, and other greta European bands, who tried hard to &quot;make America&quot;. In Judas case, they had already &quot;made America&quot; with their previous albuns, but probably greedy executive men made up their minds about selling out and making even more money. So, in DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH we have the first clear signs of what we should have to endure with the release of the &quot;great&quot; TURBO..
I'll stick to my old CD from this album than to the remastered version. What a dissapointment.. After so much publicity before releasing them, we've got almost the same thing, with bad extra tracks and no great insight in the booklet.
I was surprised that "Turbo" took such a beating with Priest Fans, because "Defenders Of Faith" has got to be, by far, the weakest Priest album with RH. The album really fools you by kicking some ass with the first three songs, and then starts to slowly fall apart. The Sentinel and Heads are gonna roll are Mediocre, but passable, but the last four songs on the album are the worst S**t songs that I have heard on a Priest album, and those ballads Judas Priest has no buiness singing. Sure, Ram it Down and Turbo have been bashed, and those albums aren't Great, but slightly above average around the 3 1/2 Stars rating. This One Sucks. Save your money, Get the first three songs (hint-hint) and avoid the rest
At the time this was hailed as Alice Cooper's "Comeback "album. Trash features an Alice Cooper made for 1989, the catchy commercial songs, the ballads, songs co-written with Desmond Child, and the collaborations with Steven Tyler and Jon Bon Jovi (also Joe Perry, Richie Sambora, Kip Winger and so on) were all attempts to make Alice seem more relevant at the time. The thing is Alice should never have cared about being current or follow trends which is pretty much what he did for "Trash". I can disagree all I want about Trash being a solid return to form but the results are there it did fairly well on the charts and this album gave Alice one of this biggest hits with "Poison".I feel the opening track and lead single of the album "Poison" is by far the best song here although it's also the most popular. It's just a great big catchy ballad, it helped introduce Alice to a new generation and to this day it's always a live staple in concerts. "Bed of Nails" is in the vein of "Poison" in that it's a slower songs, almost a ballad that rocks a little more than Poison . A highlight of the album. "Spark In The Dark" is catchy and features a riff straight out of Bon Jovi, it's a darker song overall and while it's not the best song here and its subjected to criticism I quite like it. "House of Fire" is a bit more Alice-like and what you would expect from him but is still aimed at being a radio song as most songs from Trash are. "It's Only My Heart Talking" is another ballad, Steven Tyler participates on this one and his presence helps the song and for the time this was a good ballad. I feel those are the best moments here. There are some good moments on Trash but also filler or lesser material like the title track which doesn't cut it in my opinion or even the album closer "I'm Your Gun" which is too pop and doesn't hold up very well over time. Other songs can vary between mediocre to average.This is the deal with Trash, it's far from Alice's finest moment and it suffers from perhaps too much production and it ends up being more of a pop album. I feel like there's less Alice, it's as if he went into the studio did what he was asked to by the producer or record company.It's truly a product of its time (1989), in fact there are songs that could have been played by just about any other Glam/Hair bands of the era (that said it could be considered a good Glam metal album but its just not really "Alice" which is why some fans were/are disappointed). Alice experimented earlier in the 80's with albums like Zipper Catches Skin, Flush The Fashion and Dada and this one almost does exactly the opposite. While those albums are usually not considered among Cooper's best they were fun experiments and unique to say the least, Trash is very calculated and goes for what's modern and popular and isn't very Alice-like. The album doesn't have an interesting concept unlike most of Alice's albums; the only theme I can find on Trash is love because after all, most of the songs here are love/sexual songs pure and simple. Besides I thought that Constrictor and Raise Your Fist and Yell were comeback records. Yet there are still a few great songs on Trash that makes it worth owning even though it's obviously not Alice's finest record or his best moment.Needless to say Trash is not Alice's greatest moment. There are few songs on the album that are really good but to be honest there's also filler material and this really isn't one of the best Alice Cooper albums, in fact it's a little far from it. I wouldn't say its "Trash" but it's not a great album either as there is a lot of filler material. This one is for completists and hardcore fans mostly; otherwise I don't think it has much appeal besides "Poison" to the casual listener.  Please don't take it as a stab to Alice, I love the man and what he's done, I'd still say it's worth the $6. Trash is I feel, as you may know by now an overrated album.2 /5 stars.
I seem to be in the minority here, but this album did very little for me.  There are a few good songs, but overall I think it is weaker than both "Constrictor" and "Raise Your Fist And Yell".
this is awful material! the songs tell about justice! the riffs are quite Ok but i would like to have more intelligent lyrics like slayer's!!!
Although this is a highly touted album, it is fairly weak. Rage Against The Machine is one of the most admired bands of the rap-metal movement of the 90's, and that's fair enough, they are one of the best bands in the genre; hey! at least every song isn't some teen whining about all their angst and pain, and how they're so tough. However, for a band with a message, lead singer Zack de la Rocha raps as fast as he can, and it is often difficult to understand what he is saying, without refering to the lyrics sheet. That said, he is also often a good rapper.And with regards to the music, their song-writing is formulaic, predictable and often lazy. There are so many filler moments where the music in the background just plays a bass line on repeat and Zack raps on and on. Almost all songs follow the same pattern; intro (the chorus backing music)/ quiet verse / heavy chorus /quiet verse / heavy chorus /instrumental / heavy chorus / some screaming (e.g. on the song Wake Up). Their songwriting is not very deep, the riffs can cross the line between catchy and repetitive. Repeat plays wear this album thin fairly quickly.But their music is quite energetic, the guitarist Tom Morello has some very excellent work, he is very creative, especially with intriguing high-pitched effects. And these guys have some seriously rocking riffing. Like funk-rock that just explodes from your speakers or earphones, just like a bomb going off. And, take you hat off to Zack, he puts a lot of energy in his vocals.Unfortunately, this album is too laborious to deserve a good rating. But at least they have a lot of talent and promise. Rating **
I only liked "Closing Time" and "Anthem" on this CD, and even those are a cut below Leonard's best work. This release gave me the feeling it was made of tracks that were not good enough for earlier albums, and someone decided to put them all one disc and get rid of them. The biggest insult to his fans, however, is to try to cover Irving Berlin's "Always." Both Cohen and Berlin are great songwriters, separated by a generation and a World War and amazing changes in love and courtship and sex customs. Leonard is great at writing relationship lyrics, and so was Irving, but for different planets. Try "Various Positions" and his "Greatest Hits" albums instead of "The Future." This one is just not in the top ranks of his concept releases.
I Liked Cypress Hill more when they first came out.There First Album is still their Best as far as I'm Concearned.the Problem with this Disc&amp;much of their Music is that they only Mainly talk about Weed.They  Have Talent but it gets to be a One Trick Pony after a while.Insane&amp;I  wanna get high are still the cuts.
With the release of their second record, Get Your Wings, Aerosmith was first trying to find their voice in the world of rock n roll.  At this stage, the band gives us some gritty guitar styles and a few good hooks.  However, when compared with Toys In The Attic and other material, this collection is a little bit weak.Out of the eight songs, I find three(Same Old Song And Dance, Lord Of The Thighs, and Train Kept A Rollin') stand out the most.  And even these songs are good and not quite great.  Seasons Of Wither is a little noteworthy too as a result of an interesting acoustic guitar passage.Seek out Toys In The Attic, Nine Lives, and/or a good compilation.  This one shows a little promise but does not fully deliver.
Toys in the Attic is an overrated, overplayed disaster.The only decent songs are the title track and "Uncle Salty".  "Walk This Way" has a unique vocal melody for the time it was released in the mid 70's, but that doesn't mean I like it.  "Big Ten Inch" sounds like some fake novelty song that wears thin after a couple listens."Sweet Emotion" is a decent song, but the live versions are MUCH better because the song demands a lot of energy, which this studio version lacks.  "No More No More" is Aerosmith's version of a pop song, and an unmemorable one at that.  "Round and Round" is a rip-off of Black Sabbath's "Sweet Leaf" and for some reason, a hard rock band thought it was a good idea to end an album with a ballad called "You See My Crying", complete with overdramatic emotions that sound forced and unreal.Aerosmith is a pretty fantastic band, but Get Your Wings is the place to start.  Or buy that live album released in the late 70's.
What WAS I thinking claiming Rocks to be Aerosmith's masterpiece?  The album has too many flaws for any kind of "masterpiece" talk to be thrown around.  How can an album be popular without any good guitar riffs, unmemorable vocal melodies and uninspiring drum work?  Even Steven Tyler doesn't seem to care whenever he opens his mouth.  His vocal work on tracks like "Combination" and "Nobody's Fault" absolutely stink.  A very annoying high pitched sound that was never a problem on any Aerosmith album before this one.  I don't know if he was trying a new style or just didn't care.  It was probably the drugs getting the best of him.  Let's not even mention the god awful ballad that closes the album.Not all the songs should be avoided though.  Besides the two big memorable hits that open the album, you have "Rats in the Cellar" which is an AWESOME track.  Maybe one of the fastest songs I've ever heard the band do, and it positively rules.  Side two has some good moments, but it's not really an album worth owning.
Like many other reviewers, the band was in decline on this batch.  The record starts off strong with the gritty Title Track and I Wanna Know Why(probably the best track on the collection). However, afterwards its very much hit and miss with more of the miss quality.  Kings And Queens is fairly creative at elast with some noteworthy piano, strings, and Tylers best vocal performance on the record. Get It Up is a cool track but the rest is mediocre or even abysmal.  Choose Toys in The Attic or a compilation isntead.
THE BAND: Steven Tyler (vocals, piano, harmonica), Joe Perry (guitars), Brad Whitford (guitars), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums & percussion).THE DISC: (1978) 16 tracks clocking in at approximately 76 minutes. Included with the discs is a 7-page booklet containing some great band photos, song titles/credits, where each song was recorded and when, and thank you's. All songs from 1977-78 with the exception of "I Ain't Got You" and "Mother Popcorn" from 1973. Label - Columbia.ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Debut (2), Get Your Wings (3), Toys In The Attic (3), Rocks (3), Draw The Line (1+), songs not on a studio album (4).COMMENTS: Plain and simple - most of these live recordings should have remained in the vault. The good: Joey Kramer keeps a steady beat throughout; overall decent track list - song highlights include "Back In The Saddle", "Chip Away The Stone" and "Mother Popcorn" (featuring some great saxophone from David Woodford and then leading into an uncredited smokin' version of "Draw The Line"). The bad: A majority of the songs here are simply butchered; Steven Tyler screeches and wails like a drunken sailor on leave; dueling guitars from Perry and Whitford are sloppy and actually miss musical notes; Tom Hamilton's bass guitar is for the most part absent; truly sad and careless versions of huge hits "Dream On", "Walk This Way" and "Sweet Emotion". So many great 'live' albums were released in the 1970's... an era often remembered fondly for the double-live vinyl album (Peter Frampton, Deep Purple, Kiss, UFO to name a few)... sadly Aerosmith's "Live-Bootleg" is NOT one of them. Aerosmith has always been one of my favorite rocks bands, but the timing on this album was terrible - the band members were clearly down in the dumps and at one of several low points in their career (drugs/alcohol) and their performance absolutely suffers because of it. If you're looking for some Aerosmith live, start with "Rockin The Joint" (2005).
The original Aerosmith compilation has become nothing more than a relic for completists.  Originally released as a single LP record in 1980, there are only 9 songs from their first six records (with two of them, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and &quot;Kings and Queens&quot;, substantially edited) and the Beatles cover, &quot;Come Together&quot; (originally featured on the 'Sgt. Pepper's' movie soundtrack - you know, the one with the Bee Gees).  For the casual fan, you can get just as many unedited songs from that era on the newest compilation, 'Oh Yeah!&quot;
Every few years I give this CD another chance but the end result is always the same. There are 4 decent songs and six bad tracks. Three of the bad tracks are awful. This is a CD that probably never should have been released. It has nothing to do with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford having left the band either. Rick Dufay and Jimmy Crespo were good guitar players doing the best they could in a bad situationThe good for me are Jailbait, Lightning Strikes, Bitches Brew and Rock in a Hard Place. Musically Jailbait is a fast paced, raw song even if the subject matter is juvenile. You'd think a band recording their 7th record could have come up with something more original lyrically. I always liked the guitar riffs for Lightning and Brew. Rock in a Hard Place is a boogieing rock song that is underrated.The rest of the songs aren't good. Bolivian Ragamuffin and Jig is Up are boring. Prelude to Joanie is poetry from an addict's drug-addled mind and its follow-up, Joanie's Butterfly, is a mess. Push Comes to Shove isn't much better. Cry Me a River is a great old song, but this version is terrible. Steven Tyler has one of the best rock 'n roll voices ever, but he doesn't have the voice to pull off a torch song.At some point during his tenure with the band, Rick Dufay said to the original members, "What are we doing here?" You can hear that statement throughout Rock in a Hard Place.
Well, believe it or not, Aerosmith used to be a descent band in the early 70's. This album has still a little clue, of what's been going on in the past. But still it fails, offering you the wost side of Aero-style. There  are only brief cuts form the  huge jam they had going in the 70's. But  still, it's a true masterpiece compared to the latest production.  Jeess-uss...
By the 80s Aerosmith had lost it. They had given up their trademark muscular hook driven hard rock in favor of screechen metal. Sad but true, hence, no hits, give this one a miss, even fans of the band will doubtless prefer TOYS IN THE ATTIC or GET YOUR WINGS.
This may as well been a Steven Tyler solo album. Brad Whitford and Joe Perry were gone, and Tyler had to resort to a truly god-awful cover of "Cry Me A River."The only good song here is "Lightning." Get any other Cd than this...with the exception of "Done With Mirrors," this is Aerosmith at its worst.
I find this guy's voice extremely unappealing. He sounds like he can't control it. Sometimes his voice sounds good, but then it goes weak. I'm amazed that so many people love it. This album is borderline pretentious and I just don't think the songs are very good. But some of the more atmospheric stuff sounds kinda cool, especially on the last song.P.S. - the guy's review below me is laughable. Buckley doesn't hit any "magic frequencies" - how pretentious! He can't hold a candle to NFAK either.
So he sang some simple blues songs and played his simple guitar licks and died young. And thus begins the pattern that if you die young your importance and talent become magnified far beyond what it would have been had he lived another 20 years and drank himself into obscurity. Forget the hype and get real.
In the day when I collected commercial music from my 1980s childhood, Sade, though they had only one hit ("Smooth Operator" - which sounded to me back then like "New Corporation") in my native Australia, were one of the most mentioned artists in music advertisements."Smooth Operator" I had always found enjoyable with its melodic, even haunting saxophone lines and seemingly interesting lyrics about travel across the United States. "Your Love Is King" and "Hang On To Your Love" had some truly beautiful - at least I would have though on hearing them on radio - vocals that completely overshadowed the lack of depth or fire in the backing. "Jezebel" and "The Sweetest Taboo" from Sade's second album "Promises" were even slower but had proportionately more beautiful, even absorbing vocals.However, that is where it really starts to go downhill, for on later songs there is no way in which Sade Adu's deep vocals can make up in any way at all for the lameness of her backing players. Most of the later songs really seem to stop, stop and start only in the most momentary way one could ever imagine. These songs really proved impossible for me to sit through them back in the middle 1990s when I bought this album, and I never have thought I would want to try. At times, even Sade Adu's voice can seem a little soppy rather than deep.Apart from the early singles, there is nothing even listenable here even if the album is far less dated than most music of its type from the 1980s.
Cryptic song titles, sludgey riffs, pained singing from thinly stretched vocals...it must be an Alice in Chains CD.  Yep, that's the one.AIC don't bring their A-game to the table on this self-titled disaster, except for a few key tracks: &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; and &quot;Again&quot; are true keepers, the rest of the record is deplorable.  Sadly, the only good record these guys ever made was 1993's stellar &quot;Jar of Flies,&quot; an acoustic gem that broke AIC through to the big leagues of the music industry, where they always longed to be.Rumor has it these guys used to be a hair-band from the '80s.  That's abundantly clear from this mess of a record album CD.  For true rock, check out Creed 'n' Bush.THANKS A LOT FOR LISTENIN'!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This contains one of the most boring songs ever, that I'll say right now. That song is called "Sludge Factory". Dear god, that song is awful! I shudder when I hear the high-pitched singing at the start, the lyrics are pure uninteresting crap, and musically it's just generic AIC. It's a bad song! Oh, and seven minutes of it? Um, no. Wikipedia called it "One of the more popular songs on the album" or something like that, but whoever wrote it must've been the kind of hardcore AIC fan who'd give this mess of an album a 10. And that's not its only problem: there are a bunch of "generic AIC" songs on here: "Shame in You"; "Brush Away"; "Head Creeps"; "Nothin' Song"; "So Close" and "Frogs" are all uninteresting melodically, don't have anything new to say, run out of steam way before they end, and in fact make up 7/10th of my "bottom 10 AIC songs" list. You can also find "Hate to Feel", "Whale & Wasp" and "Love, Hate, Love" on that list, if you were wondering, which I'm sure you weren't. A couple songs do have some cathartic force ("Over Now"; "Again"; "Grind"), "Heaven Beside You" makes for a great "light-and-shade" song, similar to Led Zeppelin's "Over the Hills and Far Away", but in a minor key, and "God Am" makes excellent use of synthesizers. But as a whole, this is one sad album. Kind of like that dog on the cover.
What ever happened to these guys?  They were getting better with every album, then they put out this self-titled piece of garbage.  It's their fifth album, and yet its self-titled.  Tell me if that makes sense.  And the tinted color jewel case it comes in is pretty [bad] too, probably just a strategy to sell records since I'm sure they realized the album sure wasn't going to sell based on its quality.Anyhow, I don't know why they even bothered, all the songs on here are weak.  The only song I ever care to listen to is Heaven Beside You, and even that one is slightly flawed.  Sludge Factory is the most aptly named song on the album because the title describes what it sounds like perfectly.  The rest of the songs all sound exactly the same, I can barely even tell the difference.  Facelift was kind of like that too, but it wasn't so sludgy, so harsh on the ears.  Plus all the harmonies that sounded so nice on Jar of Flies are just grating here.  I think Layne's addiction got in the way, I can't think of any other explanation for this disaster of an album.  When he sings "you'd be well advised not to plan my funeral before the body dies" it sounds horrible, I don't know what's up with his voice but I don't like it the least.Anyhow, everyone laments AIC's breakup but I'm glad they did if the songs on this album were the direction they were heading in.  Its a listenable album, but it takes a lot of effort, and its like why even bother when there's a million better CDs out there.
Overall a boring album. Fiona Apple writes good lyrics and okay music. Musically it is not very compelling and she tries to be a bit jazzy, bit rockish and poppish and even though she manages to be that all she doesn't do it very well. Her voice is irritating and constant moaning doesn't help either. Her Piano playing is overlooked by the mass production which often distract the listners from the music. Obviously talented but this album isn't very good in my opinion.
I was excited when I heard that Bruce Springsteen was going to record another album in the &quot;Nebraska&quot; mode.  My excitement turned to disappointment, however, as I listened and realized that there are no songs  here close to the power of that album's &quot;Atlantic City&quot; or  &quot;Johnny 99.&quot;  What you get instead is a lot of standard  folk-singer-stands-up-for-the-downtrodden tunes that fail to achieve any  transcendence.  Bruce's stand for the oppressed would be a lot more  convincing were he not already a multi-millionaire rock star.  This is a  well-intentioned but ultimate self-indulgent effort from an artist capable  of much better.  Never was the need for Bruce to bring back the E Street  Band more evident.
Virtual Insanity was the jam here.cosmic girl was cool but this disc is downhill after that.Jamiroquai has moments here&amp;there with the Stevie Wonder Influences but it doesn't hold up.
As Michael Jackson ventured on the second leg of the HIStory World Tour in 1997, the EP Blood On The Dancefloor was released perhaps in order to capitalize on Jackson's success in Europe. His HIStory album had experienced enormous success in Europe, yet America did not embrace the album as warmly as Europe had. Jackson's popularity in Europe was cemented as the first single Blood On The Dancefloor reached no. 1 on the English single chart, while the album enjoyed success in both England and the rest of Europe.Blood On The Dancefloor is mainly to be regarded as an EP or a remix album, consisting of 5 ordinary songs and 8 remixes. The title track and the first single Blood On The Dancefloor is a funky up-tempo song with a fusion of keyboard and teasing synthesizers. Despite being released as the opening single, the song was hardly among Jackson's finest material. In fact, Blood On The Dancefloor even sounded dated in 1997 and it has certainly not aged very well. I always found that the song bore a resemblance to the Dangerous album in terms of sound. Perhaps the material on the Blood on the Dancefloor album was written for that particular album or during the same time period. However, the gruelling theme continues as the song Morphine reveals a character completely obsessed with the drug. The soft and hunting verses are a contrast to the sturdier choruses, yet surprisingly it works quite well. Superfly Sister is Michael Jackson's attempt to simulate Prince; however the repetitive, dull baseline is an unwelcome addition. Similar to the lead single, Superfly Sister suffers from the syndrome of dated-ness. Ghosts and Is It Scary are enjoyable songs; however they are not among Jackson's greatest works. Notably, Is It Scary is a lovely track especially due to the shift between the soft verses and the tougher choruses. I considered it the best song among the 5 ordinary songs on the album. The remaining 8 songs/remixes are a Tour De Force of dance remixes. Generally, I do not like remixes, however the remix of 2 Bad, Scream-Louder and HIStory are not half-bad. Yet the remixes of the remaining songs leave a lot to be desired.Blood On The Dancefloor is primarily an indulgence for hardcore Michael Jackson fans. The few ordinary songs are pleasant, however they are not on par with Michael Jackson's back-catalogue. If you like remixes in generally, I am positive the remixes on the album would surely appeal to you. If you have recently discovered Michael Jackson's music, I would advise you to purchase Number Ones or The Essential Michael Jackson in order to fully grasp the back-catalogue of Jackson.Overall Grade: 4.0/10
I confess to buying this one for that very reason when it first came out. A friend of mine once dismissed Sting with the phrase; "He gets in my face". I couldn't be sure what he meant by that exactly, but my friend has a knee-jerk hostility to "rock" that isn't "real rock'n'roll" and Sting has a pride in his creativity that runs counter to just about every "supposed to" that says the rock singer who doesn't emphasize his charisma and avoid the "artsy" is being a bit of a heretic. Ironic, when the First Commandment of rock used to center on defiance. I guess the difference lies in just what it is you defy. But there are times when Sting gets a bit unsubtle in the way he "pays dues" to the people who came before. Like the title track "Fields Of Gold", which is lifted from his "Ten Summoners' Tales". That track is so derivative of Dylan's "My Back Pages" that I caught myself singing along and inserting the Dylan line; "Aw but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now", in a Sting vocal imitation.
An acceptable summary of his solo career is 'Fields of Gold'.  Although, like most compilations, they have annoyingly remixed certain tracks such as 'We'll Be Together'.  Who knows why they do that, it's almost as if to say  that the original wasn't very good, but all Sting fans know that it was.I  have the Australian version of this album which contains 'Love is the 7th  Wave' instead of 'Fortress Around Your Heart', a Portugese version of  'Fragile' instead of 'They Dance Alone', and 'It's Probably Me' instead of  'Why Should I Cry For You'. Not sure why they did that, as our replacements  weren't any bigger hits here than they were abroad but I am more or less  happy with the Aussie version.  Sting has successfully made the transition  from lead singer of the Police to solo artist.  His music is, as others  have sad, depressing at times but it has a unique feel about it.  It is  one of those albums that just won't date, and I will be playing it in the  next 20 years.If you really like the original version of WE'LL BE TOGETHER from 1987, avoid this album at all costs. The remix is so inferior that it is an insult to fans.
i like the music but the lyrics are not so good. i wonder why they make this kind of stuff!
Can't recall why the hype is there for this group as the live sound does not carry over into anything that I would want to hear on the radio or in concert.
With the exception of Yes, Steely Dan is generally the closest I come to prog-rock. So if you think I don't really know the genre, you're right. However, I feel this is overblown and pretentious. Granted, all that can't stop Nights In White Satin from being an incredibly powerful, lovely piece (other than the crappy stoner poem at the end). But even then, it doesn't strike me like the work of Yes (specifically Close to the Edge and Starship Trooper). The rest is overblown and endless, especially all eight-and-a-half minutes of the aptly-titled Forever Afternoon. If you're looking for grade "A" prog-rock, go with Yes.
Well shame on the people involved in this "SACD Deluxe Edition" project. Oh, maybe that's a little harsh.First off, as another Amazon reviewer noted, the sound has been aggressively compressed, which means, by the time you've reached the later stages of the album, you may experience some ear fatigue. The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics. I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix. A sign of over compressing. Has the whole music industry gone compression nuts? Or, were the Moody Blues simply worried that their back catalogue (the big 7) was lacking in musical muscle, and super charging it with heavy compression is the answer? Or both?On the EQ front, there's some added EQ to the bass and kick drum, giving me a whole new appreciation for the Moody Blues rhythm section. This "intense" re-mastering really benefited the "Dear Diary" thru "To Share Our Love" section of the album, which is usually, my least favorite part. So it's not all bad. In fairness, their albums always did lack a bit, in the bottom end, but now they don't.One more thing about aggressive compression, this also happened about a year ago when I bought the EMI "re-master" of Deep Purple's 1973 album "Who Do We Think We Are." By the time I got towards the end, my ears were tired. So, recently I bought the gold disc version which avoids over compression, and it not only sounded better, but my ears weren't tired by the end. But, since the Moodies don't play as loud as Purple, it shouldn't be a problem. Now that I got that off my chest...Secondly, the "SACD Deluxe Edition" bonus track enticement, just ticks me off to no end. Sure, there are some good rare tracks here. The BBC stuff is very nice to hear for the long time fan who only know these songs one way. But, the first five bonus cuts may take away some of  the mystery of the album. It's like when watching "the making" of a movie, and it just takes away the magic if you will, at least for me.Thirdly, as another Amazon reviewer noted, the great cover artwork has been ruined by the people in charge of reproducing the cover! The cover images have been reproduced way too light so that nearly all the detail has been faded! But, the booklet is really nice, with many color photos, insightful stories and lots of studio information.In conclusion, after hearing a number of these "SACD Deluxe Editions," I'll be keeping my old (1997) re-masters, after all, they still look and sound great. But now I have two versions of each album, great, just what I needed?!
Just so you know where I'm coming from, I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era. Also, some of the material I've heard from 1981-1999 is good (if formulaic), but I am less familiar with it. With that said, the Moodies hit their lowest point with "Every Good Boy Deserves Favour" and "Seventh Sojourn".  The only song on "Every Good Boy" that I enjoy is Justin Hayward's excellent rocker "The Story in Your Eyes".  I award two stars to this album just because it contains this song.  The other songs are either plodding and dull or sticky sweet, comparable only to the very worst of their prior material. If you are exploring the early Moodies' music, do yourself a "favour" and try any of their first five albums (see my other reviews for details).  You will find rock that really rocks, and beautiful music that is fresh and original.
The Eagles were itching to move on with their solo careers, and that is quite visible from this album.  It seems like a pile of songs just thrown together without too much thought.  There are some real disappointments on  this album such as 'These Shoes' (incredibly boring), and 'Greeks dont want  no freaks'.  'In the City' is okay but perhaps misplaced. The album's  highlights include 'I Can't Tell you Why' and 'King of Hollywood'.  Naturally it is hard to follow up a masterpiece such as 'Hotel California'.  The fact that I hardly play this album anymore proves that.
So Jackson, who was clearly listening to a lot of Bob Dylan records at the time, decided he wanted to be like a certain critically acclaimed, commercially successful living legend/cynical street poet with a really bad voice - only with a considerably better voice (technically speaking, anyway) and soft-rock instrumentation. Really, he only blew it on one count. Too bad that count was he didn't have the talent of Dylan's elbow. He tackles weighty topics - depression, suicide, drug addiction, apocalypse - but he doesn't say anything too revealing about any of them, and we wind up with several spare piano and acoustic guitar ballads that are lifeless and unoriginal, if earnest ("For Adam", "My Opening Farewell", "A Child in These Hills", et al). But he doe nail a couple of these: "Jamaica Say You Will" is a lovely ballad that's been covered by just about everybody; the piano-driven, pessimistic "Doctor My Eyes" is probably my favorite of Jackson's songs, and actually is pretty good as far as Dylan knock-offs go; and "Rock Me on the Water" is enjoyably apocalyptic. Now if the rest weren't so turgid, we'd have a classic on our hands.
I can't for the life of me, understand that there's only one sub four star review on this crappy album. "Desperado" is one of my favorite EAGLES songs, but one great song doesn't an album make. I sold this to a used cd store a couple of years ago, and I can't say I miss it that much. I have the song "Desperado" recorded on cassette, and I have the "Eagles Live" on cd, so no problem. This is definitely the handsdown worst studio release in the EAGLES discography. "On the border" is only slightly better than this one. "One of these nights" is their final one with Bernie Leadon and is their best effort, so stick with that one instead of "Desperado".
I am not a fan of the band, I have listen to this cd a couple of time and I am not very pleased with it.  There is just a couple of good tracks, not enough for me to keep this cd.  I will use it as a gift for somebody who will listen to it, because I won't if I keep it.
I remember when You Might Think, the first song off the Cars' new album made itself known - it was upbeat, but completely overshadowed by its groundbreaking video that set new standards.  The problem with that was, it was easy for the video to distract from the fact that the song was a bit fluffy, for a group that made its name by vowing "there's no mistaking rock and roll".  By now the Cars sound has lost just about everything that made it unique, and gone from having lots of odd sounding synths to having too many ordinary sounding ones.  It was the starkness of their songs that made a single lead stand out, as compared to layers upon layers of generic sweeping pads and little bell sounds.  It still has Rik Ocasek's odd voice, but instead of amusing, wry humor, the emphasis is  slickness and a certain smugness.  This album has a terrifically produced sound, it set new standards for musical precision, and there are some well written songs, like 'Hello Again' (which contains a lot of the old Cars humor and energy) and the title track.  Songs like 'Magic' and 'You Might Think' are instantly catchy, but don't really merit repeated listenings.  'Drive' is a nice ballad, it's nothing TOO amazing but it avoids a lot of the traps that made other ballads of the time (like Chicago/Peter Cetera's) so bad.  This isn't bad music by any means, like the Moody Blues' Other Side of Life, it is elegantly put together, but the soul's gone.  I guess the guys just got older and weren't as peppy and intense into the music anymore.  And one last thing, the album cover is pretty terrible.  What a confusing jumble of car parts and body parts (and interestingly, a two-star rating).  Their other covers you could UNDERSTAND what you were looking at.
Back in the day, this was very popular. Not many people are driving around with this in their cd player today. It sounds dated.However, "Cannonball" is a classic. This band just happened to stumble on a genuine, "Louie, Louie" type of song."No Aloha" is interesting (sounds very Pixie ish), "Divine Hammer" is decent and "Driving on 9" is a cool, trucker vibe of a song.The rest of this is pretty unlistenable.
i had a single from this album and a song called IN MY LIFE completely rocked my world...MY MISTAKE.  do not call this album techno.  call it top 40, or electronic but not techno and do not call it punk rock inflenced or even rock oriented.  there is little rock on this album.  this album is the predeccesor to play.  if thats your bag then by all means this is for you but it is a bland mix of top 40 wanna be music.i also bought animal rights by moby.  THAT is quite electic with a good mix of musical styles...yes i did like the soothing intro of hymn, the funky beat of lets go free (song is 37 seconds long) and the blues of what love but this is not a reason to keep this overrated mess.  although i do love the thought provoking essays in moby's cd's but otherwise this is not worth your time.
Nothing here can stand the test of time. IT's all about a bunch of hippie musicians doing crazy rock songs. At least Neil Young already shows his talents here. The rest is [...junk]
Peter Gabriel's first two solo albums are both a bit off, this one more so than the first one.The first thing that came to my mind when hearing this album was &#34;writer's block&#34; - most of these songs have very uninspired writing and Gabriel completely lacks direction. He tries his hand at country, progressive, punk rock, gospel but it never sounds convincing, rather stabbing at ideas.There are a few songs in the middle of the album that are rather good, such as the enjoyable &#34;Animal Magic&#34; and the heartfelt &#34;Indigo&#34; but even these are a shadow of what he was capable of.
I used to dig this Album More Back when it was out.But He Bites Too Much Here.Sussudio is a Rip Off Of Prince's 1999.Take Me Home is So-So.I Respect His Ability at Drum Beats&amp;Production.One More Night is the Best cut  here.but this Album Hasn't Aged well at all.
By the end of the 1980s, after four releases in a synth rock vein with instrumentals and vocals alike far removed from rock-out savagery, Rush's popularity was beginning to fade. The tour for 1988's album HOLD YOUR FIRE saw half-empty venues and cancelled dates, while guitarist Alex Lifeson was feeling increasingly pushed to the side by all the keyboards. The trio knew they needed to make a change and PRESTO, released in 1989, shows them embarking in a slightly different tradition. It's not a complete departure, as songs like "Red Tide" and "War Paint" and could easily have fit in on the previous two albums. But in the main we find a much dimished use of synthesizers, and in tracks like "Show Don't Tell" and "Available Light", Lifeson returns to the spotlight.But the album is ultimately overall disappointing. The most readily noticeable flaw is Rupert Hine's production. The drums have no punch, the sound is flat with little variation in dynamic, and there's an incongruous edit in the second track. The other problem is that, as one listens through the whole album, Neil Peart's lyrics are perhaps his weakest in the band's entire career. At best, they are forgettable, with myself and many fellow Rush fans unable to recall half of what Geddy sang. At at worst, they are risible. The "boys and girls together" bit on "War Paint" makes me cringe almost as much as the infamous "Net boy, net girl, / send your signal 'round the world. / Put your message in a modem / and through it in the cyber sea." lines of "Virtuality" on TEST FOR ECHO a few years later.I consider PRESTO the weakest Rush album released in the three decades since they moved to radio-friendly lengths. From talking to other Rush fans, I always thought this was the common opinion, and I'm baffled as to the high average review here. It's not a complete failure, as I occasionally listen to "Chain Lightning" and "Available Light", but this is one of the few Rush albums I'm reluctant to play through. Ironically, opinions aboutHold Your Fire, the album that drove so many people away in the late 1980s, seem to have improved over the last 20 years. On the other side of PRESTO, the following albumRoll the Bonesis also often seen as a solid effort.
Anyone who puts Presto among Rush's greatest albums is obviously not a Rush fan.  This CD just plain stinks.  Show don't tell is the only good song on the album.  I can't believe that this is the same band that made  Hemispheres, A Farewell to Kings, Signals, Permanent Waves, and 2112.  Avoid this and Roll the Bones like the plague, they are pure garbage.
&quot; Hold Your Fire&quot; culminated the 80's Rush, building on the innovations brought forth on &quot; Power Windows&quot;. I anxiously awaited this; the start of a new decade, with a new label and a different  producer from the last two records. What a dissappointment.
Rush's inevitable slide into mediocrity was evident from 1982 on. Unlike Hold Your Fire, ad Power Windows this album is not drawn out in synthesizers. Alex Lifeson's guitar is not buried deep in the mix like it had been for a while, but this album is not an improvement. Neil Peart's lyrics are repetitive, as well as Geddy Lee's vocals. Gone is the shrieking, and instead his voice is low (at least for his range) and it sounds generic. The songs on this album aren't that memorable, for pretty much, if you have heard one song you've heard the whole album. The musicianship of the band is still tight, and their skills are still virtuosic, especially on the complex time signature changes on &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; and &quot;Superconductor,&quot; but even that cannot save this album from blandness. Don't be fooled by the title; Presto is not a magical experience.
After the absolutely top-notch "No Jacket Required", it was inevitable that Phil Collins' follow-up would be a letdown.  And it's not that "...But Seriously" is a bad album, just BORING.  The word of the day here is "ballads".  Songs vary from moody ballads ("That's Just The Way It Is", "Another Day In Paradise"), standard fare heartfelt ballads ("Do You Remember?", "I Wish It Would Rain Down", "Father To Son"), slow groove ballads that transition to slightly-heavy ballads ("All Of My Life") and ambitious epic ballads ("Colours").  Elsewhere you find more upbeat, jazz-or-latin influenced numbers ("Heat On The Street", "Saturday Night And Sunday Morning", "Find A Way To My Heart").  All are BORING.A couple of the more rocking tunes, "Hang In Long Enough"and "Something Happened On The Way To Heaven" save this album from being a complete yawner, but both are cut from the same cloth as the far superior "Sussudio" from "No Jacket Required".  All of tunes here are admirable compositions and performances, and if you're a diehard PC fan, this'll scratch your itch.  If your tastes lean more toward his work with Genesis or rock music with a bit more of an edge, this album is just plain flat out BORING.
This album starts out fantastically -- "Dreamline" is easily one of the best songs the band has ever done, while "Bravado" and the title track maintain a high standard. But other than "Heresy" and the instrumental "Where's My Thing", the rest of the album is forgettable mainstream rock. Though fans of the 70s material may appreciate the (near) absence of synthesizers they might still find parts of this CD to be extremely boring. The completist will want to pick this up, but most of the good songs from this album are available on the live set Different Stages.[This review is based on the original 1991 release, not the 2004 remaster; the sound quality on the original is just fine.]
I love Rush, I really do, but even now, when I tried to give it a listen, it still sounds like the worst thing that Rush has done (beside Test for Echo) I am really surprised that Rush fans love this album. I just don't get any kinda of vibe from this album. Even though Dreamline and Ghost of a Chance are good songs, the rest seems like filler material. I give it two stars for those two good songs, but otherwise I really can't recommend this. If you want Rush from the 1990's, go with Counterparts. Its easily a 5 star effort and the best from that decade
I've bought this CD a long time ago and until now I can't feel it right. &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; is a beautiful song, but the others seem all alike  to me, over-produced, as if to hide the lack of inspiration of the  band for this CD.
This was recorded in Collins home studio and it has a desolate, lonely and claustrophobic feeling to it.  Some people call this powerful and art.  I call it 67 minutes of drum machine and droning.Released in 1993, this is his fifth studio solo album.  The sound quality is typical of an early 1990s CD, which is not that great and adds to over all desolate feel of the album.I am not a Collins hater, like some....Deke Leonard of the Welsh group Man once said about Quicksilver's John Chipolina &#34;why is it the good ones have to die.  Why couldn't it have been Phil Collins&#34;.I think Collins is a great drummer (listen to early Brand X).  So, I never understood how he got into this drum machine phase.  He did it somewhat with Genesis but really relied heavily on it for his solo albums.  I think it really distracting and takes away from the power of his songs.  Surely a drum set could fit in his home studio somewhere.I also think that the Collins lead Genesis was a better live band than the Gabriel led one.  With Gabriel, you had to be there to veiw the atmospheric stage show and costumes, but the songs were played too closely to the studio albums with no excitement.  A Collins led Genesis concert was fun, energetic and a different experience from listening to the album.  However.... the post Gabriel Genesis albums were not nearly as good as the earlier ones.
Ok, I fall in love with Phil's music 10-12 years ago and he is the pop-disco star from 80'es, but not the music star from 90'es. This album isn't terrible at all, but like someone said it's too private. It deserves max 2 and 1/2 stars. &quot;Everyday&quot; is great song, &quot;Both sides of story&quot; is ok, but after third song, album goes to nowhere. It is like you open big book and inside there isn't any word. Every song is too long (more than 6 minutes) and I really can't listen this album 'cause it become really painful after some time. The songs has some mood, that is true, but there isn't any catchy melody, only easy going to nowhere. This album isn't disaster but after his previous classic &quot;...but seriously&quot; this is big step down and this sounds like he is tired from life and everything. Too easy...only for big fans.
I heard mixed review about this album. Being european I hadn't exactly being thinking about Jewel or her music for that matterbecause the main buyers for this album were Americans. She though re-released this album back in 1997 when of course all the world bought it. I listened to the song Foolish Games and I thought Why not give it a try. This was it about 3 or 4 songs on here were actually good the rest is bla bla. I don't know but seeing this woman in interviews and live. It seems that she needs something really important to talk about. Well some of the lyrics are bit nice listening to. But this whole talk about her being this alternative sensation makes me wan't to scream. I mean this album hit top 5 and sold 11 milion copies in the USA alone and contained I believe 2 #1's . Although Alanis Morsette's Jagged Little Pill did that well too even better she wasn't just called a great alternative musician but a great mainstream too. I give it two stars for the singels and two other songs on the album.
Today there are lot of untalented artist that claim they arereally talented such as Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton and those kind og garbage. The one who started that was Jewel. This girl from Texas or whatever made this album which has probably one of the most non-exicting collection of songs ever put on an album before. Her voice is not very good and when she sings it's like she has a fever or something and has just thrown up. It's that bad. The music isn't very interesting. She is clearly copying Joni Mitchell ( who is another overrated singer, but has created some amazing songs). The lyrics are not good either and knowing that over 11 million people bought this album just shows how the music industry is becoming more like a circus.
I love Tori Amos work, but of all her albums, the only one I simply dislike is Boys for Pele.  It is way too long and only a few songs are worth the price.  These are: Horses, Blood Roses, Caught a Lite Sneeze, Talula, Doughtnot Hole, and Putting the Damage On.  The rest seem to go anywhere.  Good thing she improved in her subsequent albums.
During the last decade Tori Amos has builded an interesting if not fascinating music career . Being an artist who prefers to fully reveal her emotions through her songs , one can be sure she is capable for the best ... and the worst depending on her mood . &quot; Boys For Pele &quot; , her much anticipated following to 1994's &quot; Under The Pink &quot; has been deeply loved by thousands of fans since the day it was released . Even they though , can't help but admitting this is not everybody's thing .The album contains eighteen songs most of them thinly structured . It is not the liquid form of the melodies which is the problem as much as the frustrating character most of them have . &quot; Professional Widow &quot; becomes immediately intense and almost suffocating the minute the vocals walk in . &quot; Blood Roses &quot; is this middle-age...something with no aims or charm what so ever . Things are not getting much better on the more lo-fi tracks . The soft , tender story of suicide victim &quot; Marianne &quot; goes nowhere while &quot; The Doughnut Song &quot; feels long and tirering .Lyrics were always an element which made Amos stand out from other artists of her generation . On her debut &quot; Little Eartquackes &quot; on tracks like &quot; Leather &quot; , &quot; Silent All These Years &quot; and &quot; Precious Things &quot; she wrote some of her best ever , full of metaphors and witty hints . Then on &quot; From The Choirgirl Hotel &quot; , an album shortly released after a failed pregnacy she sounded so touching and vulnerable ( &quot; She's conviced she could hold back a glacier / but she couldn't keep baby alive ... &quot; she sang on &quot; Spark &quot; ) . On this album now , things just don't work that way . &quot; Muhammed My Friend &quot; could be taken as a base for a number of empty philosophical discussions among fans but if there's a piece of music messing with religion out there , this is surely not it . On &quot; Talula &quot; she sings &quot; Talula , Talula / you don't wanna lose her / wrapped in your papoose / your little Fig Newton &quot; . We are supposed to search for something meaningful behind her genious lyrical madness but it's all too confusing . The thing is that Amos doesn't need to get all extreme in order to write good lyrics . She has a rich , sensitive soul and some touching love poetic lines like the ones she wrote on the ultimately beautiful &quot; Your Cloud &quot; from her latest offering &quot; Scarlet's Walk &quot; ( &quot; Do you think just like that you can divide this ? / you as yours / me as mine / to before we were us &quot; ) will simply do .Amos was trying to overcome a rough break up at the time , something the press pointed out in every opportunity yet background information about a singer's life-phase should help complete the potrait of a music album and not trying to support it alone . Music shouldn't be like this , it should be able to  stand autonomus .It's hard to actually reach a single concusion about albums like &quot; Boys For Pele &quot; . This is a record which demands respect not so much for being deeply profound but for being as emotionally charged as it is . Amos has taken gentle music instruments like the pianno and the harpsichord and managed to create stiff , harsh melodies . Only on &quot; Caight A light Sneeze &quot; she delivers the masterpiece we all know she's so capable of : her perfomance is fierce , the bells and backing vocals are totally haunting . Elsewhere though , there's no balance in her songwriting and &quot; Boys For Pele &quot; ends up being more of a challenge for the listener than an actually enjoyable  music offering .
After their "synth era" of the mid-to-late 1980s, Rush turned back to their hard rock roots. COUNTERPARTS (1993) was their new triumph, but on 1996's TEST FOR ECHO the band went even further in reducing the role of keyboards and preferring cutting riffs to melody.Looking at the individual performances, TEST FOR ECHO shows three performers maintaining their immense talent. Drummer Neil Peart adopted two bass drums and an arsenal of new techniques for the album (which he explains on the VHS/DVD releaseA Work in Progress), with the title track and parts of "Carve Away the Stone" featuring especially strong work. Guitarist Alex Lifeson sounds thrilled to reclaim the territory once occupied by synths, flaunting this return to the spotlight in "Driven" and "Dog Years". Geddy Lee thankfully favours his bass more than his keyboards. In the instrumental "Limbo", we hear three musicians still on top of their game in their mid-40s.Unfortunately, the album is fatally disappointing from other angles. Neil Peart's songwriting here is grating instead of thought-provoking. In "Half the World", nearly every line begins with precisely those three words, and the effect swiftly becomes annoying. The Internet-themed song "Virtuality" is dated now, but was widely panned even when it appeared due to the risible chorus "Net boy, net girl, send your signal around the world. / Put your message in a modem, and throw it in the cyber sea." "Dog Years" similarly has a lame chorus. The other weak aspect of TEST FOR ECHO is the production, a "loudness war" casualty that packs everything into a miniscule dynamic range and doesn't allow the music to breathe. Strangely, however, "Limbo" sounds to me like it came from a completely different producer.All in all, I'd rate even Rush's controversial following album VAPOR TRAILS higher than this, since the strong songwriting there makes up for the digital distortion. Looking at the band's whole career, TEST FOR ECHO seems one of their very minor releases.
This is the sequel to Counterparts, with an even heavier sound. There aren't many memorable melodies and after a while the crushing guitar riffs get a little monotonous. There's still good stuff on here -- The frantic "Dog Years" may be the first (intentionally) funny Rush lyric, while other highlights are "Driven", "Carve Away the Stone", and "Resist". This is not one of the band's better albums, though fans of Counterparts may enjoy it.[This review is based on the 1996 original release, not the 2004 remaster.  I have no problems with sound quality on the original.]
2 1/2Not a huge Rush fan by any stretch, so I can't recall why this album was one of my choices to explore their more modern sound. The single title track was decent enough, but the album fails to create much traction with mediocre riffs and preachy lyrics making a persistent average quality even more self-consciously, over-the-hill-rock annoying. Good thing there are enough chops interspersed from preventing complete erosion of the senses.
Test For Echo sounds just plain and tired. It has moments that recall past glories,a cool riff or two,and possibly has some of Peart's best lyrics,despite what anyone says. Yet the tunes are not memorable at all. I rate it a hair above Roll The Bones and Presto(Counterparts was a brief comeback).The title cut is my favorite,which is typical of the formula of later Rush albums,best goes first then downhill from there.Also,Geddy's vocals,which showed some signs of life on Counterparts,have returned to the robotic,monotone delivery we older fans loathe.  A friend of mine who's lost more than a few brain cells due to substance abuse actually thinks these songs are 'classics'in the same league as 'Fly By Night' and 'Lakeside Park'. I think he's well,lost some brain cells.
A fan of Rush since 1989 and an owner of all their albums, it was quite disheartening hearing _Test For Echo_ upon its release in the fall of 1996. The basic Rush elements were there--power riffs from Alex Lifeson, intricate basslines from Geddy Lee, melodic, powerful drumming from Peart, but, something was lacking. What was ultimately lacking was the songs themselves. Even one of the better songs on the album, the title track, contains awkward lyrics and phrases (&quot;tough talking hood boys&quot;...er...ok....).There are plenty of powerful riffs on songs like &quot;Driven,&quot; &quot;Dog Years,&quot; and &quot;Virtuality,&quot; but the songs themselves come off pretty corny. Written during the wake of the internet, &quot;Virtuality&quot; is already painfully dated with a chorus that calls out to &quot;net boys&quot; and &quot;net girls.&quot; One can imagine what Neil Peart was thinking when he decided to tackle media overkill and the internet boom in the mid 90s, but perhaps more thought should've gone into whether or not these lyrics would hold up. They really don't.Elsewhere, some songs sound like Rush on autopilot, most notably on &quot;Half the World&quot; and &quot;The Color of Right,&quot; which features for the first time, in my opinion, an extremely bland guitar tone from Lifeson. If you're as big a Rush fan as me, you know how immediately recognizable Rush music is. When you're hearing a new Rush song and thinking, &quot;This sounds like it could be any band...,&quot; you know there's a problem. Also disappointing on this album is Geddy Lee's tame vocal deliveries. Considering he was coming off of some of his finest vocal performances (1993's _Counterparts_), it's surprising that he sounds pretty much restrained and unenthusiastic on many of the songs on _Test for Echo_. His layered vocals are also overdone and become more distracting than engagin.Are there good points to the album? Of course. &quot;Totem&quot; is irresitably catchy and should be brought to life on tours in the future. &quot;Resist&quot; is also evocative with typically beautiful optimism from Peart's lyrics. However, the bad unfortunately far outweighs the good. Luckily Rush would resurface with an incredibly powerful album, _Vapor Trails_, six years later. If you're looking for a taste of recent Rush, pick up that one instead of this. If you love all things Rush, then pick up _Test for Echo_, but just keep in mind--I love all things Rush too, excpet this album.
The followup to "Counterparts", released after Alex Lifeson's guitar workout, "Victor", "Test For Echo" is a continuation of the recession of synthesizers in Rush's sound and a contineud growth from the band.  This album, however, seems to miss the mark in many ways.It starts off great, two rocking songs, "Test For Echo" and "Driven".  "Test For Echo" has a great mysterious feel, a rocking chorus, and is just a blast, "Driven" is a workout, one of the best hard rock songs the band's done, a driving bass/guitar doubling and a brilliant chorus with subtle drumming.But unfortunately, thats about it for the record, it really kind of falls apart after this-- ther's some great moments, the bizarre rhythms and lyrics of "Time And Motion" and the mighty "Resist", another superb Rush song come to mind, but some of the material falls flat-- "Half the world" feels like "Nobody's Hero", but without the bite, and some of the lyrics ("Dog Years", "Virtuality") just don't make it.  Much of the other material seems fairly uninspired-- "The Color of Right", "Totem", "Limbo", etc., they'r all ok songs, but the performances seem to fall flat.  Actually, "The Color of Right" has great verses, but the chorus are just bizarrely awful, which is too bad, because the lyrics are really quite good.In the end, the album is vindicated by a few good tracks, but is overall a bit too uneven to be a fully enjoyable listen.
Since his solo career started in the 80's Phil Collins has been a mastermind of pop music from the second British Invasion. As his time came into the mid 90's, he had no place to go on the radio, and in the mainstream.His 1996 album, Dance Into The Light, is a bit more upbeat than Collins previous albums. Although the album is a complete turn from his 1993 album, Both Sides, the music proved to be a sorrowful project. The songs here are very much in-between, and only two songs stand out very well on the album, Dance Into The Light, and It's In Your Eyes. The music borrows the feel of African rhythms and effects, but is nowhere near Peter Gabriel's triumphs in African Beats. Surprisingly, the album was Phil's last studio albbum, before announcing his departure from Genesis that same year.Although Phil Collins created many hit songs, this album isn't as big of a keeper as his 80's albums, or his days with Genesis. Dance this one out of the light.
I don't agree with all these people who claim that "In rock" is a masterpiece. Of course it's an album that helped developing rock music, but that is more because of the sound, or approach itself, than the actual quality in the songs. "Speed king" and "Bloodsucker" are good songs and so is parts of (the much too long) "Child in time", where Ian Gillan show us all what a beautiful and powerful voice he have. I'd spend my money on "Machine head" and "Fireball" before even considering buying this one.Maybe 2 stars is a bit too little, and 2.5 stars would be more correct.
Don't get me wrong,this classic Alice Cooper album is worth 5 stars in my book,but this gold CD offers no improvement in sound quality over the unremastered one (which you can buy dirt-cheap ANYWHERE!).It's still sounds thin and muddy,nowhere near as good as theBillion Dollar Babiesand theWelcome to My Nightmareremastered reissues Rhino put out a few years back.Save your money and buy/keep the old one!
This is the first time I have not been satisfied with an Alice Cooper album!!!!!!! I love all era's from Alice, but this album I was expecting to all be as great as the title track, but sadly it almost felt like a couple of songs, and a few fillers! I don't see why all the fans are so into this album?I don't recommend this album for people wanting to start to get into the great Cooper legend.This has been the first album I have bought by Alice that I do not like!!!! This album doesn't rock like a few have said. The only song that seems to be worth a listen to apart from the title track is "Pubic Animal #9"If your looking for the track of "Schools Out" and haven't heard of any of these songs, I suggest you skip this album and go for one of the 10,000 greatest hits Alice has out; preferably "Definitive" or "Monsters and mascara". But as a big fan of Alice, I dont see the hype in this album? Apart from 2 tracks, its has bored me to sleep. Its no surprise to me now why I haven't seen any of the other tracks appear on greatest hits albums!Only the die hard Alice fans, or the fans of the original band will praise this album. But this is by far no where even close to anything spectacular from Alice!For a fan looking into new material, then it might be worth getting? or for the collection? but this is rare for me to say there's an Alice album I do not like!!!! I only give it 2 stars for 2 great songs. The others just seem like tired filler material to me. Tho, be the judge for yourself, different tastes apply to different people....you might like it? and it might just be me who doesn't?
"Who do we think we are" is in fact a rather uninspired album. Maybe the guys blow it all on the previous and excellent "Machine head" and simply ran out of ideas. The best songs on the album are "Mary Long" and "Woman from Tokyo", and they are indeed good. The rest is nothing to be excited about.
I'm assuming as it's not stated by Amazon anywhere on this page to date that this is the Japanese mlps version and if so, this review refers to that version.This album is one of the greatest debuts ever by a rock band and is essential listening for fans and aspirants of good rock guitaring.  Although all the tracks have been tuned down to E flat tuning for the guitar (so if you've been trying to play along with the cd and have been finding it hard to do so this is the reason) some of rock guitar's standards are on this album and especially so for "Eruption" which is a tour de force of guitar flash playing.  The extremely tasty guitar licks on all the other tracks are also worth the purchase price of this baby.The remastering though is the 2001 version and so if you already have the old cd of this version, I'm struggling to find any extra value that will justify the hefty price tag on this baby when you are essentially paying for cardboard that isn't one of the better mlps designs that I've seen out there anyway.  The cardboard is thin and flimsy and looks as if it will come apart once the glue gets old.  For examples of good mlps designs, check out The Band and Hall & Oates releases which are simply works of art on good quality thicker and stronger cardboard.This is essential listening although this mlps version does not represent good value for money and if you already have a 2001 remastered version in the jewel case, you are better off sticking to it as this is no real upgrade to me.
I liked this when it first came out b/c I was only 16. I was a rebel, wanted to be part of something different. This is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while.My favorite song here is "Mongoloid"...totally strange but rocking song. "Uncontrollable Urge" rocks (in a weird way) and Come Back Jonee is almost a conventional song. "Satisfaction" is a rather completely version but I cannot call it a good song.The group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a KISS like, multi-media, making money kind of thing.I saw them live (they were horrible) during their heyday. The most interesting thing about them is that while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream, DEVO is still as odd of a group as ever. Mark Motherbaugh does a lot of soundtrack work (Rugrats) and you can hear the aspects of DEVO in all of his work.Anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is. DEVO came out as a goof, not as serious musicians. They got big in the 70's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids (like me) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own.
First off, I'd recommend you listen to Dirty Mind right after listening to this one. Does the word "Quantum leap" come to mind? No? Because it SHOULD. At this point, Prince was on the verge of a dynasty of sorts - Dirty Mind, Controversy, 1999, Purple Rain, Arond the World in a Day, about half of Sign o' the Times. I say "On the verge of" because, frankly, Prince was pretty far from his peak here, no matter what the two amazing singles may suggest. First off is "I Wanna Be Your Lover", one of Prince's earliest classics. The keyboards! Listen to the keyboards! It's pretty much all Prince, and it's one of his best one-man jams. The song's pretty catchy, too, and tough not to dance to. "I Feel For You" is another good one - again, really catchy! - but I feel Rufus did a better version of it myself. Hey, whatever, I know a great song when I hear one and that's one. The third song I like is "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?", a scorching funk-rocker. The guitar parts on "Bambi" are cool too, but its lyrics are homophobic and I'm not down with that, as kids say today. Especially not coming from Prince, who at this point was pretty flamboyant about his sexuality (Princesexual - that is, anyone and anything's fair game) even though he regularly denied it. Sweet guitars, though.Now, let's talk downsides. I know "Sexy Dancer" is supposed to be a dance track, and I'm not supposed to care about the lyrics, but they're just dumb. They don't offend me - I've heard far worse, especially coming from Prince, who was always subtle as a jackhammer when it came to lyrics ("Soft and Wet", anybody?) And I'm sorry, but I don't think orgasms translate well into songs, though Prince obviously did because he simulated one on this track. Sorry, orgasm  fans. It's not very danceable either, so it can go into the trash bin. Furthermore, the ballads are dull, faceless, and interchangeable - "When We're Dancing Close and Slow"; "With You"; "Still Waiting"; "It's Gonna Be Lovely". Okay, so "When We're Dancing" is more obscene than "Darling Nikki" and probably would've made Tipper Gore's head explode. That's all that sets it apart. Obscene lyrics. And they aren't even funny, unlike the "Orgasmatron" lyric on "Private Joy", a track from the great, underrated Controversy.This is a pretty bad album with two pretty good singles that you can get on any Prince greatest hits, even though this is the only place you can find the full-length "I Wanna Be Your Lover" - far superior to the radio version. Oh well. Just get it from iTunes or Yahoo! Music or somewhere like that. Not from LimeWire though. I've got huge anti-LimeWire biases after my experiences with it. I tried to download ONE song, and my entire iTunes library got deleted. I didn't even get my download, either. I've hated LimeWire ever since. That and you're pretty much stealing from the artists with LimeWire. If you're gonna download, do it legally, unless you want to see musicians you like starve to death before they can make their next album. Honestly, they need all the money they can get. There. *Steps off soapbox*.
For anyone wondering why David Lee Roth was finally fired, this extremely weak 1982 release is all that needs to heard.Clocking in at a scant 31 minutes and featuring five covers, this is Van Halen as cash cow with minimal effort that Roth envisioned. And in this incredible era of mega-selling albums, mega-tours and mega-parties that seemingly would last forever, the record company would not balk as long as units could be shipped and sold.The band had been in the fast lane, touring virtually non-stop since 1977 and quickly progressing from clubs/small halls to become an arena/stadium monster that was propelling the music industry, while recording a wealth of new material. Roth wanted a party-hearty band while Eddie Van Halen had his focus on the craft of making music.This ship was starting to sink, but Eddie Van Halen was able to patch up the holes in the hull before the band became a parody of itself, with Roth as the drum major.
Clocking in at 31 minutes and containing maybe only 15 minutes of original material, this album seems more like a contractual obligation than a proper album that Van Halen would make, especially in their 80s heyday with Diamond Dave. Their covers of &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Streets&quot; are inspired, but hardly make the entire album worthy of purchase. &quot;Little Guitars&quot; is a great Van Halen song, but not considered a classic. If you are a true Van Halen nut, or a completist, by all means buy this one, but if you're casual, stick with its predecessor &quot;Fair Warning&quot; or its follow-up, the monumental &quot;1984&quot;.
This is only for die hard fans! With hindsight you might wonder if the band already had decided to break up. The songs are far from the high standard we got used to from albums like "Van Halen I" and Van Halen II", but they do a great version of The Kinks "Where have all the good times gone?". I guess Van Halen asked themselves that question, or at least should have.
This is the typical product Van Halen's critics feed upon. It is confusing, a few covers acting as fillers, it has only 30 minutes of music. Very, very weak. Only &quot;LITTLE GUITARS&quot; is a great tune. For a real and lucid VH fan, this is on the theirs leatest fine moments.
DIVER DOWN is Van Halen's most artistically bankrupt album.  Cited by both Van Halen brothers as their least favorite album, DIVER DOWN marks a vast departure from its predecessor, FAIR WARNING, returning the band to their party hearty image.  Roth was behind the drastic changes behind the record.  This album is not only Van Halen's weakest album, but overall one of the most puzzling records in all of rock.  DIVER DOWN is very reactionary.  The album points to Roth trying to reclaim the audience they lost with FAIR WARNING, as DIVER DOWN is the polar opposite of that album.  Like all Roth Van Halen albums, the album is very brief, being only 31 minutes long, which has always irritated me.The album sounds like it has a personality crisis.  David wanted to do a covers record to move product, while Eddie wanted to maintain some shreds of artistic credibility, and the quality album is a causality of this tension between the two dominant personalities of the band.  The sound and atmosphere is a total retreat from the darkness of FAIR WARNING, and the only reason for the retreat is Van Halen selling out.  This selling out indicates lack of integrity and total artistic bankruptcy.For fans of bands, I always recommend listening to the albums in chronological order.  It gives a sense of history.  When you get to DIVER DOWN, you realize that the band is simply running on empty, they're looking to reinvent themselves after the hideous darkness of FAIR WARNING, and they're simply running out of ideas.Let's look at a little history.  In 1982, when Van Halen released DIVER DOWN, they had just come off a major tour in support of FAIR WARNING.  FAIR WARNING met with a rather chilly reception.  That record was a very dark, mean spirited album, brimming with anger, immorality, and rough lifestyles.  By the time FAIR WARNING had come out, the band was known for their party, over the top lifestyle, and Eddie's guitar heroics.  While the guitar work certainly stayed amazing, FAIR WARNING simply did not sell well, and is still even to this day Van Halen's least commercially successful album due to its dark intensity.When the time came to record FAIR WARNING's followup, Roth wanted to change directions.  He and the record company began operating on the philosophy that if you start out with a hit song, you're half-way to a commercially successful recording.  While the rest of the band disagreed with this ideology, they acquiesced to Roth.Another issue contributing to DIVER DOWN's overall weakness is the band had been touring nonstop since 1977, and they were exhausted.  The band were going on vacation, but recorded a single which went became successful enough that Warner Brothers wanted an album to go with the single.Originally, the album's initial sessions  began when the band tried recording their next single.  They started out with Martha Reeves and The Vandellas hit song, "Dancing in the Streets."  Eddie expressed difficulty recording the song, as he simply could not get a real handle.  They then proceeded to record "Pretty Woman" at Eddie's suggestion.  The intro, "Intruder", which Dave claims to have written, was composed specifically to take up time on the controversial video that MTV banned, as the song was about two minutes too short for the film they shot on the video.  Rather than edit down the film further, they just wrote an extended intro.Taking the hit song philosophy to its utmost, Van Halen recorded no less than five cover songs, almost half the album.  Of these five songs, one is a Kinks song (the band was hoping to replicate the success of the "You Really Got Me" cover on their first album), the second is "Pretty Woman," the third is the totally incompatible "Dancing in the Streets", the absolutely bizaare "Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)", and the fifth is the joke recording "Happy Trails."  While the Kinks cover doesn't sound that out of place on a Van Halen album, both "Pretty Woman" and "Dancing in the Street" are obviously signs of a band selling out and just looking for a hit.  Eddie has cited the "Dancing" cover as the worst Van Halen commercial recording, and for good reason.  It's a good song, but totally out of sync with Van Halen's overall image and sound.  "Happy Trails" sounds little more than a drunken joke recorded to allievate otherwise boring and monotonous sessions.  "Big Bad Bill" has a nice vaudeville feeling to it, but again, this is Van Halen.  You don't listen to Van Halen for vaudeville, and is probably the most ridiculous thing they ever recorded.  The song is notable for featuring Jan Van Halen (the brothers' father) playing clarinet.With the five covers discussed, that leaves only seven original tracks.  Three of those are short instrumental tracks.  "Cathedral" is one of Eddie's most enthralling guitar instrumentals, primarily because when you listen to it you think it's an organ and you wonder how did he get that music on a guitar.  "Intruder" is filler written because the video ran longer than the song, although by segue-waying right into "Pretty Woman" it does give "Pretty Woman" a rather ominous tone not present in the original song.  "Little Guitar" is a totally unnecessary intro.  If they wanted to make it include it as part of the main body of the "Little Guitar" song , there was no reason to make it a separate track.With the covers and the instrumentals dispensed with, that leaves a paltry four major Van Halen originals.  "Hang `Em High" is a decent enough track.  "Secrets" never did anything for me.  "Little Guitars" has a strange Mexican flavour too it, and while nothing particularly wrong with it, there's nothing real memorable about it either.  The song was improvised and recorded live.That leaves only one song left.  "The Full Bug."  This track has sizzling guitar work, great vocals, and just a fantastic song to rock out too.  This is the only time on the entire album where the entire band just clicks.  This is vintage Van Halen right here, and easily on level with anything on the first four albums and 1984.  Unfortunately, one song cannot carry an album.  (Take note, American Idol winners).Eddie Van Halen despises this album.  As Eddie says, he'd rather have a flop with his own songs (which he did flop, and flop hard, with VAN HALEN III) than have hits with other peoples' songs.  And he's right.DIVER DOWN has too much filler, has too many covers, doesn't have enough originals, and of the originals, only one really rises to former Van Halen standards.  It has a very cold, calculating feel to it, like the record execs and the band were more interested in restoring the band to their commercial zenith and forget anything about making good music.Overall, DIVER DOWN solidified Eddie's opposition to recording music solely to sell.  After DIVER DOWN, Eddie formed his own studio where he would have complete artistic control over Van Halen's music.  Likewise, Van Halen never recorded covers again (the sole exception being OU812's closing song "Apolitical Blues.")Ultimately, DIVER DOWN is Van Halen's most dispensable album.  While I've been pretty damning about the whole album, I will say it's a very, easy listen, and is very uncharactestic of the band.  But while it's light and fun, it's also fluff.  Nothing really to return to once the album finishes, and it's only a mere 31 minutes long.  It's like cotton candy.  No real substance.
This is the one Van Halen album that never should have been made. The fact that half of its songs are covers is bad enough, but most of the covers are poorly chosen, and of the originals, all but one or two are total crap. Avoid this album; in fact don't even ask for it for Christmas or Chanukah. I'm not.
Doing far more damage than their mega-selling debut, "1984" helped launch the mainstream explosion of the West Coast hair metal assault by proving that smooth pop hooks and synthesizers could be applied for plenty of crossover appeal without losing the so-called "edge" (though most of these bands were about as sharp as a dulled butter knife). By giving license to this sort of exercise in neon-washed mummer acting, this album can take a greater share of the blame than nearly any other.There's no denying the guilty pleasure appeal of a hit like "Panama," but "Hot For Teacher" is medicore even for a dunderheaded slab of energetic sleaze rock and "Jump" is sabotaged by their new found adoration for the synthesizer (the energetic performance is in stark contrast to the mechanical musical makeup). "I'll Wait" falls somewhere in between, sounding like a cross between "Jump" and their 1991 megahit, "Right Now." The filler between the radio wonders, though, are pretty tame. "Top Jimmy" has a pretty bad vocal performance (and a rather dull punk-ish melody), "Drop Dead Legs" drags where it tries to strut, and the mediocre leftover from their early days, "House of Pain," simply stumbles. Only "Girl Gone Bad" is worth hearing, but by then, you'll probably be too sick of this album to care anymore.Best cuts: "Panama," "Girl Gone Bad," "I'll Wait"
Alright man! This is the coolest Van Halen album, David Lee Roth has sex with more women on this album than any other album, from his teacher at school to some girl in the street with 'Drop Dead Legs', so many groupies and he had sex in Panama City as well! Way to go David, it's his biggest score card yet! And yet....And anyway, this album sold lots of units, so if there was any fault in this album, well, who cares, right? I mean every critic from here to Saudi Arabia gives it 5 stars and says it's a masterpiece (well, not in Saudi Arabia, where it's banned... oh wait, it's not banned, they don't understand the sexed lyrics) and if you gave it a two-star review on Amazon.com..... well, I'm sure there would be some interesting comments to read about your review, but... Formulas are formulas, and this album is like a couple of masterpieces followed by a few formulas, and the formulas defintiely ouweigh the masterpieces....That formula, by the way, is sex sex and more sex. David Lee Roth had became a parody of himself. When on 'Women and Children First' he dubbed the teachers at school 'Fools' and was able to pull out sarcasm like 'the circus is back in town', well now he's 'hot' for the same teachers. He was no longer a rebel having fun, he was a man living up to an image, an expectation. Well, hey, 'Jump' was a fine pop song, an excellent one at that. It was synthesisers and David showing his soft side... but it was an excellent song, and then 'Panama' was a powerful rocker, with anthemic chorus and when he talks about 'can you feel the heat', well, you really could. Then comes the humourous 'Top Jimmy', which has charm. And then... Well there's a song called 'Drop Dead Legs', which is kind of predictable, a fairly joyless hard-rock number. And then there are cliche'd songs like 'Hot for Teacher' and then songs like the keyboard heavy 'I'll wait' and the dispirited 'House of pain' lacks the exuberance of earlier Van Halen material.Ultimate you are left with an album that begins terribly well, but ultimately goes stale with the same formula, and lacks a lot of the fun of their earlier albums. It's not quite a pass; Rating **
This CD is boring- somewhat original but boring. The only good song on it is "Glamorous Life" and I downloaded that. Skip this unless you're over the age of 40. Definetly skip Trina's "The Glamorest Life" which is 100% trash.
after coming off there Best Album with "What time is it" they release this very Average set."Jungle Love" was catchy&got alot of Love for a good minute as did "The Bird".I Liked "My Drawers" but overall this Album felt Campy&kinda Cold without any kind of knockout Punch.while there Performances in "Purple Rain" were tight it didn't translate to the Album though for me.while they got More Cross-over with this Album it also became there Watered Down Period.I always say that if Prince didn't have His Purple Claws all over this Band who knows How far&big they might have gotten?
The 1980's were a bad decade for music, and this album is a good example of why. I hope you like overly long, overly synth driven tunes that run out of inspiration shortly after they begin, because that's pretty much all you get. In fact, I can only think of two tunes worth salvaging here; Money for Nothing and the Man's Too Strong, which even then don't touch average works by great bands (the Beatles, the Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin, etc).A fine example of everything bad about this release is Why Worry, eight-plus minutes of boring...for one, you can barely hear it, but when you can it's fairly uninspired. The same can be said for the title track and especially the opener, So Far Away, which repeats the same line (not to mention measure) for about two minutes in the end, and the title track. I'd avoid it, but that's just me.
I like Dire Straits with their more laid back approach due to the singing and playing by Mark Knopfler, but listening to "Brothers in arms" is in the long run a rather boring experience. This album was in a way Dire Straits big breakthrough and includes the excellent "Money for nothing", and the catchy and happy "Walk of life". But the rest hasn't the quality I'm used to when it comes to Dire Straits.Skip this one, and go for their debut "Dire Straits" (1978) and the even better "Making movies" (1980)  instead.
A-HA was a one-hit wonder, at least in the USA, where only &quot;TAKE ON ME&quot; received an absurd amount of MTV and radio display, to the point of becoming unbearable to ever listen again!!In Europe, mainly int he U.K, thing were a little different, A-Ha being able to resist for more than five studio albums. BUt that was never a band to be taken seriusly. Other than the very good vocals, the ultra-pop-synth music is lifeless, industrial and toally electronic. That's why they succumbed.
Now, when Prince is on top of his game, he's one of the most talented musicians in the history of Earth, putting out classic albums and songs effortlessly. Seriously, when this guy was at his prime, his album tracks were BETTER than most the hit singles of the era, which admittedly isn't very impressive. I mean, when you've got something as good as "The Beautiful Ones" in your backlog, you're probably really, really talented. And Prince, as a singer, songwriter, musician, and innovator, is really talented.With all that said, Diamonds and Pearls generally reeks of insipidness. I don't know why - I'm not here to say Prince lost it after Sign o' the Times, because my favorite Prince album is Emancipation. But it's not really worth listening to, outside of three of the four hit singles: ballads like the lovely title track ("I'll give you DIAMONDS AND PEARLS!"), the slightly hokey but melodic as all get-out "Money Don't Matter 2Nite", and the dirty as dirty can be funk-rap crossover "Gett Off" (I'm sure he wrote several of those lyrics from personal experience) - it's really the catchiest I've ever heard the lyric "Twenty-three positions in a one-night stand!" The fourth, "Cream", is one of Prince's least creative moments, just dull funk. And most the rest fits in with that mold, other than on the decent ballad "Insatiatable", which even then isn't one of his best moments as a lyricist - not everyone's interested in your budding career directing "home videos"! As for the rest - either trite steamy bedroom lyrics about doin' the big nasty or points about spirituality ("Thunder", which has none of the resonance of early spiritual gems like "Purple Rain") or individuality ("Walk Don't Walk", ironically not very original); and one random folk-pop song that has no reason for even existing ("Strollin'"). And a LOT of jarring, abraisive raps that might as well be Prince shooting his fanbase collectively in the head ("Jughead"; "Daddy Pop"). And one big long waste of seven minutes that would've been better off silent ("Live 4 Love"). And one big, long, rambling, convoluted review of the whole mess, for those inclined to care. I'll end the madness right now and tell you this isn't one of Prince's better albums.
2 1/2If not for the title track plus a few embellishments, this would easily be dismissed as one of the artist's outdated nineties productions slathered in a corny hip hop influence.
Best track: &quot;Gett Off&quot;  There are two or three other okay songs here (like &quot;Cream&quot;, &quot;Daddy Pop&quot;, &quot;Money dont  matter tonight&quot;).  I used to really hate this album back when it came  out, but have grown to tolerate it in the wake of Prince's artistic demise.  It's far better than much of the antiseptic, boring material he churns out  these days.
Prince seems to have decided to move up the ladder of Maslow's hierachy of needs pyramid to tackle issues other than just the primal baser instincts and as a result shows himself an artist to be taken seriously.  Although some siliness is still evident on tracks like "Housequake" and "If I Was Your Girlfriend" other tracks like the title track, "U Got the Look" and "The Cross" show an artist with depth to go along with his undoubted musical and compositional talent.  The tracks do not flow as well as say on "Purple Rain" but like another very good double album the Beatles' "White Album" the disjointedness seems to work in an ironic and unexpected way and similar to other classic albums, you feel you can only truly appreciate the album if you sit through and listen to all the tracks at one go.  I get the feeling that I'm listening to one entire track and not the 16 individual tracks that make up this album.Too bad this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version couldn't equal the content in terms of quality though as the SHM-CD treatment of using a allegedly better reflective plastic material does little to improve the sound quality over previous releases. The mlps design too is a disappointment coming in thin, poor quality cardboard that is flimsily assembled looking like it will come apart easily once the glue gets old. There is a small heart-shaped sticker included though which is nice, 2 inner sleeves that replicate the original vinyl release and a 28-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.No noticeable improvement in sound quality and a mediocre mlps design and assembly makes this certainly not good value for money and hence not recommended.
Though there are some great songs here, this album finds Paul Simon beginning to run out of creative energy.  It's all getting to sound by-the-book and it doesn't always sound like he's happy to be making music.  There are two great songs - 50 Ways and My Little Town; and the title track, while subdued and downcast feeling, has a spooky, dreamy atmosphere and heartfelt vocal.  Have A Good Time *might* sound better if he had someone else sing it, i.e. a female.  To hear him wail away in a whiny falsetto for the WHOLE SONG is only slightly less grating than Prince's 'Kiss'.  No wonder Art Garfunkel did all the falsetto stuff on the S&G albums.  The rest of it is not bad, but suffers from blandness.  No real catchy hooks or anything to make you remember the music.  As far as the musicianship goes, it's top-notch throughout the album.
Prince had recorded two albums at the time of the release of Love Sexy.  One was by the good Prince (Love Sexy) and the other by the bad Prince (The Black Album).  The story goes that the good Prince won out and Prince released Love Sexy.  The album is full of positive notions about love and God.  The problem is that the unreleased Black Album(it was released in a limited edition several years later) was far superior to Love Sexy.  &quot;Alphabet St.&quot; has a nice funky groove with a guitar riff reminiscent of &quot;Kiss&quot; and is a good song, but the album doesn't offer much else.  One would be better served to find a copy of the Black Album as that contains some of the darkest, deepest, funkiest grooves Prince has ever committed to tape.  Love Sexy just doesn't match up the high standards that he had set with his previous 80's releases.
If all you want is a collection of Fleetwood Mac's hits this one's fine. All the hits are here (from 1975-1988) and if that's all you expect from a greatest hits collection, you won't be disappointed. But even a casual fan of the band (like me) found this to be a little less than I expected. The liner notes are the pits; a behind the scenes look at a 1988 concert (w/o Buckingham) with no insight into the songs in the collection. There aren't even songwriter credits (although there are production credits)! I'm not reviewing the songs here, but the packaging. I feel a band that is this talented and popular deserves a better package for their best material.
The Title Cut is one of her Best Songs ever.Like in Her top 3 songs Shes ever done.but the Album is Hit&amp;Miss.Express Yourself i sone of The Most Over-Rated songs Ever.Love Song With Prince does Nothing for Neither of  them.Keep it together is alright.The Title Cut though alone is a 4 1/2  alone.the rest of the Album is a One.She maintains her Trademark Sound but  The Album Never Rises Again to the CHallenge of The Title Cut.
I'm not a really a big fan of this album. Well, it just plain sucks. It's really bad 80's pop and it sounds outdated. And I love 80's music! I mean her other 80's stuff is a lot better then this crap. I was expecting her duet with Prince to be off the chain(boy was i wrong). It would be great to see them do an uptempo song together. Other then that Express yourself(well the album version is really crappy compared to the version i heard on the radio as a kid). Like a Prayer is ok, the video and concept are great. But the song overall pretty much gets overplayed way too much, even today. (its like mj with thriller,it gets old quick!)It's really not that great of a song. The only one that I really like is act of contrition. It's got sort of a rhythm nation feel to it. It's very good and creative. Other then that I would not waste two cents on this CD.
Blood Sugar Sex Magik was the album with which Red Hot Chili Peppers broke through to a less limited music scene. By many, it is still considered the band's best album, so I looked forward to enjoying as many as 17 great RHCP songs.But no! Apart from the hits Under The Bridge (still a superb song!), Give It Away, I Could Have Lied and Breaking The Girl, plus the last minutes of Sir Psycho Sex, this album has not much to offer. The other 13 songs all sound like (unworthwile) imitations of Give It Away.This funk-rap-rock dominates the album - so if you are not into that style, buying Blood Sugar Sex Magik will be a waste of money. I recommend Californication, even though it is more commercial, instead.
One thing I didn't like about this album that I tried in vain to savor is the rhythms. Another thing is how prestigious it is; I don't like the idea of these things being well-known, but in an effort to enjoy an album, I overlook that and listen to it anyway, sometimes.I'd say that most of this album is pretty relaxed.Lyrical-infused Moods:-Imaginary-Profane-Fascinated-Reminiscent-Inevitably Pressuring-Self-centeredI just didn't like the style of this album generally. Few songs that were creative. Most of the songs don't sound that distinguishing. This is a rotten masterpiece.
I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before "Under The Bridge" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.For every song worth listening to ("Suck My Kiss", "Give It Away"), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded.  This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief.  Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny.  They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done.  People were walking out in droves.
not my favourite bands...under the bridge has great lyrics! the vocals are terrible! the melodies are too much rap!
this isn't so good i recommedn you to get real thing! there's great lyrics but the melodies are boring!
For the most part, Prince would have one of the most successful decades of any artists.  Despite a couple of low points (the commercial failure of the movie "Under the Cherry Moon" and poor sales of the "Lovesexy" album), Prince would achieve a great amount of commercial success and even more critical acclaim.  At the center of this success was "Purple Rain".  Prince's "Purple Rain" was a surprise success at the box office and prove to also garner critical acclaim.  At the same time, the soundtrack of the "Purple Rain" album would prove to be one of the true landmark albums of all time.  With a successful decade under his belt and plans for the sequel to "Purple Rain", there was much anticipation for both the movie and the associated soundtrack.  These hopes would be completely dashed when 1990's "Graffiti Bridge" was released.  "Graffiti Bridge" would serve as the sequel to the movie and become a complete disaster from both a commercial and critical standpoint.  While something similar happened with "Under the Cherry Moon", the "Parade" soundtrack to that album would still prove to be successful.  Such was not the case with the "Graffiti Bridge" soundtrack.  In a nutshell, except for a few good points, this album was also a complete train-wreck.Much of Prince's 1980s's success proved around the "The Minneapolis Sound".  "The Minneapolis Sound" contained a mixture of Funk, Pop, R&B;, and Rock.  Prince was largely responsible for being a contributing architect to this sound movement. Following the success of "Purple Rain", the follow-up albums would go in different directions. Subsequent albums would introduce psychedelic elements ("Around the World in a Day"), a European influence ("Parade"), and even some Hip-Hop ("Sign O' The Times").  For the most part, "Graffiti Bridge" returns to the classic "Minneapolis Sound".  There is a "gospel" element toward the end of "Graffiti Bridge" and I also think Prince pushes the Hip Hop element some more.  However, just because he maintains and expands the "Minneapolis Sound" doesn't mean it's very good.  For the most part, the album disappoints overall.One big difference from this album compared to "Purple Rain" is that "Graffiti Bridge" is a true soundtrack.  "Purple Rain" only contained Prince's contributions to the film (and didn't contain music from The Time or Apollonia).  On "Graffiti Bridge", there are non-Prince songs included - such as the music of the Time, Mavis Staples, Tevin Campbell (his first break through album), and George Clinton.There are four tracks that I would term "stand out" tracks":1."Can't Stop This Feeling That I Got":  On "Purple Rain", it was "Let's Go Crazy" that set the intensity and tempo of the album as the first track.  I thought this song would do the same thing and I would prove to be wrong.  I thought some of the Hip-Hop elements at the beginning worked, but overall this song was classic "Minneapolis Sound".  I was surprised this was never even released as a single.2."We Can Funk": Historically when Prince sings in a duet, he proves to be at his best.  This particular song with Funk legend George Clinton is no exception.  This might be the album's strongest contribution.  Obviously from the title, this song is - Funk (well "Minneapolis Sound" style of course).  The last minute of the song is unbelievable and great work by Prince and Clinton.3."Thieves in the Temple":  This song was the first single released.  This song has some of the Rock elements that remind you of the "Purple Rain" days.  Since this was released before the film, many thought this would be indicative of a true sequel to "Purple Rain" - but not the case. Still a very good song.4."Graffiti Bridge": Much like the title-track of "Purple Rain" provided the emotional climax for the film and soundtrack, so does this particular title track.  It is truly worthy of being the title track.  This song brings a gospel element to the music, as well as an orchestral sound  Mavis Staples and Tevin Campbell share lead vocals with Prince as he proves he is at his best when sharing vocals with others. Again great stuff.Honorable mentions go to the tracks "Joy in Repetition", "Shake!" (one of the Time's four tracks), and "Still Would Stand All Time".  These songs are good, but don't hold up against the four tracks above.  As for the rest of the tracks, there really isn't much to say.  In other words, I mention seven tracks above, yet there are still 10 other tracks that I really don't have much to say about.With the exception of "Shake!" (good bass line), there is not much else to say about the Time's contributions.  There is a long awaited duet with Prince on "The Latest Fashion" and while some "Minneapolis Sound" fans embraced this particular track, I found it to be very extremely disappointing.  Tevin Campbell got some praise for his track "Round and Round", but again it didn't have me doing handstands.  I would also say the same for Mavis Staples' other track, "Melody Cool".  Overall, I think the theme as "not much to the other songs" is prevalent throughout the remainder of this album.Once last point worth mentioning is the "New Power Generation" and "New Power Generation (Pt II)" songs would eventually become the name for Prince's new backing band with that name - soon to be seen on subsequent albums.The liner notes did not contain the lyrics to these songs.  Overall, with the exception of the four very good tracks and honorable mention tracks, this album has to represent Prince's low point of the career.  Perhaps it is that this album has less of the Rock elements of "Purple Rain" on why this album disappoints.  This would probably be the impetus for why Prince would assemble the New Power Generation band and go back to the drawing board in the 1990s.  Overall, I'd recommend the tracks I mention, but not the album as a whole.
Disappointing soundtrack to an ill-conceived Prince movie - as though the world needed a sequel to "Purple Rain." Even guest artists such as George Clinton, Mavis Staples and The Time cannot save "Graffiti Bridge" (1990) from utter derivativeness. Only "Thieves in the Temple," "The Question of U" and Tevin Campbell's "Round and Round" are worthy of your time. A definite low point in the Prince discography.
Wow. This album displeased me. Usually, I would have an album's taste last for a week, but I couldn't give this one a try. This album was ridiculous, mostly. There are a couple of songs that have decent beats, but I'm a lyricist, and lyric-wise, I need to rebuke this Erotica album. I expected it to be pretty good. One song had good lyrics: "Why's It So Hard." That's worth listening to because of its strong reasonableness and persuasive questioning about this phenomena we live in. "Bye Bye Baby" is for people who are breaking up, and who wants to go out with that heartache, especially if you're not under that condition of considering related departure from somebody? "Deeper and Deeper" had a good beat, but I need an album to stand out, and this one fleeted my attention despite what the majority rates it on Amazon. Don't buy Madonna's "Erotica."
I think I'm listening to a different album than the rest of the reviewers."Erotica" is Madonna's first, flat-out failure as a musical artist.Something was changing when she added "Justify My Love" to her greatest hits album. OK...it had a killer, sinuous beat, and she moaned over it, more speaking than singing, and it had that video.She dips into that well too many times here, without any of the sexy kick. She's visibly trying to be provocative and it doesn't come off that way.'"Erotica" (the song) is a boring club jam with no melody: it's not a song, it's a groove. It's background. It's wallpaper."Fever" is another of Madonna's homages to old songs, and it's simply an average cover version. Better than karaoke, wouldn't fly on American Idol."Bye Bye Baby" starts off awesome...great, high-register, whispery vocals with an irresistible melody...but comes crashing down with an awful chorus and a production that just buries her voice (a common problem on this album)."Deeper and Deeper" is the one song for the compilation CD. Madonna pops out another one of her classic club anthems that would also sound fine on a car radio. Her voice is in fine form; she's much better at singing those lower notes than she was back on "Like A Prayer." This one's a keeper."Where Life Begins", like so much of the rest of the album, is boring to the point of being unable to recall a note by the time the next song is through, like "Waiting", "Secret Garden", "Words" or "Why's It So Hard"."Bad Girl" is a standard ballad, and done well, but the lyrics fail her. "Bad girl/drunk by six. Kissing some kind stranger's lips"...hello? That's an average college co-ed at a Friday night frat party. What's the big deal?"Thief of Hearts" makes you think Stacey Q did this stuff better.And that's a big problem, this set of overlong songs, for the most part, have been done better by lots of other people, including Madonna herself."Rain" is a much better ballad, and probably the other selection for your iPod."In This Life", a catastrophically boring song, is significant (for me) only because the melody is borrowed from a Gershwin piano piece, "Prelude #2."I'm not a classical music lover by ANY stretch of imagination; the song was one of my recital pieces when I took piano lessons back in junior high."Did You Do It?" is just awful, a pointless rap with minimal Madonna in it. Why is it even here?Up to this point in her career, this is her worst album. By far.
Erotica should be an album thriving with songs in the order of 'Vogue' 'Deeper & deeper' and 'Express yourself', in short; The Vogue (house) album. Instead we're thrown, the unexciting and unimaginative Erotica. Not only is the album of demo-like quality but, most of it's craft (or lack there of) has little substance to it. For instance, the 'did I do it?' track, a complete rap song by some unknown male rapper and Madonna utters not one single word, this song also shares the exact same music as 'the waiting', another bland track. the subpar mastering  and stripped sound comes off more underdeveloped and low budget than an actual audio effect; a result, much of the songs become disposable and/or unlistenable. Although this album is her most controversial record content wise, it's also the least remembered of the bunch. Most people don't recall an album from her at this point in time. There's no memorable hits that anyone can reference other than diehard fans. The album got most of it's promo through tours and not radio. It feels as if Madonna needed more time to get inspired before this production took place.
Despite some interesting songs like &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; or &quot;Secret&quot;, this Madonna album is nothing to write home about. Presenting a mix of R&amp;B/pop/soul, this effort fails to seduce and intrigue, being a listenable enough yet ultimately blah record at best. It`s more tolerable than &quot;Erotica&quot;, though, but far worse than the subsequent and more innovative &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;American Life&quot;. An average record from an uneven artist.Mostly filler material.
I &quot;LOVE&quot; all of Ms. Madonnas albums to the extreme with the exception of this one and Erotica. Although she sings great as she has always, the songs here leave something to be desired. With the exception of  &quot;Take A Bow&quot;, I don't listen to any of the other songs on this  album. I'm glad she's back with &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, Her best studio  album since &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;. Go get one of those if you want some  good Madonna music. Skip this one and Erotica.
As an album, Bedtime Stories is insipid, uninspired, boring and a tedious aural exercise. I know the intention is to do some ballads, but Madge seems to drag her feet vocally and comes across as lackadaisical.Some tracks are pretty tuneless, think Love Tried To Welcome Me and Sanctuary. The album could do with some rigorous editing to whittle down the set to the really catchy ones. And release this as an EP.Two stars for the hits - Secret and Take A Bow. The latter produced by Whats-His-Face.If you do not own this, you may just want to get Celebration which contains these songs.Looking at the brighter side, Bedtime Stories is a great cure for insomnia!
A very mellow and laidback Madonna album. With mainly midtempo and fluffy love songs that have the ability put one right to sleep, hence the title; Bedtime Stories. None of the singles from this album represent it's true sound. The songs don't match, flow or align with one another; the entire production is inconsistent, not to mention the poor sequencing.An rnb song with mild hiphop flavor and unapologetic lyrics open's the album 'i'll never be an Angel, I'll never be a Saint, Im too busy surviving'. A song anyone expects to hear after a smash like 'Human Nature'. Then sadly we run into endless, lengthy, basic and/or dull winded-down songs about love. This is where I become agitated and resentful by what's clouding my speakers. The ultimate fail of the album would be 'Don't Stop'; a cutesy and basic pop tune that does nothing for anything else present on the album. It's basic, simple, amateur and bubblegum considering where her career was at this time; karaoke at it's best.Then there are songs like 'Inside of Me' 'I'd Rather be your Lover' and several others that overlap in sound; fragile and mushy songs about love, and suddenly you're smacked in the face with the cutting-edge kickdrum of 'Human Nature', an inyourface track that glamorizes the "b" word, it doesn't add up. The bigger question is: How does such a song come about in a recording session drenched in love ballads? Why would you even want these songs to co-exist together on one album? It's not making sense; which could be why this record highlighted no tours.'Inside of Me' and 'Take a Bow' would hit the mark as first singles .'Secret' is another out of place track omn the album. 'Survival' and singles like 'Secret' and 'Human Nature' are misleading and strange compared to the dominating sound of all the others. I expected Erotica with a groovier, modern hiphop/rnb twist and her usual pop elements, certainly not this...
As one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time, anthologizing Van Halen is a tough task. This is proven by 1996's "The Best Of Van Halen, Volume 1", a measly 17 track, single disc collection that leaves much more than it includes.It's not that the music is bad. Almost all of the first 14 tracks are essential for any Van Halen fans. As a matter of fact, no hard rock fan can be without "Eruption", "Runnin' With The Devil", "Ain't Talkin' Bout Love", "Dance The Night Away", "Jump", "Panama", "Why Can't This Be Love", "When It's Love" or "Right Now". I also liked that the producers chose to include underrated tracks like "Dreams" and "And The Cradle Will Rock". The fact is, there isn't enough. There are so many classic songs left out, both from the David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar era. Here is a partial list.Hits/Chart Singles:-"You Really Got Me" (number 36)-"Beautiful Girls" (number 84)-"(Oh) Pretty Woman" (number 12)-"Dancing In The Street" (number 38)-"I'll Wait" (number 13)-"Hot For Teacher" (number 56)-"Love Walks In" (number 22)-"Black And Blue" (number 34)-"Finish What Ya Started" (number 13)-"Feels So Good" (number 35)-"Top Of The World" (number 27)-"Not Enough" (number 97)Notable Album Tracks:-"Everybody Wants Some"-"Best Of Both Worlds"-"Runaround'-"Jamie's Cryin'"-"Little Guitars"-"Summer Nights"-"Mean Streets"-"Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)"-"Ice Cream Man"-"So This Is Love"The new songs do absolutely nothing to help. In fact, they are terrible. "Human Beings", the last thing they recorded with Sammy Hagar until their 2004 reunion (more on that later) is loud and messy. Sammy obviously left the group on a low note. 1996 was when the group did a one time reunion with David Lee Roth. But what could've been a special moment in rock history turns out to be forgettable, as neither "Can't Get This Stuff No More" or "Me Wise Magic" are any good. If I had my way, I would have dumped these three tracks as well as "Unchained" and "Poundcake" to make room for some of the better tracks left off.For a far better representation of Van Halen's, pick up the two disc "Best Of Both Worlds", which has 36 of their best songs (not all the best, but close. Its new recording are much better, three new tracks by Hagar, who is now backin the group. The one advantage that this cd holds over "BOBW" is that it's done chronologically. Other than that, this is a forgettable affair.
Van Halen is a legendary hard rock group. Having just seen them less than a month ago, I can tell you, this band still has it, even as they push 60. These guys just plain ROCK. 'The Best of Van Halen, Volume 1' made an effort to compile the best of both eras: the David Lee Roth era (1978-1984; 1996) and the Sammy Hagar era (1985-1995) onto one single disc. Honestly, as you can tell by the star rating, it comes up short.The title suggests it is a 'Volume 1,' meaning that a volume 2 would have to follow. 16 years after this compilation's release, we still don't have a volume 2, and so it is probably safe to assume that we aren't going to get one. Which is a shame, because as a standalone, this album is severely lacking.Sure, 'Running with the Devil' is here. 'Eruption,' 'Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love,' 'Unchained' (a non-hit but rather a really great album track that does garner a good bit of airplay on classic rock radio nowadays), 'Jump,' 'Panama,' and a handful of Hagar-era tunes ('Why Can't This Be Love,' 'Dreams,' 'Right Now,' 'Poundcake,' the new-for-1996 tune 'Humans Being,' a soundtrack song which is surprisingly good), but what's not here is also a major issue.'Beautiful Girls,' 'I'll Wait,' 'Love Walks In,' 'Finish What Ya Started,' 'Dancing in the Streets,' 'Pretty Woman,' 'Cabo Wabo,' '5150,' 'Hot for Teacher,' 'Light Up the Sky,' 'Everybody Wants Some!!,' and many more (too many to list) are all missing on this Van Halen compilation. It's not essential for those reasons. Warner Bros. needs to wake up and release a volume 2 to go along with this, because this just isn't beneficial on its own.It is worth the money if you are a devoted fan for one reason: the two new-for-1996 DLR tracks, which, up until 'A Different Kind of Truth' this year, was the best you were gonna get for a Van Halen reunion. These two tracks, 'Can't Get This Stuff No More' and 'Me Wise Magic' sound fresh and exciting and give this compilation oomph (something it really does need). Roth is in fine voice here (and he still is in 2012, TRUST ME), and Michael Anthony's harmonies just sound flawless. This is in all likelihood the last time the original lineup of Van Halen will perform together in a studio environment (as Wolfgang Van Halen is now VH's bassist and Anthony now spends his time with Sammy Hagar in the supergroup Chickenfoot), thus these recordings are vital to your Van Halen collection.The sound on this disc is also excellent. It's not overcompressed and distorted -- it is just right. Crisp, clean, and airy, just the way CDs (and vinyls, for that matter) are supposed to sound.Overall, 'The Best of Van Halen, Vol. 1' by itself is a severely lacking compilation worthy of two stars, simply because Warner Bros. cannot get their acts together and release a proper companion piece to this set. However, the two Roth recordings make this disc a worthy purchase for any true blue Van Halen fan, and for that reason (not to mention it is dirt cheap and VERY easy to locate), you'll probably buy it anyway.'Humans Being,' 'Can't Get This Stuff No More,' and 'Me Wise Magic' all are worthwhile songs that automatically save this disc from a 1-star rating. Unfortunately, 3 songs just isn't enough to save this disc from a more than 2-star rating. The rest of the material is repetitive for die-hards, and while the material here is great, THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH OF IT.
Like the last person said, there where better hits then alot of what is on the collection of crap! I bought this expecting that the songs i already knew &quot;eruption&quot; &quot;pannama&quot; &quot;jump&quot; ect would have songs just as good? but i was wrong, maybe if it had a second disc, or a greatest hits 2 with it it would have been more worth the while? one that was not mentioned tho that i beleive shouldve been there was &quot;good enough&quot; ..... so basicly, where the hell is &quot;you really got me?&quot; &quot;Pretty woman&quot; &quot;good enough&quot; &quot;hot for teacher&quot;? this choice of songs was not thought out very well!
So many key tracks were left off, From Dave's era Janie's crying, You really got me, Atomic punk, Beautiful girls, Mean streets, Hear about it later, Dancin in the streets, Where have all the good times gone, Pretty women, I'll wait; Hell, where's Hot for teacher?Sammy's half lacks 5150, Summer nights, Best of both worlds, Finish what ya started, Judgement day, The Dream is over, Runaround, and Top of the world.This compilation re-inforces my belief that greatest hits are just the record companies out grubbing for cash.The new tunes Can't get this stuff no more and me wise magic are alright, it's great to here David Lee Roth behind the mic again. Download 'em if you can. VH fans starting from scratch might be better served with the individual albums. Check used record stores.
Despite some apealling moments that show this bands` uniqueness and stenght ("Stripsearch", "Mouth to Mouth", "Last Cup of Sorrow", "Ashes to Ashes"), "Album of the Year" is nothing special for the most part. The majority of the songs aren`t bad, yet they never seem to rise above average, merely listenable material either. Overall, this record lacks personality and staying power, presenting bland and not very intense rock tracks. Faith No More can do better and quirkier music than this middle-of-the-road effort without distinction or impact.Not memorable enough.
When I first heard Faith No More was putting out an album called, "Album of the Year", I got pumped.  I knew "King For a Day/Fool for a Lifetime" was a flop, so I thought this was the bands attempt at getting back on track.  I was sadly mistaken.  This album, to my amazement, got very good reviews at the time it was released.  I just didn't see it.  "Last Cup of Sorrow" was a decent song, as was "Ashes to Ashes", but other than that, I saw nothing but a collection of mediocre to weak songs, most of them being more on the weak side.This was a disappointing end to a band that started off with a tremendous bang, with "The Real Thing", and "Angel Dust".  Two remarkable albums.  I wish I could say the band members moved onto better things, but if you call Mike Patton's insanely childish ramblings in his 17 other bands good music, all power to you.
This is a re-review, I've done some personal research with this album and gave it another chance and I just can't get into it. Mainly it's the music. The lyrical content is just fine, and as Ive mentioned in my other reviews for Madonna albums that Im not fond of 'Its amazing what some beat adjustments, DJing and remixing can do to a song' it gives the song entirely new vibe and perspective.When it comes to Madonna I prefer her as a pop/dance artist with attitude, sass, glamour and edge. All of what I personally look for and expect in Madonna isn't present in Ray of Light, which makes a very boring and disappointing collection for me. Ray of Light (like Music and American Life) is a complete snooze to me. These three albums in my opinion are all alike and have a huge overlap with one another while still being their own record. Ray of Light through American Life is a Madonna within itself. Not one that Im personally excited about.The issue here is not that Madonna has chosen to switch gears, the mood and style are not the problem (even though Id prefer a higher energy) the problem is that the beat arrangments arent the best of their kind (for me), Ive heard better trip-hop or mellow pop songs with this same feel. This album (like Music) still has elements ofdance music but its a sub-genre of its own, its sound is a more distinct one. Its more like contemporary lounge music. Very conservative, mild and mellow mood. Its an album that would play on low with recessed lighting and light cocktails with indoor voices and no dancing. Evening attire, dim lighting and a very chic lounge. In that sense it works but thats not a daily activity. This album isnt something I would listen to on full blast everyday of the week, its more of a mood. Something you 'hear' but dont actually 'listen' to if that makes any sense.A few important elements are missing in this album as well as Music and American Life. All 3 are missing the passionate singing that's found in her most popular work. There's barely any yells or massive vocal performances. When listening to songs like 'Open your heart' 'Vogue' 'Like a Prayer' 'Confessions on a dancefoor' and other hits like 'Secret' you can hear what's missing in her vocals on this album. Sure , there are songs on this album that exhibit some passion in her vocals but its very subtle as to noy disrupt the mood of the album. Madonna is not Whitney Houston or Celine Dion (we know this) but she has a really good pop vocal that's amazing. If you watch her perform Frozen & Power of Goodbye live the songs are comparable to really big favorites of mine like 'In this life' from Erotica or 'Oh Father' from Like a Prayer. Lots of vibrato and range, you can hear in these live performances that her voice has not changed much since 1989-1994. Yet her studio performances with this album sounds as if her voice has matured to a point she sings alot different from that time frame. Her vocals are distinctly different on this album from the ones prior, but the live performances from then and on.this album all sound like the ecact same voice... Strange, I really think this album wouldve been more popular had she showcased her stage vocals in the album work.Ive learned to respect this album even though it does absolutely nothong for me. I respect her evolution as an artist and trying new things but this album to me was just completely flat and lifeless. Ray of Life is a matter of taste, anyone can listen to it and hear that everyone is not going to like this album. The sound is a very distinguished one. Sure there's some pop flavour on certain songs but not enough that it would be classified as being 'pop'.I thought that this album was completely terrible, but Its not the songs that I dont like. Its the music that I dont like. I know this because I was online and stumbled across a remix of Candy Perfume Girl and couldn't believe it was the same song. I downloaded it and played it back a few times, the remix has a hip-hop groove and a modern grunge feel to it, very edgy and dynamic. Which is exactly what I was looking for in this album. I began to come across different remixes such as Swim, this remix (again) had a 90's hiphop groove with industrial sounds and a grunge styled edge to the beat, After all these years I said to.myself 'this is it, this is the Ray of Light album I wanted all along' it was perfect.Another remix I enjoyed was the Sticky & Sweet tour version of the Ray of Light track. The pitch was taken down and more pop with a more melodic sound opposed to the original. I personally never liked the original versions of anything on this album. As I mentioned before Ray of Light is something you've got to have a taste or mood for. Its not a basic or traditional pop album and theres nothing wrong with that, I wouldve preferred better craftsmanship with the music, which ive found on my own through alternative measures such as remixes, club mixes, live versions and so on.One song that caught my attention when I purchased this album is Little Star, but the music spoils it for me. I just dont think the insyrumental is a good pairing with this song at all. I would prefer the same vocals and lyrics on a different instrumental. The music is too sharp and technical against this soft and delicate song. The music is way too polished and sharpedged for the message in the song. I also was taken by 'nothing really matters' but somethings missing in this song, I like it because its more dancey than anything else I can think of on this album but the energy that I want is still not present in the track. I have not found a good remix for this track yet, the onrs ive heard so far havent done anything for the track yet. Im sure ill find what im looking for, I.always do.I have all the remixes for Music, American Life and Hard Candy and its intriguing and fascinating what a club mix and some beat rearranging can do for a song because I can listen to these remixes as if theyre the original songs thats how rich they are. The original albums are just not the same. As Ive said time and time again, if Madonna's albums arent cutting it go for the remixes they never seem to fail....Last but certainly not least, The drowned world tour does this album so much justice. There's added elements in alot of the songs that are not present in the original formulas (the album/studio versions). Candy Perfume Girl is a rocked out version of the song, the performance is wicked; an extremely thin man does contortions in a spotlight as she stands still playing guitar and singing. I think this is the Silent Remix done live, the title is completely ironic as it's not silent at all. Another great twist from drowned world tour would be the Mer Girl/Across the sky contraction; I think the live versions of these songs together make the songs more passionate and she's actually singing with more effort which adds more vocal and feeling. Especially from all the movong around and dancing she did on that tour; she was slightly winfed therefore the singing has more 'push' and effort. She doesnt sound as nonchalant like she does on the album (I hate that), and again the remixes are better tooI rewrote this entire review, it was more judgemental =)
You know you're in trouble when a greatest hits album is dull. But then Steely Dan's obsession with studio perfection and fascination with Jazz clich&eacute;s is not exactly the stuff of greatness. In fact, I would argue that given Dan's obsessions, it would be impossible for them to be any good, but they did have a few good tracks. If you are interested, this might be the place for you to start, but I recommend CAN'T BUY A THRILL, it's not a great album either, but it's probably the best album this band ever put out.
I never got it. In the midst of Zeppelin, Sabath, Elton, Doobies, Stones, Santana, Humble Pie etc. you had these guys singing in front of a backup band and singing stuff like "One" and "Jeremiah Bullfrog" or whatever. Man, if I want to hear the Righteous Bros then I will listen to them. My wife picked up this CD and it didn't do it for me then and it still just hits me as top 40 70's ish pap. I don't even know what kind of music this is - maybe Vegas? For you fans of this type of stuff, I guess it is good stuff.
The year was 1990, the sound was "new jack swing"...R&B; laced with hip-hop..the group was Bell, Biv, Devoe..3 former members (Ronnie Bivins, Ricky Bell, Mike Devoe) split off from New Edition, the hugely successful R&B; "boy band" of the 80s. The band racked up a quick 6 Top 100 Billboard hits and then disappeared from the charts.HIGHLIGHTS:The title track is far and away the best song here and the only hit that still sounds pretty fresh. The group moves from strength to strength with sharp hip-hop beats, occasional harmony, and a really funky break (after "Blow!"). Outside of that, the album track "Ain't Nuttin' Changed" is a nice slice of old school hip-hop with a Sly and the Family Stone sample to boot.LOWS:"Do Me!" was a big hit back when, but the junior high locker room ideas about sex are pretty boring to me in my 30s (it's no "Let's Get it On"). "Word to the Mutha" and "I Do Need You" don't really go anywhere musically.BOTTOM LINE:This band was definitely a singles act, you don't really need the album unless you're a diehard fan who wants the extended remix of the title track and album track "Ain't Nuttin' Changed" which is also pretty tough. Outside of that, all the hits can be found on the "20th Century Masters:Millennium Edition" (ASIN B000066F0S) or if you really only want "Poison","B.B.D.", and "Do Me!" you might go for New Edition's "All the Number Ones" (ASIN B00004T0EB) which gives you those 3 tracks plus several big 80s hits from their old band.
i like do me&amp;poison but that's about it.i though the music was chessy then and even worse now.Ricky Bell had some talent but never got his stuff out.Bivins was a good talent scout(Boyz 11 Men)and what did Devoe exactly  do?however there impact is all over current R-n-B&amp;Hip Hop and that's  not good.
Leather Jackets, Elton's 1986 effort is one of his weakest releases. I actually enjoyed it when it was released, but it does not stand the test of time. Once again, Elton's personal problems were distracting him from making great records. Leather Jackets has a couple of great songs on it however. Hoop of Fire, Slow Rivers and Paris could rank up there with the best of them.But the rest seem like leftovers (which many were from the previously released and ill-conceived Ice On Fire). Elton shares songwriting credits with Bernie Taupin, Cher and Gary Osbourne. Taupin doesn't seem to have much to say while Osbourne turns in yet another routine love song on Memory of Love. And the Cher song, Don't Trust That Woman, is, well, it's best to leave that one in the cannons of album filler to never be heard from again.Meanwhile, the other songs sound just plain tired. The title track, in which Taupin evokes the great 50's rock stars gets the snythesizer treatment that buries a perfectly good lyric that could have been another homage to the genre like Crocodile Rock. Elton completely missed the point of Taupin's lyric here. Go It Alone, a wanna-be heavy rocker, sounds more like Bob Seger's Shakedown. And that's not a good thing. The album's lone single in the US was Heartache All Over The World and the over the top production and endless chants of &quot;girls, girls, girls&quot; would have been better suited for any number of generic 80s bands than Elton John.Gus Dudgeon, the master producer of Elton's golden 70s era,  doesn't have much to work with. The album has a slick, very 80s production but it can't disguise the fact that many of these songs just don't hold up.The last song, I Fall Apart, is very sad and as Elton pleads throughout the chorus &quot;it seems to be the night time when I fall apart; this house can get so lonely&quot; - you feel his pain.Luckily, his personal life would soon start to turn around and he would prove that there are still some great songs yet to come. We all know what happened. He went on to make some great albums and recharged his batteries.Leather Jackets was a temporary setback for Elton. Vocally, he sounds drained and lifeless. Things got better.And he has never co-wrote a song with Cher since.
Well this album is usually regarded, with the exception of &quot;Victim Of Love&quot;, as Elton's weakest effort. For the most part, I agree, but even though most of the material is faceless, I feel there still is some decent pop music here. &quot;Heartache All Over The World&quot; was the single, and while it failed to crack the top 40, it still was somewhat catchy, I'd love to see the video for it. Like many other reviwers have said, &quot;Paris&quot; and &quot;Hoop Of Fire&quot; are decent, &quot;Go It Alone&quot;, a song somewhat similiar to &quot;Act Of War&quot;(minus Millie Jackson) keeps things going in the right direction, while &quot;I Fall Apart&quot; sounds as though it could be a lost cut from &quot;Blue Moves&quot; or could be included on the future &quot;Big Picture&quot;. Okay, so there are about five decent songs, the rest is pretty much filler, but still makes for decent background noise, still, this album cannot be viewed any worse than the likes of &quot;Ice On Fire&quot;. The thing is, Elton could do so much better, and he eventually did with &quot;Sleeping With The Past&quot;.
I guess Elton and Bernie were running out of steam, Elton was tired of David Geffen's record company, or perhaps both. Although this album does have a couple of decent ballads, &quot;Slow Rivers&quot; (Elton's duet with Cliff Richard), &quot;Hoop Of Fire&quot;, and especially, &quot;Paris&quot;, the rest is dreadful filler, including the only hit single from this album, &quot;Heartache All Over The World&quot;. It's a pity that Gus Dudgeon's last studio recording with Elton was this dreadful mess. Still, this album is better than Elton's brief foray into disco, &quot;Victim Of Love&quot;, which is certainly his worst.
