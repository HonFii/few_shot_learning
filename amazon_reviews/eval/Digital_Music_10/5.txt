I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts, Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout, but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did. It makes it that much more special to all who own this album.
Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album.
Enya is one of of the most mysterious singers in music today. I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece. It's gorgeous and an album for the soul...
Many times, AND WITH GOOD REASON, the "new age" label gets slammed for lacking originality and conviction. Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is, in my opinion, her best to date.There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist, but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers. And if you look at what is being released these days, many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya, but don't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know. I know this sounds ridiculous, but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music. Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music, it works even better when it's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.Many artists/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table, but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line, but rather reflects a balance of the artist's intent with the listener in mind.Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions (even when I disagree) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work. Also, thanks to Amazon.com for providing this forum as I think that it clearly benefits the company, but ultimately it also can be a great place for a potential buyer to find his or her next favorite CD.
[One CD, with a running time of 44 minutes.] Ah...this wonderful CD shows off Enya's silky smooth voice. The eleven tunes are hauntingly beautiful. I won't try to categorize her music, it is simply too rich and complex.The paperwork includes the words to ten of the songs (The Memory of Trees is a musical number), and two nice color pictures of Enya. (I love extras!) So, if you like Enya's past hits, then I think that you will like this one as well. Buy it!
The problem with Enya is that she is so consistently good.  It is difficult to write a review that says something different from previous reviews (having recently reviewed "A Day without Rain" and previously "Watermark").  The same words, ethereal, ephemeral, airy, haunting, and spiritual apply to each album.  The only risk is that my reviews become boring, because Enya could never be.This CD begins with the instrumental track "The Memory of Trees."  While "The Memory of Trees" is nominally an instrumental, there are voices that punctuate portions of the music.  This opening feels optimistic, though the title feels as though it is vaguely related to forests and lands gone by.  The vocals provide a chorale sound that builds and cascades around you with the feeling of great trees and landscapes greater than any of the puny works of mankind.  Great beasts wander about and smaller beasts enter and exit the brush at the edges of clearings in the great forest in a celebration of nature.The pace speeds up in the peppy "Anywhere Is."  The lyrics are poetic and symbolic and are a mirror maze of mental images.  As is frequently typical of Enya the lyrics seem to make sense until you attempt to understand them and then their meaning escapes your grasp.  In this case the song seems to be describing the paths we take in life and the choices that we make, and whether they can be unmade, and even whether the choices take us to or from the one we love.  Another unusual feature of this song is the predominant instruments which compete for attention with Enya's voice.  Typically Enya's voice stands out clearly from the instruments, which in this case are mostly strings and piano."Pax Deorum" is somewhat ominous, and fits with the following song, "Athair Ar Neamh."  Both songs are simple songs that relate to God.  "Pax Deorum" translates roughly as "The Peace of the Gods," or seeking to placate the gods.  "Athair Ar Neamh" translates approximately as "Father in Heaven."  Note that the title of the latter song appears as a line in the former song, tying both songs together, and placing an Irish Gaelic line into a Latin song.  There are moments of choral lightness in the otherwise ominous "Pax Deorum," which I believe has appeared as the background music for a commercial.  The latter song is more contemplative and ethereal and Enya allows the beauty of her voice to caress and harmonize the Irish Gaelic verses."From Where I Am" is a relatively sedate instrumental that forms a brief piano interlude leading into "China Roses."  This song manages to capture the wonder of the universe and the beauty of heaven all in one song.  This song transcends the poetic to the surrealistic both lyrically and vocally.  Once again Enya allows her voice to be a beautiful instrument to complement the strings and piano to create a work of aural art."Hope Has a Place" is the first song where the lyrics are relatively easy to understand.  The concept is simple: there is always hope where there is love.  The vocals are beautiful (again) and may remind a listener of the song Enya wrote for "The Lord of the Rings."  This song is for romantics and candle-lit dinners everywhere.Another instrumental interlude follows.  "Tea-House Moon" has some of the most interesting instrumental effects on this CD.  The mood is contemplative and traditional, though with a vaguely Asian flavor.  This instrumental is the music for a heavenly choreography.The next song changes style, again, and yet fits within the character of the album.  "Once You Had Gold" seems to allude to the transitory nature of all things, perhaps most particularly life.  There are lines that seem to say that things come and things go, and you need to accept the joys that you can get just from being here to greet the new day.  I particularly like the last line which says that there are no promises in life, that there is good and bad and that one must make the best of any situation.  The song is sung in a fairy tale style, a cautionary tale young and old.The next song translates as "The Dreamer."  The music tells you all you need to know about the words, which are surrealistic and, of course, dream-like.  The ephemeral lyrics and music bespeaks an atmosphere, a feeling, a place that can only exist in our dreams, though we might wish otherwise.  This song nearly achieves allowing us to be a creation of our imagination.At last we must awaken from the fantasy Enya has woven for us.  "On My Way Home" returns us to this place and time, but with a longing for the place we leave, the poetry that has been woven for us.  Yet, we rejoice for we return to a place of familiarity, and still, there is the memory, yes indeed, "The Memory of Trees."
(...)She is one of a kind, and this album only enhances her contribution to musical enjoyment. As always, the instrumental opening sets a mood, followed by the lively "Anywhere Is", a song which grew on me each time I listened. Each song is exquisite, but for me, "China Roses" is the most delicately crafted song. However, "Once You Had Gold" which isn't mentioned as much is another of the highpoints. "On My Way Home" is a fitting conclusion to the album. I have heard rumors that not everybody likes Enya, and if there is a person who doesn't like her, then he or she shouldn't get this CD, but for everybody else, this is one of the essential CD's for your collection.
What an enchanting collection this is. I fell in love with Enya's music right from her first hit `Orinocco flow' and have been a fan ever since.Enya's haunting and ethereal voice, coupled with rich, magical musical arrangements, layered dreamy sounding backing vocals, and lyrics sung in English, Latin, and Gaelic, set her aside form all other new age artists.Opening track `Memory of trees' is a beautiful instrumental with angelic voices flitting in and out.`Anywhere is' has an upbeat tempo, cutting strings, lush instrumentation, and poetic lyrics.`Tea-house moon' is an instrumental with a Chinese sound. Magical keyboards (I think) set against a delicate backdrop. Beautiful! Just as delicate is `La So&ntilde;adora' with very ethereal vocals against a gently brooding soundscape. Then there's the tender piano instrumental `From where I am'.`Pax deorum' (sung in latin) will have you checking to see you're not in a monastery. Very religious sounding!The absolute standout has got to be `Athair ar nearmh' (sung in Gaelic). This song is stunning! Angelic vocals, delicate piano, with delicate strings sweeping in and out. Mournful sounding but outstanding!A magical, delicate, angelic experience!
The Memory Of Trees begins with the stunning titletrack, a great mix of voices and instrumental sounds, this is one of Enya's best songs. Anywhere Is has a great rythm and is catchy. Pax Deorum is a latin song and very haunting. It's like you're in a storm finding a place to schelter. The fourth song is Athair Ar Neamh; it's sung in Gaelic, I think. I see that it means &quot;Father In Heaven&quot;. Thank you other Amazon reviewer! From Where I Am is an instrumental track and it sort of lulls you to sleep. Then there is China Roses, a very romantic song about a dreamlike world, a sort of dream, I think. Hope Has A Place is another highlight of this record. Just great lyrics, and a soothing atmosphere. Thea House Moon is another instrumental track. It's not my favourite track, but still good. Track number nine is Once You Had Gold. Listen carefully to the lyrics again, just magic. La Sonadora is a spooky ballad, sung in Spanish? I don't know, but another highlight of The Memory Of Trees. And then there is the final track, On My Way Home. On Paint The Sky With Stars.. The Best Of Enya, you can hear the edited version. This one is longer and much more beautiful. A great ending to one of the best cd's ever made!
For the most part, The Cars were a singles band, but their debut stands as one of the best ever new wave albums.  The hit songs were solid, including the amazing threesome, &quot;Let the Good Times Roll,&quot; &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot; and &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; that kick off the album.  But side two is were The Cars demonstrate their artistic complexity, particularly on the lengthy double track &quot;Moving in Stereo/All Mixed Up.&quot;  &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; make for another couple of great singles as well.  This album is so good, it could stand as a greatest hits package all on its own.
Forget greatest hits!  Just listen to this and you'll be reminded what got you hooked on the Cars in the first place - this Album!  In my opinion, this release is their greatest!A stunning debut!
I loved the Cars, soooo oringinal.the more time passes, the better they are.And this is the set of songs that launched the legendary band.
What can I say about the Cars first album. The Cars debut album has to be one of the most impressive albums that I have ever heard. Why can't bands make albums this great anymore? Three big hit singles "Good Times Roll","Just What I Needed", and "My Bestfriend's Girl". As well as "Bye, Bye Love", "Moving in Stereo", and "YOu're All I've Got Tonight" that each get a lot of radio play as well. This is one of those rare albums that is great from start to finish, no filler here.
All tracks are perfect! Great music. This is a must album with such iconic hits. Seems like they never get old.
The Cars is their self-titled debut and one of the great albums of the new-wave era. Although their album Heartbeat City had more hits and sold more copies, the tracks here are their best work and many of them still get consistent airplay on classic  rock radio. The catchy hooks and memorable melodies still sound amazingly fresh over 25 years later, making the Cars one of the few new-wave acts whose work has truly stood the test of time.Like Boston's self-titled debut album which appeared 2 years earlier, this plays like a greatest hits album. The first three tracks &quot;Good Times Roll&quot;, &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot;, and &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; were all big hits and are now bonafide new-wave classics. Although not a big hit, &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; with its simple, yet memorable riff and David Robinson's busy drumming remains one of their most enduring tracks. Other excellent tracks include the punk-pop of &quot;Don't Cha Stop&quot;, the hypnotic &quot;Moving In Stereo&quot;, the moody &quot;All Mixed Up&quot;, and the catchy &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot; The band's ability to play to the strength of the song is admirable here, whether it's guitarist Elliot Easton's excellent lead work on &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot;, Greg Hawkes' keyboard flourishes on &quot;I'm In Touch With Your World&quot;, or Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr's strong vocals throughout the album. An excellent debut. Highly recommended.
The Cars was one of the most original bands to come out of the late 70s/early 80s, a band that helped set the yardstick for New Wave. This was their first album, coming out in 1978, and is in my humble opinion to be the best album that the band cut. Just about all of its tracks are great, and not just the hits "Just What I Needed," "My Best Friend's Girl" and "Good Times Roll."If you are a fan of New Wave music, then you will love this album. Heck, even if is just that you fondly remember the music of the late 70s/early 80s, then you will love this album, too. Do yourself a favor, and buy this album!
"Just What I Needed" was already an oldie by the time I was a high school sophomore, but that didn't stop it from being one of the most relevant songs I could get my hands on. It simultaneously fulfilled all of my most pertinent musical cravings, serving up a flawless three-and-a-half-minute cocktail of crunching power chord heroics, sharp melodic hooks, hopelessly clever lyrics, and vocals that were both quirky and impassioned. It was the perfect pop song, but with enough spiky alt-new wave attitude to imbue it with a sense of genuine cool. Every time I cue it up, it takes me back to tenth grade, to that joyful year that saw me fall helplessly in love with my best friend. "Just What I Needed" is the sound of pure, hopeless joy, of butterflies in the stomach and lightness in the head, of wry, knowing angst and cheekily self-deprecating humor. It's the sound of smart people letting their emotions sneak up on them. Beautiful!But the most mind-boggling thing about "Just What I Needed" is that it's not even my favorite song here! That honor would probably go to "Bye Bye Love," which is a brittle, cynical masterpiece. It's a simple breakup song that somehow manages to turn the whole notion of love inside out, and every one of its hooks is stuffed with bitterness and paranoia and caustic wit. In fact, I'd say that this album is worth the price of admission purely on the basis of Ric Ocasek sneering "you think you're so illustrious/ you call yourself intense." It's one of the most withering putdowns in the history of pop music, rivaling even the more acidic moments of This Year's Model and Highway 61 Revisited.The other seven songs are icing on the cake. I love icing. There are sweet, gooey gobs of it all over this disc, in the form of such irresistible classics as "My Best Friend's Girl" and "Don't Cha Stop." "I'm In Touch With Your World" is marvelously quirky, and "Moving In Stereo" is endearingly creepy. "You're All I've Got Tonight" is desperate and paranoid and surprisingly fun, "Good Times Roll" is a panicked (anti-) party anthem, and "All Mixed Up" is really atmospheric and kinda sultry. And the chorus is beautiful, sort of. Yeah. This album'll blow your mind with its inescapable wonderfulness. Treat yourself to it.
The Cars hit a formula right from the very start.  With Ric Ocasek generally taking the lead vocal, The Cars combined wonderfully wordsmithed lyrics with a solid rock beat to become one of the best New Wave groups.  Some people have argued that The Cars, along with Devo and several other groups, created New Wave.This album is a remarkable debut, with three of the songs released as singles and three others released as flipsides for a incredible 6 of 9 songs appearing as singles - something that few other groups have managed to achieve.  The songs are: "Just What I Needed"/"I'm in Touch with Your World" (5/29/78), "Best Friend's Girl"/"Don't Cha Stop" (10/10/78), and "Good Times Roll"/"All Mixed Up" (2/27/79).I've always had a great appreciation for The Cars' lyrics.  They are typically artfully evocative and more intended to evoke emotion than to convey a concept directly.  As an example, look at the opening lyrics of "All Mixed Up":she shadows me in the mirrorshe never leaves on the lightand some things that I say to herthey just don't seem to biteWhen you read The Cars' (typically Ric Ocasek's) lyrics you feel surrealistic.  Once you understand you are to picture images of feelings, or feel the feelings yourself, you gain an understanding of how the singer/songwriter is feeling.The Cars insisted they are music performers and not an "act", preferring to be known for their music rather than their ability to look flashy or jump around on stage.  Fortunately for us, the listeners, that desire translates into musical quality and sincerity.  This music has a pop feel to it, but with enough of a hard edge that pushes it towards the boundary between pop and hard rock.The musical style is somewhat dated, feeling like the late 70s music that it is, but it has aged to the point where it is now classic rock.  This CD is very solid music for anyone a fan of The Cars, of late 70s or 80s music, or anyone looking for something a bit out of the mainstream that has a good solid rock beat.
For many listeners, it might be hard at this point to listen to The Cars' 1978 debut album with fresh ears.  Over half the songs here remain staples of classic rock radio stations, and even if you don't voluntarily listen to these stations, you're bound to be familiar with songs like "Just What I Needed", "Good Times Roll", etc.  Even so, this is a great album, well-deserved of its classic status.Don't be fooled by The Cars' tendency to get pegged as a 'singles band'.  This nine-song debut actually has the feel of a song cycle with its uncannily sequenced lineup of songs. One of the great appeals of Ric Ocasek is the playful, yet classy, and savagely witty way in which he wrote about sex, how there's so much more to it than just 'getting laid'--there's a certain desperation mixed with vulnerability in songs like "Just What I Needed" and "You're All I've Got Tonight".The opening "Good Times Roll" sets the scene perfectly, with Ric offering us a feel-good anthem fed through his own warped sensibility.  "My Best Friend's Girl" is a wonderfully entertaining 'modernization' of Buddy Holly's patented sound.  "Don't 'Cha Stop", with its "Pleasant Valley Sunday"-ish opening riff, is album's sole uptempo track--the chorus feels rather tossed off, but it's still a very fine track, with great layered guitar lines on the verses.  The "I Can't Explain"-esque "Bye Bye Love" has a very upbeat-sounding tune, but the ominous lyrics and Ben Orr's marvelously stylish vocal delivery help make it the perfect lead-in to the album's final two tracks..."Moving In Stereo" was cooked up by Ric and Greg Hawkes in Ric's basement, making it the one track on the album Ric didn't write on his own.  And what a classic it is.  David Robinson's drums are tweaked a bit, giving them a noticeably brash quality.  Hawkes offers a synth line that's creepy and defiant without sounding melodramatic.  Perfect vocals from Ben Orr--could this man ever sing."All Mixed Up" ends the album in cathartic fashion--great dynamics, sumptuous vocal harmonies, and a stirringly emotional climax with a brilliantly-placed keyboard lick from Hawkes and Ben Orr once again working magic with his powerful, commanding vocals.I also must not fail to mention "I'm In Touch With Your World", another 'hidden' gem contained herein.  It shows that Ric could wring a quirky chord progression out of his guitar if he really tried.  Ric delivers an ultra-edgy lead vocal--it has a great, bugs-under-your-skin quality to it.  And all the percussion, sudden blasts of sound effects, and 'tick-tock' synths on the chorus punctuate this mostly stripped-down track marvelously.Lead guitarist Elliot Easton isn't spotlighted as much as he would be on the subsequent "Candy-O", but you can hear how the man was a big believer in 'serving the songs'--check out his well-placed rockabilly licks (instantly reminiscent of the Beatles' "I Will) on "My Best Friend's Girl", or his fine, if rather brief, solo on "Just What I Needed".So, you may think you know this album all too well already.  But, I suggest perhaps there's a bit more to this than you realize--after all, with a group like The Cars, things are often not as they seem.
the cars released this great record back in 1978.shortly after it,s release it was all over the airwaves.this album is in my opinion another one of the finest debut albums in rock ever!!there are so many great songs on this album it may well be the cars quintessential album. ric ocasek ;rythm guitarist and chief song writer for the cars was in top form on this album.for me the best cuts are[and there are many!]you,re all i,ve got tonight,good times roll,bye,bye,love,moving in stereo,just what i needed,my best friend,s girl,all mixed up and don,t cha stop.i realize i have just named most of the tunes on this album but i think this album is a must for any cars fan new or old!i also love the cover that chick with the sexy red lips!!this album and their second album candy o from 1979 are two of the best albums the cars ever did!
Learning to drive was one of the most liberating experiences I have had. It just changed the rules of the game.  I went from being a kid who had to be shuttled around to a more active participant in the world at large.  I not only had a new lease on life but also new responsibilities (a 1990 Honda Civic to take care of - my parents' old car that became mine around 1995 or so) that felt adult-like.  I think I grew a lot overall from the experience and now, many years later, can't imagine what life would be like if I couldn't get behind the wheel.I've always associated driving with liberation and excitement, and to this day it's my best place to think.  I have logged a lot of miles on several vehicles over the years and (wait, I'm reviewing something aren't I?) can think of no better soundtrack for this experience than the first Cars album.This album was released the year after I was born, so I certainly didn't "grow up with it" through my formative (read: teenage) years like some of the other reviewers here.  However I've always felt a certain kinship with this little classic, as if it's something that I should (in italics) have grown up with.  Perhaps that's because, for all of its virtues, a lot of the music that came about in "my" era wasn't particularly fun and catchy.  Driving to Nirvana or Soundgarden is (IMHO) a soup-sandwich unless you're really angry and/or depressed.  The closest corollary is Teenage Fanclub (another band that has created some of my favorite driving music), Fountains Of Wayne (of course) and Canadian band Sloan.The Cars' first disc is the driving album that every generation ought to have, full of good poppy rockin fun with an ever-so-slightly-twisted perspective (arched eyebrows at the ready) that allows you to still feel smart while singing along.  I couldn't ask for more.  However, absent any discoveries yet to be made, I don't believe there is such a thing for Gen-X and beyond. In the meantime, give this a spin the next time you head out on the road and try to picture that rush of liberation that you may have experienced when you first got behind the wheel unsupervised.  It's a nice feeling.
I got this album on vinyl when it came out in the 70s. Every song good...and I think their best album. One of the first New Wave albums but also retro at the same time. Get it, you already know most of the songs.
THE BAND: Ric Ocasek (vocals, rhythm guitar), Elliot Easton (lead guitar), Benjamin Orr (vocals, bass), Greg Hawkes (keyboards, percussion, saxophone), David Robinson (drums & percussion).THE DISC: (1978) 9 tracks clocking in at just over 35 minutes. Included with the disc is a minimal 2-page foldout containing song titles/times, band members and original black & white photos/artwork. Digitally remastered in 1990. There is a deluxe remastered 2-disc (disc-2 is all demos) edition released in 1999. Label - Elektra.COMMENTS: The Cars were never better than this debut album. Rock and pop with a synth/techno alternative flavor. Classic songs that sounded like nothing else at the time. The Cars were "New Wave" before there was New Wave (which hit in the early 80's). 9 songs - with only one question mark (filler?) in "I'm In Touch With Your World". The other 8 tracks were gold (the album reached #18 on the Billboard Pop charts and has sold over 6 million units). Ric Ocasek's quirky voice teamed with bassist Ben Orr's smooth voice worked well together. Greg Hawke on keyboards made & pulled this band tighter. The songs that made it to major air-waves were "Let The Good Times Roll", "My Best Friend's Girl", and "Just What I Needed". But, check out tracks 6-9... "You're All I've Got Tonight", "Bye Bye Love", "Moving In Stereo" and "All Mixed Up" run together fluidly - these are awesome album tracks. Sure this band looked like a bunch of geeks, but man when they came together with their instruments, they really made some beautiful music. Only their 2nd album "Candy-O" came close, but no album of the Cars was better than this one. This debut is ranked #282 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of 500 all-time greatest albums. R.I.P. Benjamin Orr (10/3/00). Classic disc (5 stars).
THE CARS ARE AN EXTREMELY TALENTED AOR BAND FRONTED BY RIC OCASEK.THIS BAND IS VERY GOOD JUST LIKE PINK FLOYD,CREAM,THE ROLLING STONES,AC/DC AND QUEEN.THEIR DEBUT IS THEIR BEST.PICK IT UP RIGHT AWAY BUT IGNORE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER AND HIS LOUSY RECMMENDATIONS.
Watershed Cars album, the only one you need. Youve heard 'em all. Worth it mostly for the usually-not-aired "Moving In Stereo", a moody, cryptic slow rocker, and "Doncha Stop"- I can't say what it's about here, but you may be able to get yr "head" around it if you listen carefully...
Every track on this album is a classic.  Almost all of them are in rotation on classic rock stations.  Even so the songs don't seem worn out or dated.  Ric Ocasek had a genuine ear for pop, which he melded with the bands New Wave sensibilities in order to create a classic album.
the Cars were a breath of fresh air in 1978.  Disco and sappy pop was the rule in '78, but with this release by these Boston modern rockers, it would lead to a 9 year relationship with this band.  Led by guitarist,vocalist Ric Ocasek, bassist,vocalist Ben Orr, guitarist Elliot Easton, drummer from the Modern Lovers David Robinson and keyboardist Greg Hawkes.  Produced by englishman Roy Thomas Baker, "The Cars" #18, is just a tremendous release with such classics as, "Just What I Needed" #27, "Good Times Roll" #41, "My Best Friends Girl", #35, "I'm In Touch With Your World", "Don't Cha Stop", "Your All I've Got Tonight", "Bye Bye Love", the moody "Moving In Stereo" and one of the best songs ever in rock history that radio never plays "All Mixed Up".  In less than a year they would come out with another great album "Candy-O".
&#34;We used to joke that the first album should be called The Cars' greatest Hits.&#34; said guitariest Elliot Easton. their debut was arty and punchy enough to be part of Boston' New Wave scene, yet so catchy that nearly every track (&#34;Good Times Roll,&#34; &#34;My Best Friends Girl&#34;) landed on the radio.
The Car's debut album in 1978 represents the good ol' days of American rock. They are categorized as a NEW WAVE artist but to them, they were struggling to create what American rock compared to UK rock should be evolved. With the huge success of Boston, Foreigner, Styx and Kansas they were trying to do something different while retaining mainstream pop vibe. The band challenges Foreigner with hard-edged and upbeat track JUST WHAT I NEEDED. While creating radio friendly first three songs, they were experimenting what music fans at that time might never been experienced. Fourth track I'M IN TOUCH WITH YOUR WORLD invites listeners to the uncharted territories. Then at fifth track they again put out upbeat track DON'T CHA STOP, then they turn to progressive hard rock edged YOU ARE ALL I'VE GOT TONIGHT. Listeners might have enjoyed what they might call mystery drive tour. The last two tracks often aired in pairs are truly what make the band's debut album a legend.Verdict: Impeccable and Exciting debut album by another new giant.Rating: 93 out of 100Recommended for late 70s pop rock fans.
My native Boston based rockers The Cars released their self-titled debut in June of 1978.The Cars was formed by rhythm guitarist/singer/songwriter Ric Ocasek and bass player/singer (the late) Benjamin Orr.Prior to the formation of The Cars, Orr and Ocasek were in a popular Boston act called Cap'n Swing, along with lead guitarist and Berkeley School of Music grad Elliot Easton. They broke up in 1975 and the trio joined forces with former Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson and keyboard player Greg Hawkes in 1976.For a year they did well gigging around New England and their demo of "Just What I Needed" became a hugely requested song on a local Boston rock station (WBCN for those who want to know). As a result, Elektra Records signed the band and the label decided to pull out the artillery for this new band and have legendary Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker produce this incredible debut which was recorded in London, England at George Martin's AIR Studios with engineer Geoff Workman (another Queen and Journey veteran).When this album came out, it was a smash and 30 plus years later, it is still a masterpiece.The album's first three tracks were all hit singles. "Good Times Roll" is a great opening song on this album with a killer guitar riff and what not. Next is "My Best Friend's Girl" is another great song and I think of this song from the 1979 Matt Dillon film debut Over the Edge where he told a cop off as the policeman was arresting one of his friends. The song is great too with a guitar solo reminiscent to The Beatles' "I Will" in tone. The song that follows was "Just What I Needed" which was America's intro to the band and was Orr's vocal debut on a Cars track (Ben and Ric would split the vocals evenly). The track is still a staple of rock radio. This track too appeared in Over the Edge prior to the film's party scene. "I'm In Touch With Your World" and "Dont'cha Stop" are also great rockers which close the first half of the album with classic Ric vocals (Ric sang most of the first half except as noted). Those tracks ended the first half wanting more.The rock radio staple "You're All I've Got Tonight" kicks the second half off in a grand way and is a killer rocker (the only vocal from Ric in the second half as Ben did the rest). "Bye Bye Love" is next and another great rocker as well and a rock radio staple as is most of this album. We segue into the classic "Moving in Stereo" which is one of the band's best pieces of music and the song is forever etched in our brains as that image of Phoebe Cates in the red swimsuit coming out of the pool in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The closing "All Mixed Up" is a great song as well and a great way to close this album.This album fittingly got the success it deserved and not only did New Wave fans buy and embrace this album in droves but hard rock fans did as well and sold millions and peaked in the US Top 20.This version of the album was remastered in 1998 by Joe Gastwirt and Rhino then upped the anty by issuing a deluxe edition in 1999.Highly recommended!
After years of listenting to metal/rock/pop/... rock, I heard this album...and the world turned on it's head for a moment (for me, of course)...my first intro to something other than 'Free Burd', and although  it took some getting used to, this still remains on my list as one of the  best new-wave/rock classic albums of all time.  The 'best of' they did  covers the hits, but this CD, from start to finish, is a work of new-wave  art - rarely matched by their contemporaries (except maybe the 1st  Pretenders album...).They (The Cars) brought cynicism to a new level,  without being obsessed with anger/etc.  This CD has an underlying power to  it that is unmatched by others - one that will remain as a CD that listened  today (20 years on) for a reason beyond their sheer popularity.
The Cars' self-titled debut album, which introduced the band's unique blend of the Velvet Underground, the Steve Miller Band, and Roxy Music, is their most balanced album as far as vocals are concerned, with lead vocals about equally split between Ben Orr (R.I.P.) and Ric Ocasek. Orr's vocals are more melodic than Ocasek's, as the latter seems to have some vocal tics that can be annoying at times. This wasn't a problem on the first two albums or HEARTBEAT CITY, as these records have enough hooks to compensate for any vocal shortcomings that the bandmembers might have had, but it was a severe issue on PANORAMA. If you're hoping for a Cars reunion, sadly, it will never happen; bassist/vocalist Ben Orr died of pancreatic cancer in 2000.
If you love this album as much as I still do, pony up the extra couple of bucks and be prepared to be wowed, loud. Go for the double disc deluxe set, which sports a great remaster."The Cars" was a classic debut and one of the first bands with a new wave association to actually make it big. Their blend of irony laden Roxy/Bowie pop and AM radio hooks made "My Best Friend's Girl" and "Just What I Needed" sound like Top 40 classics from play one, and the rest of the album skirted experimental stuff like "Moving In Stereo" with the classic nervy album rock ready sounds of "Good Times Roll." Roy Thomas Baker's spare production is gave the band a sharper focus, and made the songs leap from the speakers with a fresh sound.The band's arsenal was well loaded. Greg Hawkes brought keyboards to the front of the band, as well as his sax work. Elliot Easton made his choppy guitar work as fluid as it was jittery, and Ben Orr and Ric Ocasek switched vocals just enough that, while there was variety, it was seamless. True originals, The Cars were often aped but never replicated (as opposed to the dozens of Joe Jackson/Elvis Costello copycats) and it makes this debut sound great almost 25 years after it was released.
I don't know why so many people claim The Cars invented &quot;new-wave&quot;. They did have that sort of weird keyboard sound, but their music was straight popular hard rock. They are more in the vein of groups like Loverboy then &quot;new-wave&quot;. They had the sound of the early 80's MTV groups, but in a rock style. &quot;Just what I needed&quot; was an instant classic with me and my hard rock fan friends in the summer of '78. Good stuff.
I got into The Cars around the time I was 14 due to smoking mad pot, drinking beer, and hearing the song JUST WHAT I NEEDED all the time on my local classic rock radio station.I remember the exact moment that I actually "heard" this song. I had a nice buzz going and I was chasing this hot little ticket around this beach we used to hang out at. I had a baby boom box in my hand and this song was playing. Suddenly I stopped everything because it seemed that I had become surrounded by this incredibly transfixing electronic music. This of course is the synth hook from the song. Oh yeah!The next day I asked my moms if she had any CARS records, and indeed she did. This one.I never gave New Wave a chance before this record, however there was no doubt a lot of fun music on here with a solid rock edge to it. Very cool. These guys innovated the NEW WAVE sound which of course would mutate substantially in the decade that followed, leading to some good, some bad, and some downright irritating music.The Cars for the most part remained pretty good, although their music gradually lost the rock edge and just went into realms of stray pop up until they fell apart in the mid-late eigthies, but this is their best album for sure, along with the second, CANDY-O.The album is just partying it up until the end, where you get an awesome tripped out bit of electronica MOVING IN STEREO. You may remember this song from the movie FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH when that extremely fresh young thing comes walking out of the swimming pool. Uh huh..... LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL for SURE!
The Cars formed in Boston circa 1976 and debuted in 1978 with this eponymously titled release.  Straddling the line between rock and new wave, the group managed to maintain rock credibility while also racking up some major pop hits.  "Just What I Needed" peaked at #27 and has become a rock radio staple.  The single is my favorite song of all time - it so perfectly encapsulates the late 70s new wave scene.  And it's catchy as hell - I have to turn up the radio whenever I hear it.The second single, "My Best Friend's Girl," went to #35; the song starts with handclaps before a major synth line kicks into gear.  Finally, "Good Times Roll" just missed the Top 40, peaking at #41.  However, not a single track is filler - any of them could have been a hit.I was a little too young in 1978 to become a Cars fan, although I caught them in their pop heyday, when "Drive" was a major hit.  I've picked up the rest of their catalog in the last few years, and I've been blown away by the quality of their music, especially "The Cars."  Propulsive synths combine seamlessly with the rock-edged guitars to form one of the most distinctive sounds ever.  This CD really demonstrates why the Cars became stars - it still sounds completely amazing."The Cars" sold very well when first released and was certified platinum in late 1978.  Since then, the CD has continued to win fans - with certification for sales of 6 million by 1995.  Every time I hear The Killers or other current retro new wave bands, I want to throw on this CD and hear how it was done right the first time around!  Most highly recommended.
Brian Wilson once said of this album he wanted to write songs on "more than one level". And since the term "classic album" is often overdone and often used without care,Brian's own terms seem to define this album very much. And there are very few full lengh albums over the years that I can say exist on more than one level. The works of Marvin Gaye,Stevie Wonder and The Beatles come to mind. This is one of those records I can put on with absolutely no urge to skip over any songs. The key to the entire success of this album was arrangement. Inspired by the vocal harmonies of pop and doo-wop groups along with the wall of sound production of Phil Spector Wilson created this,which basically amounts to his debut solo album co-staring The Beach Boys on vocals and harmonizes. Aside from that Carl,Dennis,Mike and Al had precious little to do with the music on this album. That's where the name comes from. These were,in fact Brian's "pet sounds". Based on musical influences that impacted on him personally.This album is home to some truly wonderful songs. Much heard and well known hits such as "Would'nt It Be Nice" and "God Only Knows" being among them. And interestingly enough if those songs excite and amaze you,than the rest of this album will be right up your alley. Much as The BeatlesSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandwas supposed to be (but which even John Lennon admitted it actually wasn't) this album is completely musically and thematically unified. This is not the work of an adolescent celebrating California surf culture. This is the work of a reflective and yearning 20 something who'd by this point already experienced physical abuse,mental illness and was now married with a baby on the way. Speaking for a generation obsessed with the eternal youth,this sets the record straight on that. On "I Know There's An Answer","Caroline No","Here Today" and beautifully chorded pieces such as "I Just Wasn't Made For These Times","Don't Talk" and "That's Not Me" there's this prevailing sense that the singer-songwriter who once mused about the delights of being "in my room" now saw the music world as forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity.Musically? Well on this you here an album that goes for redefining what rock and roll was. Rather than having a lot of distorted guitars in the mix,playing three noisy chords you have elaborate organ/piano/horn/rhythm based songs that are more about melody,harmonic and chordal invention that making noise and "rocking out". On the instrumental title track for example you realize this album has a lot more in common with types of Northern soul recordings from Dusty Springfield or Georgie Fame for example. It's not by any means a guitar rock album. Bands such as the High Llama's would later make music very much based on this sound. But it definitely extends off the Beach Boys surf sound into something that comes very directly from Brian Wilson's soul. He would in fact suffer something of an emotional breakdown whilst attempting to outdo himself with the follow up album to this. That also mixed with the fact the blood and sweat perfectionism Brian put into this product wasn't fully appreciated by every member of the Beach Boys. But that's another story.
You know,even with classic radio hits like &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;,&quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot; I just can't putThe Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; into my CD player and not listen tothe entire album in one sitting!I'd be missing out on my favoritesongs like &quot;Don't Talk&quot;,&quot;Let's Go Away For Awile&quot;,&quot;Caroline No&quot;,&quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;...I can go on and on,really!This has less weak cuts then The Beatles &quot;Sgt.Pepper&quot; and thatonly had ONE mildly weak song if that tells you anything.Okay-order this NOW!It will brighten your day!
This album was originally released on and is still distributed by Capitol Records. Capitol's original catalog number is DT 2458 for the stereo LP and T 2458 for the mono LP. The stereo copies were "duophonic",meaning they could only be played on stereo phonographs for maximum sound quality. But then again,you'd get good quality sound if you played a duophonic copy on a monaural phonograph. Stereo LP copies of THE BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS were "duophonic" also. Hits from this album include SLOOP JOHN B.,GOD ONLY KNOWS and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE?. This album was a best-seller when it was released in 1966. The Beach Boys were still in their teen idol phase then as was their Capitol labelmates,The Beatles and Peter & Gordon. Also then,Brian Wilson began to have problems with drugs. He'd remain with the band in the studio but turned his duties on the stage to Bruce Johnston. All the other songs are good.
You don't need a rocket scientist to inform you that The Beach Boys' 1966 album "Pet Sounds" is one of the Top 10 greatest albums ever made. Not much is left to say that hasn't already been said about the album. Song for song, the record is pure perfection. From the youthful abandonment of "Wouldn't It Be Nice" to the dramatism present on "Sloop John B." to the heartugging "God Only Knows" (voted the greatest love song of all time) to the poignancy of "I Just Wasn't Made For These Times" to the chilling "Caroline No", there is not one clunker on the whole cd.This newly remastered edition features the entire album in both stereo and mono. In both forms, the album sounds absolutely fantastic. There ies also an excellent booklet filled with some great essays and rare pcitures. Definitey a must have album.
"Pet Sounds" seems to be compared a lot on this website to "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", which might be okay since The Beatles were so impressed with The Beach Boys new (at that time) album, but at the same time the comparasion is ridiculous. Both are legendary albums in different ways, and "Pet Sounds" for a moment in time made the Beach Boys the greatest rock and roll band in the whole world, even bigger than there friendly competitors The Beatles (who came right back and took the title away from them with "Revolver").First off, "Pet Sounds" is a far, far departure from the Beach Boys that most people know and love. These songs aren't about fun in the sun, girls, and surfing. Instead, it is a deep examination of the thoughts and dreams of a young boy, and how they change as he grows older and his problems and worries become bigger issues for him to deal with. Many people know that Brian Wilson, the leader of the band and the creator of this album, had many mental problems, and also had various drug addictions at this time as well, so he had a thousand ideas that he was thinking about. Also, Brian was an obsessed perfectionist, he wanted to create an album that was greater than anything that had come out before. He spent hours upon hours in the studio, creating layers upon layers of sound and vocals, using any instrument available (even soda cans!) He created a sound that was more lush and beautiful than anything ever before, creating almost a "dream" sound of reflection of a boy becoming a man who for his whole life was yearning for the love and affection that he felt was missing."Pet Sounds" is Brian Wilson's baby, and many even argue that this was his solo debut as a back up band was used on many of the songs instead of his fellow band mates. However, the harmonies and vocals are what make this so pleasing, and only his band mates could help in that. The songs themself are pretty excellent. "Wouldn't it be nice", "Sloop John B.", and "God Only Knows" are the well known songs, and the only ones that you are able to listen to as singles. The other songs you have to listen to along with the album as they paint the whole picture that way. The album is about one man's search for love from boyhood to manhood, and the pain and hurt he goes through in his search for it. If Wilson's lyrics don't make you reflect yourself or even make you feel the pain, then listen again. And again. And see how the album will move you in ways your never felt possible.Such a complex and challenging album to listen to that is essential to every rock and roll fans collection. While this album might have started the break down of Brian Wilson, and while the rest of the band mates didn't necessarily agree with the direction the music was heading in (more songs influenced by drugs and mental illness, which the band wasn't dead set on singing the lyrics to), for one moment this album made them kings. Brian was working on his next project, "Smile", when The Beatles released "Sgt. Peppers." After listening to it, Wilson put up his white flag of surrender, the others went back to the simple days of surf rock, and the Beach Boys never reached the level of creativeness and uniqueness as they did with "Pet Sounds."
Released in May 1966,"Pet Sounds" was the album that saw The Beach Boys graduate from purveyors of perfectly crafted lightweight pop like "Sufin USA","Fun Fun Fun" et al,into a vehicle for the mature compositional genius of Brian Wilson.Though it was not an huge hit,its became hugely influential on pop and rock musicians,most notably The Beatles,whose "Sgt. Pepper" drew inspiration from this album as Paul McCartney would gladly tell you,and many others old and new(too numerous to mention).For me,it was the first time I truly enjoyed the Beach Boys because it was a work that expressed emotions that I could relate to like finding true love,being insecure,not fitting in,and loss of innocence.It also had the most gorgeous and most haunting melodies,harmonies,sounds,and songs ever commited to tape,like "God Only Knows","Caroline No","I'm Waiting For The Day","Wouldn't It Be Nice" and others as well.It made me look past the corny striped-shirt fun-in-the-sun image and made me realize that this band had a much deeper,more substatial body of work than I thought.And it has given me great comfort to my heart,soul,and ears since then.That's probably the reason why this album's rep as "The Greatest Album Of The 20th Century" still continues to grow and deepen with each passing year!
I often write about heart and soul when reviewing cds, describing the enormous effort musicians put into their works. Certainly there are many bands and singers who have devoted their lives to music, but never, ever have I heard an album that is remotely close to the breathtaking Pet Sounds, as far as work ethic, creativity, perseverence, and in the end, pure perfection.Many people liken Pet Sounds to The Beatles Sgt. Pepper album. People often criticize Sgt. Pepper for taking its influence from the primordial Pet Sounds, but the fact that Brian Wilson was first inspired to make Pet Sounds after he heard Rubber Soul is often overlooked. Here's what he said in the liner notes: &quot;In December of 1965, I heard the album Rubber Soul by the Beatles. It was definitely a challenge for me. I saw that every cut was very artistically interesting and stimulating. I immediately went to work on the songs for Pet Sounds.&quot; As a huge fan of both the Beatles and the Beach Boys, I find it absolutely wonderful and riveting that the two biggest bands from across the seas were involved in somewhat of an artistic spar; one which ended up helping both bands produce some of their greatest music.As far as the individual songs of this album, there are no highs and lows. Pet Sounds stays at a steady constant of brilliance, sounding at an uncalibrated musical high. From the swirling harmonies of the opening Wouldn't It Be Nice to the wonderful coda of Hang On To Your Ego, this recording is thoroughly enjoyable. My personal favorites are Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows and I Just Wasn't Made For These Times. To wrap things up with a hackneyed yet appropiate cliche, your music collection is incomplete without Pet Sounds.
1966 was an annus mirabilis for rock music. The greatest bands of the British Invasion - The Beatles, The Stones, The Kinks - began to reliably deliver sets of all original material instead of dividing their LPs between covers and originals. (The Who's first great album was released in 1967.) Moreover, the LP became more important as a complete artistic statement, resulting in great records (Revolver, Aftermath, Face To Face) rather than simply great singles. While great but fairly simple pop music had been produced prior to this year, 1966 was the year in which rock bands began to challenge themselves, and their audience, with more sophisticated songcraft.The Beach Boys' 1966 release Pet Sounds was the best example of an American band making this leap. Inspired by the previous year's Rubber Soul, Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson,along with lyricist Tony Asher, was determined to make a record that would keep them on par with the Fab Four commercially and artistically. Many - including Paul McCartney himself, maybe - would argue that Pet Sounds surpassed Rubber Soul's achievements, only to be outdone itself a few months later by Revolver. (I flatter myself to think that people have read my other reviews, but I make it clear time and again that Sgt Pepper was just another Beatles album, so I am going to disregard it here.) Whatever the case my be, Pet Sounds turned out to be a huge critical smash on both sides of the Atlantic. Strangely, it was less of a commercial hit in America not only than it was in Britain, but than its predecessors in the US had been.I will try, even if I have already partially failed, to avoid rehashing everything that has already been said about Pet Sounds, and attempt to review it strictly on its musical merits and how well it has endured over the past 40 years. By these standards, it is factually a great and  truly unique record. One would search in vain for Chuck Berry-style riffs and solos that were a trademark of their previous records. In fact, the closest thing one finds to guitar riffs at all are the plethora of plump, high-pitched bass lines. But not to worry about the trademark vocal harmonies. They are as plentiful and as gorgeous as ever. The singles are clearly the pillars of the album, and are enough by themselves to make this a worthy record. But while "Wouldn't It Be Nice", "Sloop John B", "God Only Knows", and "Caroline No" are all great, "Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)", "That's Not Me", "Here Today", and "I Know There's An Answer" are also exceptionally vital numbers. The remaining songs are not quite as great, but they are good enough to help earn Pet Sounds the reputation that it has. Even the two instrumentals are quite strong, and serve as highlights for the unprecedented variety of instrumentation throughout the disc, including tympanis, horns, tubas, Christmas-y bells, and of course, the Theremin. The overall sound of the record is wholesome and magical, and finds kindred spirits in late-Sixties LPs such as Love's Forever Changes and Odessey and Oracle by The Zombies, and in more recent releases like The Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin. Hence, Pet Sounds was not a traditional rock record at all when released in May 1966. Rather, it was the origin of what would come to be called baroque or chamber pop.Influence and endurance are essential to an album's "greatness". However, it seems to me that sometimes influence and endurance are overemphasized and used to hide the fact that a given record's songs are not really all that good. Ultimately, what good is a great record if it doesn't have great songs on it? Pet Sounds needn't worry about lacking any of the necessary elements. But most importantly, it is the songs themselves that would earn this record the high rating that I have awarded it even if it were not so influential and enduring. In terms of its standing in the Beach Boys catalog, it is obviously their best record, but it is also something equally important: the point at which the sun began to set on these California boys' endless summer. Gone are the surfboards, fast cars, and hamburger stands. That isn't to say that they wouldn't return, but at this time Brian Wilson was dealing more with the fleeting nature of the pleasures of youth, embodied by Caroline, who said she'd never change, but did. In doing so, he created a record that is artistically influential, historically enduring, and - with nary a weak track - truly Great.
This one is a strong contender for best rock album of all time and should be in everyone's collection. Period. Now, it has been reissued countless times (I think I have owned three different versions at least). Unfortunately the best version ever released looks like is no longer available: a stunning one CD containing all tracks in both stereo and mono for the price of a regular CD. Now these versions are sold separately. Which one to buy? Originally, the album was released and mixed in mono. Only recently was the album remixed in stereo. So, if you are interested in the history behind this album, and the whole `painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa' issue, get the mono version. With the stereo version, although you get all the inherent improvements of stereo sound, some sounds from the original album are lost in the stereo mix. Nevertheless, bottom line, for my ears the stereo will always sound best, and that is the version I listen to most. The extra track is just `I know there is an answer' with different lyrics, nothing revealing.
&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; has become one of my all time favorite records.I can't stop playing this  newer  version.The first 14 songs are recorded in Mono,then repeats in Stereo.When Paul McCartney and George Martin heard &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; they were amazed.This Album was the Blueprint for the Classic,&quot;Sgt.Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot;and The Beatles,&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the blueprint for this record.Brian Wilson was Blown away after hearing the album.He stopped touring with The Beach Boys,and just wanted to work in the studio.&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is more of a solo record by Brian,and his partner,Tony Asher.When the single,&quot;Caroline No,&quot;came out,The Beach Boys name wasn't even on the record.The cut bearly made the top 40.No one knew who Brian Wilson was.This is my Second favorite cut from the album.&quot;God only Knows,&quot; with Carl Wilson on lead,is  unreal,The vocal arangments  are perfection, and its one of the first songs to have God in it.This has got to be one of the greatest records ever made. My other favorite cuts are &quot;You still Believe in me,&quot;I'm Waiting for the day,&quot;and&quot; I know there's an answer.The CD comes with a 31 page booklet that tells you all about the recording of the album.I've been playing this CD for two weeks,and I can't get these songs out of my head at night.The Harmonies,the weird sounds,This record is a Classic.
The Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds" is the best sunshine pop (let alone 60's pop) album EVER recorded. This album is SO original and SO cheerful that you can't help but love it. The most well-known songs on here are the hits "Wouldn't It Be Nice", "Sloop John B.", "God Only Knows" and "Caroline No", but the other tracks are just as good and interesting. The Beach Boys are famous for their harmonies and vocals, and this album does not disappoint. The musicianship is definitely 60's, but the audio quality and the instrumentation is perfect. Another great thing about this album is how quotable and interesting the lyrics are - they're some of the best ever written! You'll absolutely love singing along to songs like "Wouldn't It Be Nice"! Fans of every genre will love this album (you'd be hardpressed not to), as this is an instant classic. Buy it now!Highlights include:the entire album
Y'all lost me when you declared Pet Sounds as the best album of all time. That's simply a ridiculous claim, hell I'll take Black Sabbath's Paranoid, or Sticky Fingers by the Stones, or Dark Side of The Moon by the Floyd, or Kid A by Radiohead, or XTC's Nonesuch, or King Crimson's Discipline, or the Sex Pistols, or Revolver by the Beatles or Axis: Bold as Love by Hendrix and many others (and we're just talking about rock here) before Pet Sounds any day.  Now if you'd said that Pet Sounds was the most influential album of all time I'd have given a longer pause to reflect.  After all XTC would probably never have done Nonesuch which owes a huge debt to the vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys and the Beatles wouldn't have done Sgt. Peppers in order to compete with Brian Wilson's masterpiece.  Pet Sounds became for a brief time in the mid sixties a kind of pop music benchmark and was the most complex and ambitious pop music album of its day.  And that ambition, that desire to make rock 'n roll or pop music grander, more musically serious, is Pet Sounds most profound and lasting legacy.  A legacy that influenced the Beatles, Moody Blues, King Crimson on up to Pink Floyd and beyond.  One could make a case that Pet Sounds was the first progressive rock album. But it doesn't really matter if Pet Sounds is the best or most influential album ever made.  What does matter is that Pet Sounds is sublime pop music.  The lyrics may be slight, so what, the sound of this album is a gorgeous island of melodic and harmonic bliss.  It's just damn beautiful, at times very touching and shouldn't be missed.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.
This is a exciting Beach Boys album and this is hailed a rock masterpiece by all the rock critics but they suck but I will recommend it.This album came out in 1966 and even the Beatles said &quot;How are ye gonna top this mates&quot;.I give props to Mr.Cranky for his reviews one man with the balls to say what he thinks and everyone is going nuts about it that would be good.1.Would'nt be nice-This one is a classic 10/102.You still believe in me-This one was pretty good 10/103.Thats Not me-This one was entertaining 9/104.Thats Talk(Put your head on my shoulder)-Great 10/105.Im wrating for the Day-This one is pretty good 10/106.Go Away for a while-Beautiful instrumental 10/107.Sloop John B-This one is another classic 10/108.God only Knows-This one was called the best song written 10/109.I Know theres Answer-This is short but sweet 10/1010.Here Today-This one was good. 9/1011.I just wasn't made for these times-Good 8/1012.Pet Sounds-Another Instrumental that is great 10/1013.Carolina No-This is the last official song 10/10 Has Dogs14.Hold on to your ego-This is a good song 10/1015-27 Crappy Remastered songs my dad likes I don't.This album was produced by Brian Wilson but this should have included Good Vibrations but still it is very good album.Lyrics 10 Production 10 Music 10 Style 10 Voice 10Overall=50/50 Almost a perfect album still sounds Fresh in 04
What do you know, the album officially considered The Greatest Of All Time might just be that.  I am innately hostile to canons, their systems of values and generally crippling influence - they close down thought rather than encourage it - but I think it's fair to say that the influence of the Beach Boys, and 'Pet Sounds' in particular, has inspired most of the great imaginative pop of the last three decades.Considering its reputation for sonic adventurousness, I was expecting something more lush, more sound-heavy, but 'Pet Sounds' is actually quite austere, effects never promoted at the expense of the beautiful songs.  The most dominant feature is that thrilling soul-shuddering thump-drum echoing in vast Spector-al spaces, making intense and urgent great catchy songs like 'I'm waiting for the day', 'I know there's an answer' and 'Here today'.There's a mirroring of types on the album, where similar songs reflect and transform each other: the serene sleepiness of 'Don't talk' refracting the shocked tragedy of 'Caroline no'; the frustrated dream of 'Wouldn't it be nice' and the frustrating intentions of 'Here today''s narrator.'Pet sounds' is one of the great exposes of the male psyche, with its less endearing, more devious and self-serving impulses - 'I'm waiting for the day' and 'Here today' especially.  Best of all is the tragi-bathos of 'Sloop John B', a male appropriation of the Shangri-La's' traumatic pop, made un-tragic by youthful male ridiculousness, yet still moving with its (and the album's?) refrain 'I want to go home'.
I am not a Beach Boys fan.I consider this one of the 4 or 5 greatest albums of all time.The trouble with this album is that it constantly points out the musical genius--and I do mean genius--Brian Wilson was, and leaves you wondering how he could have plummeted to the depths that would hit him within just a few months of PET SOUNDS.As much as I love &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B,&quot; they seem second tier when heard in the context of this album.  &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day,&quot; &quot;Here Today,&quot; &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; and &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; are all first rate Pop.PET SOUNDS also has what I consider to be the greatest Beach Boys track, &quot;Caroline No.&quot;  It is a perfect recording of a heartbreaking lyric.
Most young today people associate The Beach Boys music with surfing,cars,chicks and fun,fun,fun.Thus when the songs,Wouldn't It Be Nice,Sloop John B,and God Only Knows are recycled for the umpteenth time on  a compilation album,it's easy to overlook the wonderful production,as well  as the depth of its parent album Pet Sounds.Since it set the standard for  albums for the last 34 years,most seemed lost on its impact.But when you  truly listen and get inside these songs that you really experience the  beauty of this album.The aforementioned themes are replaced with songs of  introspection and more adult themes.Brian Wilson's need to compete with The  Beatles turned into burning creativity as he recorded Pet Sounds with  meticulous attention to detail.Using some of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew  as well as the famed Wall Of Sound technique,the albums complexity was  nothing short of amazing.Songs like That's Not Me,Here Today and Caroline  No display both beauty and sadness in their own unique way.Wouldn't It Be  Nice, God Only Knows,and Waiting for the Day are rays of light that seems  on the brink of turning into dashed dreams.The Beach Boys harmonies are  flawless though since Brian sings most of the leads,you'd almost think  they're guest stars on their own album.Even for all its accolades,Pet  Sounds was deemed a failure back in '66(due to the general publics as well  as Capitol Records inability to understand and embrace the record)But over  the years it has left the other Beach Boys albums in the dust,as well as  accorded its own boxed set.In '66 it seemed way ahead of its time,nowadays  it just exist outside of time.

Bought this album on reputation...many critics would have it as the greatest album of all time. The track listing had never grabbed me enough to want to get the album without the reputation given to it by the critics. Anyway, I took a punt. The cd I have is listed as released in 2001, and it has the mono version of the album first, then the stereo mix of the album. There is a bonus track too, which is a reworking of one of the songs on the regular album. On first listen I gave this album 77.5/100. On second listen and after listening to the mono mix as well, it's difficult to rate. If it had 3 or 4 songs I liked as much as "Sloop John B", then it could be an easy 5/5. This album would score in the high 80s to 5/5 for me based on the fact that it is just so listenable...no more killer tracks, but no dud tracks either. That's been enough for me in the past to give an album 5/5 too. With a band like The Beach Boys, maybe there is just an expectation of lots of songs up there with their poppy best. On this album they move beyond their lyrically simple but highly infectious surf-pop confections. These songs aren't memorable to me, but I can imagine being pleasantly surprised at how pretty they are if I was to dig this album out again. Of course, "Sloop John B" is a great cover by the band, which they turned into a masterpiece. Perhaps it's wrong to expect the other songs to measure up to this? In any case, this album would be more uniform but still very strong without this classic on it...and maybe easier to score.Overall, the album has many pleasant tracks, with symphonic elements to them at times. Lyrics have depth which their early surf-pop songs don't have...not that this was anything but a positive for those early songs. On second listen the album was just an easy listening pleasure, which I've tended to reward here in the past with high scores. A difficult album to rate...it's listenability demands a high score though. Range: 87.5 to 100/100.The all time classic ("/"):Sloop John B - iconic intro. Glassy percussion. A killer pop cover of the Caribbean folk song. Has a tuba, I think and great harmonies with good variety in the voices.The best of the rest...on second listen (">(.)"):You still believe in me - bumped this up from a "[.]". Nice lead vocal tone and melody. Cello? Harpsichord? Has bicycle horn type sound as well.Caroline no - Same bump up as above, but after my third listen, on the mono mix. Has chunky wooden percussion, which is nice. A pleasant track. Harpsichord, big bass notes and a pretty woodwind type of instrument. The outro features a train and barking dogs.Then ("[.]"):Wouldn't it be nice - album opener. Iconic lead guitar melody intro. Brass. Good stereo balance (albums of this era were experimenting with the new stereo capabilities and didn't often do stereo well by today's standards).I know there's an answer - catchy piano, tambourine and a tuba type instrument. Double bass plays in a jazzy kind of a way. Symphonic drums. Thoughtful lyrics and a catchy chorus.On second listen (">[.]"):Don't talk (put your head on my shoulder) - was hoping that this was a cover of the sugar 1950s pop ballad. It's not. Only has one of the Beach Boys singing on this track. Features organ, bass, piano, violins and cymbal percussion.Let's go away for a while - a pleasant, experimental instrumental. Drums and symphonic drums. Piano, brass, violins, twangy string instrument and xylophone (?),God only knows - horn, bass, sleigh bells (?), interesting tone to the percussion, some sort of keyboard effect, violin and a lovely falsetto by one of the Boys.Here today - piano, tuba, tambourine, symphonic elements like brass. Double bass note picking. Catchy verse (?) parts...I mean like the opening vocal melody.On third listen!  (">[.]"):I'm waiting for the day - interesting symphonic drumming and other symphonic elements feature as well. Quiet parts alternate with with percussive passages, which is a little bit catchy.I just wasn't made for these times - bass notes, harpsichord (?), interesting percussion tones at times...(bongos?), symphonic drums at times, woodwind? I think that the mono version of this song may have that novelty instrument which was often used in the 1950s...the one where you waved your hand over an aerial type instrument which created sci-fi type noises...I forget what you call those!The rest:That's not me - organ, dual lead guitar, aboriginal percussion sticks sound, bass drum (?), reflective lyrics. Interesting.Pet sounds - instrumental with symphonic elements. Maracas, brass...including a tuba, twangy lead guitar, bass, interesting drum tone and a tambourine, I think.Hang on to your ego - A bonus track. Very similar to "I know there's an answer". Wikipedia's entry for the album version states that this bonus track was the original version, but there were concerns about supposed drug related themes...as in the title! Personally, I can't see it!Recommendations...easy listening classics:Fleetwood Mac - Fleetwood Mac (2nd self-titled album), RumoursGenesis - From Genesis to RevelationThe Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground & Nico, The Velvet Underground.
Unless you're an avid reader of Rolling Stone's retrospective issues, you could easily forget that the Beach Boys were once a great band comparable to the Beatles and that Brian Wilson was considered a musical genius. Certainly the copious notes included in the CD booklet here will vouch for that viewpoint. With Wilson finally completing his legendary "Smile" recording after a 37-year break, interest in the band's recognizable music will likely cause an upswing in sales, especially for this album, long considered the masterpiece of their lengthy career. Inspired by the Beatles' "Rubber Soul", Wilson wanted to make an album that thematically integrated love and even inspirational songs together. He succeeded.With their soaring, yearning harmonies and sunny California dispositions intact, "Pet Sounds" is still great and made all the more resonant by its sophisticated instrumental arrangements and Wilson's creative musical invention. Songs like "Wouldn't It Be Nice", "God Only Knows", "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times" and "Caroline No" remain classics that go far beyond the aging Gidget set and showcase their amazing abilities as a vocal group. The title track and the especially esoteric "Lets Go Away for Awhile" unearth Wilson's talent for multi-tracking and embracing different musical styles without sacrificing the sound that was essentially the band's own. This CD contains a bonus track, "Hang On To Your Ego", which is actually an alternate take of "I Know There's an Answer", and for die-hard fans, the whole album is repeated in stereo. I still prefer the original mono recordings as they have the pop and crackle that captures a more innocent time in recording, a nostalgic postcard for a band that once had the potential to supplant the Fab Four in creative output. Whereas the Beatles retired amid inner turmoil at the height of their popularity thus assuring their legacy, the Beach Boys languished into a parody of themselves as Wilson was facing demons of his own. But at least there is this one album to treasure.
I can't really say that I'm a huge Beach Boys fan. I don't particularly care for surf music or a lot of the Beach Boys' music for that matter. Lately I've been on a music kick on checking out albums that was on VH1's 100 Greatest Rock and Roll Albums list. First the Beatles, then Madonna, now the Beach Boys.I was stunned by the beauty of what I heard on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. The Beach Boys goes beyond their traditional surf sound by exploring the sounds of pop and rock. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is the band's &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as noted in the liner notes, maybe not in those exact words but that is what Brian Wilson was aiming for and he got the results what he wanted. The songs are simply amazing. Next to The Beatles' &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;, I haven't heard music as pure as &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. All the songs took my breath away, especially &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; also makes for a wonder summertime album to listen to, so carefree and easy going to listen to. A real rock and roll masterpiece.
Undeniably the Beach Boys masterpiece. This is an album that has transcended the years and will still be played and enjoyed hundreds of years from now. Brian Wilson, inspired by The Beatles &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album, set to work, along with some help from Tony Asher to create one of the most amazing pop records ever made. The digital remastering is excellent,...these songs sound wonderful. And the 24 page book is great. Includes notes by Brian Wilson, loads of photos, track-by-track notes, and a 6 page essay by David Leaf on The Beach Boys and the making of this album. My version has 3 bonus tracks &quot;Unreleased Backgrounds&quot;, &quot;Hang on to Your Ego&quot; and &quot;Trombone Dixie&quot;. This album belongs in all good music collections.
No question, one of wonders of the digital is the chance for a work like this to be remixed in stereo, with an amazing soundstage.  Mark Linett deserves an award for the work he did with the multi-tracks to this album.  I've heard things I've never heard in the hundred times I've listened to  the mono Pet Sounds.  Putting the mono and stereo versions back to back  really shows the aural difference.For all that refuse to accept the  stero version and consider it some sort of sacrelige, hey, you have the  mono version.  But you are really depriving yourself.This classic got a  whole lot better.  For those of you that are Beatles fans as well, we can  only dream of the Beatles work getting the same treatment.
PET SOUNDS REALLY IS THE GREAT ALBUM THAT ALL THE LAME GEEKS FROM BAM AND ROLLING STONE AND ALL THE A&R BLOWHARDS AND INDUSTRY JUNKIES SAY IT IS.......THATS THE BAD NEWS......NOW HERES THE GOOD NEWS.....CLARK THE SHARK FROM GE SAYS ITS GOOD SO GO BUY IT AND HEAR THE TRUE PURE SADNESS AND ANGST A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE PUNK ROCK AS IT USES PETE TOWNSHEND SONGS FOR TOILET PAPER !...THIS ALBUM REALLY IS THE SH***...IF YOU MUST WANT THE TRUTH OR NOT I'LL GIVE IT TO YA...ITS BETTER THAN RUBBER SOUL...THAT OTHER UBBBEEERRR MID 60'S ALBUM...THE TWO ALBUMS THAT LAUNCHED THE GREAT ALBUMS WARS THAT WOULD PLAGUE ROCK INTO THE 80'S AND BEYOND...EVEN WHEN PET SOUNDS STARTS TO STRUGGLE...ON SIDE TWO...AND ALITTLE ON SIDE ONE, THE PAIN AND BITTER LIFE EXPERIENCE OF BRIAN WILSON (AND HIS HATE FOR HIS DAD) KEEPS THE LISTENER RIVETED! THIS THING IS ALL GOOD ! BEYOND CLASSIC...IF IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU CRY, THEN YER PROBOBLY SOME FACIST CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT TYPE WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND GREAT ART ANYWAY AS YOU CLAIM YOU DO ! BUY IT !
A great recording takes the thoughts and feelings of the artist and creates with them a work that enables the listener to say "I've been there...I know EXACTLY what they mean". For the 40 some minutes "Pet Sounds" plays, I *am* Brian Wilson....The disc encompasses the full range of human emotion: the wide eyed innocence of "Wouldn't it Be Nice?", isolation ("I Just Wasn't Made for these Times"),gratitude ("You Still Believe in Me"), longing ("I'm Waiting for the Day"), infatuation ("Don't Talk (Put your Head on my Shoulder"), insecurity ("That's Not me"), homesickness ("Sloop John B."), envy ("Let's Go Away for Awhile"), desperation ("God Only Knows"), benevolence ("I Know There's an Answer"), pity ("Here Today"), disillusionment ("Caroline No") and the devil-may-care ebullience of youth ("Pet Sounds").When someone tells me they've listened to this and didn't like it, I really begin to question their humanity. EVERYONE needs a copy of this in their home.
It's true this is one of the best albums of all time. I'm not sure if I'd call it the second best album ever (Rolling Stone), but it is amazing. Even though &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as a whole is great, it's the hits that really stand-out, which include &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;, &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. But I also really like &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; and &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Other than being a classic among classics, this disc also includes the bonus track &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot;, and the entire album is repeated in stereo on tracks 15-27. For all these reasons I highly recommend getting &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. At least you should see what all the fuss is about.
Has no one else noticed?What amazes me about this, one of my all time favorite albums of all time.The Beach Boys only sing on it. They play absolutely no instruments on it.Produced by Brain Wilson & Phil Specter. They can make anyone sound this good.At least The Beatles played on Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, didn't they?And golly gee, Paul McCartney  did get so upset the way Phil Specter produced Let It Be.
This album is a classic masterpiece!!! One of the best albums of all time!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five Stars!!! A+
The Beach Boys/ Pet Sounds (The complete Albums in Stereo & Mono):  This is a beautiful and absolutely classic album.  This particular single CD version of it gives us both the Mono and Stereo mixes.  Both are great.  I originally did not want to buy a bunch of individual albums by the Beach Boys.  I wanting instead a good compilation but, having been disappointed with the five-disk history set, I turned to the original albums.  I had the old LP of Pet Sounds many years ago and this CD is a revelation of brilliance and clarity.  I could not be happier with this CD, and am glad that I was not forced to buy the multi-disk Pet Sounds Sessions in order to own the album.  Highly Recommended.
Like many people, I did not discover what by many is considered the greatest rock &amp; roll album of all-time until the Beach Boys had passed into the 'Nostalgia Oldies' genre...what a tremendous loss for me.  I had heard for years about what a masterpiece this record was, and to be frank, I only thought that music written by Beethoven and Mozart could earn that status--boy was I WRONG.  Brian Wilson, one of the strangest songwriters of our time, has penned something truly magical.  When someone like Paul McCartney says that this is his favorite album of all-time, that certainly says a LOT.As many before have noted, there are many reasons why 'Pet Sounds' is great, in fact, there are as many different reasons as there are different types of people, but there is one thing that we ALL agree on:  This album is truly a phenomenon unto itself.  Almost nothing compares to it (all serious music lovers will understand and agree) and comparing 'Sgt. Pepper' (another great album--but also the most overrated Beatles' album) to 'Pet Sounds' is kinda like comparing the first World War to the Gulf War...they were as different as can possibly be.I in particular enjoyed both versions of these songs.  Many wonder why they were originally recorded in Mono when Stereo was widely considered the way to go...Brian Wilson was virtually deaf in one ear, so he couldn't even HEAR it stereo, and therefore concentrated on the minor details, the things which really made his production superior to virtually everybody in the recording business.  In short, there is almost nothing I could add to what has already been said about this musical masterpiece.  Anyone who truly appreciates music and does NOT go into listening to 'Pet Sounds' expecting to hear a bunch of 'Surf Tunes' will be surprisingly disappointed--at FIRST.  After a few listens however, the true genius behind this audio treasure will begin to show itself...and the more you listen, the more you appreciate.  In other words, buy, open, listen and enjoy.  Repeat.
This is Pop Music at its more beautiful. A genial vocal work with the correct melody. If &quot;Revolver&quot;(The Beatles's masterpiece) was considered the best album of the XX century, I should say that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is problably the natural rival for that album.Essential for any CD's collection. Superb!
I remember the first time I ever heard 'Pet Sounds.' I was sitting at a beach house in Delaware, just relaxing, and I decided to pop in a copy of 'Pet Sounds' that I just purchased not too long ago (at the time). I shut my eyes, popped the CD in the player, and entered another universe. I was moved to tears (and it takes a LOT for me to cry). This record completely changed my life.It has taken me forever to write a review on Amazon for 'Pet Sounds,' simply because I couldn't quite find the words to describe Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys' 1966 masterpiece. I still can't honestly. But I'm going to try. But first, in case you don't already understand the background of this record, allow me to "clue you in."In the early 1960s, The Beach Boys consisted of Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Carl Wilson, and David Marks. This lineup released three records from 1962-1963, all consisting of "fun in the sun"-esque songs, revolving around the surf, sun, cars, and girls. These records symbolized the California surf sound. Marks left the group in 1963, replaced by original member Al Jardine (although both were in the group at the same time, it was soon obvious that Jardine was going to dominate the rhythm guitar spot -- Jardine had been in the group during its earliest incarnation but left in late-1961 to pursue dentistry, only to return less than two years later). With this lineup change, the group slowly moved towards a more complex sound and added tighter vocal harmonies. In 1964, Brian Wilson suffered a nervous breakdown, and stopped touring. The group initially replaced Wilson on the road with future country and television star Glen Campbell on the road, but this was no long term solution. The group released one final album with the five-piece, 'The Beach Boys Today!' before adding Bruce Johnston to the touring lineup as Brian Wilson's replacement, and, as it turned out, in the studio as well.In 1965, the group released 'Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!),' which is perhaps the precursor to what was to come a year later. This record proved to be their best yet, and showed The Beach Boys maturing as vocalists and lyricists. But even in '65, nobody could have predicted what was to occur a year later.That's the history lesson.Brian Wilson was the visionary behind this record. And his vision shines through brilliantly here, to say the least. The vocal harmonies on this record are otherworldly. There are simply no words to describe just how brilliant 'Pet Sounds' is. 'Wouldn't it Be Nice,' 'Sloop John B,' and 'God Only Knows' are the "radio hits" (notice the quotations -- this really isn't a radio-friendly record by any means) from this album, but these are only part of the mystique of 'Pet Sounds.'Listen to the haunting harmonies on 'You Still Believe in Me,' and the creative use of sounds by Brian. A honking horn? Brilliant. Mike Love turns out one of his best vocal performances on 'That's Not Me.' To those who say that Mike Love can't sing, listen to 'That's Not Me' again. His vocals here are emotional and almost flawless, and Brian's vocals in the chorus are also just brilliant. I've always loved the guitar sound in the chorus here as well.The instrumentals are also great. 'Let's Go Away for Awhile' is a dreamy, mysterious piece that features none of The Beach Boys playing on it (this includes Brian Wilson). Wilson arranges it and does it perfectly, but take note that he does not actually participate in the playing. I've always loved the vibraphones on here. This is a neat instrumental. The title track is also quite imaginative, featuring the banging of Coca-Cola cans for percussion. The guitar sound on here is great, as are all of the multiple percussion tracks. This track is extremely complex, and packs a lot into it for a song under 4 minutes.'Here Today' is another fine performance by Love. This is a love song, and it is probably one of the few tracks here (besides the "radio hits") that the strictly "fun-in-the-sun" Beach Boys fans could relate to. While I'll always prefer Love's vocals on 'That's Not Me,' he still sings wonderfully here, and should be praised for his vocal delivery.And then there are the tearjerkers. 'Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)' is, in my opinion, the most beautiful piece of music ever found on any modern record of any genre. Period. Brian Wilson's vocals here are as close to flawless as one could ever hope to hear. The string arrangements in the middle of the track are perfect, and just suit the track perfectly. Hal Blaine's ever-so-light tapping on cymbal is just perfect for this track. More so than any other track on the record, this song creates a mood. It's slow, romantic, and thought-provoking. This may very well be the most perfect track ever put on tape. And I mean that. 'I Just Wasn't Made for These Times' is also mind-bogglingly beautiful. If you aren't moved by Brian's vocal delivery and the harmonies contained in the middle section, there is something seriously wrong with you (or you are soulless). 'Caroline No' has always been my personal favorite track on the record. While it isn't the most beautiful song on the record, it certainly could be on any other record. Brian's vocals are gut-wrenching and just perfect. You can feel almost every emotion he is trying to convey. You feel the heartbreak in his voice, and it almost stings. But it is also quite beautiful, and the arrangement could not be more perfect.The hits on this record are also perfect. 'Sloop John B' is an old folk song that Bud & Travis had recorded a few years ago, as had The Kingston Trio. Al Jardine had the idea to put a folk song on the record for a balance. Brian, at first reluctant, agreed, and radically altered the track for the record. This song was a radio hit back in 1966, and while I have read that the track is out of place on the record, I could not disagree more. I think the track is perfect here, as it gives the record a lighter track, despite the song's message being rather sad. (This song would have also fit perfectly on 'Summer Days' in my opinion).'Wouldn't it Be Nice' has been played many times, and is still a concert staple for all three current touring lineups of The Beach Boys. Tony Asher's lyrics here are great, and Wilson's voice is also in top shape. This song conveys a message of optimism, and is a perfect love song and the ultimate record opener. 'God Only Knows' was one of Carl Wilson's first vocal performances, and it also remains one of his best. Wilson would perform this song in concert with The Beach Boys right up until his death in February 1998. The backing track is perfect, and the harmonies that Brian, Carl, and Bruce Johnston share on the track are just gorgeous.Lastly, 'I Know There's an Answer' could be interpreted as Brian's take on LSD. It's an interesting track, and it does surprisingly fit on this record. The backing track is extremely complex, featuring a tambourine as its driving rhythm. It's quite interesting. It's not a beauty like some of the other tracks here, but it is certainly a very cool track.The bonus tracks are also neat. 'Trombone Dixie' appears on some additions. Portions of this track (you can call them "recycled bits") would later show up on later albums (as backing tracks). 'Hang On to Your Ego' is simply the original version of 'I Know There's an Answer' before Mike Love made Brian Wilson and Tony Asher change the lyrics due to its obvious drug references.The years following 1966 would see some good times ('Good Vibrations,' released at the end of the year would reach #1, the last Beach Boys track to do so in America until 1988) and bad times (the shelving of the 'SMiLE' album until November 2011, Brian Wilson's breakdown, the disappearance of The Beach Boys on the American charts). But one thing is for sure -- 'Pet Sounds' is brilliant. I think it is the greatest album ever made, and it is probably also my favorite album ever made. It is beautiful, moving, interesting, complex, intricate, gorgeous, and flawless. It is very well engineered and very well played (featuring some of the best session musicians in the business, including drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist Barney Kessel and bassist Carol Kaye). This record is a masterpiece that must be owned by all serious music fans.I don't care if you like The Beach Boys or not. If you don't own 'Pet Sounds,' you don't have a collection of music that is worthy of mentioning. Plain and simple. Words cannot describe just how brilliant this record really is. Millions have tried to sing its praises (like I am trying to do now), but there really aren't words adequate enough to describe just how wonderful this record is. This is more than a record -- it is almost a religious experience in its own right.Five stars is not worthy of a record like this. Infinite stars are needed to even *come close* to describing how brilliant this album is. Buy this album IMMEDIATELY if you don't own it already. Buy it and prepare to be blown away by the sheer brilliance that is 'Pet Sounds.'
This album is universally regarded as the Beach Boys' masterpiece, and who am I to disagree?  You might say that this was the band's peak, but I would say that they actually peaked with the "Good Vibrations" single after this.  But Pet Sounds is certainly their peak from an album standpoint.  This album always ranks among the top ten albums of all time in any survey of critics, and rightly so.  If you can't appreciate how great this album is, I feel sorry for you.
For years, I often read about what a wonderful album this truly was. I was, like millions of others, well acquainted with and highly admired the radio favorites Wouldn't It Be Nice and Sloop John B. I often planned to purchase this CD, but I never got around to it until a few months ago.After watching VH1's 100 Greatest Rock-and-Roll Albums of All Time, I witnessed that after the votes of many fans and critics  were tallied, Pet Sounds came in at an astounding Number 3, only behind Nirvana's Nevermind and The Beatles' Revolver, and the additional commentaries provided in the program concerning this release led me to thus conclude that this is definitely a must-have.It is interesting that both The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and The Beatles' Revolver were almost simultaneously released in 1966. These two works alone illustrated the evolution of synthesizing top-notch songwriting and instrumentation with highly expensive yet very creative musical productions.Lately, as a longtime Beatles fan on one hand and as a person who has come to highly admire the genius of Brian Wilson on the other, I have been comparing Pet Sounds with Revolver. Yes, I think that these albums are equal in greatness and significance. However, I have come to enjoy Pet Sounds a little more. Even Paul McCartney has identified Pet Sounds as one of his all-time favorites and rightfully so.Throughout their careers, the Beach Boys released other works that have come to be noteworthy pop standards but never at the level of this one. In a way Pet Sounds was and is a hallmark of both creative triumph and a series of what-ifs and what-might-have-beens. To me there are now two great mysteries in rock-and-roll history that will forever remain: 1. How successful and well-received would The Beach Boys' Smile, the highly anticipated follow-up that never came to exist, have been? and 2. What if Brian Wilson had a prolific partner within his group just as McCartney had Lennon?
People tend to glorify their rock and roll idols.  We think that "genious" is just as fitting a word for a Tool album as it is for advances in heart surgery.  We look more fondly upon Bono and Bruce Springsteen than we do our own fathers.  Some pretend that rock can really save the world when deep down, we all know it can't.  Reason is not always the music lovers ally, myself included.Having said that, I don't find anything wrong with giving proper credit where it's due.  So I can say, without any reserve, justification, or apology, that this album is perfect.  Every note.  From the psychedelic piano/rain effects of "Wouldn't it Be Nice" to the sobering, lovelorn "Caroline No."  It is amazing what we humans can create.  "I Know There's an Answer" seems to ask if there's something more, while Brian Wilson tries to convince us he "just wasn't made for these times."  "Sloop John B" is one of the greatest singles of all-time.  And though I know I'm not the first to mention "God Only Knows" as being the first rock song to mention God in its title, you'll have a hard time convincing me that I'm not the most dismayed that we're approaching a time when mentioning God at all is taboo.  This album reminds us of a more simple time.  Happiness, joy, and harmony...  These things should have always been a part of rock and roll.Overall:  10 out of 10.
Everyone has heard that this album is a classic, and those unfamiliar with it may wonder why it has such appeal. Briefly, its qualities might be summarized as follows: 1. The inventiveness of its arrangements. There are  so many timbres and instruments used, all working together to create  moments of beauty. The bass lines in particular are worth noting, as they  so often help create sonic tension. All of the musicians used are top  notch. 2. The warmth and depth of the recordings. Every groove sounds like  a canyon, though without the excess mushy echo of Phil Spector. 3. The  dazzling vocal harmonies. The Beach Boys were known for them, and here they  reach new heights. 4. The sincere emotional depth of Brian Wilson. You can  practically hear him pouring his heart and soul into the project, taking  catchy pop tunes and turning them into quasi spiritual moments. 5. The  belief inherent in such an unusual project that pop music can be something  more than just dance or party music. Brian Wilson conceived this as  something of a &quot;teenage symphony to God.&quot;  I am glad this  recording is available in both its original mono and its stereo form.  Regardless of which you prefer, this sounds good (with headphones, it  sparkles as the rich tones wash over you), and it is important to hear the  mono version for insight into how the record originally appeared. If you  like this music, I also heartily recommend a box set called &quot;Good  Vibrarions - Thirty Years of the Beach Boys.&quot;
This album was and is McCartney's inspiration for the rest of his musical life and that is saying something. Brian pulls out all the stops to make the Teenage angst Masterpiece and the song I just wasn't made for these times is the anthem for those of us that can't seem to fit in with the cliques. Highly Recommended for music fans, especially musicians. Casual BB fans should not start here, get the greatest hits.
One of the truly hyped albums of all time that lives up to the lavish praise heaped upon it. Brian Wilson was a 23-year-old who was struggling to express himself in new aural forms, and made this masterwork. Somewhat surprisingly, it flopped. The liner notes detail the reasons: kitsch cover (no doubt), automatic dislike of anything &quot;Beach Boys&quot; by those that would have liked it the most - hippies. It also paints Brian in a glowing light as working alone, without a songwriting partner like the Lennon/McCartney team, or without a guiding producer like George Martin. That he was such a young man working alone, against the advice of his manager, and created such a beautiful album is truly a testament to his musical genius. The songs speak for themselves, and everyone should know them by heart.
I must admit, as someone who was not a real fan of The Beach Boys, I always considered themselves to be a "Fun in the Sun" type of band.  However, as I became intrigued by The Beatles' "Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hears Club Band" album, I soon became equally intrigued by The Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds".  I soon learned that there was a bit of a rivalry that existed between the Beatles and the Beach Boys' from a creative standpoint.  It turns out that when the Beatles released "Rubber Soul", Brian Wilson felt compelled to push himself to the creative max - and the result would be "Pet Sounds" - which in turn inspired the Beatles to do "Sgt Pepper".  With "Pet Sounds", I discovered was an album that wasn't the typical Beach Boys' "Fun in the Sun", but an album that would prove to be one of complex instrumentation and be years ahead of its time.  This would be the result of the efforts of Brian Wilson - with some songwriting help from Tony Asher.Wilson incorporates probably one of the widest ranges of instruments that had been heard on any album in the Rock era.  This includes Strings, Woodwinds, Brass, and a variety of percussion and interesting sounds (bicycle bells, dog barking, etc).  If one is to basically compare "Sgt Pepper" against "Pet Sounds", "Sgt Pepper" may have stronger and more catchy lyrics, but Wilson's musical arrangements on "Pet Sounds" have the slight edge.  For all practical purposes, Wilson incorporates a four piece orchestra for many parts of this collection.  Two instruments that really stand out on this collection are the use of Tympani Drums and Baritone SaxophoneOne thing that makes this collection so unique is you get two flavors of "Pet Sounds".  The first 13 tracks are the original tracks as they were recorded back in 1966 and released in mono.  In 1997, Brian Wilson would take those original masters from 1966 and create a Stereo version of those tracks - which are also included on this collection.  This basically is a win-win for the listener.  I found that I would appreciate the charm and originality of the mono recordings while I could also appreciate how well these tracks sounded when converted to Stereo.  Each version brings a different listening experience. You will hear a little more distortion with the mono version, but that is to be expected.  There is also a bonus track that was not included on the 1966 release called - "Hang On to Your Ego".Here is a quick synopsis of the tracks:"Wouldn't It Be Nice": This is one of the more popular tracks.  It has the classic Beach Boys' harmonies.  This song is enhanced by the use of Tympani, Saxophones, and Mandolins"You Still Believe in Me":  Slight psychedelic feel.  The use of bicycle horns gives this song some charm.  The music from the Harpsichord,  Clarinet, and Tympani are some of the highlights here."That's Not Me": Not a bad song.  Mike Love does a good job on vocals here and Glen Campbell contributes 12 string guitar."Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)":  A gentle song highlighted by gentle vocals by Brian.  Even the use of the Tympani is softer here.  Nice string arrangements here."I'm Waiting for the Day":  This sounds like a cross between psychedelic and Hawaiian sounds.  The Tympanis and Bongos sound great here, but also Ukulele, Flute, and English Horns sound good as well - all will really give this a terrific sound"Lets Go Away": I never thought of the Beach Boys as an instrumental group, but "Pet Sounds" gives us two instrumentals.  This one has a nice soft classical music feel to it."Sloop John B": Here Brian rearranges a cover of this traditional song.  There is a bit of Doo-Wop in here.  The Baritone Saxophone is used well here.  Brian and Mike do a great job sharing lead vocals."God Only Knows": Paul McCartney still calls this one of the greatest songs he ever heard - and with good reason.  This song is perfection.  Carl Wilson gets the nod to lead the vocals here and doesn't let anyone down.  The French Horns, Baritone Sax, Clarinet, and String Ensemble really help as well.  This song is lyrically very strong and probably the best song done by the Beach Boys."I Know There's An Answer":  Mike and Alan Jardine share vocals here.  Some more strong lyrics.  More of a Doo Wop sound and more terrific Baritone Sax work."Here Today":  Great horn arrangements highlight this song - especially the Baritone Sax"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times": Lots of interesting percussion sounds on here.  The Tympani and Baritone Sax stand out here again."Pet Sounds": The title track and another instrumental.  Wilson admits to this having a James Bond psychedelic sound.  More Baritone Sax and Percussions"Caroline Ho":  The train sound and the sounds of Brian's dogs barking at the end of this song are most remembered.  There is some nice Ukulele on this song.  Brian does a great job on the lead vocals, but great harmonies by the Beach Boys."Hang On To Your Ego": This is the bonus track.  Baritone Sax is the highlight here again.  However, Brian's vocals might be the strongest of any track on this album.The liner notes are incredible.  You get a short "letter" from Brian Wilson about his perspectives on "Pet Sounds".  David Leaf has a two terrific write-ups - one is more of a biographical point of view of "Pet Sounds" while the other talks about the making of the "Pet Sounds" album.  There are track by track notes that include commentary by Brian.  You also get a Sessionography of all of the participating musicians in "Pet Sounds".  "Pet Sounds" might not be the best selling album in history, but it most certainly merits its place in music history.  Highly recommended.
With Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys (or rather, Brian Wilson with the rest of the Beach Boys in tow) pulled off one hell of a feat: the album is a pop masterpiece, a collection of little ditties that command the emotional impact and inherent grandeur of symphonies. The songs aren't performances so much as they are works of architecture, a series of sound constructions that are executed with an uncanny amount of artistic finesse. The album makes use of densely layered instrumentation, incorporating an endless array of horns, strings, keyboards, guitars, and percussion to create a set of lush, colorful soundscapes.  The thing is, the music never sounds pretentious or forced; In the hands of Wilson and his endless army of session musicians, these gorgeous musings sound like the natural outcome of songs like "California Girls" or "In My Room." It's either genius or something very close to it.And really, there isn't a bad song in the whole bunch: "Wouldn't It Be Nice" is an absolutely glorious album opener, a sun-splashed rush of passion and yearning. Brian's (and Mike Love's) vocals are stunning in their emotional directness. "God Only Knows" is quieter, but no less poignant- its dizzying swirls of percussion and dreamy vocal harmonies are just plain hypnotic. "Sloop John B" (a cover of a classic folk song) has some great harmonies and an infectious melody. "Let's Go Away For Awhile" and the title track are a couple of dizzyingly complex instrumentals that are among the dreamiest and most evocative works on the album. "You Still Believe In Me" is a stately, dreamy piece of chamber pop, while "I'm Waiting For The Day" is a wonderfully optimistic ballad. "That's Not Me," "I Know There's An Answer," and "I Just Wasn't Made For These Times" are fantastic evocations of youthful alienation and angst, while "Here Today" and "Caroline No" are equally effective portraits of lost innocence and love gone sour. There's also "Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)," one of the most achingly beautiful ballads ever created. The chorus will make your heart melt.So...yeah. Good stuff. Pick it up.
"Pet Sounds" is one of those albums that occasionally is released that has a Jekyll/Hyde existence. Many people either hated it or didn't understand it, while those who saw the evolution of rock into art realized that this album was helping direct that evolution. As always in everything from movies to books, the difference between art and entertainment became a huge factor in the album's initial commercial lack of success.There was nothing like "Pet Sounds" when it came out. Furthermore, the music was very different from what The Beach Boys had done previously. A recipe for commercial disaster. Long time fans of "Barbara Ann" and "Surfing U.S.A." wondered what these songs were all about. This stuff just wasn't The Beach Boys they knew. Little did most fans know that The Beach Boys they knew never were The Beach Boys they thought they knew.It wasn't until many years later that the complex relationships and creative conflicts between the members of the group were brought to light, and the discovery that Brian Wilson in particular wanted the group to grow in a more mature direction. "Pet Sounds" was a very long step in that direction.We look back on "Pet Sounds" from our next millenium perspective and want to say, "What's the big deal?" It was a very big deal in 1966. "Pet Sounds" and "Sgt. Pepper" sparked a whole new revolution in rock music the effect of which can never be fully understood or estimated. These albums were the sound of rock music growing up. However, "Pet Sounds" was too alien for the typical public taste at the time, and it flopped.But, other musicians loved it; particularly The Beatles. John and Paul recognized the roots of something great, and were strongly influenced by it. Many other rock and pop musicians have pointed to "Pet Sounds" as being a big influence on their music. "Pet Sounds" was music as art. "Sgt. Pepper," while also striving for art, also managed to be commercially successful. However, there are songs from "Sgt. Pepper" which followed well the artistic path of "Pet Sounds" that had their own detractors. Unfortunately not everyone understands art.Listening today, "Pet Sounds" is somewhat dated. However, listen to it over and over, and you realize that the music is well done. From our perspective we can look back over 25+ years of rock music and realize that "Pet Sounds" was ahead of its time. In all the hysteria of The Beatles, "Pet Sounds" got lost."Pet Sounds" is great rock because of what it was when it was released, and who it influenced.Beyond the influence, there are some really great songs on this CD. "Sloop John B." is one of my favorite Beach Boys songs. "Wouldn't It Be Nice," "That's Not Me," "I Know There's an Answer," "God Only Knows," "Caroline No"...all very good to great songs. Admittedly somewhat mellow, but beautiful.Should you buy this album? Well, depends on what you like. "Pet Sounds" refuses to fit into a nice niche. It's not like what The Beach Boys did before it. It is mellow, but it's not a perfect fit into pop music. If you've heard at least 3 or 4 of the songs above, and like them, then you'll like the rest of the CD. If you haven't heard very much of the CD, then either download samples or borrow a copy. I, on the other hand, may need to purchase another copy, because I think the laser diode is knocking too many molecules off my copy, I play it so much.Note that this album has been reissued and remastered and thus this particular version is now the "old" version.  You may want to see what features are available and the price of other versions before you buy.  Good luck!
Your illustrious Seer is at the beach now. The warm sun and ocean breeze are invigorating. The white seagulls circle overhead (watch out!), and I have been busy all afternoon trying to build a summer sand castle for myself meanwhile sweating to death in this Seer's cape. They said the fabric breathed and would be good in all temperatures. They lied. And, aside from all that, just when I get the sand castle to a stately form, some freckle-faced, red-headed bratty boy comes around and knocks it down. I threatened to report him to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Seers, however, an ice cream cone made him go away. Dealing with Guido has made me very adept in any situation. Now if only the tides would stop being a threat. Ah well..........Anyway, I am in the perfect setting to examine the rewards of "Pet Sounds" by the Beach Boys. Much has been written about this seminal album. And why not? It consistently ranks in the top 10 pop-rock albums of all time. And rightly so if you ask me.Of course, it wasn't greeted ethusiastically when it came out. At least not as much as their prior hits. Brian Wilson took the hit most of all. Probably unjustly. But time has proven that it was the right move and the right time. To most, perhaps a little early and maybe they would say the wrong time. But I would have to disagree with that. Brian was ahead of everything on the scene at that time. He saw that the music was changing. Plus, artistically, you can not stay in the same place. Artistry needs real growth. Meanwhile, the other Beach Boys needed more hits- and this is why the chasm happened.But, lets get into this a little more. The Beach Boys were (and still are) the ultimate summer group. Songs about California Girls, fast cars, high school life, requited love, and teen angst, angst, angst.  These songs were incredibly successful. But Brian knew that, as he got older, his audience were also doing the same thing. He wanted to try a new direction and add some sophistication. Looking back to 1966, this album is a monumental achievement- and remains so until this day. Sure, some may downplay the importance of this recording, however, that cannot eliminate the fact that it was a monumental change that influenced the musical landscape at that time forever. It is essential, and one of the very best.But, getting to the main point. Brian Wilson was moving towards greater musical compostion and more adult and inner emotions on record. This was a mega step- and quite a risk at the same time. Most of the music is lush, well thought out, and instruments used precisely to get the right nuances that bounced around in his mind. Certainly the songs are confessional, i.e; "You Still Believe in Me", emotional, i.e, "That's Not Me", "I'm Waiting for the Day", and quiet, heartfelt romance, i.e; "Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)".  One must, of course, listen to all the colours and passages in this music. All these songs have a way of revealing certain moods that marry the music perfectly. Beautiful lilting breaks, shifting meter, an array of musical instruments heretofore never thought of in the pop-rock genre. Excellent.And songs? We are treated to different, but essential, gratuitous hits with "Wouldn't It Be Nice" and "Sloop John B". But more than this, Brian gives us 2 more considerable high standard gems. Yes. We get to "God Only Knows" which I nominate as the most beautiful song ever written in the course of popular music. Grandiose, glorious- I am fairly convinced that a higher power is somehow behind this remarkable song. Sweet, yearning, beautiful beyond compare. Angelic vocals as well. If anyone doubts Brian Wilson's genius, have them look to this song. Absolutely the highest gem. Then we get to the wispful "Caroline No". Brian reflects upon how time can change a relationship. He looks back to a time when his love was new and exciting and wonders why she changed. "Where is the girl I used to know"? He hurts badly from the change and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship, knowing full well that it has changed forever. Listen to the end. A train in the distance, approaching at a rapid pace, getting louder, and then quickly passing by. A dog barks in the distance-urging its return. But it gone and then silence. What an incredible conveyence of mood this is for the ending. Superb.In a way, the outtake of "I know There's an Answer" entitled "Hold On to Your Ego" to me, conveys the frustration Brian was going through in order to have the other members of the group in compliance with his new direction. But he knows he's alone and he knows that he's "going to lose the fight". Well, he may have lost it to them- however- he won the classic album. And we are all so much better that he did.Now, I must go and make sure that kid isn't planning some new attack on my new home. I don't want to lose the fight anymore than Brian does.In conclusion- a classic and a must have in any considerable music collection.Goats say "feed me", Seers say "read me". -- yours, Metamorpho
When I was 21 or 22, one of my coworkers dropped a copy of Pet Sounds on my desk and said, "listen to it, it'll change your life".  Well, like anyone that age, I assumed he'd be wrong, but one late night years later, I did listen to it.So anyway, he was right, it changed the way I thought about music, at a minimum.  Since then, you might say my obsession with the Beach Boys is complete.The album--  13 tracks of just incredible, lush, essential music.  Much of it is Brian singing lead, and he does so magnificantly, in either a tenor range or falsetto, depending on the piece.  Where there's harmonies, they're sometimes drier than the previous stuff, sometimes as lush and well arranged, and sometimes there's none.As far as the songs go, there's not a bad one-- highlights change for me over time, right now "You Still Believe in Me", "Don't Talk", and "God Only Knows" are my favorites, but this changes over time.  They're all quite brilliant though-- every time I listen to the album, I'm amazed how good it is, from the fragile lead vocal in "Caroline, No", the brilliant, layered tag on "God Only Knows", the mighty chorus of "Sloop John B", there's really not enough room in any one review to say what there is to say about this.This is an album about growing up, about seeking adulthood, it leaves behind the childish themes of the older Beach Boys material that has maligned their reputation for a more mature viewpoint.  If you have a view of the Beach Boys and have not heard this, like I did before I heard it, you're missing out if you don't give this a chance.  I come from a jazz/progressive rock/avant-garde background, and while I had my own impressions of the Beach Boys, I learned how wrong I was.Essential, if you don't own this, you should.  This may be the best pop album ever written.
As a reviewer I try to be rather conservative in my opinions to better aid the people considering buying said product, but I think easily PET SOUNDS is the most deserving five star rating I've handed out, ever.  Exaggerations and hyperbolas are the standard in Amazon reviews, but everything I say about this release is both an accurate description and a heartfelt love.Originally a response to The Beatles' RUBBER SOUL, not only does PET SOUNDS proves Brian Wilson head and shoulders above even The Beatles (if only for one album), he quite beautifully  demonstrates what can be achieved by the human spirit.  Musically ceaselessly inventive, with layers and layers of all sorts of instruments and even a dog and a train.  However, music itself does not support the hype I've said about the album.Here's what does: Brian Wilson's collaboration with Tony Asher, who wrote most of the lyrics for the album.  Asher easily proves himself an incredible lyricist and the best collaborator for Wilson's vision.  What makes PET SOUNDS so great is all the songs add to a cohesion of both emotion, spirituality, and searching for the answer that The Beatles never captured (and maintained) throughout an entire album, and only distantly felt (compared to this; in their own right, both albums I am about to cite are intense) in Radiohead's OK COMPUTER and Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.This is the genius of PET SOUNDS.  It captures a stage in which we evolve the most: youth.  Not only does it capture it, PET SOUNDS recreates this stage and makes it wonderfully relevant to our own lives, no matter how far from youth one is.  Brian Wilson and Tony Asher chart a young man's voyage through his youth.  In only 35 minutes, this musical journey becomes both real and tangible, becoming almost like a novel in its characters' complexity.  While it can be argued that this is only a collection of songs, that strips away much of the beauty and incredible vision that it took to make this album.Listening to PET SOUNDS is like watching your life unfold: going through romantic idealisation to crushing heartbreak, searching for God and your relation to Him, and a struggle to establish who you are and what you stand for.While the dominant motif is romance, you can take this as an allegory or analogy for anything a person truly loves and the trials and tribulations one will encounter in a pursuing this love.  This facet is also what makes PET SOUNDS so accomplished and beautiful: it captures the pain of love, whatever that love is, whether it be in romance, which PET SOUNDS chose as its dominant landscape, or any other true love which is accessible to humanity.Every teenager should discover the truths on this album, for it will greatly aid him/her in their own love lives.  PET SOUNDS, because of the ascetic environment in which it responded too (music largely simple with all these impossible romantic dreams, ala &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand,&quot; etc), much of PET SOUNDS deals with romantic turmoil.  The opening track, &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&quot; shows the young man in a very simple, wholly naive belief about love and relations to the opposite sex.  Then Wilson and Asher gives us a study of this young man journeying from idealisation to crushing lost.  The unnamed &quot;I&quot; becomes so real by the end of PET SOUNDS that, listening to the album in its entirety, &quot;Caroline No&quot; is so painfully intense after watching him struggle through so many things in his own life.  Because of the incredible buildup, this is the single most powerful ending to any work of art, let alone music, that I have experienced.When I said &quot;study&quot;, one may think of a dry, academic approach that only deadens what you really have an interest in and truly love.  Have no fear.  When you listen to this, you are constantly connecting to this person (or persons, even) that PET SOUNDS deals with (the unnamed &quot;I&quot;).  Anyone who will truly allow themselves to be open to this will find much of their own probing of life here, and generally one cannot help but connect and identify with the young man in his quest for identity and a solution to life's ever-appearing questions.Before I end this review, to clear up my own viewpoint of Beatles records in relation to this, the three mid-period albums (RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER, and SGT. PEPPER), are some of the best albums ever made but simply cannot answer to PET SOUNDS, The Beach Boys only truly significant album.  RUBBER SOUL is brilliant but does not add up to any cohesiave whole as this does.  Wilson wanted to outdo The Beatles after hearing RUBBER SOUL, and in my opinion he did.  REVOLVER, one of rock's most celebrated LPs, again lacks the cohesion to that is required to top PET SOUNDS.  SGT. PEPPER, which, after Wilson heard it, felt crushed and defeated and left one of rock's most enduring &quot;What If?'s&quot; by abandoning SMILE, the follow up to PET SOUNDS which was never finished, let alone released.  While historically the most important LP we have, SGT. PEPPER is more an exercise in band psychology to truly stretch across and become the achievement PET SOUNDS is.  Paul McCartney allowed himself the luxury of pretending to be in Sgt. Pepper's band, and the only importance the &quot;concept&quot; of PEPPER had was freeing McCartney up and getting the band away from their bubble-gum identity.  While it has a tremendous closing, there is no magnificent buildup to what is an already powerful conclusion.I consider PET SOUNDS, the one piece of art from music, that should enter the classical canon of twentieth century art.  Its importance and relevance to humanity cannot be overstated, and is one of art's best epiphanies and expression of human pain, searching, faith, and endurance.AS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS POSSIBLE!!!
Most, and most likely all, of the people who don't like The Beach Boys' classic,Pet Sounds(1966), just don't like The Beach Boys. If you don't like the beach, you're not gonna like surfing.Pet Soundsis actually quite a remarkable piece of of work. Introspective and deeply personal, the songs are about life, love and yearning, not surfing and hot rodding on the strip. The album is a symphony of sophisticated chord changes, wistful melodies, sweet vocal harmonies, and reflective lyrics of love and longing. The true genius of Brian Wilson realized.The classic Beach Boys sound isn't completely lost here, and it's especially highlighted in the album's first song, Wouldn't It Be Nice and in the sailor's boisterous lament, Sloop John B, but mostly the atmosphere onPet Soundsisn't the usual fun day at the beach. It's quiet, thoughtful and lonely.Sometimes I feel so very sadAnd I guess I just wasn't made for these timesConsidering this was released in 1966, it's an amazing accomplishment. Sir Paul McCartney praised the album by saying, "No one is educated musically until they've heard Pet Sounds...It is a total, classic record that is unbeatable in many ways."There is another dimension toPet Soundsthat's evident to people who were around in 1966 and remember listening to the album when it was first released. The loss of innocence. The world was changing fast in the 1960s, and The Beach Boys represented good, clean and carefree fun to a lot of people. The melancholy spirit of many of the songs onPet Soundsseemed to be sadly saying goodbye to the endless summer of innocence in America. And in many ways, it actually did.Could I ever find in you againThings that made me love you so much then?Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone?Oh, Caroline no
Realesed in 1966 Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys is loved by critics and well anyone who likes the Beach Boys. Pet Sounds is one of those albums that are just not able to created ever again. By this time Brian Wilson who had suffered a nervous breakdown while on tour with The Beach Boys now remains in the studio writing and recording new material. Pet Sounds shows the bands growth from there humble beginnings to more complex songs and much more greater album compared too there earlier ones... Highly influentail album that has even influenced the Sgt. Peppers. Such classics as, "Sloop John B", and "God Only Knows", remain classic songs too this day. Albums like this come around once in a lifetime. Pet Sounds is a pop, rock, and psychedelic album and explored Brian Wilson's exploration of the drug LSD. So what are you wating for the only Beach Boys album you will ever need buy Pet Sounds todayYou wont be dissapointed
Pet Sounds is one of those albums (like Sgt. Peppers, Born To Run or Exile On Main St.) that have been reviewed and analyzed to death.  But the reason why it has garnered so much critical attention is that it truly one of the most original and groundbreaking albums in rock history.  Brian Wilson had spent the previous few years writing and producing magnificent singles, but had yet made a truly great album.  Spurred on by The Beatles' Rubber Soul and his idol, Phil Spector, Mr. Wilson set about to make an album that raised the bar on what could be achieved on a pop album.  He succeeded on every level.  Pet Sounds is one of the most literate, intricate and lavishly produced albums ever released.  The other band members were limited to just providing vocals on the album as Mr. Wilson employed studio musicians to provide the music.  Despite this fact, the band never sounded better as they provide the luscious harmonies that make the songs practically float out of your speakers.  The songs were no longer about surfing and cars, but about more mature relationships and growing up.  &quot;Wouldn't Be Nice&quot; is a beautiful song about wanting to get married that hit number 8 on the charts, &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; is an airy number about a woman standing by her man, &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&quot; is another gorgeous melody and &quot;Sloop John B&quot; is a traditional song that was the album's biggest hit peaking at number 2.  &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; is another brilliant introspective number from Brian Wilson and &quot;Caroline No&quot; is a beautiful ballad that closes the original album out and was actually released as solo recording by Mr. Wilson.  &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is perhaps the most heartbreakingly beautiful song the band has ever recorded and is the essence of the album.  Carl Wilson gives his hands down best lead vocal and the song is a virtual symphony.  Pet Sounds was not a big hit in the US, peaking at number 10, as Americans wanted songs about sun and fun in the sun.  But in England, the album was a huge success peaking at number 2 and blew the minds of the British musicians.  One in particular, Paul McCartney called it the greatest album ever made and it was The Beatles' inspiration for recording Sgt. Pepper's.  Brian Wilson tried to top Pet Sounds with Smile, but that album was never to be.  Pet Sounds stands as The Beach Boys greatest album and one the best of all time.
Many will debate whether or not PET SOUNDS is the absolute greatest album of the rock era, but just about everyone agrees that it is certainly at least worthy of consideration.  If this album were produced today in 2004, we would marvel at the sonic quality, the production magic, the textural intricacy, and the instrumental details.  That it was done in 1966 is mind-boggling.  With PET SOUNDS, Brian Wilson's name was forever etched in the pantheon of great composers; and like fine wine, this album just seems to get better with age.  The lyrics combine wide-eyed innocence with a knowing pathos that makes each song quite moving.  The melodies are achingly gorgeous and the harmonies are positively celestial.  Wilson's choice of instrumentation is as bold as it is broad; chimes and sleigh bells and woodwinds and brass and strings augment the traditional bass-drum-guitar-keyboard sound, giving PET SOUNDS a lushness that has seldom, if ever, been matched.  "Wouldn't it be Nice" is a joyous romp that launches PET SOUNDS on a very high, longing note.  Dazzling harmonies highlight the ballad "You Still Believe in Me" before the band swings into the highly personal, uptempo "That's Not Me."  Brian Wilson's romantic "Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)" is amazingly intimate, and then the mood shifts once more for a romp with "I'm Waiting for the Day."  The jazzy instrumental "Let's Go Away for Awhile" leads into one of the Beach Boys' most beloved story songs, "Sloop John B," a folky, jaunty-sounding song that tells a very sad and disturbing tale. If PET SOUNDS is arguably the best album of the past 50 years, then "God Only Knows" is arguably the best song.  Take a stunningly beautiful melody, overlay it with instantly relatable and honest lyrics and a bracingly innocent vocal performance filled with longing and the sweet pain that only love can bring...and then wrap it in some of the lushest arranging and instrumentation ever heard on record...and you have a song that is an enduring and beloved classic.  Confession and hope imbue the next track, "I Know There's An Answer" with a positive, refreshing sense of survival...made all the more poignant now knowing Brian's state of mind when he was working on PET SOUNDS and the subsequent SMILE.  The tempo picks up again for "Here Today," before cooling back down again for the heartbreaking "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times," a song destined to be Brian Wilson's epitaph.  The title track is a cool, exotic instrumental that sounds like a surf tune arranged and orchestrated by Nelson Riddle.  With "Caroline, No" Brian Wilson takes a very simple line, "Where did your long hair go?" and spins it into a metaphor for lost innocence in life, in relationships, and indeed, for an entire generation.  One finds themselves overusing the word "poignant" to describe songs on PET SOUNDS but is certainly is an apt word...especially for "Caroline, No".  The bonus track, "Hang On to Your Ego," is an alternate take for "I Know There's An Answer," and it is enlightening when juxtaposed with the final version.  Because of it's cohesiveness musically and thematically, PET SOUNDS is one of those few CDs that virtually demands to be listened to, uninterrupted, from start to finish every time.  Give it a spin and let it grow on you...I used to love PET SOUNDS, but now, I consider it an absolutely indespensible part of my CD collection.  I seldom go anywhere without it.
Pet Sounds is an album that is totally beyond comparison. To call it the best pop album ever is an understatement, and also a little misleading. This music is beyond categorization as &quot;pop&quot;-- it's simply brilliant, idiosyncratic MUSIC. That being said, there is nothing in the history of recorded music that even touches the sheer genius of this record. Every microsecond of sound is so carefully considered and perfectly arranged that the result is the most emotionally touching collection of songs you'll ever hear. It is impossible to overrate Pet Sounds. It is unlike anything that came before or after. Nothing in the Beatles' over-hyped catalog even comes close-- and anything that might be in the same general proximity is rightly credited more to George Martin's production than the &quot;Fab Four&quot;. Remember, Pet Sounds is the work of one singular musical imagination-- Brian uses the Boys as &quot;instruments&quot;-- composed, arranged, produced/assembled, dreamed as a coherent whole.This album should be heard by EVERYONE, whatever you believe your musical to be. It is one of the great works of Western Civilization for us to study, consider and enjoy. Beyond essential.This version offers the original Mono mix as well as a new Stereo mix. Obviously,it should be heard in the original Mono to be fully appreciated, but I'll be the first to admit the Stereo is REALLY good, offering a sense of spaciousness and natural sound that is hard to criticize. It's not a substitute for the original, but a great addendum. Honestly, the best version is the DCC &quot;gold&quot; disc which is mastered with such attention to detail that it has an almost intangible like-like quality not even present on the original LP. But, I own about 7 different copies and versions of this album on various format, and this &quot;two-fer&quot; offeres excellent sound an value.
This time in 2 different mixes. Authentitcity in the mono version, and a stereo version for Hi-Fi freaks. I'm over the moon about this one
...pop albums going back or forward in time. Let's face it,there is more to good songs and music than youth-oriented rock. I was in 8th grade when this album came out,and always liked it alot,and the funny thing is not until maybe 30 years later, did I ever meet anyone who liked it much . But I've always been a big BBoys fan. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is among the finest compositions ever, and, along with a handful of Brian's songs,deserves inclusion in the 20th Century canon, along with Gershwin's and Kern's best,etc. I heard a beautiful recording of this by a Canadian children's choir,which sounds better than the BBoys.Beyond this, most the tunes seem to be about late adolescent angst,high production value or not. As one gets into the Middle Years of life, can anyone really praise &quot;Wouldn't it be Nice&quot;, or &quot;Caroline No&quot; to the Sky? They remind me of whining choir boys,stretching to hit a note. Yes, Brian was looking for a new sound at the time,but on this record there is almost none of the fun and whimsy so obvious in their earlier work. It's true they were still very young (mid- 20's probably) when they did PET SOUNDS..The songs with Mike singing the lead come off better, like &quot;I Know there's an Answer&quot;, &quot;Here Today&quot;, and &quot;I'm Waiting for the Day&quot;, with the high pitched Wilson brothers doing the backgrounds. Along with their own SURFS UP, this is among the great late 60's, early 70's  pop/rock albums. Yes, it's up there with the best of the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel,and the Byrds. But's let's not go overly gaga on it! Brian another Mozart or Handel?? Come on,let's not overdo a good thing!
One thing was always clear when one discussed the most popular artists or bands from the 1960's, The Beach Boys were near the top of each and every list and at one time in the 1960's were voted the most popular band.  Sultry vocals and harmonies, great songwriting about things that most people, in the U.S. in particular, could understand and relate to, being on the beach, cars and girls.  However, Brian began to want to explore more in music and draw on the rich and outstanding wellspring of musical genius he had within him.  This began to eat him up inside as the record label and those within his own band, Mike Love in particular, couldn't nor wouldn't allow themselves to understand.  I've heard many reasons for his nervous breakdowns but I believe this to be the catalyst.This was a man who was hearing wonderful musical themes in his head and was not being allowed the time, space and creative freedom to explore and bring these themes into fruition.  On top of that, the "British Invasion" was in full swing and those artists and bands were bringing a fresh perspective on music, both it's recording and production, to the world as well as the "Motown Sound" topping the charts with one great artist after another.  Fate typically does things when least expected and fate saw an exhausted Wilson being home recuperating from his breakdown at just the time the "Rubber Soul" album was being released by the Beatles.  It would be the album that helped to validate the direction Wilson was feeling his music and that of The Beach Boys should be going.He found his creative "second wind" and with the help of friend and lyricist Tony Asher, he begin to compose, write, produce and record the songs that would become "Pet Sounds."  It was truly an ambitious project and one that would change the face of not just rock music but music in general forever.  When his fellow band mates returned off of the remainder of the tour Brian had left, he had basically the entire project completed except for the vocals.  Once the other members, along with Brian, laid down their gorgeous vocals which, as usual, were one of the many strengths of the album, they had completed a true game changer and neither they nor the music world would be the same.  This album would inspire a whole host of artists to change their entire perspective on how songs should be both written and recorded.Paul McCartney took a copy to John Lennon and they listened to it over and over again until it became engrained in their thought processes.  George Martin, their brilliant producer, also was listening to the album and it was now the catalyst for what would become "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."  Funny how fate and destiny work, isn't it?  Bravo to you Mr. Brian Wilson, I recently listened to this album from beginning to end and marveled at what was produced.  You and Mr. Asher created a masterpiece that truly changed the music world and more importantly, validated your true genius.P.S. Here's what others were saying about the album and Brian Wilson:Eric Clapton stated that "All of us, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce and I consider Pet Sounds to be one of the greatest pop LPs to ever be released. It encompasses everything that's ever knocked me out and rolled it all into one."Elton John has said of the album, "For me to say that I was enthralled would be an understatement. I had never heard such magical sounds, so amazingly recorded. It undoubtedly changed the way that I, and countless others, approached recording. It is a timeless and amazing recording of incredible genius and beauty."Beatles producer George Martin stated that "Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper wouldn't have happened... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds."Paul McCartney has said "It was Pet Sounds that blew me out of the water. I love the album so much. I've just bought my kids each a copy of it for their education in life. I figure no one is educated musically 'til they've heard that album. I love the orchestra, the arrangements. It may be going overboard to say it's the classic of the century, but to me, it certainly is a total, classic record that is unbeatable in many ways. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried.  I played it to John [Lennon] so much that it would be difficult for him to escape the influence, it was the record of the time.  The thing that really made me sit up and take notice was the bass lines and also, putting melodies in the bass line.  That I think was probably the big influence that set me thinking when we recorded Pepper, it set me off on a period I had then for a couple of years of nearly always writing quite melodic bass lines.  "God Only Knows" is a big favourite of mine, very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one. On "You Still Believe in Me", I love that melody - that kills me. That's my favourite, I think, it's so beautiful right at the end comes surging back in these multi-coloured harmonies, sends shivers up my spine."Bob Dylan has said of Brian Wilson's talents, "That ear - I mean, Jesus, he's got to will that to the Smithsonian."Roger Waters stated that along with Sgt Pepper, Pet Sounds "completely changed everything about records for me."Elvis Costello stated "Last summer, I heard "Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)" played on the cello. It sounded beautiful and sad, just as it does on Pet Sounds."Pete Townshend stated "'God Only Knows' is simple and elegant and was stunning when it first appeared; it still sounds perfect".Tom Petty stated "I think I would put him up there with any composer - especially Pet Sounds. I don't think there is anything better than that, necessarily. I don't think you'd be out of line comparing him to Beethoven - to any composer."
What it is there to say about this album. It is without doubt one of the greatest albums of the popular music era. However until recently I didn't know the album that well, and so I've put it on my Ipod so that I'd hear it a little more frequently. With the Ipod in shuffle mode occasionally a brilliant track would come on that I didn't know (didn't even know it was The Beach Boys believe it or not), and I'd rush over to the Ipod to find out what the track was, only to find it was from Pet Sounds.So what makes it so good. Well for me its the combination of the beautiful sounds that Brian Wilson produced for the album, combined with his brilliant songwriting. Perhaps its best summed up by 'God Only Knows', which is such an exquistely crafted song, with trademark Beach Boys harmonies and that achingly beautiful melody. However the marvellous 'Here Today' pushes it close as the best track on the album.It really shouldn't matter what sort of music you like, this album should be in your collection.
There is nothing that I can say about this album that hasn't already been said.. But I would like to express my profound moment of discovery when I first listened to it.. I had the preconception that the Beach boys were just a bunch of dumb surfers.. My musical tastes leaned towards jazz, classical, and more progressive rock.. But I kept on seeing this album on lists of the greatest albums of all time so.. I gave it a try. I wasn't prepared for the beauty of this perfect musical mixture of sounds and moods.. It was clearly a very personal record that expressed many feelings I had at the time.. the production is brilliant.. being a big fan of the beatles I immediately heard simmilarities between George Martinand Sgnt Pepper and how they must have been influenced by this record.. This is not surfer music - it is much more..
In 1966, when it was released, this album didn't sell as well as previous Beach Boys albums.  I don't know why.  I thought it was fantastic.  Now it's regarded as a critical success!  Well, I guess better late than never.  The subject matter is mostly boy-girl relationships - "Sloop John B" is a notable exception - with a little venturing into the territory of introspection.  But the music!  The melodies and instrumentation rival the music of The Beatles' "Rubber Soul" in variety and inventiveness; and like those songs, these manage to display that genius in the standard (then) 3-minute track.  "God Only Knows" is one of the most beautiful ballads I have ever heard, and I'm not saying that because of the religious reference, because I am an agnostic.  "Wouldn't It Be Nice" sounds like a more typical Beach Boys record, but the lyrical content was daring enough to get it banned on some radio stations.  "Caroline No" is gorgeous, the lyrics and the music.  This CD gives it all to you in both mono and stereo.  Mono may be OK for sentimental reasons, but I recommend the stereo (Tracks 15-27) for sheer pleasure.  Too bad that Brian Wilson suffered a mental decline after this album.  Who knows what he might have produced?
OK, I have read several reviews here giving this masterpiece a two and three star rating and for the reason being that it "is not the greatest album ever." So, if the album does not qualify as greatest ever it gets a **? Wow, that is going to leave a couple million records with * out there. Well, In my humble opinion, this is arguably the greatest album ever. And guess what, this is the only Beach Boys album I own. So don't go calling me some Beach Boy fanatic. But I can respect genius, especially genius that is as far ahead of it's time as this album. Every song is brilliant and in just the right place. I would put it in the category of Led Zeppelin IV, Who's Next, and several other classics. You don't think it is the best ever? So be it, but spare me these ** and *** star ratings, that is ridiculous!
By far the best Beach Boys album (and the best Brian Wilson album, along with the recently unearthed treasure "Smile"). The harmonies and lyrics in the songs are perfect, and remain timeless no matter how many times you listen to it or how many years have passed since this masterpeice first hit the shelves. It wasn't a big hit in the States, mostly due to the fact nobody was ready for it. It's such a well-organized and cohesive work, much unlike what people were used to the Beach Boys putting out at the time. They decided to be something more than just a surf band, or a catchy and trendy pop band, something which nobody gave them credit for. Compare "God Only Knows" to "409" or "Surfin' Safari", and you shall understand what I mean. The melodies are perfect, and blend greatly with the vocals. This is a rare album without a single track to be skipped. If you haven't caught on yet, freaking buy this!
Do I recommend it? Of course! I just want to say that being used to the mono mix for so long I wanted to hear it in stereo. But honestly the stereo mix doesn't do anything for me. Naturally this is an important piece of any  music collection.
PLEASE NOTE-THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE NEW AUDIO FIDELITY GOLD VERSION OF "PET SOUNDS" FOR SOME REASON AMAZON IS GROUPING REVIEWS OF THIS ALBUM UNDER ONE HEADING.One of Brian Wilson's masterpieces "Pet Sounds" was his response to the increasingly sopisticated albums by The Beatles. Working with the best session musicians in the business (something Wilson would do while The rest of The Beach Boys were touring), Wilson composed and produced "Pet Sounds" and then invited the band to come in and do the vocals, contribute lyrics as needed, etc.This new Audio Fidelity remaster is the second time that Steve Hoffman has done this popular title. Evidently the original mastertapes are in fragile shape so Hoffman used a first generation copy that was unequalized (the same one he used on the DCC release)to remaster this again. I never had the DCC but I did have the Capital mono master and this edition blows away that version which used noise reduction. The album sounds warm and inviting with nice detail and isn't compressed or too loud. The disc is also HDCD encoded for those with high definition CD players. After the debacle with the reissue of "Heartbeat City", it appears that Audio Fidelity got this one right.The booklet includes Brian Wilson's note on his intent with "Pet Sounds" as well as photos but it doesn't include the extensive booklet that came with the previous Capital editions of the album which is a bit disappointing. I should note though that all the musicians that played on this classic release are credited in the booklet. Other than that this is a terrific reissue and is available for a limited time with each edition numbered on the cardboard sleeve that houses the jewel box.Brian Wilson's classic song cycle has never sounded better to me. Highly recommended.
Just lay back and listen. Brian Wilson never misses a note. His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop. His composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle eight section on &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;)on this album. These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling  both excited and uncertain. Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves, this is a true pop magnum opus. The best tracks are the gorgeous &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder&quot;), the title cut, and the tear inducing &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity, Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that haven't aged a day since 1966. The more you listen to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, the more it's beauty envelopes you.
the perfect introduction to U.S.-filtered bossa nova.  I say 'U.S.' because the sound Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz bring to these classics are considerably smoother and broader than originals which can be often raspy or intensely private, but always richly nuanced.  Getz's playing is masterfully self-effacing, never virtuosic for its own sake: you might forget he's even there as he conducts intimate conversations with Byrd's often Reinhardt-like guitar, or the quietly insistent rhythms, and yet he is the soul of this beach music that sounds so sad.The best tracks are the old Jobim favourites 'Desafinado' and 'One note samba', in which the familiar melodies are taken through the most intricate, yet never alienating, variations, always obeying that hypnotic bossa nova beat.  'E Luxo Se' is a wide-eyed beauty, beaming the kind of melody that makes you instantly happy no matter how miserable you felt before you heard it.  The same could be said for the whole of this marvellous album, perhaps best listened to at night when you're feeling weary, ready to dream...
I first heard this album in the mid-1980s when I was running a used record store in Florida. I didn't know samba from Sambo, and had only a vague idea of who Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd were at the time, but after playing the LP a few times I was hooked. This music was unlike anything else I was listening to at the time (classic rock, alternative rock, vintage soul, etc.) but it really struck a chord. Irresistable and magical tunes, the kind that truly evoked a unique mood and atmosphere. I played the record to death and have done likewise with my old CD copy. This music just never gets "old" or boring. A classic in the truest sense of the word. You don't have to be a jazz fan to enjoy this, just let the music play and let it soak into your consciousness. Laid back and lovely.
This is the album that kicked off the bossa nova craze in the US over 40 years ago.  In the hands of lesser musicians this style could degenerate into lightweight cocktail music, but not here.  Stan Getz's feathery, soft saxophone playing weaves beautiful melodies over the swaying, dancing Brazilian rhythms.  Charlie Byrd's is terrific on the acoustic guitar and the tunes will get stuck in your head after 3 spins or less.  The only possible complaint is the short playing time -- a mere 35 minutes.This recording isn't as well-known as Getz/Gilberto but is just as essential.  If you like Getz's playing, be sure to get some of his other, non-bossa-nova recordings as well.  (One more caveat: those looking for more vocals by Astrud or Joao Gilberto will be disappointed -- this CD is entirely instrumental.)
How do you critique the album that started an era? Forty years later, Jazz Samba is still one of the most relaxing, rhythmically pleasing albums made. All instrumental, with the tenor sax of Stan Getz (the guy John Coltrane professed to admire!) and inspired guitar of Charlie Byrd. The entire album was recorded in one session in the performance hall of a Washington, D.C., church, and it puts legions of studio albums to shame.While Desafinado and Bahia are the best known tracks, the album is a seamless experience and it is difficult to single out certain songs as superior. If Getz is one of the masters of the tenor saxophone, it is also hard to separate his proficiency from the effort as a whole -- it truly comes across as a tight ensemble effort. (For a contrast, Duke Ellington's masterful and equally essential Money Jungle released the same year finds the trio of Ellington, Mingus and Max Roach locked in a musical duel on a couple of tracks.)Favorites? I enjoy Samba de Uma Nota So, but every time I reach for Jazz Samba I alway listen to the entire album. At least once. This and Getz/Gilberto belong in every jazz collection.
Jazz is all about being evocative- the greatest examples of the genre have always been the ones that take the listener to another place, that have expressed emotions and ideas with uncanny accuracy. In essence, the best jazz recordings feel like they're coming from somewhere inside you, born out of your dreams and private thoughts and inner longings. Which, I guess, is why I'm so fond of Jazz Samba. The album's warm, lyrical tone instantly paints a portrait of some sun-splashed and utterly peaeful Brazilian beach, a hidden little paradise by a crystal ocean. But there's more to it than that. Jazz Samba's lush textures and instantly hypnotic imagery are downright theraputic. When you're stressed out, angry, or depressed, this is the ideal record to put on; the hypnotic, shuffling bass line that opens "Desafinado" casts a spell that isn't lifted until Getz's gorgeous, velvety solo at the end of "Bahia." The music radiates so much warmth and joy in the meantime, wiping away just about every single one of your worries and fears. It really is a neat trick. Of course, like any great piece of music, Jazz Samba is much more than music. Getz and Byrd make for a formidable team, bridging the gap between jazz's emotive cool and bossa nova's swinging sensuality with irresisitable finesse. The music is simultaneously dreamy and upbeat, hypnotic and energetic, beautiful and propulsive. Basically, it's a great album, and one that belongs in every jazz collection.
Bossa nova music was created largely by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joo Gilberto in the late 1950s and early 1960s. When Charlie Byrd and his trio heard it, they wanted to make a bossa nova album of their own. The result is this wonderful CD.The CD track set opens with an extended version of "Desafinado." The guitar gets plenty of air time in bossa nova music; and Charlie Byrd's guitar solo stuns me with its beauty and sensitivity. "Desafinado" plays with a few key changes to enhance the quality of the number; and the percussion works very well, too."Samba Dees Days" picks up the tempo considerably; and this ought to brighten any party you play this at! Stan Getz plays tenor sax to perfection; and Buddy Deppenschmidt along with Bill Reichenbach play the drums very, very well. "Samba Triste" is the only truly mournful sounding samba on this album; the minor keys work very well as Stan's melancholy solo enhances the forlorn flavor to "Samba Triste.""Samba De Uma Nota S&oacute; (One Note Samba)" exudes elegance and style; when you listen to this track the fusion of jazz and samba is very evident. "E Luxo S&oacute;" reverts to a faster tempo that really makes you want to get up and dance wherever you are; and "Bahia (Ba&iacute;a)" concludes the album with a silky elegance that is singularly beautiful.There is one extra number. The bonus track is the 45 rpm issue of "Desafinado." Naturally, the shorter version of this number doesn't provide us with the luxurious meanderings of the full length track. Nevertheless, it interests the listener to hear what the band chose to include--and exclude--when, under time constraints, they had to deliver the number fast yet with all the brightness of the full rendition. You won't be disappointed.The liner notes include the original liner notes by Dom Cerulli; and there are great black and white photos of the band members playing. John Litweiler contributes an informative essay about the creation of the album as well. The quality of the sound is excellent.I highly recommend this CD for any fan of bossa nova music; and people who enjoy jazz with a samba twist will cherish this one for ages to come.
This is an amazing jazz album. You got Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz together, making the first bossa nova jazz record in the U.S. It got a Grammy, it made thousands of listeners transport themselves to a calm South American beach. To top it off, the lead drummer, Buddy Deppenschmidt, is my own drum teacher. How boss is that?Awesome jazz with a twist. All instrumental. My greatest discovery out of Brazil since Sepultura.Pop it in and chill...
With Bossa Nova already achieving worldwide popularity by the 1960's, the Latin jazzsubgenre from Brazil then took another international step when Stan Getz and CharlieByrd made there U.S. State Department to South America in 1961 when they set outto discover the Bossa Nova.  After the return, the Bossa Nova had reached the UnitedStates, as it resulted into the making of Jazz Samba, the highly praised landmark duetalbum that topped the jazz and pop charts as introduce the subgenre to the Americanpublic when it first came out in 1962.  Featuring a set of timeless compositions pennedby Antonio Carlos Jobim and Ary Barraso, the first rate track set features a solid recordof songs that begins with the chart-topping smash hit Desfinado, which procede withBarraso's Bahia, Jobim's Samba De Uma Nota So (One Note Samba), O Pato (The Duck),Samba Triste and E Luxo So.  Showcased with harmonic structures and it's beautifully-crafted tone, Jazz Samba is a landmark masterpiece that will provide you with a superbsimultaneously warm full tone and a cool control of dynamics.  Thanks to the chemistryof Getz, Byrd, Jobim and Barraso, their truly melodic inventiveness, romanticism, andeven the undercurrent of melancholy inherent in the music makes a revelatory classicthat will certainly remain as timeless as ever.
Jazz samba the collaborative album of Stan getz and Charlie Byrd is one of the most beautiful and relaxing albums I own. From the opening track Destafino on throught to the final track Baia listening to JS is like being on the beach and watching the sun set. The Byrd getz combination is flawless the two artists compliment each other extremely well making this album a effortless listen, again and again.  If you are new to samba music this is where to begin.
I can't believe I slept on this record up until a week ago. The only other BDP record I had before this one was 1987's "Criminal Minded," which is one of the most brilliant, and groundbreaking albums ever made. But I'm beginning to think that KRS-One's sophomore effort "By All Means Necessary" is just as influential. The murder of DJ Scott La Rock had a profound effect on KRS-One, which is very apparent in his engrossing lyrical flow. This record feels more personal, and much more concise. And in the eyes of many critics, including myself, this is KRS-One's finest moment.Until now, I never knew that I've heard KRS-One's vocals sampled on so many other hip-hop albums I own. Not only samples, but covered choruses, signature time flows, and of course, the beats. Every emcee has been vastly influenced by KRS-One; underground and mainstream. Check out the first song, "My Philosophy". If you're an avid hip-hop listener, you've probably heard these lines sampled many times, "Right up to your face and diss you" or "It's not about a salary, it's all about reality". Check out that cut-up Deep Purple riff ("Smoke On The Water") on "Ya Slippin", along with the familiar sample "Bring it back that old New York rap". I was also shocked by the chorus on "Stop The Violence" - "1,2,3, The crew is called BDP, and if you want to go to the tip-top, stop the violence in hip-hop, wyahhhh", or the how about the cover of that chorus by Mos Def & Talib Kweli (Black Star) - "1,2,3, Mos Def & Talib Kweli, we came to rock it on to the tip-top, best alliance in hip-hop, wyahhhh". The "Teacher" is also in full effect on songs like "Illegal Business". The often sampled "I'm Still No. 1" is also one of my favorites (It's hard to deny that he's the best). I also enjoyed "Jimmy" quite a bit, where we here a reference to one of my personal favorite Jungle Brothers tunes, "Jimbrowski".All in all, I'm ashamed that I referred to myself as a hip-hop fan before I got a hold of this record. It's so good it's sick. You can bet that I'll be checking out his solo career after after hearing this example of hip-hop perfection.
There isn't much to say about a certified classic.  Boogie Down Productions was always on the pulse of conscious rap.  That's why By All Means Necessary stood out as one of the most dynamic albums in rap music at the time.  Other groups like Public Enemy and X-Clan were more unabashed in their delivery.  KRS-One had a vision of entertaining as well as educating their listening audience.Throw on a song like "Jimmy" where the beat and the mood are both playful, but KRS-One doesn't joke around when he's telling everybody to strap up and protect themselves when jumping in the bed.  As a 12-year-old boy listening to this record for the first time, I knew there was more to the material being discussed on this song and would eventually learn what he was truly talking about in later years.  Other songs like "Still Number 1" and "My Philosophy" are the other standouts on this album.  But the fact is that the style and sound of BDP made them stand out from the rest.  The rock 'n roll edge of "Ya Slippin" was a risky move at that time considering most rappers rapped over old r&b; samples or drum beats only.  The Caribbean groove of "Stop The Violence" and the uptempo groove of "T-Cha, T-Cha" are other examples of going against the grain.Criminal Minded is always the first album people blurt out as their favorite BDP album.  But once his brother Scott LaRock was murdered, By All Means Necessary unearthed the conscious mind of  KRS-One.  If you consider yourself a true Hip-Hop fan, then you already know all of this to be true.  But if you've missed a few albums during your lifetime, you should definitely complete your hip-hop collection with this album...By All Means Necessary!
When you mention hip hop to somebody, the name KRS-1 should come up. When you mention the most impressive LP's, By all means Necessary should be mentioned immediately. Everything you want from a dope MC: Philosophy, Storytellin, Battle raps, you name it its found here. Cop it now!
Many have heard of the passing of DJ Scott La Rock but somehow, his sidekick KRS-One manage to still hold it down and still bring out another classic album under the name of BDP. Following Criminal Minded with 10 tracks of highly concentrated molecules in the form of By All Means Necessary, KRS still kept his rhymes as fresh as they could get. From My Philosophy to Necessary, the record introduced KRS-One as the peaceful Teacher and foreshadowing his gift for contradiction. The album cover may be very familiar to the famous shoot of Malcolm-X with a gun in his hand but songs like Illegal Business, Jimmy and Stop the Violence dropped science on drugs, sex and violence. With such a powerful voice and untouchable lyrics, KRS-One made us all believe his boasts that BDP would be here forever.Best moments= My Philosophy, Ya Slippin' and Jimmy
It would be easy to assume, as many people probably did, that after the death of long time partner Scott LaRock KRS-One would fall off. However he gave all those critics a fat smack in the face with the release of By All Means Necessary. Although it's not QUITE as great as Criminal Minded (few are), it is definetly a worthy album and is an example of some of the best rap to come out of the Bronx. "My Philosophy", the semi-sequel to the first track on Criminal Minded "Poetry" (a great track) surpasses its predecessor which is not an easy feat, and is arguably the best hip hop song of all time. Add 9 other great tracks and I'd say you have an essential album.
this was when you had to be saying something in Rap to get true Respect.ANd KRS-One is one of the Greatest Teachers The World Of Rap has ever known.you got more Black History from his Records than from most  classrooms put together.His Lyrical Flow&amp;words hit home.The Malcolm  X.Take was something Refreshing&amp;much Needed.he didn't pull no punches  here.I Miss those days.
By All Means Necessary showcases KRS-ONE at his best. He is definitely one  of the greatest MC's of all-time, and the material here should tell you  why. &quot;My Philosophy&quot; is one of my favorite hip-hop songs of  all-time. KRS talks about the state of hip-hop, the past of BDP, and their  future. On tracks like &quot;Illegal Business&quot;, &quot;Stop The  Violence&quot;, and the spoken word track &quot;Necessary&quot;, KRS speaks  about political issues while he displays his MCing skills on the classic  &quot;I'm Still #1&quot;. And Kris takes the Jungle Brother's  &quot;Jimbrowski&quot; one step further on &quot;Jimmy&quot;. From start to  finish, By All Means Necessary is a great album. If you are a hip-hop fan,  you must own this.
This album is why I still listen to KRS-1 today!  If I saw this CD in the stores, I would get it.  Lots of intelligent and conscious lyrics and he doesn't hold back. I like &quot;Stop the Violence&quot; and its rumbling sound.  I still like &quot;My Philosophy&quot;, &quot;I'm Still #1&quot;, &quot;Jimmy&quot; and many others.  But I like on &quot;Illegal Business&quot; where they sample some music that I remembered hearing on Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, Bill Cosby's show.  He mentions his friend Scott La Rock many times over the album.  This is his best effort to me. While I like his later ones, this is the best!
There is no doubt in any TRUE hip hop fan's mind that KRS-1 may be the best MC of all time, and this album just backs that theory up. Originally recorded after the death of his Boogie Down Productions partner Scott LaRock, KRS decided to pay tribute to his lost friend By All Means Necessarry, hence the name of the Album. This is a true Hip Hop classic and one of the most influential albums of all time. A MUST HAVE for ANY Hip hop or music fan.1.My Philosophy-10/10-Awesome, a Hip Hop Classic.2.Ya Slippin'-10/10-My favorite track on the album, Unbelivable, hip hop at it's finest.3.Stop The Violence-10/10-Probably the most influential BDP song out there, great beats and infamous hook. Classic.4.Illegal Business-10/10-One of the most funky and catchy hooks from KRS, plus some pretty amazing lyrics and funny Fat Albert samples.5.Nervous-9/10-Just a bunch of talking over a beat. But the beat is tight as hell so it carries the whole damn song.6.I'm Still Number One-10/10-Nice flow by KRS on this one, and a pretty tight snare beat too. Plus many see this track as the one that proves he is the number one.7.Part Time Suckers-10/10-Tight track with some pretty tight snares. Just plain good.8.Jimmy-10/10-Awesome song wif a catchy as mess hook, and some pretty cool and creative lyrics about safe sex.9.T'Cha T'Cha-10/10-Nice flow from Krs and a pretty tight hook.10.Necessary-10/10-Even though its a talking track it's still a really good and true look at hip hop music.Overall this Cd is awesome. Get this cd by all means necessary, no pun intended.
Another Banger from one of the greatest years in hiphop "1988". Kris drops science like no other on this one. This still bangs today almost 20 years later. I can't wait till Kris says "Fresh for 2008!" You SUCKAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!
Krs-One is another one of those MCs, on a SHORT list of them, whose second album COMPLETELY took the first. By All Means Necessary was EXCELLENT, as he, just like Public Enemy did in 88, brought a conscious and more political state of awareness to hip hop. This album represents Krs in his true form, and it shows on EVERY song. Here's the review:Album Highlights: EVERY song is worth a listen.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Mattere: Thumbs up. Other than Public Enemy, who else was coming this political in 88?Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: This was a great moment for hip hop music. Krs-One came back in 88 for this second album and he didn't disappoint. If hip hop was still like this today, it would be so much better. One can only hope. Overall, I strongly recommend this album to any fan of hip hop, if you're into politically charged hip hop.
Jamaica native Billy Ocean had a Top 20 hit in 1976,LOVE REALLY HURTS WITHOUT YOU. That should have appeared on this compilation with a few original tracks. The original tracks are LICENSE TO CHILL and I SLEEP BETTER(IN SOMEONE ELSE'S BED). The latter track features Will Smith,originally known as The Fresh Prince,who co-wrote the track. Hits from 1984's SUDDENLY are the title track,CARIBBEAN QUEEN(NO MORE LOVE ON THE RUN),LOVERBOY and MYSTERY LADY. From 1986's LOVE ZONE are the title track and THERE WILL BE SAD SONGS(TO MAKE YOU CRY). From 1988's TEAR DOWN THESE WALLS are the title track,THE COLOR OF LOVE,HERE'S TO YOU and GET OUT OF MY DREAMS GET INTO MY CAR. LOVE IS FOREVER from LOVE ZONE should be on this collection. Also there's WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH(THE TOUGH GET GOING) from the 1985 film THE JEWEL OF THE NILE. In the video,the film's stars Michael Douglas,Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito(they starred in the 1984 predecessor ROMANCING THE STONE),appear as background vocalists for Ocean performing the song on stage. The actors were probably just lip-synching. Some of these songs were written by Robert John "Mutt" Lange,who produced music for The Cars and his country superstar wife Shania Twain.
This is one of the best RandB singers with a soft touch I really did like his music he had so many good songs I really did like Billy I still hear his music on the radio now he sings so well that you understand every word that he says I would truly recommend anoyone who likes Rand B music to definitely buy this album because it contains a lot of good songs from Billy . It contains: Love Zone, Loverboy, When The Going Gets Tough The Tough Gets Going, Caribbean Queen, Suddenly, Sad Songs, and many other good songs so therefore this is a very nice album I really do enjoy this album!!!!
Billy Ocean was one the most pleasant and emblematic figures of the pop movement between the early seventies. His repertoire was composed by easy to listen ballads and swinging pieces that were influence by the rhythm & soul. He is visibly influenced by Marvin Gaye, Lou Rawls and a little bit of Barry White. He was owner of a natural sympathy and unique charisma that so many successful moments gave us along his career.This compilation confirms why he was the figure he was. Don't miss this important album, part of the musical history.
Trinidad born British singer Billy Ocean (Leslie Sebastian Charles) rose to fame in the 80's where he had hit after hit on both sides of the atlantic with either happy pop songs or tearjerking ballads. Billy Ocean more then anyone is a perfect symbol of the 80's with his music that is typical for that era and even if it's a bit dated by now he still recorded some of the most memorable songs of the 80's. However, it all started in 1976 when he recorded his first album, an eponymous album that spawned the hit single "Love Really Hurts Without You" that peaked at #2 in the UK and #22 in the US. Few people would know that 8 years later he would be at #1 in both countries with his "Caribbean Queen" and also become one of the most successful caribbean singers of all time. Let's take a look at the songs.It should've started with "Love Really Hurts Without You" his first hit which is quite typical for the late 70's. A happy uptempo Pop-R&B; song with piano and disco vibes and Ocean's usual deep but happy voice. i don't know why it isn't on this version, cause I have the same at home with it included.Next song is "When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Gets Going" which was the soundtrack to Michael Douglas/Danny De Vito's film "The Jewel of the Nile" and on the video we had the two of them dancing to it. It's another happy uptempo and one of my all time favorite songs that always make me smile. It peaked at #1 in the UK and #2 in the US."Licence To Chill" is very simular to "When The Going" actually with a happy beat and backround singers + a closure with saxophone and it became his last hit in 1989, proving to be a typical 80's artist."Caribbean Queen" from 1984, was Ocean's Biggest hit, a song dedicated to all the beautiful women from Jamaica, Cuba, Bahamas, Haiti, Dominican Repubic, Puerto Rico and Trinidad & Tobago. The song is a midtempo that actually uses the saxophone aswell. The song was also called European or African queen based on where it was released, but I prefered the Caribbean."There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry) was another massive hit peaking at #1 in the US. This however, was one of his slowest most romantic songs. 80's classic for sure."Loverboy" is a pop/rock song in fast pace from Ocean's succesfulSuddenlyalbum. Simply put, another strong and memorable Ocean trademark."Suddenly" is a ballad and another big hit from 1984 but apart from most other of his songs this one ain't too remarkable or typical for him, it's just a decent ballad."Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car" sound a little like "When The Going" and it was also soundtrack to a popular film, The Roger Rabbitt film that is. It became one of his biggest and last hits in 1988."Love Zone" a power-ballad with some good percussion and another memorable hook. It became a top 10 in 1986."Here's To You" was never a single and is a quite forgettable ballad. I think it was first released for this complilation. Maybe they needed more songs?."I Sleep Much Better (In Someone Else's Bed) a trademark midtempo with some backround singers and happy vibe. Released in 1990 it failed to chart."The Colour Of Love" another late ballad hit, eventhough it's very sweet song it didn't become as big as the singles he released in the mid 80's."Tear Down These Walls", is a decent uptempo but sounds alot like previous songs aswell. It was released very late and never became a hit."Mystery Lady" the last single from the "Suddenly" album is good aswell, a midtempo that may not be as famous as the others but is a nice addition to this complilation.Overall, although this compilation is old it is the best one with most of his hits included. I'm bewildered though that "Love Really Hurts Without You" isn't included since it was his first song and also the ballad "Love is Forever" that was a minor hit eventhough it wasn't too hot. Other then that, everything else is found here. I would have liked to see the songs in chronological order aswell, here there is no order at all. However, the compilation is strong and if you're curious to find out more about Billy Ocean here's a perfect way to start rather then to buy his albums. A good purchase!.
THIS CD WAS AMAZING! I LOVED IT. IT WAS SO GOOD TO HEAR SOME OF MY FAVORITE BILLY OCEAN SONGS..LIKE SUDDENLY...CARIBBEAN QUEEN, LOVE ZONE, & THEY'LL BE SAD SONGS..AMONG OTHERS! THIS TOOK ME ON A NICE STROLL DOWN MEMORY LANE! IF YOU ARE A FAN OF BILLY OCEAN GET THIS CD ASAP!
Billy Ocean.  If you call him the poor man's Michael Jackson, you should be smacked upside your head!  Despite &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot; having a keyboard part that sounds a little like &quot;Billy Jean&quot;, Billy manages to diversify to cutesy dance pop, funky R&amp;B to smothering slow jams.  Take the get-up anthems &quot;When The Going Gets Tough&quot; and &quot;Get Out of My Dreams&quot;, both fast paced grooving pop tunes.  With peppy sing along tunes like those, it s nearly a crime that he wasn't crowned the King of the era.  Then there are adult contemporary gems, which are sang sweetly and lightly like &quot;Suddenly&quot; and &quot;There ll Be Sad Songs&quot;.  Billy's funkiest track that hints of the islands is &quot;Love Zone&quot;.  &quot;Loverboy&quot; is a stomping rock beat dancer.  &quot;Tear Down These Walls&quot; is a good combo of a pop song in a slower more romantic way.  &quot;Mystery Lady&quot; is a romantic tribute.  Also, Billy gives us guests like the Fresh Prince  (now known as Will Smith) and Robert Lange (who produced heavy metal monsters AC/DC and Def Leppard before this and country queen wife Shania Twain after).  Then of course, there is &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot;, the blessing and the curse.It's kind of sad that the despite being known before the breakout hit &quot;Caribbean Queen&quot;, a funky fusion of dance pop and R&amp;B suavness, that none of those tracks are included on here.  Billy Ocean's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; starts off with that unforgettable eighties jam (career wise, not by tracklisting) and touches on all 3 of his Jive albums, but nothing before or after that.  Look at the date on this disc.  1989.  Is that an omen?  Unfortunately, all of Billy's other stuff appear to be out of print or only available as costly imports. When you listen to this disc, you will fell something, whether it is joy or sorrow.  I almost second-guessed the man and thought the only songs I liked would the upbeat well-known radio staples.  I didn t even remember the adult contemporary staple ballads.  This album is essential 1980s!  I guess some people have a time period in which they do their most successful work (not a real revelation by any means).  But Billy Ocean wasn't just a part of the music scene during his run.  Billy owned it!  Here s To You, Mr. Ocean.
It just never ceases to amaze me how KRS-One stayed on top of his game in the late 80's and early 90's. With BDP's final album Sex And Violence, Kris was going through a lot of problems with his personal life, which included a divorce from his wife, Ms. Melody (many know her from the "Self Destruction" single), and apparently was reducing the people in his BDP circle (according to the linear notes). Not to mention what he did at the P.M. Dawn concert. So there was some stuff going on while recording this album.When I first heard this album, I was damn near blown away. Everything here is on point. Every song here is amazing in its own way, as it has it's own message. "Drug Dealer" is a song about doing something positive instead of selling drugs. On "Questions and Answers", Kris goes at those fradulant magazines and does his own self interview (Don't diss The Source though. Their chief editor give him 4 1/2 mics for this LP.) Even "13 And Good" is a interesting story about hooking up with an underage girl, with an unusual ending to the plot.When he is not kicking messages, Kris' mic skills are still on point. On the amazing "Like A Throttle", he goes with a vingence over a dope beat. The next "Build And Destroy" he gets a lot off his mind, going towards if rappers who are true to the Islam nation are legitimate in their rhymes. The final track "The Real Holy Place", Kris questions Christianity and the credibility of the Holy Bible. Even Freddie Foxxx shows off on "The Origonal Way", and drops a long facinating verse on "Ruff Ruff".With producers like himself, Kenny Parker, Prince Paul, D-Square, and Paul Joey, along with Willie D and Sidney Mills, help create this great album. It's very unfortunate that this was BDP's least selling album. I guess everyone's ear was heading out to the west coast, because they were dropping classic albums aroung this time. Sex and Violence should be enjoyed by all fans of east coast or early 90's rap. In the words of Kris himself, this album is "Fresh for 1992, you suckas!!" Peace.Lyrics: A+Production: AGuest Appearances: A+Musical Vibes: ATop 5 Tracks:1. Like A Throttle2. 13 and Good3. Drug Dealer4. Sex and Violence5. Ruff Ruff (featuring Freddie Foxxx)Honorable Mention:1. Build and Destroy2. Sex and Violence3. We In Here
This is probably my favorite BDP album. It has great lyrics, great beats, and is really a personal album. KRS-One talks about issues dealing with sex, drugs, and violence. I can't believe that this got bad reviews when it first came out. Favorites include Duck Down, Like a Throttle, Build and Destroy, Poisonous Products, Questions and Answers, and Sex and Violence. Get this and all of BDP's albums to support the real hip hop.
KRS 1 has always been light years ahead of the rap game, and the Sex and Violence CD is just one more item of proof for that statement. Rappers like Emenem and Rakim have recieved an abundance of well deserved credit for their lyrical witticism. KRS-1, however, takes lyrical wit to another level by using his tounge twisting talent to speak on more complicating issues such as the ethnic history of drug dealers, the hipocrisy of 5% NOI rappers, The IRS as the true pimps of the world and more.The tragedy of this CD and KRS has nothing to do with KRS's tendency to "preach" but rather with the immaturity and low level gratuities of a rap industry that has gone mainstream. In fact, THIS is exactly what this CD is all about. It may very well be that KRS will sadly go under recognized by an industry that he helped revolutionized. But I believe that will only be temporary. If hip-hop ever grows up and evolves beyond thugs, drugs and adolescent narcisstic content, then it may very well reflect on artists like KRS 1 and give him the props he deserved since his introduction to the rap game.
I really feel like this was the best BDP album. KRS-1 is always amazing yes...but this is just mind blowing! It deserves 10 stars. Start your hip hop collection with this.
I've attempted to write this review before but it would not post due to it's length, so I'll attempt to be brief, (notice I said attempt).  Why would I run out of space writting about a seldom heralded little known BDP album?Well, first being that I consider this album to be perfect.  And I mean perfect in every sense of the word.  Sex and Violence is my all time favorite album and I ain't scared to admit it...But first, let's set the historical context.  The Blastmaster was at a very strange time in his life when he made this album.  He had just divorced his wife Ms. Melodee.  He had split up from the majority of the BDP crew (hence the harsh liner notes for anyone but Kenny Parker and Ill Will to "Stop Frontin'").  He'd been subliminally dissed by X-Clan, (RIP Professor X), Wise Intelligent from Poor Righteous Teachers, and Prince Be of P.M. Dawn.  Maybe even a little subliminally by Ice Cube and NWA, (although that one's gotta be read into really deeply).  Hell, even D-Nice was talking bad about Kris in the Source.  The Heal project had failed.  BDP's live album and corresponding video did not move the units that he or his label had desired.  Even worse, East Coast Hip Hop seemed to be on a decline, (this album was released prior to Illmatic).  What to do?  Well, for starters, Krs showed up impromptu at a P.M. Dawn concert and unceremoniously through Prince Be off the stage, ("Damn, Kris IS kinda big"), and then proceeded to rock the house to the tune of "I'm Still Number One".  Proof positive KRS was not havin it in '92.Unfortunately, all of these incidents led to a very confused fan base.  Seems everyone had gotten used to KRS' Stop the Violence and Edutainment messages and forgotten Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary.  They also forgot that KRS is still a human being and not some sort of deity.  Ultimately, his fan base left him as it has done and will probably continue to do for years to come.  The fact that KRS is an artist and will express himself with how he is feeling at the time needs to be recognized.  I'm sure ALL Hip Hop fans have felt alienated by KRS albums or ideas at some point (myself included).Sex and Violence is the culmination of all of KRS frustration.  The Blastmaster of old reared his ugly head and spit hard and fast.  KRS bludgeons the competition with tracks like...well, everything except "The Real Holy Place" which is a sort of spoken word piece about God being within us all and "Drug Dealer".  On the later, KRS brilliantly advises drug dealers of the world to unite and use their money to improve the community.  Of course, all anyone heard was that the dealers should "Organize (their) business and open up a school.  This was again interpreted by any of his fickle fan base left that KRS wanted to make Drug Dealer High School, (c'mon now, Open your mind and put a book in it!!!).Other than those two songs, from the intro where KRS plays the role of a DJ dying from lack of vinyl, (a BIG issue back in 92, believe me) to the final grand indictment of the IRS on "Who Are the Pimps?" KRS seems to have no end of material for fueling his fire.  For the sudden prevalence and dominance of Gangsta Rap, (and most specifically NWA's Efil4zaggiN album), the fire of the singles "Duck Down" and "We In There" came out punching with lines like "I spit on your #1 hit" and "in jail in a pair of panties you'll look just stunning".  For X-Clan and PRT there's "Build and Destroy" where KRS scientifically breaks both crews and his philosphy down with classic lines like "Too many teachers in the class spoil the school/after awhile you've got blabbering f*ckin fools" (ouch!!!).  For society at large there's the second single "13 and Good", "Say Gal" and "Poisonous Products".  Here Krs edutains the masses about our musical and societal problems with infidelity, morality, vanity... Basically holding up a mirror for us to look at and ask "What the f*ck is wrong with you?"To explain all this "madness", KRS supplies "Question and Answer".  Here KRS breaks down the point of the whole album.  In a format similar to "Imma Break It Down" by Eazy-E, KRS interviews himself about various times in his career, his overall message, his own sincerity, and what he's doing to help.  Sadly, this track was never a single so no one ever heard KRS explanation and most of the singles fell on what were becoming deaf ears.Next come the biggest surprises of all.  The first is the crazy allout breath control fest of "Like a Throttle".  This is the ABSOLUTE BEST exercise in breath distribution ever.  I've memorized every line in this album and am amazed to this day how KRS rips this sh*t!!!!  The second big surprise comes in the form of a newly invigorated Freddie Foxxx.  While Foxxx had appeared earlier on Kool G Rap's Wanted Dead or Alive track "Money In The Bank", it is on tracks "The Original Way" and "Ruff Ruff" where Freddie starts repping the sound that made him the commodity he became a short while later.  His LOOOOOOOOOOONG verse on Ruff Ruff is one of his best ever and, if you ever meet me or KRS or Freddie and are so inclined to hear, has a great story behind it.Finally, the results.  After all that, the album didn't sell.  In fact, it remains the worst selling BDP album of their carreer.  The first album to receive a "Mic" in the source, (they were records before this album was reviewed), received a 4 1/2 rating.  The label released 3 singles (all of which have near classic, must have extra tracks).  They did three videos.  Everything was in place except for the alienated fan base.  Maybe they'd all jumped on the West Coast band wagon of Gangsterism and Mysogyny.  More likely, they just weren't ready for the new Boom Bap.  I figure when the revolution that Nas, Wu-Tang, Boot Camp Clik, and DITC was brought to the table, KRS had to feel like he was slapped.  The Teacha and more importantly innovator was ahead of his time again.  Pick it up so you can make it your time now.(Guess that wasn't very brief, huh?)
Its kind of hard to deny what Krs-One has brought to the game. His flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now. Standout Tracks: DUCK DOWN, RUFF RUFF(dope match up with Freddie Foxx), 13 AND GOOD(the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches), POISONOUS PRODUCTS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, LIKE A THROTTLE, WE IN HERE, THE REAL HOLY PLACE(the deepest track on here), WHO ARE THE PIMPS? and the reggae tinged joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also. Filler: NONE! Bottom Line: BDP's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day. Besides the slammin production, Krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the average rapper with this album. Any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with Edutainment and work their way down to this album.
SEX AND VIOLENCE, Although commerically his worst selling album of all the BDP albums, lyrically and production wise, is his best as he ridded the rap world of X-Clan, Poor Righteous Teachers and the soft as mallow pie PM Dawn on the singles "We In There" and "Build and Destroy".  The 12" single remix of the "We In There" single includes a track on the other side called "Feel The Vibe, Feel the Beat" where he basically massacres that track and ended PM Dawn's and his former homey D-Nice's career.This had to be the first KRS-ONE lp that I could actually listen to the tracks more than I could just the lyrics.  KRS-ONE was going through a lot personally before this album, the divorce from his wife Ms Melodie, the beef with former homie D-Nice, and the fact that east coast rap at that time in 1992 had taken a back seat to West Coast Rap being dominated by NWA, ICECUBE, Ice-T, Too Short, Snoop, D.O.C., Geto Boys, Compton's Most Wanted, DJ Quik.  West Coast rap had become the rage and the afro-centric, edutainment rap that the KRS's, the Rakims, the Public Enemy's, the Queen Latifah's, Jungle Brothers and Tribes of the East had continue to build on top of the foundation already laid down, had started to crumble.  East Coast rap was being largely ignored by Yo MTV Raps, The Video Jukebox at the time, the two largest video players of rap videos.  Unfortunately, this album like a poster said earlier came two years before Illmatic started the resurgence of East Coast rap again but lyrically was one of the better albums hands downs that was released that year.  Though, this album will never get the mainstream props that Criminial Minded, By All Means Necessary, Edutainment, Return of the Boom Bap and his self titled, KRS-ONE albums receieved but real hip hop heads know that no MC would have dared come at KRS on any level after this.If this album was released today, everyone would think it was so new and fresh and diverse.  A shame since this album came out in 1992.  What does that say about our current hip hop now?
By time 1993 rolled around, cats were getting a lot more lyrical in the hip-hop lexicon. It was virtually a game of "can you top this" as several well-oiled rhyming machines left mediocre & stagnant rappers in a cloud of dust. KRS-One has always stayed ahead of the trends, and " Return of the Boom Bap" is no different. In my opinion, he is arguably rhyming tighter than he ever has before. His content & strong message tracks weave excellently in and out of some of his finest lyricism to date.The production is uniformly excellent, and hits hard with a minimal and spare set of beats, which is 100% boom bap. The legendary Dj Premier, who is also on top of his game, produces most of the tracks here, with KRS-One producing 4 tracks himself. Kid Capri also produces 2 tracks, and Showbiz kills it on another. All in all, these elements add up to an unstoppable force. Every track here is bananas... "Outta Here", "Black Cop", "I Can't Wake Up", "Sound Of Da Police", "Higher Level", ""P" Is Still Free"... every tracks bangs with a rugged & raw fury. This is hand down essential KRS-One material. Recognize the master.
KRS-One's first "solo" album is 1993's "Return of the Boom Bap." After the original six Boogie Down Productions albums, KRS dropped the BDP moniker and dropped this gem. Kris enlisted the production of legend DJ Premier, who only recently had begun to receive recognition for his musical genius as a member of Gang Starr. The beats, however, while excellent, are quite simple, allowing KRS-One and his awesome character to take center stage. He drops some of the political and social stances of the last two BDP albums,EdutainmentandSex and Violence, in favor of a more entertaining and overall simpler approach. That's not to say that the verses aren't relevant. His classic tales of police brutality, urban injustice, and hip hop loyalty are all here. He just delivers them in a way that puts the music and the performance to the forefront. This is a totally classic album. Every song is totally memorable, because KRS puts such a great performance on every track. Whether he's screaming, singing, or toasting like a dancehall reggae performer, he entertains first and foremost. No track is even average or any worse than the others, this is pretty close to a perfect hip hop album. I couldn't find you any flaws, it's arguably hip hop's greatest MC teamed with arguably hip hop's greatest producer. A must have for the rap fan.The album begins with an awesome intro, "KRS-One Attacks," where Premo laces a totally dope beat and covers it with some old BDP samples, to make a perfect start. "Outta Here" uses simple drum-and-bass to allow KRS to address the current state of hip hop, chronicling his life as a rapper and talking about the tendency of rappers to "fall off." Perhaps his best known song, "Black Cop" follows. Here, he is an entertainer first and an MC second, yelling and screaming, completely going wild on the mic. Anyone who hasn't sang along to the yelps of "Black coooop...black COP black COP black COP" shouldn't consider themself a hip hop fan. "Mortal Thought" is relevant, with a great chorus. I love the conceptually genius "I Can't Wake Up," where KRS raps from the perspective of a blunt. He namedrops most of the big names of '93 rap, as the MCs pass the blunt from rapper to rapper. Again, he yells and sings a great chorus, this song's another classic. The nice "Slap Them Up" precedes the infamous "Sound of da Police." The look at police brutalities is simply rap at its finest. My favorite part is where he draws a connection between the similar-sounding words "overseer" and "officer" in the second verse, as they both oppressed the urban black community. The chorus is just classic, nobody else could ever pull this off like KRS-One. "Mad Crew" has a heavily sampled beat, and "Uh Oh" uses a human beatbox in favor of a drum machine. "Brown Skin Woman" delivers musically and lyrically, and the following title track is just awesome. "'P' Is Still Free" is once again classic material, I remember first hearing this song on theMenace II Society: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrackcompilation. The album ends perfectly with "Stop Frontin'" and "Higher Level," a provocative challenge to American religion with a heavy horn-laden beat.I feel like this album gets overlooked in comparison to the BDP albums, but I think this is as entertaining and enjoyable as anything KRS-One has ever done. A classic album in every sense of the word, perfect hip hop from the best year for the genre, 1993. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and pick it up.
This is probably the best solo album KRS-One has ever put out. Sorry to say there are probably other good ones, but this is the best put together one. The beats, the rhymes, and the material go together very nicely. My favorites are Outta Here, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound of Da Police, Uh Oh, Return of the Boom Bap, and Stop Frontin'. But the other songs are good too. I recommend this to fans of Boogie Down Productions or Hip Hop in general.
KRS-1's best release after the BDP LP's. His subject matter is truly remarkable. His visuals hypnotize you and take you to where the story is at the moment. Extremely DOPE around the board! 10 stars!!!
God damn, I haven't heard an album with so much effort and time put into it. Other classics were dropped before and after this but this is just a timeless classic, I can't stress just how much this album reigns SUPREMACY. KRS-One dropped 2 hot albums with BDP (Criminal Minded and By Any Means Necessary) which were just off the hook but this is different. His voice has matured a lot more than what it was in his earlier days and his lyrics are thoughtful and excellent. Check out Sound Of Da Police to experiment his might and talent. F*ck tha Police by N.W.A. is by far the best diss song towards the police but this follows it right behind it. I really like his 'Overseer/Officer' rhyme and the way he raps in his Jamaican way as he did back in Criminal Minded. Other cuts enjoyed include Outta Here, where he talks about his life in the game, I Can't Wake Up, a pleasant track produced by Premier, Uh Oh, using beatboxing as his instruments, Brown Skinned Woman, where he puts it down for the black/brown nation and "P" is Still Free, a song dedicated to the girls.I like KRS-One for several reason but the strongest being that he's one of the few rappers to understand REAL HIP-HOP. Take a look at the title, Return of the Boom Bap. It means just that: it's the return of REAL RAP. He's kept it true since '87 and still he's doing it. This is probably the best '93 rap album, waay better than Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle. It's definately one of my favorite top 50 rap albums of all time. Check this out, coz KRS-One is out to ATTACK!Best moments= Outta Here, I Can't Wake Up, Sound of Da Police and Brown Skinned Woman
What else can be said about this album that hasn't been said already?  This is basically a collaboration between two legends of the genre (KRS One and DJ Premier) while both were at the top of their games.  It gets no better than that.  Period.  I feel kind of special because this is the kind of stuff I was growing up on.  I think it was 9th or 10th grade for me when this came out and I ran out and got this after hearing "Outta Here" for the first time.  "Sound Of The Police", "Outta Here", "Return Of The Boom Bap, "Mortal Thought", "Black Cop", "Brown Skin Woman", "Uh Oh", "Higher Level"....I mean, the list of classics on this disc goes on and on.  The sound can best be described as bass heavy boom bap (hence the title of the album).  Kinda makes me miss the early/mid 90's sound...  *sigh*As far as flaws, I can only think of one..."I Can't Wake Up."  That song was a bit of a misstep.  Otherwise, the rest is straight fire.  Anyone giving this less than 4 stars doesn't know what a timeless piece this album truly is.Return Of The Boom Bap is classic.  Point blank.  Period.  If you haven't heard this album yet, then quit cheating yourself and check it out.  It may have come out in '93, but it sounds just as fresh 13 years later.  I highly recommend making this one a collection piece.Standout Tracks: 'P' Is Still Free, Slap Them Up, Black Cop, Mad Crew, Outta Here, Brown Skin Woman, Sound Of The Police, Stop Frontin', Mortal Thought, Uh Oh, Higher Level (My Favorite), and Return Of The Boom Bap
I have been a krs-one fan for a LONG time, and would have to say this is his best album.  Sound Of Da Police is completely off the hook, the lyrics are some of the best you'll come across.  Krs is one of the greatest rappers ever, and this album is a timeless underground classic.  This is REAL hip-hop, dont support what we hear on the radio these days, its all crap, listen to legends like krs-one and rakim.  Other good tracks are KRS-One Attacks and Return Of Da Boombap.Beats - 10/10Lyrics - 10/10Production - 10/10Originality - 10/10Final Note - 5 Mic Classic, one that all true rap/hip-hop fans have.  Classic album, one of the best of our time.
The first album from KRS-One{Knowledge Rein Supreme...} that i loved on the first listen.KRS One Attacks,Blacc cop,Sound of da police, Mad Crew,"P' Is Still Free,Stop Frontin'!!! is insane,Higher Level!!!{Not for the dumb,deaf,& blind}, & Outta Here.
Criminal minded, by any means, return of the boom bap, krs one (self titled) are the best albums he ever did and made him the legend he is. On this particular album he displays his true lyricism such as metaphors,battle rap etc. This is definately far entertaining then previous releases such as sex and violence, edutainment, and ghetto music, those albums came off to preachy in my opinion and don't standout amongst his better efforts as I mentioned before. You can play the whole thing through, although in my opinion the only track I would skip is "uh oh" because it's a beatbox beat which get's annoying after awhile other then that this is a classic album in hip hop and a landmark in it's history.
True hip hop at its purest form was being born wit krs's return of the boom rap... Diz should already be in true heads collection no weak joints. A classic from a genious. Best tracks ? " mad crew" , "sound of the police" , and , "stop frontin" a true classic.
Sh**!!! This album is off the hook! "Outta Here" has one of the best beats ive ever heard!! Thats on a real HIPHOP tip right there! KRS-One's voice is better than ever and his lyrics are ON POINT EVERY TRACK! KRS-One has kept it real out of most emcees out of all these years. You got to give him his repsect. This guy is a TRUE emcee and if you dont like him, then go listen to your wack azz 50 Cent album. The production on this album is pretty much what gives it its name. Grimey old school soundin hiphop beats. If you want TRUE hiphop, better get this now! Real stuff. All the songs are on point.My Top 5 Songs1.Outta Here (NICE!)2.Mortal Thought3.I Cant Wake Up4.Return Of The Boom Bap5.Stop Frontin
Theoretically R.Kelly's debut album,as a solo artist anyway is very crucial for the development of music in the 90's. It was transitional music easing out of the hip-hop based new jack swing style of the beginning of the decade towards what would eventually be known as "neo soul",a largely retro funk based sound usually informed by hip-hop rather than being dependant on it. Creatively R.Kelly embodies many of the qualities of the R&B/soul/funk greats that came before him. He's a songwriter/vocalist with a strong flair for song construction and strong,gospel informed singing and (most importantly perhaps) a multi instrumentalist with the ability to create sturdy grooves and,for example the good sense to bring in jazz guitarist Bobby Broom to play on "Your Body's Callin'". Lyrically this album blends the sacred and the secular in the classic soul tradition. It was a quality he'd maintain throughout his career. "Bump N Grind" was of course the big hit and the album followed that excellent groove,for the most part in the same manner."For You","It Seems Like Your Ready" and the extended jam "Sex Me" all follow that same basic mid-tempo neo-funk groove to a tee. This album also includes a touching story song type tribute to his mother in "Sadie",full of gospel organ and all kinds of soulful breaks and release. The same goes musically for the closing title song,the main difference is that one as with the rest of the album is based in heavy duty bedroom music,visually explicit without the use of explicit language. The interesting part is,as pointed out in many reviews the album is actually one of the few of it's type I've heard where the album loses some energy when the tempo picks up. With the exception of the strong "Summer Bunnies" the majority of the uptempo cuts such as "Homie Lover Friend","Freak Dat Body","Back To The Hood Of Things" and "I Like The Crotch On You" feature raps by DeAndre Boykins and Carey Kelly that are very repetitive and very uninteresting. Since this album was at it's time looking to innovate to a degree the inclusion of rapping on these songs kind of seemed like a step back and,in the future Kelly would come to do much much better at utilizing hip-hop in his music. For the longest time I thought of R.Kelly as a bit of a one trick pony who was likely not very capable of delivering anything close to a consistant album. After all that tended to be a problem for a lot of music of this particular era. For those I will have to say this album will certainly prove those naysayers wrong,including myself.
THIS IS ONE OF R.KELLY'S BEST ALBUMS I ENJOY THIS ALBUM IT CONTAINS SOME NICE SONGS: BODY'S CALLIN, HOMIE,LOVER, FRIEND, SEX ME, BUMP N' GRIND, THIS IS A NICE MIX I ENJOY THIS ALBUM IF YOU ARE AN R.KELLY FAN I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS ALBUM IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY R.KELLY FAN!!!!
I first discovered R. Kelly and his talent back in 1995; two years after 12 Play was released. I listened to 12 Play dozens of times and I just became overwhelmed by his skills and his "raunchy" lryics. Released in 1993, 12 Play was where R. Kelly became a true R&B superstar. It was a concept album that showcased his talents and versatility perfectly. The opening track, "Your Body's Callin'" is a classic. It's a smooth and sexy ballad with airy instrumentation and the amazing vocals. "Bump And Grind" is another song that will go down as his most popular tune. The song has memorable bouncy beats and throbbing lyrics, that make this an instant classic. "Homie, Lover, Friend", "Freak Dat Body", and "Back To The Hood Of Things"; all show off his rapping skills with the G-Funk inspired beats and the awesome hooks. "It Seems Like You're Ready" is a slow jam with R. setting the bar high on his romantic persona. "I Like The Crotch On You" is another one of Kelly's X-rated themed songs with the G-Funk inspired rhythms, but after half of the song ends, he tones it down by singing with other male vocalists about the "cons" who hates his music. He also plays the piano on there. "Summer Bunnies" is an upbeat song about the ladies. "For You" is a personal favorite of mine. It's a nice ballad with smoothed-out vocals, romantic spanish guitars, and the lushy strings. "Sadie" has R. doing a cover song of The Spinners' classic. He wonderfully dedicates the song to his mother. "Sex Me" is an 11-minute epic that has R. singing the most notorious lyrics of his career. It's a well-crafted ballad with the airy synthesizers, bumpy drumming, and spacey vocals. The title track, "12 Play" is what I consider to be the climax of the whole album. It's a lovely, slow jam with memorable hooks. Overall, all I can say about 12 Play is that it's Kelly's most raunchest and unified album, in every sense. His 2000 album, TP-2.Com, the sequel to this album, 12 Play, might've been more sexually explicit and thugged-out, but 12 Play just took him to a whole new level: bringing him to a mainstream audience and redefining his image. I really think it's a 1990's R&B classic and one of R. Kelly's best recordings. A
Don't be too mad at me, but I really just discovered 12 Play about a few weeks ago.  I've really been 'into' music the past few years.  I feel its important to go back and listen to the 'real' music.  This cd has always been in my house, but never listened to it.  I mean who doesn't kno Bump and Grind, Your Body's Callin, It Seems Like you ready.  But to me those aren't the only good ones on the cd.  I love the uptempo jams like HOMIE LOVER FRIEND, FREAK DAT BODY, my fave uptempo being SUMMER BUNNIES! It just screams old summer jam!  But besides the obvious the good songs all the releases SEX ME AND 12 PLAY are just so damn good.  There has never been an r&b cd since this and it's a tough act to follow.
As the album title, 12 Play, insist on sexual connotations, it is a lot more than just that. 12 Play is R. Kelly's first solo album, second overall. He makes a dedication to his mother on the sensational remake "Sadie". "For You" is a simple R&B love song of being a shoulder for someone. Robert also takes us to the earlier years of his life on "Back To The Hood Of Things" featuring additional flows of DeAndre Boykins & Carey Kelly. You can also hear him flow distinctly on "Homie Lover Friend". The weather never felt as hot as stated on "Summer Bunnies" out taking in some sunrays. Then as night falls upon the summer, he has something for the ladies to dance to as R. Kelly shows them how he'll "Freak Dat Body". As for the slow jams that invite the mood, all there's to say is good night!
This is probably R kellys best work to date. I still love the songs  from this album.
I remember being twelve years old when the 12 Play album came out. At the time there really was no other male R&B singer doing it like Mr. Kelly expect for my boy Ralph Tresvant. As I've said in other reviews, R.Kelly's ballads are what make the CD work. Of course everyone knows the singles Your Body's Callin ,It Seems Like You're Ready, Bump & Grind, Sex Me Parts 1 & 2 but there was also the self titled track, the heart-felt cover of Sadie and the sentimental For You. The up-tempo stuff is really weak but the ballads are on-point.
R. Kelly - 12 Play (Jive, 1993)Many people claim that they grew up listening to R. Kelly, but when asked what songs are favorites, if you say, "Thoinga Thoing" or "Fiesta", then you're just a YOUNG'UN! Because ten years ago before all that "Pied Piper" hogwash, R. Kelly, bald head and all, had ladies (and fellas) swooning with this, his second album. The classics are all on here like "It Seems Like You're Ready", "Sex Me Pts. I & II", and "Bump n' Grind". The raps that he do on here are also an improvement off of his first album. One big classic. Check it out. -EJR
The man is Prince Teddy Pendergrass in one. The difinitive R&amp;B album of the '90's is still a banger to this day.
I have got to say that this album has brought me back during my high school days. I grew up listening to him and other artist such as Keith Sweat. I remember attending to his concert in Radio City Music Hall performing with Salt-N-Pepper right after prom night.Kelly does almost everything by himself. The production, songwriting, and mix's, etc.... and he's brilliant as a multi-instrumentalist.Every fan of R&B; and soul will love this smooth laid-back music. I mean who can forget classics like "Your Body's Callin'" and "Bump N' Grind". Songs that just make your head bounce. Don't forget The Best R&B-Song; of 1993 "Sex Me", for its seductive, made-for-lovers-in-bed sound. Other very good low-tempo songs are "It Seems like You're Ready", "For You" "12 PLAY" and "Sadie". It was with the album "12 PLAY" that he acknowledged his real music and showed the world his enormous talent.Overall "12 Play" is a very good album and although released in 1993, it can stand up to anything on the R&B; market now. This is a very sexy album great for all kinds of lovers. I definitely recommend this to all Kelly fans.
12 play was R. Kelly's first real solo album unless we count "Born into the '90s" with Public Announcement that pretty much was R. Kelly's affair all the way, but on 12 play it get's more evident that R. Kelly is the man behind the music and he sings what he wants to, the new jack swing is mostly gone and the main theme is smooth midtempo's with a theme about sex. infact it's one of the most sexual albums since Prince. Quite a few songs still feauture a guest rapper but it doesn't take away anything from him on the musical side, here he proves that he's a musical genius and that he's here to stay. Say what you want about him, but The production here is a class of it's own.12 play starts with "Your Body's Calling" a slick pleading mid tempo about you know what, This was one of the biggest hits of the album. "Bump and Grind" goes ones step further and it's even better. It got effective beats and R. Kelly singing "I Don't See Nothing Wrong/ with a Little Bump N Grund". "Homie Lover Friend" is a midtempo that features a rapper, the song sound taken from the early 90's and resembles alot of songs from "Born into the 90's". "It Seems Like You're Ready" is another excellent number. It's one of those seductive on the limit songs that could have been penned by Mr Marvin Gaye back in the day, R. Kelly deliver his most sensitive lyrics here, great making love song for sure. "Freak Dat Booty" also feautures a rapper and the song is more of a uptempo party track, not that good actually consudering that during the last few years we've heard a million of simular songs, but I suppose that back in 1993 it was diffrent?. "I Like that Crotch On You" is simular, a mid-tempo with a rapper. Could have been on the previous album also."Summer Bunnies" also feauture a rapper but this song is more of a uptempo and the rap is more prpriate here. It's one of the highlights here, reminds me a little of the latter "Only the Loot Can Make Me Happy" but this one is entirely dedicated to girls. "For You" is a very slow romantic song, not to be mistaken for "Strip for You". "Back to the Hood of Things" with Snoop and Dr. Dre doesn't sound like anything from this album, and in this case it feels out of space here, better for a latter album perhaps. "Sadie" is a slow urban number that adds weight to the album. "Sex Me" is right on the spot and doesn't hide anything. It's delivered in 2 versions, together they are 10 minutes and resembles good old Prince music. "12 Inch Play" continues where Sex Me left off, odd that the title track is the last song? either way it's a slow seductive song that closes a great album well.Overall, R. Kelly finally released a real solo album and he did it with great results. The album was a major hit and launched several hit singles as well. The theme is simple, S-E-X, but sex sells and it's produced with first class. This album is much better then TP2 and TP3 and it was the album that made R. Kelly a superstar. Say what you want about him and his scandals, but when it comes to music, he's a genius and he proves it here.
I started to like him when I listen to his CD, R. After that I bought all of his old CDs. When I bought this one, I knew it was going to be nasty, but that's how it was. This CD sounds great and if you are a BIG fan like me, then you should buy it, DON'T BURN IT BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!
R. Kelly really stepped things up with this his debut solo effort without the support of Public Announcement. The previous LP had showcased moments like "She's Got That Vibe" but had a lot of room for improvement and self expression.The focus here is almost totally on the 90s party/romance "R&B;" sound (He pauses only to honour his mother) and is full of classics in this respective genre. "Bump N' Grind" was the big hit and a definite anthemic highlight as he lays down his manifesto. Other well known material includes "Your Body's Calling Me"  and "It Seems Like Your Ready", both are beautifully structured and performed. Tracks five to nine bring a more uptempo feel with a slight new jack twist carrying on from 1992's "Born Into The 90s". The album reaches it's climax on the final two numbers: the bedroom suite of the near twelve-minute opus "Sex Me Part 1 & 2" and "12 Play". It's all really well done, you can tell he had really studied the epic nature of Marvin Gaye's 70s work.Which leads into the one minor complaint, he didn't seem to have found his own distinctive sound at this stage. His vocal echoes Aaron Hall while the production at times Teddy Riley. That said this problem isn't as acute as on the last LP and the material is great on it's own merits. Even though he would go on to find his own voice and style on his next album (1995's self-titled effort), don't sleep on "12 Play", it's full of gems...
this one still sounds the best to me of all his other release.your bodys callin,bump&amp;grind,12 play.he is a very talented writer&amp;producer.
12 Play ruled the airwaves in 93. R Kelly killed all of his Aaron Hall impersonations from "Born Into The 90's" and dropped this classic baby making  sex fest on wax.Top Joints:Sex Me (Both)12 PlayIt Seams Like You're ReadyBump and GrindYour Body's Callin
My favorite R. Kelly CD to date--a note: trapped on track 8, is an overlooked, but great song called &quot;For You&quot; that I'm sure you will play over &amp; over--trust me.
Aaliyah came out when she was 15 and had some great hip hop laced R&B; cuts with help from R. Kelly, her mentor and rumored husband.Aaliyah had a certain charisma and smooth delivery that made up for her sometimes immature lyrics (which was not her fault). Still this Cd was very important in the mid 90's. Age Ain't Nothing But a Number, Back and Forth, and At your best (You are love) were her singles but I was also impressed by her other cuts.This Cd is straight 90's music but it is Aaliyah and it is still a classic!Favs: Street Thing, Im so into you, No one Knows.., Old School, along with her singles!
Aaliyah.  The name of the woman who gave birth to every teen sensation out since her debut. this includes Mya, monica, christina aguilera, britney spears, 3lw, 702 etc.  She made it tight to sign a teen to a record deal.  With 49 minutes of sheer genius of R. Kelly production and songwriting ( no they were never engaged) catapults this from mediocrity to being a cd for the ages.  This beautiful girl with the beatiful voice knock folks on they heels with Back and Forth, then she went for the knockout punch with At Your Best and the title track.  All the songs are brilliantly done and sung. Production is timeless.  Another opus is Street Thing.  Do not sleep on thsi joint anymore.  Cream will always rise to the top.  Dont get it twisted about Aaliyah.  I bet some people think she a new artist which is pretty ridiculous.  The mother will return witha album this summer drops on July 17th. She teased u with Romeo Must Die soundtrack but it is now time to restore order in her household of little &quot;teenyboppers&quot;.  If you consider ya self a true r&amp;b fan then you should already have this cd If you dont you should be at the store in the next 15 minutes u will not be disappointed.
I'm amazed this album doesn't have that many 5 star reviews considering the beats are catchy and has that typical90s sound. I agree that One and a Million is her strongest album but it would be hard for me to give Age Ain'tNothing But A Number less than 5 stars. Yes, the lyrics can be fluffy at times but I still feel like it doesn'ttake off the focus of the song. I've been listening to it alot these days. The songs are just hard to resist. Mostof them made my body rocked to the hooks. It made me miss the 90s and how much fun it used to be. I think R.Kellywas trying his best to make Aaliyah more marketable to the public. Throughout the songs, there are frequentshoutouts to her name.1. Throw Your Hands Up (5/5)-When I listen to this song, it gives me energy. I love the chorus or the bridge. Ithink having the guest artist rapping throughout the song gave this song more funk.2. Back & Forth (5/5)-a song that is about chilling with your friends on a Friday night. R.Kelly's voice adds anice touch to it.3. Age Ain't Nothing But A Number (5/5)-AMAZING! I would give anything for r'n'b music to sound like this rightnow! Her smooth vocals go so well with the hardcore, gansta hip hop. It just makes the song more mysterious.4. Down With The Clique (4.5/5)-I don't think Aaliyah sounded all that good especially with the occasional "ooos".It makes her sound like she can't sing. But the song itself is very laidback and the lyrics flow well together.5. At Best You Are Love (5/5)-best ballad on the album. it suits her voice very well.6. No One Know How To Love Me Quite Like You Do (5/5)-the beat reminds me of Janet's You Want This. Great song todance to!7. I'm So Into You (5/5)-typical fluffly love song, but it sounds really nice.8. Street Thing (5/5)-I could hear the R.Kelly influence in her voice. She displays alot more soul in this songthan the others and it's the only song where she showcases her upper range in which she did not do very often. This is the side of her I enjoy seeing.9. Young Nation (5/5)-it has that same smooth, laidback like Age Ain't Nothing But A Number. Her vocals sound verysensual and very sexy especially with R.Kelly's.10. Old School(5/5)-I thought it was kinda boring at first, but it grew on me....11. I'm Down (5/5)-everytime I listen to this, it takes me back to the mid-90s and those saturday afternoonswatching soul train. i love the lil piano playing in the background.12. Back & Forth remix (4/5)-cool remix but I prefer the Ms.Mello remix. I wish they had included that remixinstead of Mr.Lee's one. I think it would have flow well with the smooth and laidback vibe of this album.Average rating: 4.75
Sad and weird it is, but the fact is that I hadn't bothered listening to Aaliyah before. All I knew was that she had starred in &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; alongside Jet Li.Now, I found out this morning she had been killed in a plane crash yesterday, in the Bahamas. So I figured: let me see who this girl really was!And I saw myself listening to her music, to be gladly surprised that she's not the common type of R&amp;B act at all: she died at 22, so that makes this 1994 album a remarkable feature, having recorded it age 14! If you listen to the sample tracks above, you'll be as amazed as I continue to be...I know her music will live in the hearts of all her fans, and will continue to gain the respect she well deserved. The biggest irony of all is that barely a month ago, her new album had hit the stores, one which the majority of the public reviewers here in Amazon have termed 'more mature' and 'eclectic'.R.I.P. Aaliyah
This cd was Aaliyah's debut cd, and it was very nice. R Kelly obviously had alot to do with this project since he can be heard all over it.  Aaliyah had a sweet and melodic voice, and I hadn't heard this cd in years. Some of my favorite songs are Back & forth, At your best, I'm so into you, Old school, and I'm down..If you are an Aaliyah fan get this asap!
The soulful, sexy, attractive, elegant, beautiful, talented Aaliyah has started it all with this album. Although this cd is almost 10 years old, it is still in my cd player non-stop. My all time favorite track is At Your Best(06)*. It is the most soulful track she has ever done. Others include Age Ain't Nothing But A Number(04), Back & Forth(03)*, and I'm Down(12). All the other tracks are incredible as well. These are the songs I play the most. I love her style and her whole everything. The tracks are smooth with her singing and then has a hip-hop flavor to it. I love it when an artist knows what sells and sticks with it. This cd sounds like it took time to do. The song selections on here are just amazing. I love her. This is what you call real music, not that techno, synthesized $h*t that is now called R&B. This is true and not overplayed. If a cd can last for 10 years and not sound out of date, then you made a successful album. This is one of the four she has! Much Love! (*These songs can be found on the I Care 4 U album + DVD)
If you're even a lukewarm fan of Brandy, Monica, Mya, Nivea, Ashanti, Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, Teirra Marie, Lumidee (did I miss any of the clones?), give THIS Aaliyah debut a good listen ...All of the aforementioned basically tried to come out behind a very distinctive path carved out by the GREAT Aaliyah: a true entertainer who combined dance, a girl power-esque image via assertiveness (she called it "street but sweet") and was the first to dare to put cool, smooth vocals over a blazing hip hop beat.Aaliyah was indeed one in a million ...Highly recommended LP.
Great work from Aaliyah an Kelly...She was known for working with the best but this is not flawless like the Red Album or Damn near perfect like One and a Million.It's still has many hit's like,Bacc and Forth!!! ft R Kelly,Age Ain't Nothing But a Number!!!,Down with the Clique,At Your Best!!!,Street Thing, & Young Nation!!!{The Best Tracc}
E-40 was a long-time veteran in the rap game when his seminal album "In a Major Way" was released in 1995. It's really the album that got E-40 noticed by a mainstream audience, and pushed Jive to ultimately stuff more money into his forthcoming albums (the next being "Hall Of Game" [1996]). This album rides the line between independent and mainstream lines ridiculously well. As far as rapping goes, E-40 is at the very top of his game, boasting his slang-filled flow with a cunning wit, that is arguably in peak form. Most notably, some of the best west coast rappers came to support Forty's untouchable style - 2Pac, Mac Mall & Spice 1 - who all perform flawlessly on the classic posse track "Dusted 'n' Disgusted"."Da Bumble" kicks off the album right after a solid intro. From this point on, we catch a glimpse of what the production will sound like throughout, although minimal, it bangs nicely. The production is mainly kept in-house, and is handled by Mike Mosley, Studio Ton & Funk Daddy among others. There are some stellar tracks here! "Sideways" featuring The Click's B-Legit & Mac Shawn is probably my favorite. The beat is tight, and is one of my favorite appearances from B-Legit. "Spittin'" is also one of my favorites. The album's front half burns brightly with bangers like these...it almost feels front-loaded with the goods, but truly boasts quality through and through. Then comes perhaps E-40's greatest single - "Sprinkle Me". The Click's Suga-T performs immaculately alongside Forty Water. The beat is tight and the lyrics are true to form. Other standouts are the aforementioned "Dusted 'n' Disgusted", and the breakthrough single "1-Luv". The quality of album tracks in the mix leaves the album free of filler.Consistent quality has always been part of E-40's repertoire. Consistently enjoyable full albums are another thing. "In a Major Way" is definitely his most consistent effort to date. Although the beat-makers will prove to hit harder on later albums, there has never been a set of beats/collaborators that E-40 has worked better with. This is one of the albums that defines the Bay Area in the rap world.
The third solo release, In A Major Way, from the self-proclaimed "Ambassator of the Bay" delivers a complete project with mainstream success.  E-40 speaks over "Intro" as he gives the ingredients contained in this album that ties with "Da Bumble" both produced by Sam Bostic & Mike Mosley with speed variences.  The objective is definately arranged for the trunk as 40 Water flows without any hooks, chorus or breaks, but his original multi-styled flow with charisma and energy as quoted "...he say / she say / b*tch, that away..."  "Sideways" featuring B-Legit & Mac Shon is for the riders hitting the strip or the block as E and B share verses highlighted by the catchy hook.  "...big timer, timer / 40 water..." "Sprinkle Me" featuring Suga T had all the perfect elements with a memerable hook, perfect delivery and production makes this a highlight with a mainstream feel.  Taking it to the streets with all star support from 2Pac, Mac Mall & Spice 1 on "Dusted 'N' Disgusted" as each shined with their signature flow.  Performed as a letter to a friend in jail "1-Luv" featuring Leviti poses the reality of simply living and E-40 did not miss a beat.  Relating to getting high and getting drunk for serious smokers and drinkers, "Smoke 'N' Drank", was written with just that in mind.  "Dey Ain't No" is dark with an incessant deep bass enriched by a piano silhouette to give this LP a more street feel.  Speaking about the street games, E-40 spits on how to invest into businesses for a legal hustle on "Fed" featuring Suga T.  Sharing verses with B-Legit & Celly Cel representing the "H.I. Double L." side of Vallejo, California on how they live.  "It's All Bad" is about life in the ghetto and changing times comparing it to excerpts found in the Bible.  This song was enlighened at the conclusion with a surprise guest by E-40's son with a solid performance.  The "Outro" only left the listener craving another dosage of this sixteen track album.
After dropping two underground albums, E-40 came out with In A Major Way, which is an instant classic.  E-40 is from Vallejo, and after dropping this album he proved he had everything it took to be the next West Coast rap star.  His crazy, comical, hip style is a pleasure to listen to.  Also, the beats on this album are some of the best I've heard in a while.  They have a richness to them, which is real good.  Production comes from very accomplished producers like Sam Bostic and Mike Mosely, Studio Tone (who produced some tracks for Kurupt), Funk Daddy, and a few others.  Also, E-40 raps extremely fast on some tracks, and it took me a couple listens to get it when I first started listening to him a long time ago.  However, after a listen, everything sounds clear as a bell!  He's also got an amazing guest list: Tupac, Suga T, Mac Mall, Spice 1, B-Legit, Mac-Shawn, and Celly Cel to name a few.  But most of the tracks have E-40 going solo, which is good too, because it's good to see he's not just relying on others to guest on his album.  Overall the tracks sound &quot;Hipper than a hippopotamous&quot;.The album starts off with this introduction over a slower beat, but then moves into the crazy funked out &quot;The Bumble&quot;.  E-40 rips this track to shreds, and the beat is bananas!  Definitely one of the most original beats I've heard in a while.  &quot;Sideways&quot; also has a tight bouncy beat, and E-40 and B-Legit trade lines on it with class.  Mac-Shawn does the chorus, clever lyricism on here too.  &quot;Spittin'&quot; has a heavy, sunny funk beat.  E-40 comes with a real nice intro at the beginning, but sounds nice throughout.  &quot;Sprinkle Me&quot; is a classic single, with a fun, sunny beat and Suga T (E-40's sister) guests on it.  They make a nice sibling team.  Sprinkle me mayne!  &quot;Dusted And Disgusted&quot; like everyone else says, is a CLASSIC posse cut.  It features Tupac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.  The way the beat changes is so dope.  E-40 holds his own against three other great emcees.  Part of the beat is a nice, laid-back one, and the other is a rough gangsta beat.  &quot;One Love&quot; is a nice light-hearted track where 40 gets personal.  Great line: &quot;This ain't no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap/This here is serious, more realistic than radio-shack&quot;.  Actually sounds like it could've been a huge hit even today.  &quot;Smoke And Drink&quot; has more of a Zapp sound to it.  E-40 raps really fast on it, but nicely, and the beat has this cool groove to it, and I love the refrain!  &quot;They Ain't Know&quot; is a slower song about street life and gettin' money.  The lyrics are worth listening to.  &quot;Fed&quot; has a GREAT bouncing bass beat, and E-40 rips it, the tune sounds kind of familiar from something else, it's catchy.  &quot;H-i-Double-L&quot; is a classic ode to Vallejo featuring B-Legit and Celly Cel who both tear it up along with 40.  The beat is nice and sounds like the kind of thing for the car.  &quot;Bootsee&quot; is a tight funky track about a busta named &quot;Bootsee&quot;.  I'm sure you're familiar with someone in real life who fakes and claims to be tough when they're really just fakin' it.  &quot;It's All Bad&quot; is a darker track where 40 speaks on various subjects in life.  He knows the game well.Overall if you like Bay Area rap, you probably have this, but if you don't try it.  E-40 tears it up everytime he's on the mic on this record, and the beats are amazing.
This is easily E-40's best work. &quot;In a Major Way&quot; is top-notch material from beginning to end. The beats provide classic West Coast g-funk, while 40's flows and linguistics are solid as usual.Nearly every track is equal in calibur, but the 3 stand-outs would probably be the classic &quot;Dusted &amp; Disgusted,&quot; &quot;1-Luv,&quot; and &quot;Spittin.&quot;There's not one weak track on here. If you're into the West Coast sound, and even if you're not, this is an album you should definitely have in your collection.The West could use another album of this calibur these days.
In a Major way is E-40's best album, a Bay Area classic. The Vallejo Boss Playa just blew up on this amazing album. Features the unmatchable beats by Mike Mosley &amp; Sam Bostic, Funk Daddy and Studio Ton. The album is  perfect from start to end and it's got the two classic cuts : Sprinkle Me  (feat. Suga T) and the one and only Dusted 'n' Disgusted, which has one of  the TIGHTEST beats I've ever heard, combined with BREATHTAKING verses by  the greatest rappers - SPICE 1, 2PAC, MAC MALL AND 40 WATER! The album also  features 40's long time partner B-Legit and also Mac Shawn, Levitti and  Celly Cel. This album takes the Sick Wid It Mob sound to a whole new level  and E-40 continues to develop his own unique style, inventing new slang and  always comming with fresh delivery.
Umm... What shall I say 'bout this one? It's pretty easy, if you like westcoast rap you gon' love this one! E-40's best all around and probarly one of Bay Area's finest, up there together with Mac Mall's Illegal Business?.E-40 never dissapoints me and after dropping so many albums, he still hasn't got the props he deserves.The whole Bay Area is painfully underated.Mac Mall, Spice 1, E-40 and his Sick-Wid-It records click and Ray Luv, these are my favorites outta Bay Area.Buy anything by them and show love, 'cause it basically don't get pretty much better than this type of Westcoast rap.One word for this record : Classic.I don't even have to mention highlights 'cause they're all great, but my favorite probarly is Dusten 'N' Disgusted featuring 2Pac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.Get this one, it will make you money worth, no doubt.
E-40 is at his best on this album.  He may rap about hustlin, sex, and violence like many of his peers, but the way he does it is inventive.  He created much of the slang we use today.  This album is laced with hard mobb beats ("Dusted and Disgusted"), melodic G-Funk laden with whiny keyboard riffs("Drank and Smoke"), and even a track with a beat hinting of what we call today "crunk" (1 Luv).  He paired these neat beats with with his tongue twisting flow.  Most of the songs on the album are classics; the ones that aren't are still tight.  Bump this funky materpiece from the yay while sittin' sideways in a lac!
This is 40 Waters second best{just behind element of...}.Intro{that's one of the best intro's i ever heard},Spittin',Sprinkle Me{I can't celieve vibe did not add this classic tracc on there 50 greatest duets of all time}{smh},Dusted 'n' Disgusted,1Luv is crazy,Bootsee,H.I. Double L,Dey Ain't No,Smoke & Drank,Sideways,The Bumble, & It's All Bad ft his lil son.
Slipped lipped, body snatchin', thugroovalishus, playa for playa, and ego trippy, E-40's has been my favorite rapper since he and the Click came &quot;Down 'N Dirty&quot; in the 90's. I like this one the best because my  favorite &quot;Fed-&quot; is on it, but anyone of E-Dollah Dawg's cuts are  good from any  of his or the Click's CDs...
R. Kelly's self titled third album and second solo release has everything the others have with more exploring of his boundaries and even spirituality as done on "Intro - the Sermon", "Heaven If You Hear Me", "As I Look Into My Life" and "Trade In My Life".  R. takes it to a club scene with "Hump Bounce" as he states "...everyday, every night humpin' and bouncin' is all I wanna do..."  "You Remind Me Of Something" is a mid-tempo tune where he compares a woman to a jeep, his sound, his cars and his bank account.  She must be something especially nice then.  The mood changes to a bit more sexual atmosphere with the inviting "Step In My Room" and he makes offers to anything you want on "Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby..."  The classic love or anti-love song with 70 feels about creeping on "Down Low (Nobody Has To Know)" featuring Ronald & Ernie Isley.  He then begs for forgiveness and wants his lover to come back with "I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)".  "Thank God It's Friday" has the same feel of his later hit "Step In The Name Of Love".  To the rescue, he comes in with "Love Is On The Way" for another mid-tempo bass filled song.  "Religious Love" is simple and have feelings of depths undiscovered for a single person as he prays for love.  He slows the motion to almost still as the lights turn down low on "Tempo Slow".  The sixteen songs which were written and produced by R. Kelly seem never-ending and on the other hand it seems too short.  But it will be kept on repeat.
Very few albums out at the moment are so good that you can listen to it from start to finish. Although this is far more mellow and laid-back than just about all of Kelly's other albums, the consistant quality of the songs make this a treat to the ears.Kelly has said that it was around this time that he discovered God. God really must have inspired him, as it is far greater than his previous work (although 12 Play is a classic).Just about the best ballad Kelly ever wrote (&quot;I Can't Sleep Baby (If I) is probably the best song on the album, followed closely by the mid tempo &quot;Thank God It's Friday&quot;. The multi-octave style of Marvin Gaye can be seen used here. It is a pity Kelly doesn't use it anymore.If you are just getting into his work and are not going for the more hardcore elements of &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, get this album as it will really open the door to what tis guy is trying to say.
i cant get enough of this CD. all the songs are STR8. this CD is a musy buy.
This is the album that really made me take notice of "Tha Rrah"! I gave it a 5 star rating because as a music lover, any album that grabs my attention & allows me to listen all the way through without skipping is classic in my book.  This album just flows from song to song, no production flaws, no songs that jarred my sensabilities.There's not a bad song on this disc but the standouts to me are:You Remind Me of Something - classic slow jam for the 90's(You To Be Happy) w/ Notorious B.I.G. - great collaboDown Low - who can forget that epic videoI Can't Sleep Baby - love this song!Trade in My Life - as powerful as "I Believe I Can Fly"
You could think that this was his first album based on the eponymous title of it, but it was his third album after "Born Into the 90's" from 1992 together with Public Announcement, althought it sounded like a R. Kelly affair all the way, and then the sexual explicit "12 Play" from 1993. This album was released in 1995 and stands as one of his best albums to date, only "12 Play" and "R" can measure with it. This is a quite easily accessible album since it doesn't follow any trend or theme, no overwhelming sexual lyrics nor a overpretentious Step album either. It got a great mix of the best, some faster songs but many wonderful tearjerking ballads aswell, infact some of the greatest R. Kelly songs are actually found here. There isn't much filler either nor any annoying hip hop collaborations like we saw on latter albums, no, "R Kelly" stands strong on it's own and as a whole this is a fantastic story of trade mark R. Kelly songs that fans would drool over.The album starts with "Hump Bounce" that actually, based on it's name sound like it would have been on "12 play", it's a sexy midtempo with lyrics both from a woman and a rapper. A very good song. "Not Gonna Hold You" is a semi-ballad that also feautures female vocals, "You Reminds Me Of Something" stands as one of his best ballads to date, songs like this made R. Kelly one of the most promising songwriters of the 90's. "Step Into My Room", yet another laidback sexy ballad. Perhaps also better for his previous album?. "Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby" yet another laidback soulish ballad. "(You To Be) Happy" is midtempo soul."Down Low" is one of my favorite R. Kelly songs, it's a very poignant ballad feauturing Ron and Ernie Isley, the great video also which portraited R. Kelly in the middle of a fatal jelousy drama. "I Can't Sleep" follows the trend of slow jamz while "Thank God It's Friday" is a excellent club song, even if it's slick. "Love Is One the Way" is yet another good midtempo, "Heaven" is only a interlude but "Religious Love" shows some of his more faithful sides. "Tempo Slow" is one of the slower songs of this album, it's dreamy and meditative. Next song called "As I Look Into My Life" is also more of a interlude but "Trade My Love" closes this album well, another midtempo that is."R.Kelly" is one of his best albums, needless to say it captures you with it's mix of slick and sexy ballads and midtempo's and it doesn't contain much filler either. If You're new to R. Kelly start with this one or "12 Play". This album is more clean though. 5/5
I listened to this CD and I was amazed. This CD starts off fast, then at the end it is slow and calm. The last song is an inspirational song which sounds soooo good. Pick up this album because it is worth it.
I love R Kelly and all his material, and I love this album the best out of all I've heard of his.  I have almost all of his cd's but out of all of those, and in fact out of all I own, I still listen to this cd real often.  It's the best.  I love love love Down Low, Can't Sleep (Baby) and Thank God It's Friday - they are the best cuts on here.  He's such a great talent, and so underrated.  He's soulful and a joy to listen to.  Despite whatever goes on in his personal life, he remains one of my top favourite singers ever.  Down Low is among my top 10 favourite songs of all times and I could listen to this cd over and over again, never get sick of it.
This album in my opinion is R's finest of all. Sadly 1995's "R. Kelly" seems slept on (Due to a lack of real hit singles?), which is a damned shame as he never got as deep before or since. It is mature, beautifully orchestrated and he had now found his own vibe. "Born Into The 90s" and to a lesser extent "12 Play" were soaked with the influence of Guy's New Jack era material and although both (especially the later) had great chart friendly appeal, this album is his fully realised masterpiece.Operating within the framework of a gospel themed intro and closure, R. is on best behaviour and there is little of the shallow, thug posturings that on occasion have hurt his recent releases like "R" and "TP-2.Com". There is a chilled, bumping flow throughout and this is no better exemplified than on probably my favourite R. Kelly track of all, "Down Low". The chemistry between R and Ronald Isley (Brother Ernie assisting on guitar) is beautiful to behold. A true epic, laid back jam. "Contagious" the sequel (On Isley Brothers' "Eternal" album) is equally excellent.Other highlights to be found include "You Remind Me Of Something" with it's humourous metaphors and "(You To Be) Be Happy" which effortlessly works a Notorious BIG rap in. There's the usual quality bedroom ballad "Step In My Room", yet he ploughs a deeper grain with the exquisite "I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)". "Hump Bounce" and "Thank God It's Friday" are prime relaxed, head nodders.There's not a weak moment to be found and the LP's self titled moniker of "R. Kelly" surely comes from the work here being the ultimate personal statement of his artistic muse. Despite the relative inconsistency of subsequent efforts I'm sure he can sleep well, rest assured that in this album he produced a true work of class no matter what the future holds...
I truly dig this Album alot&more as time passes it just gets better with time.Between this Album,12play&Chocolatefactory/Loveland R.Kelly to me Has made 3 of the Most Important Albums since 1990.this Album Combines many elements that truly highlight R.Kelly as a Writer,Producer,arranger&His Vocals truly soar here.rocking it with Biggie on "You to be Happy" that Jam is my cut."thank god it's friday" is a Knockout Jam that truly gets me hyped on the weekends."Dow Low nobody has to now" with the Great Ronald Isley is a Hall of Fame Song that still is tight."Religious Love" works as well.this Soulful Genius is unstoppable when He allows His Musical Strengths to direct His Flow.
Before the release of this album I thought the 12 Play was his best but this self-titled release blew that album out of the water. I love 12 Play and it would still gets spins till this day but this album got more spins from me than that album. This album came out at a time when R&B; gave you quality artists with tight albums so you couldnt go wrong with R Kelly back then. You could go wrong with him now because he's trying to hard to remain relevant by making songs for teenagers like that's all his fanbase consists of. At any rate....You Remind Me Of Something was the summer jam and I refuse to let some corny cable channel that nobody watches and some lame ragazine that is the b*st*rd child of Rolling Stone magazine tell me different. R Kelly is at his best when he does the slow jams like Step In My Room, Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby, Religious Love and the fantastic I Cant Sleep. I love Tempo Slow. It has a unique concept where the tempo of the song changes after every chorus(you would rarely find an artist that creative now and when one does come around stupid hoity-toity critics will knock them for being unconventional). The late Notorious Big makes his presence felt in (You To Be) Be Happy. Hump Bounce and Thank God Its Friday are dynamite party songs. Down Low feat The Isley Brothers is the beginning of the Mr Biggs/R Kelly saga. The album closes off with Trade In My Life. There are no bad songs to be found on here and that in itself is rare with 2000 R&B.;R Kelly's self-titled sophomore release is his best album point blank period. Its shows his range as an artist. It shows his talent at songwriting and it shows that he was a giant in the game that was here to stay. Pick it up if you are interested in what real R&B; is supposed to sound like.Standouts: YOU REMIND ME OF SOMETHING, STEP IN MY ROOM, BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY, DOWN LOW, I CAN'T SLEEP BABY, RELIGIOUS LOVE, TEMPO SLOW and TRADE IN MY LIFE.
12 Play was the first.

This is a personal classic of mine....The album dropped almost 9 years ago, I cant believe its been that long!!!Overall, its one of the best hip hop albums ever produced...Bun B and Pimp C rip the beats apart....Classic material throuout...IF ya haven't come across this album, pick it up now---you'll love it
Port Arthur, Texas' own Pimp C and Bun B return for the third time with Ridin' Dirty.  Underground Kingz start the album off with a touching reality song about life on "One Day" featuring 3-2 over a soulful southern instrumental.  Next on "Murder" a more up-tempo track with a continuous loop as the duo each take on a verse.  For a classic old school feel, "Pinky Ring" has a funk sample as Pimp C sings the hook.  The southern accents are apparent, but on "Diamonds & Wood" it contains a DJ Screw sample for the chorus.  On a late night tip "3 In The Mornin'" is a tale of being out in the streets during the wee hours of the day.  "F*** My Car" is about how women choose by what type of car they drive.  They take it back to the streets with "That's Why I Carry" featuring N.O. Joe on the reasons why they carry guns.  UGK reach for higher grounds and spiritual guidance on "Hi-Life".  For another aspect that's still non-mainstream, but a club swinging tune "Good Stuff" will have listeners bouncing and nodding their heads to this.  Laid back sounds to end the LP off with the title track for clean and clear production.  "Outro" is a shout out track by Pimp C over another laid back track to complete the mood and overall fell of Ridin' Dirty.  Seven of the thirteen tracks were produced by underrated UGK's own Pimp C.  Underground Kingz took us for a ride with good instrumentation, lyrics and presentation for southern hip-hop / rap.
Yesterday was a sad day for rap/hip-hop, as officials found Chad "Pimp C" Butler, 1/2 of the group U.G.K., dead in his hotel room in Los Angeles. It's a shame that such a talented artist who helped elevate southern rap died at a young age (he was 33). In memory of him, I decided to spin their third album on Jive Records "Ridin' Dirty". An album full of funky, laid back production and some great wordplay by both Bun B and Pimp C, just how I like it. Hearing this album, there are songs on here that reflect on life such as "One Day" (hearing the hook on that song is so depressing), as well as "Hi-Life", a song about the duo getting their life straight. The former song features Rap-A-Lot member Tre-Deuce (Mr. 3-2), and he also appears on "Touched". Another standout would be "Diamonds & Wood" has an excellent chopped & screwed sample for a hook that makes the song impressive. Other great songs on here are "F My Car" as well as the mello funky bass track "Ridin' Dirty". I would say that the latter is my favorite song on this LP because the song is so laid back. The album ends with the outro, as Pimp C giving shoutouts.Overall, this album is a southern classic. This is a huge improvement over their previous albumSuper Tight.... I'm glad I picked this up a while ago, because this album dropped in 1996, and it still sounds fresh today. The production on here is excellent, comming close to such funky albums asGet in Where You Fit Inor along those lines. Most of the songs on here clock in at over five minutes, so there is plenty of funk for a listener to digest. To tell you the truth, I also believe this album was slept on, and should have made UGK a household name. This is one I recommend everyone, especially fans of southern rap, to check this out. This album is not too expensive as of now, so that gives you a reason to give it a listen. It's one of those albums you can just pop in, roll one up (if you smoke), and just ride to. Trust me, you're going to feel this one, if you know how southern rap is supposed to sound like. It's sad now that the Pimp is gone, because southern rap will never be the same.

UGK's third album is the album when they came with it lyrically.  Their other albums were built around thumping grooves and samples with playalistic rhymes about life.  While they still rap about their lives, now they are RIPPING songs to shreds.  Bun B comes into his own on this album and proves why his name is mentioned among the most slept on mc's ever to grace a mic.  The production as always is excellent and the samples are still going on on this album.  And if there was ever a song to pop that collar to, it would have to be "Pinky Ring", that song is for the playas around the way.  The album's title "Ridin Dirty" does the album justice as it is perfect for your car while you are just cruising around.  "Diamonds & Wood" is just playalistic cruising with one hand on the wheel seat back in that gangsta lean...just chillin and ridin.  I would compare this album to Outkast's first album "SPCM", every joint is borderline classic if not a classic.  "3 In the Mornin",  "One Day",  "F... My Car", the title track, and "Hi Life" are all bumping tracks.  Any true hip hop fan should have at least heard this album and more likely than not own it somehow someway.  Dirty South Masterpiece.  Five stars easily.
The best group of the south puts out one of the best albums I ever heard (I have over 700) for their 3rd group effort.  Rightfully earning the name Underground Kingz on this one.  2 years after their 4.5 star "Super Tight" the boyz from Port Arthur come out Strong.  Only 11 songs and nowhere near a weak spot on the album (except possibly the skits), 4 are classics, 2 are almost classics, and the other 5 are good or great songs.  Production is great as well.  Pimp C does 5 songs, N.O. Joe does 4 and Sergio does 2.  Guests rap on 2 songs, and do the hooks on a few , so you get alot of Pimp C and Bun B.  a definite classic that everyone should own, one of the best rap albums ever, period!#2 - 8 (f/ 3-2)#3 - 10 (CLASSIC w/ great beat and some great hard verses)#4 - 9.5 (another great beat)#5 - 8.5#6 - 10 (CLASSIC w/ great beat -- f/ Big Smokin Mitch)#7 - 10 (Another CLASSIC -- great beat --- f/ 3-2)#8 - 8#9 - 10 (CLASSIC w/ great beat -- f/ N.O.

Ridin' Dirty is most def. some of Pimp C & Bun B's best.  Great Southern Fried Funk with a hard gangsta lean.  These guys pioneered southern hip hop, this is the real deal.  If ya like some fresh, country flava with your beats..cop this
Classic cd, represents the south good, with songs like one day, murder, Hi life and ridin dirty makes this cd good for the collection. They even give dj screw props in a song. Better cd then dirty money, with pimp c's smooth flows and bun b's lyrics makes this cd a keeper.Free Pimp C
Long before Chamillionaire was "Ridin' Dirty"(which was questionably changed to simply "Ridin'" when it made radio waves) on the charts, the Underground Kingz were ridin' dirtier than anyone else in the game; and to this day, this is still one of the grimiest records to come from the Dirty South. This is arguably UGK's greatest album(although Dirty Money is also a classic album), and was quite a few years before UGK were first exposed to the mainstream with Hova's "Big Pimpin'."Some people new to the game probably think that Bun B, who makes a guest appearance on seemingly every Southern rapper's album, is some new cat who's trying to make waves in the underground. While I can see why they'd think this(Bun B is always hungry when he raps, leading one to believe he's trying to make an impact on the industry - despite the fact he already has made a significant one), Bun B has been in the biz for well over a decade, alongside his partner in rhyme(although, 'in crime' maybe more appropriate for Pimp C than it is for most), Pimp C. Together, they're the Underground Kingz, who identify themselves by the acronym of UGK. When they first came into the game, the South was obscure; now that it's blown up(especially their native land of Texas), one would think that UGK would get better publicity. Unfortunately the Kingz' publicity still doesn't compare to their skills, and only true heads have been able to check out their undeniably dope music.Hailing from Port Author, they may not be Houstonians, but they still possess the love of flossin', and grindin', as well as slow hypnotic beats, and equally entrancing flows. On Ridin' Dirty, UGK provide one of the most revered music to ever come from the South; and for good reason. While one may criticise them for their admittedly limited subject matter(whips, drips, chips, tips, and tricks), they deliver their raps with so much finesse, and style that you can't help but overlook these issues. No matter how much these things are rapped about, UGK always provide an interesting take on them, complete with captivating rhymes, and superb flows. Their production? Just as somber, yet hypnotic as their flows.Highlights? I'd say this album has gems, but in all honesty, it's a complete gold mine. Every single track on this album is a five-star cut, and even the outro has a dope enough beat to warrant it that label, despite the fact it's all shout-outs. Whether it's the smoothed out, Isley-sampled "One Day," the gritty "Murder," the Southern anthem "Diamonds & Wood," or the impressive showing of wordplay on "Touched"(which Jay-Z lifted a verse from on "99 Problems"), this album has something for every hip-hop head. If you're a fan of Southern rap, then you need this album; if you're a detractor of Southern rap, you also need to this album to show you just how great it is. If you're a head who isn't prejudices to coasts or regions, this album will have constant rotation, and you too will be able to appreciate the dopeness that is UGK.
...these boys done f@&amp;ked around and got a triple-double with this!  the production on here is rich and deep...you can play this on your granmama's ol' clock radio and its gonna make you sit up and lissen! it's true, tho, they aint sayin a whole lot...references to drugs and sex are integrated into damn near every verse!  but they are so skilled in creating lyrical landscapes and the production is so tight that true hip hop fans wont complain too much...but if you want insight and meaning then check out mos def, talib, outkast or any of the old school recordings that are still out there.  these boys only wanna keep it crunk.
Comin out of Texas, UGK's third full-length Jive album "Ridin' Dirty" is contradictious, because the rhymes are dirty, but the beats are clean as hell!!  The album is bumpin' from start to finish.  The production is some of the best I have ever heard from any region, south, north, west, east, whatever.  Production is held by Pimp C, 3-2, N.O. Joe, and Sergio.  Beats are heavy Southern G-Crunk and deep-fried funk, with some smoother joints. The lyricism is awesome.  I love the way these two flow and complement each other.  "One Day," produced by 3-2, is a deeper song about the unpredictable ways of life, and how some heads are really trippin' over a gorgeous, faster, twangy Isley sampled beat.  "Murder" is a crazy and awesome crunk type joint with heated flows; check the bass on this one.  "Hi-Life" is smoother, slow rollin' G-Funk dropping street sociology about the drug trade cycle, a classic!  A cool street jam is "That's Why I Carry" over a heavy N.O. Joe (he also raps the hook); this one explains why they stay strapped.  "Good Stuff" is a danceable, twangy sex joint.  "Pinky Ring" is a dope pimpin' joint with deep twang; just listen to those guitar riffs, a nice joint to roll in the cady with the fuzzy dice hangin' off the mirror!  You can hear the DJ Screw influence in "Diamonds And Wood," beat by Pimp C, a slower crunkish joint, an awesome rider anthem for flossin' your whip.  3 In The Mornin' is perfect for the late night cruise; the beat is relaxed G-Funk influenced, but with less melody.  This has to be their best album.  It just has an awesome vibe to it, and is one of my favorite albums in my collection, and the album is a pinnacle and a standard setter for southern rap!  This is my first UGK album, and it solidified me as afan of theirs.
This album in my opinion is a definate classic. Alot of rappers today that are from the South really got influenced by this one. You can tell by all the samples they use in their songs and some of the song titles, liek Chamillionaire's "Ridin' Dirty" for example. Bun B and Pimp C's best album also. IF you like ol' skool gangsta rap or southern rap, this is a MUST BUY!TOP TRACKS:One DayMurderPinky RingDiamonds & WoodHi Life
Terrific pop CD has some of the best songs of the late-nineties on it. &quot;As Long As You Love Me,&quot; and &quot;Quit Playing Games With My Heart&quot; were smash hits and are still favorites on soft rock stations  all over USA. Now,there is a lot of controversy over if Backstreet or 'N  Sync(that other group) are better. I like both,but Backstreet Boys always  will be my favorites. They're the kings of ballads and have a couple great  up-beat songs(mostly on this one.) 'N Sync are the more hip-hoppy group if  you like that stuff. Their first CD was great and I thought the second that  everyone is fussing over is horrible. There's only about two good songs on  it. So,I definately say to get this(the Backstreet Boys debut),and their  second release Millenium. If you like these,you'll probably like 'N Sync's  first CD too. You won't be disappointed with any of these three.
The Backstreet Boys became highly admired dominantly by young girls just like New Kids On The Block in the late 80's and early 90's. In 1997 when this album was released,it sold by the dozens just like Hanson's MIDDLE OF NOWHERE album. Hit songs include EVERYBODY(Backstreet's Back)*,QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEART,I'LL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART,ALL I HAVE TO GIVE and AS LONG AS YOU LOVE ME,all later recycled for 2001's THE HITS-CHAPTER ONE. SET ADRIFT ON MEMORY BLISS contains music excerpts for Spandau Ballet's TRUE. Personally,this album,like every other BSB album,I believe is one of the greatest ever recorded. It continued to sell well throughout 1998. *How could that be? They just started.
As a person with a variety of musical tastes, loving everyone from Bjork who is my all time favorite, to Loreena McKennitt to Mel C...(you get the idea) you can pretty much tell that I realize that this isn't the deepest music, but who cares? As Duke Ellington said, &quot;If it sounds good, it IS good&quot;, so I don't see why everybody feels like they have to hate fun music that gets you through the day, even if song twelve of this album is something less than savory in sentiment. I like the Backstreet boys a lot and I think this album is just great! Boy-band music is always fun, unless they do too many ballads, and as a great lover of dance, club, and overall danceable and enjoyable music I play this album a whole lot. And even if two of the ballads are slightly boring and both start with someone whispering &quot;baby..&quot;, there's something kind of sweet about them. Though their second album as a whole has slightly better overall production and is more introspective and thoughtful and is, I think, preferable to this, this is still a great album and is great fun. So if you just want something fun and nice to listen and dance to, buy this album. I think you'll really enjoy it and even be caught bouncing around the room to it alot.
I remember this album when I was the 5th and 6th Grade. This album is a keeper! This album is armed with powerful harmonies, groove friendly beats, passionate ballads, a dynamic stage show and charisma that will not be denied, They were ready to show USA what the rest of the planet has already figured out: They are more than a phenomenon, they are here to stay. This album has been certified 14x Platinum. Remember, this was 1997-1998.
This is the greatest CD of all time. Though Millennium is a VERY close second, this CD has it all! My faves are &quot;Quit Playing Games&quot; &quot;We've Got It Going On&quot; &quot;I'll Never Break Your Heart&quot; &quot;Everybody&quot; and &quot;Backstreet's Back&quot; Because they all have their own sound. The Backstreet Boys are my favorite group now and forever. I hope Kevin and Brian have very happy, successful marriages, but just incase, keep my e-mail!
I've been a huge fan of the Backstreet Boys since '97, and I have each and everyone of their albums. All of them are GREAT! This one, however, is their American debut (they've had two other Import albums before this one). I think it's a rockin' CD that shows the more fun, relaxed side of the BSB. Every song on this CD is awesome (well, with the exception of one song!). So here's the run-down:"We've Got It Goin' On" - - this is the very first single the BSB had. They first released it in the US, but it didn't do very well on the charts so they decided to try Europe...and it became a major hit! This is a groovy, upbeat song and the lyrics are awesome. So are the Boys' vocals."Quit Playin' Games (With My Heart)" - - you've all heard this song before. I personally love it and it never gets boring or old!"As Long As You Love Me" - - still my favorite ballad on this CD. You've all heard this one, too."Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" - - the CD I have doesn't include this song, but I have the single for it and it rocks! You've all heard this song so you decide."All I Have To Give" - - a great ballad. The vocals and lyrics are smooth and solid, and so is the music. You've all heard this one, I believe."Anywhere For You" - - a cool love ballad. The lyrics and vocals are wonderful."Hey, Mr. DJ (Keep Playin' This Song)" - - an awesome uptempo dance song. The lyrics are cool and so are the BSB vocals."I'll Never Break Your Heart" - - one of my favorite love ballads. And what they say is true: They never WILL break my heart! Beautiful lyrics and vocals."Darlin'" - - OK song. Brian does great here. But not one of my favorites."Get Down (You're The One For Me)" - - an awesome uptempo song! I just love it. The lyrics, music, and vocals are amazing."Set Adrift On Memory Bliss" - - I think this is the only song by the BSB that I ever disliked. It shouldn't have been included here. Really bad."If You Want It To Be Good Girl (Get Yourself A Bad Boy)" - - my favorite uptempo song! Nick's lead vocals are awesome (I think Nick is so gorgeous and talented!). This song should NOT be missed.All in all, terrific CD. It's great for a party or just for having a good time and relaxing. Nick, Howie, Brian, AJ, and Kevin were al much younger when they recorded this CD, but that doesn't make them bad! BACKSTREET BOYS - if you haven't got it yet - is the one CD you shouldn't miss out on! ... This CD rocks!!
