Enya is one of a few artists whom I consider successful at creating this type of electronic atmospheric and dreamlike music. For certain, The Memory Of Trees is melodic, romantic and sensuous. Roma Ryan's lyrics, sung in  Gaelic by Enya (Athair Ar Neamh), float gently like pillow-soft white  clouds. The compositions are relaxing and harmonious (Tea House Moon),  dreamlike and filled with mystery (Once You Had Gold), and include subtle  touches of Celtic tradition (Enya's phrasing on `Hope Has A Place'). The CD  is a quiet and lush alternative to ninety-percent of the popular music on  the market today, and also a welcome substitute for the often hectic pace  of daily life. Enya's arrangement of the compositions on Memory is well  thought - the comparatively dramatic and uplifting `Anywhere Is' and `On My  Way Home' are placed so that the listener doesn't fall asleep.However,  I'm very leery when I read a dozen reviews of a particular musical release,  and all the writers rate the artist's work with five-stars. My hesitation  is not a matter of taste (listeners are free to condemn or rave about  whatever they please), but one of perspective. Is The Memory Of Trees a  musical ground breaking effort? Does it introduce a unique technique or  significantly alter a current genre of popular music? On close listening,  the electronic pseudo-symphonic music of Memory does not approach the  beauty or dynamics of an orchestra with real people playing real  instruments. Nor does Enya's multi-layering of her own voice have the same  rich sonic texture as a chorus comprised of real voices. Then again,  perhaps The Memory Of Trees (and all of Enya's work) is so provocatively  ethereal because it is surreal.
What is the big deal? Wouldn't it be nice and Caroline no are great songs. There's 3 more good songs and a nice instrumental and the rest is filler. Sure, its great for a Beach Boys album but in the great universe of music this is just a really good pop album.I suppose if I'd never heard jazz or classical music I too would think that Brian's use of vibraphone and glockenspiel was some sign of genius. And if I'd never heard the Platters, the Lettermen or Manhattan Transfer I too would think that the Beach Boys were a great vocal band. Brian brought a good sense of vocal and instrumental arrangement together with some good material to create a pop record that had more depth than most at the time of its release. Just keeping it real.
I feel that Pet Sounds is a listenable and pleasant, but marginal record from a listenable and pleasant, but marginal band. First, the good news: there's nothing as annoying as, say, Little Deuce Coup or Surfin' USA on this album, and the four a-sides (Wouldn't it Be Nice; Sloop John B; God Only Knows; Caroline, No) are easily better than even some of the Beach Boys' stronger hits (Fun, Fun, Fun; In My Room; Don't Worry Baby; even Good Vibrations). Nonetheless, there isn't much to this record outside of the hits and Brian Wilson's egotistical but enjoyable lament I Just Wasn't Made for These Times. The rest sounds silly and dated to my ears: when was the last time you listened to the title track? How about Let's Go Away for A While, I'm Waiting for the Day; Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder) or You Still Believe in Me? The group's lack of a good lyricist or instrumentalist hurts even further - the Beach Boys could harmonize, all right, but harmonies can only get you so far. Which is why The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Crosby, Stills & Nash and the Motown acts are all so much better than the Beach Boys - in addition to the harmonies, they also had interesting lyrics, solid instrumentalists, AND great melodies to back the singing up.I understand that this was a big influence on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, so it merits careful study for those hooked on '60's rock, as I am. But there are other '60's albums that influenced Sgt. Pepper's (Freak Out!; Blonde on Blonde; Aftermath; The Beatles' own Revolver) that are far better. This sounds distinctively like it was made 40 years ago. Sure, so do all the aforementioned albums, but they all have a timeless quality this one lacks. That leaves Pet Sounds as a good bunch of a-sides accompanied by pure fluff. All of that makes it one of the most overrated records of all time.
I have always liked some of the Beach Boys work but had never heard the much hyped Pet Sounds until recently. For thirty years plus now I've read critical reviews in this magazine or that praising Pet Sounds as the greatest album ever made. HOGWASH. Wouldn't it be nice if some of the reviewers who try to outdo one another in lavishing hosannas on Pet Sounds actually sat down, listened to the album objectively, and then wrote reviews that consisted of something other than a string of superlatives? I am not saying anything is wrong with the album, but in my opinion it is not even their best work, let alone the best album ever made.I listened to it a number of times to see if it would speak to me in some mystical voice as it seemingly has for others. No such luck. I find Pet Sounds to be an enjoyable album on which the best tracks are Wouldn't It Be Nice and Sloop John B. Simple as that. If you are a Beach Boys fan, then you will likely enjoy hearing both the stereo and mono versions of Pet Sounds as presented here. If you are not a Beach Boys fan though, this CD is unlikely to make you a convert.
The Beach Boys-Pet Sounds ***Honestly I don't get it. I have tried time and time again to give The Beach Boys a chance and I just don't get it. I know it is good time music and summer fun but for the most part I really just think they are overrated and I feel the same way about Pet Sounds. I totally understand that it was a landmark album and changed the way music was recorded and the way it could sound, but other then the production I don't get it. Yes it inspired Srg. Pepper by the Beatles but so what, so did Freak Out! by Frank Zappa and The Mothers Of Invention and that doesn't get half the acclaim this does.I think 'God Only Knows' is a great song....lyrically that is. Music wise I do feel the band could have done better. The melody is smooth as ice though. 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' is hands down one of the greatest pop songs of all time, no debate, I would even fight someone who dare says a bad thing about that tune. I must say though that 'Sloop John B' could have been better. The title track is really awful to my ears. 'Here Today' was misguided. 'Caroline No' may be the best song on the album and it rarely is spoke about.Now I know everyone is gonna vote not helpful on my review just because they disagree with me I wish you would be open minded about where I am coming from though like I have tried to be time and time again with The Beach Boys before you click no. I am just saying that this is not an album for everyone there for I don't understand the claim that it is one of the ten greatest albums of all time. Maybe someone could leave me a comment explaining it to me because I am not saying this is a bad album because its not, but it isn't amazing either.
I bought this CD back in August and I have only listened to it once(when I needed music to fall asleep to when there was nothing on the radio). I have heard that this CD is &quot;depressing&quot;, but when I heard it, I found  nothing depressing about. Maybe it was because I wasn't concentrating fully  on it, but I wasn't impressed. Maybe if I looked at the lyrics(if I could  find them) and found the true meaning of the songs I would like it better.  Maybe when I listen to it again, I'll give it a better review.
"Pet Sounds was a whale of an album during its own day, but it has been slowly surpassed over the past 40 years.  When "Pet Sounds" was released in 1966, it was indeed a musical masterstroke, an album whose lush orchestration forever changed the concept of pop music.  Yet there have been so many records released since that time that have gradually usurped this album's status as the definitive lush-pop album. "Dark Side of the Moon," "Loveless," "Disintegration," "Daydream Nation"...all these albums display a level of invention and sound density that makes "Pet Sounds"  sound very dated, much more so than, say, "Sgt. Pepper" or "Are You Experienced," two albums released at nearly the same time as this one.  And I know that some will say that those albums wouldn't have been possible without "Pet Sounds", but (to paraphase a Lou Reed lyric), 'what comes is often better than what came before.'While its sonic marvels have dulled over time, "Pet Sounds" still boasts some rich melodies and beautiful harmonies, as well as some heartfelt love songs.  It is a very good album, one that often borders on perfection--I really like "Caroline No" and "Wouldn't It Be Nice," but I can't give this collection of songs more than three stars because its style of pop music is now pass&eacute; and clich&eacute;, and there is no reason to elevate this particular album above so many others that are more innovative and timeless.  I think many critics canonize "Pet Sounds" just so they can gleefully (and wrongly) proclaim that there is an album better than those of The Beatles--"Pet Sounds" is a good pop album on its own terms, but it is not the 'greatest album of all time' that many believe it to be.
Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd have managed to adapt and introduce a whole new music genre with this important and seminal album.  The title is very apt and describes not just the music on this album but also the whole subgenre that developed from this later on.  Despite this, this album remains the standard by which all other pretenders will be judged.  I believe there are other versions especially the Japanese remastered one which provides a better sound quality than this version that I recommend to get if you can still find it.  What is remarkable about the album is Charlie Byrd's great guitar work.  Naturally Stan Getz plays up a storm throughout and his solo on the first track is brilliant but I believe Byrd's playing has been overlooked.  As a guitarist myself, I'm astounded by what he does on an acoustic guitar playing at high speed and great phrasing too!  Amazing what he accomplished in relative obscurity compared to the modern day guitar "gods" whose phrasing don't come close to what this guy displays on all the tracks here.  A great album and I highly recommend you try and get a more recently remastered version if you can.
3 1/2Relaxed classic known for being the first full-fledged American bossa nova record is not exactly gripping, but still tightly chill enough to constitute compositional significance, with the Getz/Byrd dynamic lending to some interesting synergy. Not quite the landmark of next years Gilberto collaboration, but completely important in its own right.
not really feeling this one as much as i thought i would considering everyone loves this album.  i think his self titled album has the better couple of premier beats on it then every beat on this album.  overall this one is mediocre for me
Boogie Down Productions leader KRS-One's reputation began to slip in the early '90s, as he spent more time educating than performing. He hit back at his critics with the slamming Return of the Boom Bap, his first official solo release. Leaving behind the detailed production of the last BDP album Sex and Violence, Boom Bap returns the MC to the spare, gritty territory of Criminal Minded. KRS-One sounds reinvigorated, as well, spitting out his rhymes with fury and intelligence. Although the record isn't as didatic as Edutainment or Sex and Violence, KRS-One hasn't made his lyrics simplistic, nor has he abandoned his cutting, intelligent social commentary. The combination of hard, basic beats and exciting rhymes makes Rerturn of the Boom Bap a genuine comeback for KRS-One, one of the founding figures of modern hip-hop.
overall, this is a pretty good album with a few outstanding cuts. "Outta Here", "I Can't Wake Up", and "Mortal Thought" are all fairly entertaining tracks that showcase KRS-One's gifted delivery and his creative flow. but the production of this record sounds dated and alot of the songs toward the end of the record are forgettable. i prefer the hardcore leanings of his BDP days rather than these semi-concious psuedo-ragga party jams. but KRS's voice is still a treat to listen to and this record is probably better than almost any other hip hop album put out in 1993.
When 12 Play first came out it was an absolute classic. However, I haven't listen to it for a long time and was surprised at how dated it is. Homie Lover Friend, Bump N Grind and Your Body's Callin' are the best cuts. Homie Lover Friend really connects with me because that is what I am looking for.Maybe one day I'll find her.
He's Kels, he's the R in R&B;, he's R, R. Kelly, and Robert Kelly.  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the album that made him.  It's called "12 Play".  It was released in 1993, which was a very good year for Kelly.  This is a must have album for any R&B; fan, because R. Kelly did such a great job.I enjoy listening to this album, the slower songs in particular.  In fact, the faster songs sound very dated, and they are the key reason I could only give this album 3 stars.  If this album was built on only his slower, sexier stars, it would easily be 5 stars.  "Homie Lover Friend", and "Freak Dat Body" are examples of the dated material I am speaking of.  Here, Kelly tries to rap, when, clearly, his forte is singing and producing.  "Summer Bunnies" is the only up tempo song that is good.  This is a very sexually driven piece of work, but that's alright, because R. Kelly is sexy and he knows how to croon.  Well, he's a little more blatant than his colleagues like Jaheim, Donell Jones and Tevin Campbell.  "Sex Me", "12 Play", "Your Body's Calling" and "Seems Like Your Ready" are so sensual, they would set the mood perfectly for a romantic evening.Overall, this is a nice album and I recommend it to all!Mikeisha's Top 51. Bump N Grind2. Your Body's Calling3. Sadie4. Summer Bunnies5. 12 Play
R. Kelly is a master of taking a completely juvenile, sexual song title like &quot;I Like the Crotch on You&quot; and flipping it with his smooth voice into some kind of bizarre love song. &quot;12 Play,&quot; his first album without the assistance of Public Announcement, proves that he could hold his own rolling solo. And while it isn't as polished or as popular as his later hit-making LPs, it's a solid release nonetheless.The album kicks off with the smooth-groovin' &quot;Your Body's Callin'.&quot; From there it's on the hit single &quot;Bump-N-Grind,&quot; the hip-hop-inflected &quot;Homie Lover Friend,&quot; and the first of many slow, sticky ballads, &quot;It Seems Like You're Ready.&quot;The back half of the album has most of the better songs. Tracks like the flossy &quot;Summer Bunnies&quot; and the uptempo &quot;Back to the Hood of Things&quot; are perfect for riding around on a hot summer's day, watchin' honeys. Also, &quot;Sex Me, Pts. I &amp; II&quot; succeeds, despite the fact that it's one song followed IMMEDIATELY by a remix of the exact same song. That was kind of a bone-headed move on the part of the producer, but it works, nonetheless.However, the pinnacle of the album comes in the form of a complete departure from the rest of the album. &quot;Sadie,&quot; an ode to Kelly's mother, is a beautiful mid-tempo ballad that makes you forget that he spent the rest of the album trying to get in your woman's panties.All in all, the sound of this album is a little dated. It's definitely early '90s R&amp;B with some hip-hop thrown in for effect. But it was a step towards defining the R&amp;B giant that would soon be R. &quot;I Wish I Could Fly&quot; Kelly.
R. Kelly's 12 Play album still holds up over a decade later.  Didn't like it at first because it overdoes it on the bump and grind songs and sexy themes.  It's steamy on a number of songs, especially Sex Me, It Seems That You're Ready, Your Body's Callin', the popular Bump and Grind and others.  But one of my favorites is not like that.  It's Sadie, R's remake of the Spinners' '70s classic, and I can't help but cry when I hear it, because he really sings it with soul.  After his album came out, there were floods of R&B artists riding on the steamy themes of it in late-93 and early '94.  But when the smoke cleared,this album still holds up.  This set the tone for his producing of later hits with his one-man band signature sound for people like Aaliyah, Changing Faces and others. Otherwise, this album would be best heard when making love in the bedroom at 1:44 am in the morning.
With R.Kelly in the backround whatever aaliyah lacks its made up by resources in the team that surrounds here.. there are definately some good songs on here, This is just the beginning for this chicago based  musician.great things are coming.
On Aaliyah's debut, it ain't hard to tell that R. Kelly found her. Most of the songs sound like Aaliyah is featured on them instead of them being her own songs like &quot;Back and Forth&quot; and &quot;Old School&quot; (R. Kelly's name is even being mentioned in the latter's chorus). One of the only moments that you can feel Aaliyah's ability is on the remake of The Isley Brothers' &quot;At Your Best&quot;. This album is still good to play in your stereo, but if you want a really good Aaliyah album, check out One in a Million (yeah, I know she has another album after that; I meant what I said).
Aaliyah's debut features a pleasant mix of r&b;/hip hop/pop that appealed to a wide audience.  What also helped fuel interest in her was the fact that she refused to reveal her age and had some mysterious ways about her during interviews.  I know it piqued my interest enough at that time such that I'd try to watch all of her interviews to see if she was really only 14 or 15 years old OR if she was actually in her 20s.I loved the fact that there was no negative rivalry mess started up between Aaliyah & Brandy since they were both bringing individual flair to the r&b; field.  It was cute how people called Brandy, a young Whitney Houston while Aaliyah was being touted as a younger Janet Jackson.This is an interesting album featuring production from then up & coming R Kelly where he utilizes hard hip hop beats in contrast to Aaliyah's sweet airy vocals.The standout tracks to me are: BACK & FORTH, AGE AIN'T NOTHING BUT A NUMBER, AT YOUR BEST (YOU ARE LOVE), I'M SO INTO YOU, STREET THING & NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO LOVE ME QUITE LIKE YOU DO (although a little monotonous, I still love the beats).I'd recommend it to Aaliyah fans and to those who are curious about mid-90s r&b;.
With his thrid CD in three years, R.Kelly delivered more of his usual antics. While this CD had it's moments it also had it's share of weak moments. The strong moments were the ballads which he's always known for. The first trio of ballads the hit single You Remind Me Of Something, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby and my personal favorite Step In My Room show R's vocals and writing at it's best. The next two strong ballads Down Low (Nobody Has To Know) and "I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)" were also good , although the remixes were better. The other strong ballads  Tempo Slow was placed at towards the end of the CD but it was placed in the middle of R. Kelly's religous section of the CD.
I have this CD but I am not playing it that often. In fact this album is sitting on my shelf for weeks or months on end. My U2, Depeche Mode, and Enya CDs are getting a lot of spins. As Long As You Love me, and Everybody are good in my opinion. I do enjoy the Halloween video for Everybody. It was one of the best videos I had seen in a long time back then in 1997. Meanwhile songs like Hey Mr. DJ, a cover version of Set Adrift On Memory, and If You Want to Be Good Girl are just plain awful to the point to being almost unlistenable. The rest are ok. The music on here is very teen oriented with some blue-eyed soul influences.I,m not very fond of this CD. Not that I call it bad but just so many other CDs I have get many time more spins in my CD player.Backstreet Boys would improve dramatically on their Millennium album two years after this one but would come crashing to the ground with the oh so boring Black and Blue.
Wasn't this album available in the States then? That is suprising to say the least, as it was all over Canada. The BSB's were kinda the start of the commercially put together boy band craze. At least, since this album came out, it seems that every guy and his brother want to be in a boy band. Even though nearly every guy will profess that they hate the BSB's and all boy bands. However, I must admit that the songs are catchy and danceable, and on the whole, harmless fun. But certainly nothing that will last for generations. A hundred years from now, heck..50 years from now, they will be forgotten along with Britney, but for now, they are here, so enjoy while you can.
Following the untimely and tragic death of musical genius and rap icon, Tupac Shakur, his mother, Afeni, saw to it that she and his estate attained the rights to his musical legacy including some of the lost and forgotten outtakes from his early albums like &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.&quot; and &quot;Thug Life&quot;. Such album leftovers seem to be the highlight of this beefed-up but dated double album.Most of the tracks on this album were clearly recorded between 1992 and 1994, before his incarceration and his infamous days on Death Row Records. There are some very powerful tracks like &quot;Hellrazor&quot; and the moving &quot;Do 4 Love&quot; but spreading it out over two discs hurts the overall feel of it. Pac's questions of self-worth on &quot;Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto&quot; also do a good job of showcasing Shakur the poet but there is no need for two versions of the same song when one got the job done just fine. Aside from these highlights, most of this two-disc album sounds exactly the same. More work could have been done to update the beats and make the tracks stand out more on their own. All that really remains in the average listener's mind when he thinks of the majority of music on &quot;R U Still Down&quot; is the raspy and tired-sounding voice of Shakur echoing through the speakers. As much as many fans criticize later posthomous releases for depending too much on samples and R&amp;B-type production, a little of that might have actually helped this particular release. I'm not suggesting that the whole album sound that way but a few tracks could have stood to be polished a bit.All in all, &quot;R U Still Down&quot; is a very raw and rugged-souding album. As much as I wanted to get into a lot of the tracks on this album, the production was just so simple that it made many of them sound exactly the same. For those who might not know, much of the production has been changed but the record still feels rushed. The finished result is a double-album that could have been cut down considerably but is still worth the price of admission for any true Pac fan.
This album has a lot of gems and hidden jewels, showcasing some of Pac's greatest material.  It is obvious that 2pac was in a zone when he was making these songs.  You can just feel his energy as he raps non stop from verse to hook to verse to hook as he does on most of the songs on this album.  This collection was put together after 2pac died so it's more of a collection of songs than an album per se, but there was something unique about Pac's spirit when making most of these songs that provides a cohesive force of sorts that makes it all fit together well.  It seems as if Pac was just hitting his stride and really getting comfortable in the studio during these sessions, and the results are songs that sound really fresh and honest even when they are not his greatest material.  The first nine tracks are outstanding and add a very critical element to the big picture of who 2pac was as an artist.  'Open fire' is just intense and relentless.  The title track is much more personal and comtemplative.  It resonates most strongly when 2pac feeling battered and persecuted says, "now the whole world's callin' me a killer, all I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real(la)".  And this does honestly seem to be quite true of 2pac's intentions up until the point where he made the material on this album.  I never truly understood some of the criticism that he faced.  This is pretty much the tone of the next five songs and they are all some of the best songs that he has ever written, especially 'Hell Razor'.  This is something that you just have to hear to appreciate.  2pac basically just blindly lets it go, honestly pleading and screaming his heart and soul out. "I'm Gettin Money" is another winner and "Like to Kick It" is also a pretty solid effort.  The next two songs sound like nothing more than studio exercise and should have been left off of the album.  The last track on the first disc is quite similar to "I'm gettin money" and is also quite powerful.  The second disc does not have any really bad songs but it is not as good as the first one because it only has a few songs that stand out as really great. The songs on the second disc that stand out most to me are "Hold on be Strong", "Do for love", "Nothin but love"--finding 2pac at his most compassionate and idealistic saying, "I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free I can't take what she offers me, this is how the world could be, this is how the world should be"--"I Wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto", "When I Get Free II" and, the haunting "Only Fear of Death".  This is not exactly 2pac's best album but it is one of his most enjoyable to just ride out and listen to.  It also gives you a clearer and much more well rounded picture of who 2pac was than the solid but seriously overrated "All eyez on me".  So I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to see more of 2pac than what the mainstream is accustomed to.
Those of you who are expecting another best of all time 2 cd album from 2pac will be sorely disappointed. This album is nowhere near as good as the aforementioned All Eyez On Me. Of course you can't really expect too much since the man had been dead about 2 years when this album came out. The first cd is pretty decent. I can make it through most of the songs without any serious complaints. Some of the better songs include &quot;I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto&quot; (not the one you heard one the radio), &quot;Thug Style&quot;, and &quot;Nothing To Lose&quot;. The second cd falls terribly short though. About the only song I like listening to is &quot;Do For Love&quot; and you could've just recorded that off the radio or BET. If it were just the first cd, this album might get 4 stars, but as it is, it's lucky it gets 3. Those of you who are expecting vintage Pac (i.e. before his death), don't waste your time on this album. Those of you who just have to have more Pac, well go ahead and get this; it's not completely terrible, but it's not that good.
R U Still Down is one of the best after life 2Pac albums that anyone has put together. It is a hard listener but the overall talent that he must have put into making that much material before he died deserves enough respect, but overall R U Still Down is a must have.
I've tried Five Leaves Left several times: at the office, in the car, on my home stereo, and with headphones; frankly, I don't understand what all the hubbub is about. The album rates near the top on everyone's Top-100 list, and I had hoped that I would be enthralled by the "unnoticed master." I have no argument with the fact that his work is melodic (The Thoughts of Mary Jane) and lush (Way of Blue, Day Is Done). I'm simply not enthusiastic concerning his voice and subject matter. Drake reminds me of Britain's answer to Bob Dylan - Donovan. His delivery is effeminate and breathy. Compared to the Zombies' Colin Blunstone, I believe Drake's voice falls short in energy, range and beauty. Lyrically, Five Leaves Left is lonely, disparate, melancholy, and generally depressing. I keep my copy handy for rainy afternoons. In small doses, I find Five Leaves Left beautifully disturbing. Perhaps a greater appreciation of Drake will  take more time.
To actually access the music of Nick Drake, you have to get past a lot of baggage: the biographical legend; the twee aesthetic, aptly signified by the blandly psychedelic cover, fey title and spelling; the voice, an adolescent-whisper-falsetto type thing when it's not trying to be Bob Dylan.  Once you do get past all that, the album is a vaguely pleasant, if indistinguishable, wash of folk pop, with unexpected instruments - cello, piano, harpsichord, sax etc. - keeping things interesting (some of the songs sound like an earnest Divine Comedy).  There is one stand-out track, however, 'Poor Boy', part-Jobim samba, part-Legrand French cafe pop, part-Stones gospel.  Its pop melancholy suggests where Drake's true talents lay.
The weakest of the three albums released in his lifetime, "Bryter Layter" suffers in comparison to what came before (the brilliant "Five Leaves Yet") and what came after (the sparse "Pink Moon").  Comparison within the catalog of one's own work is largely inevitable, but here, it can be fatal.(if you're new to Drake, I'd with no modesty recommend both my review of and the album "Five Leaves Left" as a superb introduction)Largely eschewing the baroque/folk of his last record, Drake seeks a jazzier sound, a more varied approach, and some material thats upbeat.  The results are mixed-- songs like the horn-driven, upbeat "Hazy Jane II" suffer from almost kitchy arrangements and "Poor Boy" may be the only song on record by Nick Drake that I really quite dislike.  The style just doesn't seem to sit with his voice.On the other hand, in some ways its the pieces without any of his vocals that may excel the most-- the opener and closer ("Introduction" and "Sunday") and the title track all combine a sort of baroque string sound with Drake's folky sensibilities and what almost feels like a Pet Soundsish feel.  And certainly the darker (but still jazz influenced) settings of "At the Chime of the City Clock" (check the strings after the vocal too-- breathtaking), "Hazey Jane I", the absolutel beautiful "Fly" and the stunning "Northern Sky" (the latter two featuring some mesmerizing playing from John Cale, in particular his delicate viola countering Drake's voice on "Fly") succeed much better.YOu know, its a great album, but in my mind, its always doomed to be "the worst" of Nick Drake's catalog, which is to say its still amazing.  Check the other two first, then come back to listen to this one.
Nick Drake-Bryter Layter ***It goes without saying that Bryter Layter is one of the most difficult albums in my collection. Coming along in a time of music when damn near every album was difficult this manages to be even more so. Adding to the fact is that no other album by Drake is this busy. But more so than that, I don't know if I actually like this record. I have listened to it over and over again but I don't think I even like it in the slightest bit. Much in the same way that I think Sleep Dirt by Frank Zappa is a fantastic record but cannot stand to listen to the damn thing. Bryter Layter suffers equally. I think this is a nice, or at best decent record despite the fact that I often find it impossible to listen to it.For me many of the songs here are forgettable and stand out very little in my mind if at all. 'Hazy Jane II' stands out the most in my mind but mostly because I hate the song. I truthfully find the whole whoa-is-me folky-jazz number incredibly pretentious and trite. Though I can respect and fully understand why so many consider it a full blown classic and the star of Bethlehem on this record. 'Introduction' stands out to me because it is the part of the album I love the most. Drake's fantastic finger picking of acoustic guitar has been one of the things I love about him most. His knowledge of alternate tunings and wide range and reach make for one underrated player. 'At The Chime Of A City Clock' is the only other standout for me. The subtle drumming mixed with the bright strings remind me of Central Park in the winter. The song is beautiful.As for the rest of the album I couldn't even begin to describe another song with out hearing it because they all seem so blaa to me. What doesn't help this album for me is that the fantastic guitar playing of Thompson is really out of place on a Drake record, and Drake's own guitar playing is ofter lost in the production which also on this album is some of the worst I have ever heard.But what really bothers me about this record is that it is without a doubt Drake's most depressing album lyrically, and musically it is as bright is a sunny may afternoon. I always thought if I heard an album like this it would be genius, much like Lou Reed's Berlin, but I must say Bryter Layter totally put all this to rest. It is just down right annoying and for those people out there who don't listen to the lyrics, (they know all the worlds but not what they mean which blows me away) this would seem like a happy album, which it totally is not.So no I can't truly give this a better rating than a three because it simply isn't that good. With all hype and tragedy aside, Drake was a genius but genius doesn't always work out for the better as attested to here.
Elvis Costello had a lot of gull picking the stage name "Elvis Costello." Of course, Elvis Presley is a rock and roll legend, and Costello is the goof from the straightman/clown comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello.  Like Elvis Presley and Lou Costello, Armed Forces contains a mix of  first-rate Elvis Presley R&amp;B/Rock-A-Billy (My Funny Valentine, Busy  Bodies) and Lou Costello musical foolishness (Senior Service, Green Shirt).  Elvis (Costello) is quit adept at crafting powerful pop ditties with ironic  lyrical references. `Oliver's Army' is a light and frolicking rocker with a  dramatic classical piano introduction. The romantic ballads (Party Girl,  Chemistry Class, Allison) are melodic, intense and soulful. In fact, the  `live' recording of `Accidents Will Happen' demonstrates Elvis' clever  ability to compose romance melodies which are mesmerizing, lyrically  ambiguous and mysterious.The shinning moment of Armed Forces is the  roaring and passionate rocker `What's So Funny 'Bout Peace, Love and  Understanding?' Elvis and the Attractions unleash their normally restrained  temperament and charge this rocker forward with sheer abandonment. Not to  be missed. I understand that the song was written after a barroom fight  where a member of the Rossington Collins Band punched Elvis after he made a  disparaging remark about Ray Charles.At sixty-four minutes, Armed Forces  is too long. Mediocre compositions that subvert the momentum of the CD  (Sunday's Best, Moods For Moderns, Clean Money, Wednesdays Week) could have  been dropped. Still, Armed Forces contains enough material worthy of The  King with an ample dose of Lou's buffoonery.
Elvis Costello - Armed Forces (1979)This music is undeniably good. Very tuneful, melodious. Costello has a really cool voice. The bassist is very good . . . so why am I not crazy about this music? It's a question of taste. Overall, I find it too chirpy, too cutesy for my liking. I especially dislike the keyboards which are a little too dominant and add a sort of goofy circus-like quality that doesn't turn me on. Sometimes the organ fills remind me of church music or something along those lines which I'm not crazy about.True, Costello's lyrics are witty, biting, cynical and clever. The peppy music serves as a nice contrast to his words.  Costello is sometimes associated with punk rock (probably because of the timing of his debut album more than anything else), but his music isn't really like that, especially not this album. ARMED FORCES is more like New Wave/ (old school) R&B; if you had to label it.The song I like the most is the most rockin' one - "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding?" and understandably one of Costello's most popular tunes. "Moods for Moderns" is also very catchy. I can hear the Bowie influence on that one which Elvis himself refered to in the liner notes (which are written by the man himself and quite entertaining).I actually like a fair amount of Costello's music - "Watching the Detectives," "Pump It Up," "Brilliant Mistake" . . . I'm just more picky about which ones appeal to me, so I guess I don't really qualify as a fan.On the bonus disk, the extra studio songs are good and would've easily been at home on ARMED FORCES. The live stuff is good too with more than decent versions of "Alison" and "Detectives" (though I still prefer the originals). The crowd is very enthusiastic. I really like the last one "Chemestry Class" which Costello does solo. It's nice to be able to hear his guitar so clearly for a change.P.S. - To the die-hard fans who can't handle a different P.O.V. - I apologize for expressing this honest and objective opinion. I realize the main point of this forum is for fans like you to excessively praise everything the artists you love have released. Peace!
I came upon Elvis Costello's "Imperial Bedroom," by way of a Rolling Stone article something along the lines of the best 100 albums of this century and sure enough Costello's "Imperial Bedroom," made the cut.  I already was a big fan with a greatest hits tape that introduced me to "Allison," and "Pump it Up."  "Imperial Bedroom," is pretty steeped in the 80's.  Though it contains some memorable songs, the general tenor is symphonic, jazzy, flowing numbers.  For some reason it didn't strike a chord with me like other Costello and the Attractions works I've come to know and love.Granted, "Almost Blue," and "Beyond Belief," rank right up there with Costello's best, the album stays on the surface slick and sleepy, torchy and touched. Granted it was hard to live up to the expectations set forth by making a Rolling Stones top 100 list, but with the likes of Elvis Costello it was possible.I believe you should give Costello his due...the man is ultra-talented and knows his way around a song.  But unless you are drawn to the more pop-ish polished side of Elvis, go elsewhere.  If you need some "Peace, Love, and Understanding," and don't mind some of the sameness give "Imperial Bedroom," a whirl.  Just don't get your expectations up too high unless you are a "Seal," crossed with Burt Bacharach fan.  If you are...first seek counseling...next get Imperial Bedroom...it's only bound to make the condition exasperated.  Not bad for a sleepy Friday night date under candle-light but other than that the Bed ain't spinning, it's imperial after all.--MMW
I like a good number of EC songs and "Uncomplicated" to me is Grammy level with plenty to spare. A marriage of music and lyrics to be envied by Dylan himself (the pre-"Skyline" Dylan, too!); the title tune of sorts, it simply says that the bitter meets the sweet, as Blood and Chocolate leave the same chromatic trace. A perfectly captured performance; with The Imposters to assure its' drive and bottom, and the star well up in the mix.The next most accessible and memorable track is Tokyo Storm warning, another thematic highlight...but to this Reviewer, once you realize there was some unconscious borrowing of the Rolli8ng Stones' 19th Nevous Breakdown, it stutters just a bit.The rest of the set is for serious Costello-ites. I always find his writing difficult to decipher, his singing loud but unclear; also, never surprising, always in that same box of keys and pitches. It's not a particularly artful style, as the notes seem to come from the back of his throat, tongue extended. Something like the way Bruce Springsteen and Joe Cocker do it. A deep fan will say, whatever, it works!!
This review is only based on the ten original tracks, though there are some great bonus tracks (Paper Sun; Hole in My Shoe; Smiling Phases) that would've undoubtedly boosted the rating had they been included on the original album instead of a few of the dated psychedelic songs Berkshire Poppies; A House for Everyone; Utterly Simple; Hope I Don't Find Me There; and the album-closing jam Giving to You. Psychedelia wasn't Traffic's thing, they were better off playing jazz/folk/rock songs such as Heaven is In Your Mind; No Face, No Name, No Number; Colored Rain and that unforgettable title track, arguably the best song in the Traffic canon. Plus Dealer is a good song, on the misunderstood side - the title does spell drugs, but it's really about a card dealer. A bit of an offbeat subject, but this was 1968. At its best, it's the kind of English Folke that would later inspire Jethro Tull's best work; at worst, it's psychedelic excess vaguely reminiscent of the Rolling Stones' worst work. Thankfully, they would get their sound straight on the next, self-titled album, the latter of which containing several classics (You Can All Join In; Pearly Queen; Feelin' Alright?; 40,000 Headsmen). It's the better buy, but this isn't bad at all.
Mr. Fantasy was an exception to the marketing ploy used by US record companies during the 60's. Most companies would repackage albums (a la the original US releases of both The Beatles and the Stones back catalog)and try to get more from less by loping off songs to create &quot;new albums&quot; (which is how the famous butcher cover came to be on The Beatles' Yesterday and Today). When Mr. Fantasy was finally released in the US (a month or so after its UK appearence)most of the weaker tunes by Dave Mason were cut in favor of the band's strong selection of singles. The net result was an album with 12 tracks instead of 10 and a rearranged running order that markedly improved the album.The Mr. Fantasy CD shares the same basic flaws as the original album. Bill Levenson opted to release both the mono UK original and stereo US original albums separately. His decision makes sense as both albums sound remarkable different after their &quot;plastic&quot; surgery. Heaven Is In Your Mind (the US version of Mr. Fantasy) is the stronger of the two. The running order evens out the tone of the original album. The inclusion of Paper Sun and Smiling Phases only improves the album as both songs were catchy material. They probably would have made the original album if they hadn't been released as singles.The sound quality on both these albums is spectacular and a surprising improvement on the the UK CD (which combined both the stereo Mr. Fantasy and mono release for Heaven is in Your Mind). While that CD benefited from 24 bit sound, the use of Sonic Solutions No Noise process homogenized the album. The result was an album that sacrificed the original album's sound for a technological sheen. Reissue Producer Levenson wisely chose to have this remastered and resequenced.So you do get more for less although in this case it's an improvement unless you're on a budget. Levenson has added the mono tracks from the film soundtrack Here We Go Round The Mulbury Bush and the mono single mixes for both Paper Sun and Smiling Phases. The two albums have minor differences for example some of the mono tracks run a bit longer and feature slightly different mixes from the stereo ones (similiar to the Beatles' catalog up to and including the White Album). In fact, Mr. Fantasy runs longer than Heaven even though it has one less song on it.I'd recommend picking up both for hardcore Traffic fans and those not on a budget. The only complain I have is with the liner notes; they are still full of mistakes (some of them unintentionally hilarous). I'm surprised they weren't corrected from the UK notes. They are still pretty informative without resulting to overkill but it would have been nicer to have an explanation as to why the UK and US versions of this album ended up so remarkably different (aside from the fact that Dave Mason had left the band by the time this was released).Levenson made the wise choice of splitting these distinctive albums up and adding the bonus tracks. Levenson has also done an outstanding job on the band's second album (Traffic). The UK edition had some important bonus tracks (kept for the US release although they are the US mono single mixes)but the producers saw fit to include the Mulberry Bush tracks as bonus selections. While that was a nice extra (especially since they weren't on the Mr. Fantasy UK CD)they were out of context (as they were recorded prior to the first album)and don't quite fit. Levenson and his staff have done a terrific job in a very difficult field.I'd still recommend HIIYM over MF as it is the stronger of the two albums.
There are some interesting comments about the debut Asia record.  Some folks praise it as a long lost classic.  Others rip to shreds.However, its the folks who take an even tempered stance are the ones who seem most practical to me.  There are many creative instrumental passages on this record particularly from keyboardist Geoffrey Downes.  However many of the songs are just a little too radio friendly with cliche laden lyrics.  The overplayed singles-Here Comes That Feeling, Only Time Will Tell, and The Heat Of The Moment are mildly creative in small doses and a bit patience trying with the overplay that they did receive.Soul Survivor is probably the most captivating of the nine album tracks.  I enjoy the lyrics, keyboard passages, and the steady drumming.  Wildest Dreams has an interesting style and One Step Closer and Cutting It Fine have some memorable moments.Therefore the impression of this record is a decent one but not a reverred classic that will stand the test of time.  Truthfully I prefer Asia's follow up record, Alpha as the atmosphere stands out even more and the lyrics are less cliche driven.  Nonetheless, a 3-3 1/2 star rating seems fair.
By the time this album was released (1982), the classic progressive rock style had completely morphed into the American stadium rock and English symphonic pop styles, so when the formation of this supergroup was announced I was pretty excited - classic prog would reign again.  Unfortunately, while the Roger Dean cover was very cool, the reception to the music was mixed as I recall - some people loved it, some hated it, and I found myself in-between.  Indeed, I was not completely bowled over - "Steve Howe is here, but this is not Yes" - I thought at the time.  There is however, something immediately attractive about the sophisticated technique of the players and the rich vocal harmonies.  After listening to this album again after such a long time, I realize that the debut really is not bad at all.The lineup includes members of Yes (Steve Howe - electric and acoustic guitars, vocals; Geoff Downes - keyboards, synthesizers, vocals), U.K./King Crimson (John Wetton - bass guitar and lead vocals); and ELP (Carl Palmer - drums and percussion).  While they are all first chair players, Steve Howe really needs to be singled out.  His playing is exceptional throughout and he apparently did not let the fact that he was in a pop group water down his approach.  John Wetton uses the slightly distorted tone on his bass that characterized his work with King Crimson and his vocals are OK, although he does strain to hit the high notes on occasion.  The vocal harmonies however, are stunning. Carl Palmer does an excellent job and demonstrates once again why he is one of the finest progressive rock drummers.The tunes on the album are pretty short (3-6 minute range) but are very exciting and feature top notch musicianship - my favorite tracks include Time Again and Here Comes the Feeling.  Unfortunately, the songs sound somewhat similar to one another (energetic prog/pop) which is a consequence of a lack of dynamic contrast and similarity with respect to instrumentation.  Although there is a nice piano break on one piece and atmospheric synthesizer parts here and there, they are the exception and not the rule.  After all, these guys wanted radio airplay and you could not get that with sharp acoustic/electric contrasts and a marimba solo.  Speaking of which, I think it says something about the time when members of progressive rock acts could get together, put out an album, and do so very well.On a side note, Asia fans may be interested in the fact that John Wetton recorded an early version of Here Comes the Feeling with members of the French prog act Atoll in 1979 (the track is featured on the Musea re-issue of the Atoll album "Rock Puzzle").  Although there were plans to form a group, Wetton eventually went on to form Asia without them.This version of the CD release is pretty skimpy and features OK sound quality.While some people may regard this as the final nail in the classic English progressive rock "coffin", I think it sounds a lot better than it did in 1982 and is a fine example of well written and performed prog/pop.  Indeed, this album has influenced at least a few of the neo-progressive rock acts currently active, so its legacy will live on.  If you liked this album, check out Danger Money (U.K., 1979) and especially Drama (Yes, 1980).
In 1982 Asia were formed with Geoffrey Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and John Whetton, all talented and seasoned professionals.The result, for me is 2 great songs and the remainder disappointing.Heat Of The Moment and Without You are defintely classic 1980s rock songs, real standouts, however I could not get excited about the rest, hence 3 stars.
This self-titled, full-length debut album from Asia was released in 1982.  Nine tracks are contained.  The material is in a majestical pop rock musical direction.  Altogether, I find the songwriting to be pleasing, the musicianship to be skillful, and the sound quality to be worthy.  I enjoy John Wetton's distinctive, smooth, meat-and-potatoes vocal delivery; also, he handles the bass guitar playing.  There is an agreeable synthesis in regard to Steve Howe's gratifying guitar work and the tasteful keyboard playing of Geoff Downes.  As for the harmony vocals, I find them to be remarkably rich.  The compositions that I consider to be favorites are "Only Time Will Tell," "Sole Survivor," and "Here Comes the Feeling."  The nicely tailored, attractive "Only Time Will Tell" displays memorable, stately keyboard work from Downes, indelible, pretty guitar playing from Howe, and lush, charming vocal harmonies.  The rousing "Sole Survivor" exhibits a dynamic, unforgettable chorus, while the spirited "Here Comes the Feeling" presents a catchy principal keyboard line and sparkling solo from Downes and an energy-filled, captivating refrain.  I think that the rest of the songs are enjoyable, too.  The sprightly "Heat of the Moment" provides lavish, admirable harmony vocals.  The appealing, easygoing "One Step Closer" features a mellow, flowing chorus.  The energetic "Time Again" sports creative musical arrangements and impressive utilization of vocal harmonies.  The lively "Wildest Dreams" supplies talented drumming from Carl Palmer.  The plaintive "Without You" furnishes somber, pleasant harmony vocals.  The active "Cutting It Fine" has a touching, regal ending keyboard passage from Downes.  The CD insert does not include the song lyrics.  The album cover artwork is interesting--a portion of this illustration is also displayed on the back of the CD jewel case.  The disc is just over 44 minutes.  The enthusiasm that emanates from this album is infectious.  Actually, I rate this piece of work 3.5 stars; it is a treat to listen to.
One of the more oddball shotgun marriages in musical history was Asia, a "supergroup" comprised of one ELP member (drummer Carl Palmer), one Crimson King (vocalist/bass John Wetton), a YesMan (guitarist Steve Howe) and a Buggle (keyboardist Geoff Downes). With that kind of pedigree, you would expect long, self-indulgent soloing and piles of classically inspired virtuosity. Surprisingly, none of that appeared on their Geffen debut in 1982.Instead, you got straight ahead arena rock with strong melodies and eager to please hooks on about half of the album. Yes, the album was stunningly well produced and played with verve, but these men were most certainly no pop=musicians. Downes might have been, considering the meager output of The Buggles, however it seems the man who wrote "Video Killed The Radio Star" really longed to write "Starship Trooper." He and Wetton co-wrote the bulk of the songs here, and while there's plenty of soloing going on, it's economical. (Which was the alleged reason Howe left after two albums, he wanted more.)Again, though, these men are not pop writers. Which means that half the songs on "Asia" are utterly awful, long forgotten in the ongiong classic rock play for "Heat Of The Moment," "Only Time Will Tell" and "Wildest Dreams." Palmer gets to wail away on the drums during "Wildest Dreams," while it is Downes' keyboards that make the album sound like the band didn't just drop in from the seventies. That didn't stop "Asia" from hitting number one and getting a lot of pretentious "serious music" snobs from creaming themselves over what they considered a rabbit punch to new wave. (Or critics from mocking the band for sounding like throwbacks IN the peak of new wave.)Either way, Asia had the last laugh. Some 40 years later, the good stuff on the disc sounds cool, but that means you're probably just as well off withAsia Gold- which at least has a more up-to-date track mastering - than just buying this one.
I respect Don Henley for creating a sound way different from the Eagles light country-rock sound.  His lyrical style is very thought provoking.  However, there are almost as many clunkers in this collection as there are  quality songs.  Try to get the cassette version at a bargain basement  price.
In the grand scheme of Don Henley's career, "Building the Perfect Beast" is kind of a blip on the radar, not landmark material but also an interesting, worthy snapshot of where he was at the time. With the inclusion of a few synth-heavy songs and an overtly '80s pop sound on some of the tracks, it's evident he was trying to distance himself from that little band he was in called the Eagles. One of the elements that make "Beast" a noteworthy album is the surprising diversity of the tunes. From ready-made-for-radio pop ("All She Wants to do is Dance") to somewhat contrived country ("You're Not Drinking Enough") to the mechanically driven song "Building the Perfect Beast," Henley and his fellow musicians crafted solid tunes on this 1984 album. Even the non-hits force you to sing along.Also to Henley's credit, two of the hit songs, "The Boys of Summer" and "Sunset Grill," contain an atmospheric edge to them that has helped both songs age well, become classics, really. Even when Henley laboriously stands on his soap box, as on "A Month of Sundays," you can't help but be impressed with his clear-eyed sound and vision, honesty and insightful lyrics.
There's some pretty cool material on this album from Whitesnake.  A total of nine tracks is included, and the album is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction.  The musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight and satisfying.  Most of the songs are straight-ahead hard rockers.  John Sykes does a great job with the guitar playing.  His guitar riffs and solos are really good, and he also helped write almost all of the album's material.  David Coverdale does a good job with the vocal duties.  There's also some nice keyboard playing throughout.  The songs that I like the most are &quot;Still of the Night,&quot; the ballad &quot;Is This Love,&quot; and &quot;Don't Turn Away.&quot;  All three are memorable and well-written songs.  The rest of the tunes are good, too.  This album is solid and worth a listen.
I had this on cassette back in '89. It was da soundtrack of my life back in da fall of 1990. cruising listenin to songs like the title track, i will not go quietly (with guest vocals by Axl Rose), Last Worthless Evening, and another minor FM hit, If Dirt Were Dollars, which i thought was da bomb back in da summer/fall of '89. I remember the duet with Patti Smyth from Scandal (darn, it was only '89 and she was already a has been -lol_). Get this again if yer in da mood for nostagia, personally, i don't think i'd go as far as getting this album, there's some turd filler on here that sounds like the era it was recorded in, maybe download I Will Not Go Quietly and If Dirt Were Dollars, which were IMO, the best ones on there, and maybe dats just da nostalgia talkn.
DON HENLEY-ACTUAL MILES/GREATEST HITS: Output has never been DON HENLEY's strong suit...THE EAGLES only managed a half dozen albums during their 70s reign, and his subsequent solo career netted just three more by the time this compilation was released. Nonetheless, the reedy voiced singer enjoyed a healthy run of Top 40 hits throughout the 80s, adopting a detached AOR sound that had more in common with HOTEL CALIFORNIA than his old band's early country-rock vibe. The sleazy used car salesman cover art showcases HENLEY's seldom evident sense of humor; what's inside is his cynical, at times pretentious world view filtered through crafty fare such as DIRTY LAUNDRY, THE BOYS OF SUMMER, and THE END OF THE INNOCENCE. Songwriting chores are shared with the usual suspects including DANNY KORTCHMAR and J. D. SOUTHER; ironically, THE END OF THE INNOCENCE sounds more like co-author BRUCE HORNSBY than HENLEY himself. Synth-driven social commentary JOHNNY CAN'T READ should have been included here instead of the less impressive "new" tracks; in fact, only one song from his solid debut even pops up. Suffice to say that hard core HENLEY-ites will want to own all his original platters...this one's mostly a quick fix for the casual fan.RATING: THREE DRUMSTICKS
Tragic Kingdome seems like the most hyped recording by No Doubt.  With all those singles:  Don't Speak, Spiderwebs, Sunday Morning, etc.... I thought that this CD would be a classic.  Somehow, it is not.The thing is that in addition to the five singles there are ten other tracks.  And many of them just do not do anything special for me.  I think the hooks are less memorable as on Rock Steady and The Beacon Street Collection.  Sixteen is an exception as its a fairly catchy new wave rock tune. Different People has a nice jazzy beat to it with good horn arrangements.  And the title track has some interesting textures to its style.Therefore I count the recording as about a fifty fifty split between good songs and nothing special ones.  Therefore three stars seems like the right rating.
This cd, all in all....is, well, i guess i couldnt explain it. All i can say is that its ok when you are in the mood, but totally ... when ur not. But can totally rule when you are feeling happy. Grrr...i cant say it! It's alright, but its not one of my favorites. I wouldnt really reccomend it to anyone unless they either (1)have no doubt's previous albums, or (2)are a fan of reggae/ska. What I could reccomend is Sublime's self entitled cd. It has the same groove, but WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY better I love it alot. Plus, it is the most popular CD in my town. If they dont have it, they will be considered a loser so they must steal it from somebody (my friends got his stolen...luckily mine didnt!) I rate alot of cds (you probably have seen my reviews hundreds of times) and I have only rated 1/3 of my collection. So this is coming straight from a music collector with lots of experience...its not that good, but ok when you feel 'tragic kingdomish'. If you can decipher what I am talking about. Easier said, or in other words, when you're feeling funky inside and out and you want to listen to something funky but you cant find nothin on the shelves, go out and pick yourself up a copy of "Tragic Kingdom" from No Doubt. Oh yeah, and the best tracks are "Just A Girl", "Happy Now?", "Spiderwebs", and "Don't Speak".Peace and Love for everybody,  -JJP.S>Give 'Pumpkins' a try...you'll enjoy their taste (musicwise)
Massive Attack's first album, BLUE LINES, was an exciting and novel release that offered a range of superb tracks that didn't let the listener down. Four years later, Massive Attack released PROTECTION, and this trip-hop band tripped up a little.PROTECTION nowhere offers the consistency that BLUE LINES did, and many of the songs are rather weak, especially the title track and &quot;Three.&quot; The last track, a live performance of The Doors' &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, seems pretty out-of-place.However, there are a couple of great tracks which stop this from being a bad album, the ganja-influenced &quot;Eurochild&quot; and &quot;Karmacoma,&quot; and the ambient &quot;Heat Miser.&quot; This songs make the album listenable, but somewhat disappointing all in all.Happily, Massive Attack's next release, 1998's MEZZANINE, is one of the best rock albums ever, and regains the perfection (surpasses it, in fact) of BLUE LINES.
When you release one of the most influential and unique releases of the past 20 years, what do you do for an encore?  This is the no-win situation that Massive Attack had to face with their follow-up to 1991's seminal Blue Lines debut.  Whereas that album simultaneously combined smoky hip-hop, inspired soul, and laces of &quot;rasta&quot;, this album eschews many of those hip-hop and reggae elements in favour of soft jazz ('Weather Storm', 'Better Things', 'Heat Miser') and electronic-pop (such as the title track and 'Spying Glass').  Soundwise, it's a slightly uneasy mid-point between the raw urban flavour of Blue Lines and the unsettling bleakness of Mezzanine.  Overall, Protection is another high-quality release, but it falls well short of these two benchmark albums.  Musically and creatively, it is solid as expected (with the exception of their grating cover of 'Light My Fire' - but I didn't like the original either so there you go). However the combined danger and sensuality that marks Blue Lines and Mezzanine is conspicuously absent on Protection.  Even Nicolette's raspy voice on 'Three' and 'Sly' rings somehow hollow.  The album also fails to set a consistent groove: of the 10 songs, there are 2 jazzy instrumentals (both of them superb), 2 poppier tunes sung by Tracey Thorn, 2 eclectic cuts rapped by 3D and Tricky, 2 loungy rhythm-based grooves by Nicolette and 2 disappointingly un-reggae tracks by Horace Andy.  This grab bag of vocalists and styles overall simulates the disjointed feel of a compilation disc.  It not only lacks the cohesive flow of Blue Lines and Mezzanine, but is a bit bumpy in terms of quality as well.  The cuts by 3D/Tricky, Tracey Thorn and the instrumentals are absolutely ace, while Horace Andy's usually amazing voice grates on both 'Spying Glass' and 'Light My Fire'.  Nicolette's tracks are kind of in the middle, highly listenable but not the CD's bread and butter.  Overall this is not the Massive's strongest release, but mediocre Massive Attack is better than 90% of other bands at the top of their game.  It's a very good album that, however unfair it may be, is forced into comparison with their near-untouchable debut.  If taken on its own merits, Protection will not disappoint.
Toni Braxton enjoyed chart success since 1992 with LOVE SHOULDA BROUGHT YOU HOME off the Eddie Murphy's smash soundtrack BOOMERANG.One year earlier she came up with her first CD to her name.She was signed, arranged, and produced by Babyface, L.A. Reid and Darryl Hall.This trio is a true hitmaking machine.Proof be the three singles off the album that reached the Top 10 status: ANOTHER SAD LOVE SONG, BREATHE AGAIN and YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.The album glides in R'n'B sound, 7 WHOLE DAYS is as black as any song can be and I BELONG TO YOU shows the lady can make your feet stomp anytime.But it's ballads where Toni gives her best: buy this cd, invite over someone you have had your eyes on for a long time, put it on skipping directly to CANDLELIGHT and let the music do the talking for both of you...
While this is their only album I can do without, the country-fried debut still contains enough creativity to hint at the trail these outcasts would blaze on future releases. Some fans claim to always love this most traditional southern rap entry most, but besides for a few creatively produced tracks, a numbing standardization belies the originality this dangerous duo would come to represent.
Positives: For the most part, this album is straight up Southern funk and good rapping. This is before Outkast got really good but it's still a solid collection of songs. The production is pretty good and you can see the beginning of a strong lyrical duo forming. My favorite track is &quot;Git Up, Git Out&quot; cause I can identify with it.Negatives: Becuase I heard their best album to date, Aquemini, before this one, I expected more in terms of production and lyrics. If I would have heard this album before I heard their more recent stuff, I would have said this album was pretty dope. Overall, this is good Southern rap.
Secrets by Toni Braxton is her most beloved and best-selling album of her career. This album is pretty good but it's also a mixed bag as well. After a thousand listens to, Un-Break my Heart is just plain nauseating! You're Making Me High is probably her strongest single ever, love those naughty lyrics and pulsating beat. How Could An Angel Break My Heart is a beautiful ballad which was co-written by Braxton. The rest of the songs are pretty ordinary and jeez most of the time I can't understand what she is singing, she needs to enuicate her words. This album is a great flashback to the mid-90s but that's pretty much it.
Toni Braxton's sophomore set attempted to build on the huge success of her debut, while at the same time maybe trying something a little different here and there.  Hearing first single 'You're Makin' Me High' actually gave most(including me) hope that the &quot;different&quot; part might actually be worth  checking out. Sad to say, she fails to follow through on the promise of that track, instead padding SECRETS with many  average-at-best moments that do nothing but diminish her  unique vocal talent. Ballads abound here, though a few, like the acoustic guitar driven 'Let It Flow' and 'There's No Me Without You', though hopelessly hokey, at least allow Braxton some solid room to showcase her lower range.  But then you have 'How Could An Angel Break My Heart', replete with soulless and near-offensive Kenny G sax work and the Diane Warren weeper 'Un-Break My Heart', which has now been rendered unlistenable--I'm sorry, but Braxton manages to get the very worst of Warren's Celine Dion throwaways (I don't think I need to elaborate further).  The rest of the disc is made up of material that's not quite as offensive but does nothing to enhance Braxton's stature.  Though not nearly as bad as Braxton's subsequent third album  THE HEAT, SECRETS nonetheless leaves one wondering when Braxton will or even can live up to her far more promising debut.
Just about all of this is produced by Babyface which ensures plenty of pop appeal. Indeed, "Un-break my Heart" was a huge hit and "How Could an Angel Break my Heart?" and "I Don't Want To" still garner AC radio airplay. Braxton is possessed of a lovely voice, but too often it's tethered to the syrup...not really allowed to shine.HIGHLIGHTS:Single "You're Makin' Me High" is the sound of passion on low smoulder with a high quavering Moog-like synth that oozes sex. Despite my fervent dislike of Diane Warren, Toni Braxton so beautifully sings "Un-break my Heart" that I like it despite myself..truly classy. "Talking in his Sleep"'s infidelity tale is slinky and memorable. "I Don't Want To" is a little rawer musically and it lets the song breathe, though I would have liked it to be even further stripped back...perhaps just a piano and Braxton. "In the Late of Night" is where Babyface departs a bit from the formula. The song manages to stand out from the tunes around it with even Kenny G's presence handled well (he's mixed in such a way that his alto sax sounds almost like an oboe..it's actually a welcome addition).LOWS:The presence of schlock merchant Kenny G dooms "How Could an Angel Break my heart?", Outside of those, there's a general sameness of sound to most of Babyface's tracks...mid-tempo, acoustic guitar mixed high, that digital effect that sounds like a rimshot, and some keyboards playing very soft chords for atmosphere.BOTTOM LINE:The persistent slickness of Babyface's production tends to make this all sound a bit too adult contemporary for my tastes. (read: all edges smoothed off) All of these love songs seem curiously dispassionate turning into so much aural wallpaper. It's not the worst thing you'll ever hear but taken as a whole it's far from inspiring.
Toni Braxton has one of the most distinctive voices in the industry. You can't help but caught up in the deep richness of her range. However, I don't think that &quot;Secrets&quot; was her best effort. The CD is filled with good songs, but I wish she could have had less ballads. Of course, I can't talk about this album without mentioning Braxton's signature hit, &quot;Un-Break My Heart.&quot; This is the song that put her on the map and made her a star. She really did the song and Diane Warren (the writer) justice.Stand-out track: &quot;Talking in His Sleep&quot; - it's a nice departure from the normal love song.Overall, this a pretty good CD, but I know that there is so much more that could be done to showcase Braxton's voice.
Following the huge (and well-deserved) success of her debut, Toni Braxton unleashes "Secrets," an album that follows the formula of its predecessor so slavishly that it takes almost no risks. Not that the material here is bad; in fact, quite a lot of it works. But the album ultimately fails to take Braxton to another level with respect to songwriting and vocals. "There's No Me Without You," a Babyface-penned number, is "Breathe Again 2." Same song, different words. And the sappy "How Can An Angel Break My Heart," replete with sax by the ever-boring Kenny G, is near-unlistenable. Ironically, the strongest cuts on "Secrets" are songs not produced by Babyface. "Unbreak My Heart" is a soaring ballad that's so well sung, you almost forget that it was written by schlockmeister Dianne Warren. And R. Kelly gives Ms. Braxton a little edge in the ballad "I Don't Want To." Ultimately, the verdict on "Secrets" is a split decision. It's absolutely nowhere near a disaster, but it's not the great sophomore outing it could have been.
3 1/2Although it would take another album until this dynamic hip-hop duo would seemingly solely reinvigorate the genre, ATLeins represents them, and consequently rap, at its late-old-school best.
The Production was good. Much Respect their. Lyrically though? LOL!!! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE read the haters who gave this like 1 or 2 stars. These cats actually like REAL MC's. They're just fustrated much like I am that people call this a CLASSIC. It sold millions and continues to do so. Big ups and so do these rappers now-a-days who have no skills. That doesn't mean it should be mentioned with the greats. Seriously PAC wasn't a THUG that was all a gimmic. Do your homework!!! He was from NEW YORK! HE HIMSELF LOVED HIP HOP REAL HIP HOP! If you are a PAC fan LISTEN TO REPRESENTIN 93. LISTEN to Old school. Any of his earlier material. You will see for yourself. This is just as good as the garbage floodin the market today. If you like what is coming out now, chances are you consider this a classic. LOL!!! Oh Yeah.... Jackson I appreciate all your remarks/coments. You must know what you're talkin about since all you do is bag on reviewers reviews. For all that want to read JACKSON'S reviews go check out 50 cent, Snoop, NWA, & of course Pac.
Tupac did not get the love that he gets now while his career was blowing up...a true poet, who expresses feelings not seen in most rappers or poets.
What's Going On is another one of those albums the critics say is indispensible to any music lover's collection and judging by the ecstatic reviews I've read, I know I'm swimming against the tide to say its not.Perhaps it is innovative in terms of what was happening in soul music at the time it was issued, but not in terms of the whole music picture. The vaunted percussion, while enjoyable, is pretty basic. Much more exciting things were happening in rock, blues, and jazz then and Gaye's "innovations" were timid by comparison.Marvin Gaye was essentially a top-40 singer and the fact that the two best songs on the album were AM hits for him bears this out. I don't like much top-40 music, but I do like Marvin Gaye's vocal style and the songs "What's Going On" and "Mercy, Mercy Me (the Ecology)" which are the reasons I took a chance on the CD. But those two are really all there is.The rest of the album is enjoyable but nothing else stands out. Inner City Blues is a great song, but not as performed by Gaye. Les McCann and Eddie Harris as well as Brian Auger do much better and more powerful versions.Fans of R&B; and 60s top-40 will undoubtedly love this album, but to me it sounds a little dated. Only "Mercy, Mercy Me..." seems relevant still today. Those looking for a little more essence in their music can't help but agree that while this CD may be good, it is highly overrated.
I have a funny relationship with What's Going On; listening to it, I can totally understand the rave reviews, the adoring fans, the consistently high rankings in "best albums of all time" type surveys. I totally dig that this album  kinda sorta revolutionized soul music, established Marvin Gaye as a "serious" artist (although it is criminally wrong to imply that "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" isn't high art), and set the tone for a more hard-edged breed of socially minded pop. I even recognize the music as being genuinely gorgeous, and I understand the phenomenal emotional impact that these songs must have on people.The thing is, I really don't care if I ever hear this record again.I really can't understand why. Sure, What's Going On has its faults - the lyrics can be a bit too obvious and melodramatic at times, and some of the themes seem somewhat dated- but none of them seem like a compelling reason to give the overall work less than five stars. Criticizing the album for any of its obvious faults would feel like I was just looking for a reason to explain why I gave it a less-than-perfect score.Maybe it has something to do with the fact that What's Going On is a bit too perfect. It seems glossy at times, glossy and calculated and hermetically sealed. Listening to it, I feel like I'm watching a stage play that would be performed in the exact same manner no matter who the audience consists of. It's a one-trick album that happens to be very good at its trick, a well-preserved piece of art that's been encased in wax and left to hang silently in a museum, a cold monument to the ideal of emotional expression held by its creator.Or something like that.
Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" has been consistently acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time since it came out in 1971, and is often seen as the moment black music liberated itself from the confines of mass production.For all the efforts Gaye might have made to deal with the opposition of his record company to focusing as he did on social issues, the music on "What's Going On" really does not live up to its reputation. UnlikeStevie Wonder,Sly Stoneor laterParliament, "What's Going On" is distinctly lightweight, even flyweight in tone. At times, indeed, Gaye's voice sounds even soppy and devoid of any emotion, notably on the famous title track.Only twice, on the two lesser-known tracks "Flying High (In The Friendly Sky)" and "Right On", is their really any passion and emotion. Whilst all of "What's Going On" is heavily orchestrated, only there does the orchestration enhance rather than blunt the groove in the music, so that in general "What's Going On" is one of many failed attempts from that period at orchestration in pop music. "Flying High (In The Friendly Sky)" is so toughing as to obscure the lightweight character of the music, whilst the epic groove of "Right On" is the one emotional note here. Even "Mercy Mercy Me", which is promising, could catch fire far better than it does.Compared to the best soul music of its day, "What's Going On" is really disappointing. Stick withMusic of My MindorMothership Connectionto see the best of blakc music from that tense era.
I'm a big Stevie Wonder fan because he is the master of melody, but I have to admit that &quot;S.I.T.K.O.L.&quot; isn't very enthralling.  Only one or two other reviewers had the same standpoint.  I don't see why everyone keeps giving it 5 stars.  Even though I like when artist put a lot of songs on an album, it's more the quality (as opposed to quantity) that I care about more.  If Stevie would've have taken all the radio hits and a few other note-worthy songs and made them into a single album, that would've been much better.  Instead I feel short-changed, sorting through the &quot;not-so-captivating&quot; songs just to hear the gems &quot;Summer Soft&quot; and &quot;Another Star&quot;.  Even the songs I actually like I skip towards the end because they trail on waaaaay too long (i.e. &quot;Ordinary Pain&quot; with its segueway, &quot;Joy Inside My Tears&quot; with its refrain, and &quot;Black Man&quot; with its Black Panther-esque chants).  And what's up with &quot;Saturn&quot;?  I mean it's a good song, but it's just plain weird.  I'm sorry to say that you're not missing anything by passing this up at the store.  Get either &quot;Innervisions&quot; or some greatest hits compilation if you really have to have some Stevie Wonder in your collection.
While the music on this latest compilation is great, it's missing A VERY ESSENTIAL MARVIN CLASSIC....'After The Dance'!! This 2 CD set (nice packaging though!!) is a MAJOR FAILURE without 'After The Dance', and THERE IS enough room for it's inclusion (I remastered the set myself to include 'After The Dance' & more!!).Also, instead of too many 'filler songs' from the so-so 'Here My Dear' CD, they could've (& should've!) included masterpieces like 'Save The Children', 'Flying High In The Friendly Sky', and Marvin's awesome 'Till Tomorrow' from his Midnight Love CD (1983). The rare track 'Where Are We Going ?' is nice, BUT by releasing this incomplete collection, Motown missed the boat AGAIN! (F.Y.I., the recently released Marvin Gaye 'Gold' 2 CD set is the EXACT SAME collection as this one, with new & terrible cover art!!)I advise everyone to remaster this set (with the proper software) & do Marvin some justice, since Motown continues to miss the mark!!! In the end, you'll have a CD set to REALLY be proud of!GRADE for 'The Very Best Of Marvin Gaye'Cover Art/Packaging...5 Stars!!Tracklisting gets...2 Stars!!OVERALL GRADE...3-3.5 STARS!!
With the exception of Rocket Love and Master Blaster (and yes, I Aint Gonna Stand For It), this album does not really show the creativity and joy of his 70s albums - it's all starting to sound a bit weary, like he's just going through the motions.  Vaguely disco-ish production winds up making Stevie sound at times like inferior groups that were inspired by him.  Imitating his imitators, like Elton John on Ice On Fire.  The songs are certainly not awful - most of them have acceptable hooks, but the fire's gone out  from what it used to be with albums like Innervisions and Songs In The Key Of Life.  Or maybe he just needed a rest - two years after this album, he released 'Musiquarium' with 4 new songs that to me were 10 times better.I find it difficult to tell from reviews on Amazon if a record is good or mediocre - most people can't give anything less than 5 stars for any album it seems.  I mean, I like a lot of the music on this album, but if I give it 5 stars, what do I give Innervisions or Songs in The Key Of Life?  I really don't think this is (quite) as good as those albums, although it has its good points.
When I read a bio on Stevie Wonder,many made a fuss about Songs In The Key Of Life being overdue since his last album(Fullfillingness..)came out two years earlier.Since then many of his album were years between  releases.Characters came out a mere &quot;TWO YEARS&quot; after In Square  Circle.At first listen it was Wonder-bliss.Unfortunately,repeated listens  showed he should have taken more time with developing this one.No doubt  Skeletons is a jam &amp; a half,but many songs are mediocre(Get  It&lt;w/Michael Jackson&gt;,Dark N' Lovely,Crying Through The Night,My Eyes  Don't Cry)as well as downright ridiculous(Galaxy Paradise,In Your  Corner).Others are worth a listen(You Will Know,With Each Beat Of My  Heart,One Of A Kind),especially the buried nugget Free that salvage this  mediocre mess.
In 1987, Just two years after "In Square Circle", Wonder came back with another studio album, "Characters" but for the first time I can truly say that it isn't a great album just good. Well, It got it's moments but it doesn't have enough memorable or creative songs like most other albums. Wonder settles for passable R&B ballads and contemporary Pop without taking alot of risks. "Characters" was the last Wonder album to gain moderately success. It eventually went platinum and launched a few hits including the top 20 hit "Skeletons" and a surprising duet with Michael Jackson called "Get It". The hit "Skeletons" (in the closet) deals with people with big secrets (i'e it follows the same path as "Big Brother" and "You Haven't Done Nothing. It's a funky uptempo that even had a video and is one of this albums best. "Get It" is typical 80's pop but despite MJ's appearence it isn't that good. Non-singles end up being better like "Dark'n'lovely" about the misery in the motherland Africa, midtempo love song "One of a Kind", drug problems among youth on the sentimental "You Will Know" and "Come Let Me Make Your Love Come Down" with B.B King and the late Stevie Ray Vaughn 1954-1990. "Galaxy Paradise" is alright but a little corny about finding a girl from another planet and the funky soul numbers "In You Corner" and "Crying in the Night" with backround choirs sound alot like previous takes. The rest of the (3) songs are not so memorable but they are not bad either. As a whole I can't say it is among his best but a few songs stand out and a few others surprise, if you're a big Wonder fan check this out, otherwise check out others first. "Characters" would be the last Stevie Wonder album with success, in the 90's he only released two albums, Jungle Fever" a soundtrack to the film with the same name and the lackluster "Conversation Please" before coming back with the strong effort "A Time to Love" in 2005. This was my last Wonder review, Hope They have been helpful!.
Considering that Stevie Wonder's recent releases have been hit compilations for the last eight years,Conversation Peace may be considered as his final studio album.An attempt to find his place on mid 90's radio where hip hop and rap dominates.The attempt at incorporating hip hop elements into his music dilutes his music and makes him sound archaic(a problem with other musical geniuses of the past,Michael Jackson &amp; Prince).Only a handful of songs slightly show his genius(Taboo To Love,Sensuous Whisper,Sorry),while others sound bland(For Your Love,Treat Myself).His message of peace and love tends to sound redundant and at nearly 75 minutes,the album meanders.Hopefully one day,Wonder,after eight years will find his muse and make music that withstand the test of time instead of keeping up with it.
When a Rock superstar launches a Mega-hit album like "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" (as a double LP, in addition) what to do next?... Quite difficult!  With "Caribou", EJ tried to keep his lucky star in the heights of success. However, the album falls short to be the logical sequel to his previous masterpiece. Anyway, it is an album worth to give a try. "The Bitch Is Back", "Pinky" and "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me" are genuine EJ superhits. But "Solar Prestige A Gammon", as well as "You're So Static" and even "Stinker", are an exercise on a different EJ. Strange songs, but hey, if you expect to listen the same tam-tam-tam and tah-dah/tah-dah/tah-dah on every record you get from your favorite artist...
Coming hot on the heels of Elton's masterpiece, &quot;GoodBye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, &quot;Caribou&quot; was a crushing disappointment to critics and fans alike. Elton had never been one to put out &quot;product&quot; for the sake of satisfying the demands of the record company execs, but that's exactly what this is. There are no golden eggs here, although there are a few rotten ones, namely &quot;You're So Static&quot; and &quot;Solar Prestige A Gammon&quot;. &quot;I've Seen The Saucers&quot;, &quot;Stinker&quot; and &quot;Ticking&quot; are the exception and each would sound right at home on &quot;GoodBye Yellow Brick Road&quot;. Many of the other tracks are filler. Considering the pressure Elton was under and the hectic touring schedule he endured, this sin of an album is understandable but falls well short of the high standards Elton had set for himself with his string of early 70's gems. Sadly it was all downhill from here....
Elton John was at the height of his poularity during this period.  Having just released the phenominal Goodybye Yellow Brick Road less than a year earlier, this follow up pales by comparison.  Yeah, there are some WONDERFUL songs on Caribou.  Bitch Is Back, Don't Let The Sun..., Pinky, and Ticking come to mind.That said, there is some filler on this album.  Songs like Dixie Lilly and Solar Prestige A Gammon actually make me cringe--and I love just about everything E.J. has put out.Elton John was a hit making machine in 1974 when this album was released and he prooves his stamina with this effort.  Still, if you're unfamiliar with Elton's music and want to purchase some of his 1970's best, there are better options--like Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Madman Across The Water, Honky Chateau, or even Rock of The Westies.  In my opinion, all of those would make a better choice than Caribou.  His latest, Captian and the Kid and Made In England are also worth a serious listen.
Well, what can I tell you guys? This album is THE worst from his golden years (Empty Sky til Blue Moves). I don't think Elton John was taking his career seriously at all, and it all sounds so refried with several exceptions. &quot;The Bitch is Back&quot;, &quot;Ticking&quot;, &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; are the only reasons for buying THIS album.  I remember someone telling me &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; is the silliest song Elton has ever done. They didn't here &quot;Solar Prestige A Gammon&quot;. What is that? I think Elton John was going through a &quot;Let me do an album like the Beatles&quot; stage. I really don't like this one, I had a bad feeling about it from the beginning, and it only goes to show. Doesn't compare to classics like &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; or &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;... just doesn't.
This is an okay album by Elton John, not great, but some nice music on it.  Does not challenge Honky Chateau or Goodbye YBR.
Without any hesitation on my part, I have to say that Tears for Fears is a talented and sophisticated band.  I enjoy listening to this better-than-good greatest hits collection from time to time.  There certainly are some memorable, well-written songs that are included.  Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82-92) contains a total of 12 tracks--I find every one of the songs to be worthwhile and listenable.  The tunes are taken from three albums:  The Hurting (1983), Songs from the Big Chair (1985), and The Seeds of Love (1989).  Almost all of the songs are in a progressive pop musical direction except for two of them--&quot;Mothers Talk&quot; and &quot;Change&quot; are in a straightforward pop vein.  Undoubtedly, a lot of work has been put into the material that's featured on this album--the songs are intricate, textured, ambient, and inspired.  Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith both do well with the vocals.  Overall, the songwriting is tight, and the musicianship is proficient.  All of the songs feature atmospheric, meaty production.  Also, I like the way keyboards are utilized throughout the disc.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Advice for the Young at Heart,&quot; &quot;Head Over Heels,&quot; and &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love.&quot;  &quot;Advice for the Young at Heart&quot; is a charming, melodious song that displays notable singing and a good guitar solo.  I find the tuneful &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; to be an impressive, well-crafted track--the beginning is very nice.  &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot; is one that's elaborate, layered, ambitious, and engaging; it also sports a serene, smooth chorus.  &quot;Shout&quot; is gratifying and memorable, too--I like the urgent-sounding chorus and the catchy guitar solo.  The aspect of &quot;Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)&quot; that I like the most is the ethereal-flavored keyboard playing.  The CD booklet includes the song lyrics.  I find the lyrics to &quot;Mad World&quot; to be interesting.  As for the duration of the CD, it's just under an hour.  This compilation of hits from Tears for Fears is consistent, fulfilling, and well worth a listen.  I actually give it 3.5 stars.
I simply wish to make a correction to my review below.  I complained about Candle in the Wind not being included on EJ's Greatest Hits (it was NOT included upon the record's release in 1974).  I see now, however, that  Candle in the Wind has been added.
A greatest hits album that is greatest hits.  My favorites song on here is Daniel.  Elton John has a style all his own.  These songs cover a wide range of tastes. The rocking Crocodile Rock.  Your Song which is a ballad love song.  And just about every kind of song in between.
Elton John has certainly cemented his place in the history of music.  He is a legendary performer who has rode a wave of success unlike any artist.  Elton John first came on the music scene in 1969.  Once his 1970 hit "Your Song" of his self titled "Elton John" (his second) album was released, it would begin one of the most consistent music careers in the history of music.  In fact, from 1969 until 1991 - there wasn't a calendar year that passed without the release of some sort of Elton John album.  Even after that, Elton would only miss 2 calendar years without a release between 1991 and 2004 (those years being 1998 and 2003).  On the plus side, not only has this given Elton John a level of consistency that has been unsurpassed, but it also has allowed him to build up an incredibly large music library.  There is a minus side:  With such frequent album releases, Elton's albums are often diluted.  While there have been dozens of legendary tracks by Elton John, there aren't too many "complete" Elton albums that I would dub of legendary status.  In other words, his albums usually contain 1 to 2 great tracks with the remainder of the tracks being lukewarm at best.  It is this scenario that makes a Greatest Hits album very attractive to the Elton John fan - namely because it allows one to have a collection of those legendary tracks in one place.  One such collection is the first Greatest Hits collection that Elton released entitled "Elton John Greatest Hits".Elton has certainly no shortage of Greatest Hits albums as he has released several of them.  There is this collection - "Greatest Hits", but there is also "Greatest Hits Volume 2", "Greatest Hits Volume III" (this one is a tough find), "Greatest Hits 1976-1986", and "Greatest Hits 1970-2002".  Other compilations include: "To Be Continued" Boxed Set and "Love Songs" collections.  "Elton John Greatest Hits" focuses on the early part of Elton's career - 1969 - 1974.  It is worth noting that all of the songs that are contained on this collection are also found on the "To Be Continued"  Boxed Set (although "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" and "Candle in the Wind" are live versions on the boxed set).  With the exception of "Border Song", all of these songs are found on the "Greatest Hits 1970-2002" set.  The good thing is that "Greatest Hits" focuses on that early period in Elton's career - and this makes it a very attractive collection to have these songs.  However, I would still be tempted to go for one of the two broader collections - either "Greatest Hits 1970-2002" or "To Be Continued" despite some of the minor differences.For "Greatest Hits", there are 11 songs taken from 5 Elton John albums. For 1974, this is a pretty good sized collection of music to be available on a single album (This was before the days of CDs that could fit more music on a single unit).  These albums are: "Elton John" ("Your Song", "Border Song");  "Honky Chateau" ("Honky Cat", "Rocket Man"); "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player" ("Daniel", "Crocodile Rock"); "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" ("Candle in the Wind", "Bennie and the Jets", "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", "Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"); Caribou ("Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me").  As you can see, the pattern with Elton John not having depth on his albums seems to apply - except for the case of "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" (but this had 17 tracks - more than most albums during that time).Looking at the time period of 1969 through 1974, there are some glaring omissions of songs.  For starters, there are no tracks from Elton debut "Empty Sky".  "Empty Sky" might not be a well-known Elton John album, but there are other more obvious omissions.  There are no songs taken from the better known albums such as "Tumbleweed Collection" (namely "Burn Down the Mission") and "Madman Across the Water" ("Tiny Dancer" and "Levon").  Also missing from "Caribou" is the popular track "The Bitch is Back".  Much of these omissions go back to the fact that Elton probably wanted to put out a Greatest Hits album as a single entity.  As a result, just two years later Elton would release another Greatest Hits album entitled "Elton John Greatest Hits Volume 2".  This second collection would include some of the tunes that were omitted from this collection - namely "Levon" and "The Bitch is Back".  However, the omissions of "Burn Down the Mission" and "Tiny Dancer" are too much to overcome.  I consider these two of the best Elton John songs he has ever done.  While I do realize songs like "Daniel", "Honky Cat", and "Crocodile Rock" are close to the hearts of Elton John fans, I would have easily traded any of these songs to have those two omitted songs to be included.I'm also disappointed the collection is not in chronological order of the release of the songs.  The reason I prefer this is because it allows me to see how the artist progresses over time.  The songs seemed to be "mixed" in an order for some reason, but I haven't been able to decipher what the logic was behind this particular ordering.The liner notes do contain some information, but not a lot.  For each of the tracks, each of the musician credits are included along with a couple of production credits.  They also tell the dates the songs were recorded, but they don't tell the album that the song was contained on.  As with most Greatest Hits collections, there are no lyrics included with this collection.  Even with some of the flaws, this was a good collection during its time.  However with some of the more recent releases, if you are a serious of casual Elton John fan, you are probably going to want to consider some of the more complete collections.
Elton John is one of the few none country singers that i ever listened to.  I was teenager back in the '70s and most of my friends were more into rock music then i was.  But you just about had to be deaf not to have heard his songs,  He was everywhere.I bought his first Greatest Hits then bought this one.  And they are the only two cds of his that I have.  At the time that this came out I was out of school so I wasn't hearing his music as much as i used to.  I didn't know most of these songs. I kne The Bitch Is Back, Philadelphia Freedom,Pinball Wizard.  And Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.  Which I really like and is my favorite song on this cd.  I dont really know the rest of these songs and I dont really listen to this enough to probably ever really know them.

Other compilations include: "To Be Continued" Boxed Set and "Love Songs" collections.  It is worth noting that all of the songs that are contained on this collection are also found on the "To Be Continued"  with the exception of "Grow Some Funk of Your Own". As for the "Greatest Hits 1970-2002" set only 7 of the 10 songs on "Greatest Hits Volume II" are included - the exceptions being "Pinball Wizard", "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds", and "Grow Some Funk of Your Own"There are 10 tracks on "Greatest Hits Volume II".  This collection was released only 3 years following the release of "Greatest Hits Volume I".  Elton had released three studio albums during that time and as a result there are only 4 tracks from new studio albums.  These albums are: "Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy" ("Someone Saved My Life Tonight"); "Rock of the Westies" ("Island Girl", "Grow Some Funk of Your Own"); "Blue Moves" ("Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word").  During this period, Elton contributed a song to the "Tommy" soundtrack (a cover of The Who's "Pinball Wizard").  There are three songs on this album that were only released as singles that weren't included on any studio album until the release of this collection.  These three songs are actually some of Elton's most legendary work:  "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds", "Philadelphia Freedom", and "Don't Go Breaking My Heart".When Elton John's "Greatest Hits" (Volume 1) was released - this covered a period of time from 1969 through 1974.  During this time, there were definitely some songs that were left out of this collection that could be considered Greatest Hits.  The nice thing about "Greatest Hits Volume II" is that there are two tracks included that come from this period.  These songs are "Levon" (from the "Madman Across the Water" album) and "The Bitch is Back" (from the "Caribou" album).  There are still some other tracks that were omitted from this early period that weren't captured until much later on compilations by Elton John - namely "Burn Down the Mission" (from "Tumbleweed Collection) and "Tiny Dancer (from "Madman Across the Water").  This isn't meant to be a knock on "Greatest Hits Volume II".  I am pleased that Elton included a couple of earlier songs.  Keep in mind that in 1977, this was the days of Vinyl albums - and there was limited space to get songs on a single entity.  In 1977, to get an album with 10 songs was pretty good.One thing that is interesting about this collection is that there are two "covers" of songs by Elton John.  These covers are  The Beatles' "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" and The Who's "Pinball Wizard".  For these covers,  Elton brings his own spin and style to these singles and I feel his versions hold their own.  I would say "Pinball Wizard" is the stronger of the two songs.  Years later, when the album of Elton John Covers "Two Rooms" was released, The Who would "return the favor" by doing a cover of Elton's classic song "Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting".I'm also disappointed the collection is not in chronological order of the release of the songs.  The reason I prefer this is because it allows me to see how the artist progresses over time.  The songs seemed to be "mixed" in an order for some reason, but I haven't been able to decipher what the logic was behind this particular ordering.The liner notes do contain some information, but not a lot.  For each of the tracks, each of the musician credits are included along with a couple of production credits.  They also tell the dates the songs were recorded, but they don't tell the album that the song was contained on.  As with most Greatest Hits collections, there are no lyrics included with this collection.  Overall, the tracks that are included on "Volume II" form a nice selection of Elton John tracks.  I also think the material on "Volume II" is stronger than "Volume I".  Overall, I'd recommend this collection.
There are so many acts that truly have defined the sounds and souls of the 1970's. Although they've had such great music, there have been just very few definitive performers still showcasing that feeling of great classic music like Billy Joel, Chicago, Stevie Wonder, and especially Elton John. Elton's music of the 70's as well as his later eras have still brought so much joy to all corners of the world. While his first greatest hits record did actually deliver that point of his era, his sequels could've been a lot more to actually have been desired. That is the point within this record.Elton John Greatest Hits Volume 2 is a reflection of his highpoints from the mid 70's. The collection mainly is comprised of several good tracks like the somber Someone Saved My Life Tonight, Philadelphia Freedom, and the hard rocking Pinball Wizard from The Who's rock opera Tommy. Although the collection has some good tracks, there are just so many great songs that weren't actually highlighted at all like the soulful Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word, Don't Go Breaking My Heart with Kiki Dee, Burn Down The Mission, and many other great gems.All in all, Elton John Greatest Hits Volume 2 could've been better, if there was more to have been highlighted. Instead, I really suggest you purchase the double album Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002. Saying sorry to this collection, isn't the hardest word.Album Cover: BSongs: CPrice: C 1/2-Remastering: B-Overall: C
This collection of EJ rarities is for the die-hard rather than the casual or curious.  I'd prefer to give Rare Masters 2 1/2 stars, but that's not an option on Amazon.  The effort to present Elton's hard-to-find B-sides,  demos, and other marginalia is noble, I guess.  But just like EJ's studio  release, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Rare Masters would've made a heck of a  single record if the fat had been trimmed off.  Biggest mistake, without a  doubt, was the inclusion of the ENTIRE Friends Soundtrack.  Yeah, I know  that Friends is out of print.  But there's a reason it's out-of-print:  because it's almost unlistenable.  Friends contains a handful of Elton John  cuts (second-rate cuts, at that) and a whole lot of sappy, stringy schlock  that wasn't even written by Elton (so why is it included on Rare Masters)  but by orchestral arranger Paul Buckmaster.  I do have to agree with one of  the reviewers below that &quot;Into the Old Man's Shoes&quot; is wonderful,  and I have no idea why Elton didn't include it on the dull Tumbleweed  Connection.
Rare Masters is a very interesting listen for someone like me who is the ultimate Elton John fan.  At one point or another, I've owned everything Elton's put out, so it's nice to have this double CD of B-sides and  unreleased tracks.If you're unfamiliar with Elton's albums, there are some better choices to start with.  I'd suggest, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Madman Across The Water, Rock of the Westies, or even his latest release, The Captain & The Kid, over Rare Masters.  That said, if you've worn grooves in your 20 year old LP versions of the above mentioned you can't go wrong with Rare Masters.
Almost all of the b-sides and various singles included here on this collection are now available on the expanded reissues of Elton's albums. The real reason to get this is that its (as of this writing)the only place to get the "Friends" soundtrack. No, not the soundtrack to that TV show but to an obscure early 70's movie. Elton and Bernie wrote four new songs that were used in the film (although Bernie supposedly didn't read the script he only skimmed through it to get a feel for the movie). The rest of the album is filled with Paul Buckmaster's soundtrack which adapts various themes from these four songs plus a reprise of the title track. Is it worthwhile buying this just for the "Friends" soundtrack? Yes, if you're a hardcore Elton John fan because his is the only place to get the album now.If you enjoy Buckmaster's orchestrations on the early Elton John albums, then you'll enjoy every aspect of this album. If you're looking just for the songs that John and Taupin wrote, you'll still enjoy the four full performances and song reprise. Just about any of these songs musically would have fit in well on "Elton John", "Tumbleweed Connection" or "Madman Across the Water" with "Honey Roll" and "Can I Put Yon On" two great lost Elton John rockers. They would have made a fine single if they had been released separately from this album (which I believe one of them was if memory serves).We also get the singles/b-sides that were added to each Elton John album through "Tumbleweed Connection". "I've Been Loving You"/"Here's To the Next Time", "Lady Samantha"/"All Across the Havens", "It's Me That You Need", "Just Like Strange Rain", "Bad Side of the Moon", Rock & Roll Madonna", "Grey Seal" (an early version of the song from "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road")all demonstrate Elton and Bernie's developing songcraft even if they aren't always the best songs by the duo.The second disc features an outtake from "Madman Across the Water" (included on "Tumbleweed Connection"), "Into the Old Man's Shoes", "Rock me When He's Gone", "Slave" all of which appear on "Tumbleweed" or "Honkey Chateau". "Skyline Pidgeon" is a piano/vocal re-recording that appeared as a b-side from 1973 and appears along with "Jack Rabbit", "Whenever You're Ready (We'll Go Steady)" from "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player" (although the latter two were also on the deluxe reissue of "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"). "Screw You". "Sick City", "Step Into Christmas" and "Ho! Ho Ho" all appear on "Carbiou" as bonus tracks. "One Day At A Time" and "I Saw Her Standing There" appeared as b-sides and on "Captain Fantastic". "House of Cards", "Planes" and "Sugar on the Floor" all appear on "Rock of the Westies". Only "Let Me Be Your Car" doesn't appear anywhere else as it was written/performed as a demo for Rod Stewart who recorded it for one of his albums.The two CD set includes an oversized booklet with comments from Bernie about the genesis of each song. The mastering is pretty good overall and is done by Joseph Palmaccio before engineers started applying too much compression to make the music sound "louder" and more contemporary (and squeezing the dynamic range to death hurting the quality of the sounds you hear). I'd get it if you are an Elton John fan before it goes out of print as almost everything here is somewhere else, it's possible this is on the chopping block. So I'd give 4 stars to the best songs here from "Friends" and the stronger tracks from disc 2 with 2-3 stars for the other b-sides on the first disc and the remainder on disc 2 with an overall rating of 3 stars.
3 1/2Elemental remains the sleek early 90's production job it initially sounded of, though can putter off on autopilot, while vocals grow increasingly grating, in its cheesier moments. Thankfully, TFF never leave entire songs stranded for too long, with mushy pace often subsided by broad electronic strokes to help clear the palate when needed.
I love Abba to death and view Benny and Bjorn to be in a league with  Lennon/McCartney.  This 19 trk collection of their biggest hits is nice,  but leaves so much to be desired.  If you like Abba, you know Dancing Queen  and Take A Chance On Me so much that you can replay the songs in your head  without listening to it.  This collection is a nice sampler of the biggest  hits, but many of their best songs were either lesser hits, or were album  tracks.  Get either Thank You For The Music or Forever Gold if you  really want to experience why they were such a phenomenon.
When Bon Jovi lets loose a larger-than-life power ballad, it usually doesn't fall too badly.  Richie Sambora's fluid guitar work and expert (if slick) production values tend to make these acceptable.So we have  several songs here dripping with hookery:  &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot;,  the band's biggest hit, a big anthem with killer melodic progressions;  semi-novelty cowboy tune &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, featuring that  immortal Sambora riff on acoustic guitar; &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, the  ballad that's really Jon Bon Jovi solo with a guest appearance by Jeff  Beck; and &quot;I'll Be There for You&quot;, a teenager's-swoon kind of  romantic ballad with good sonics if incredibly juvenile lyrics.  Too bad  this collection omits the best and most sexual song from New Jersey,  &quot;Living in Sin&quot;, one of the band's best power ballads.Now onto  the losers:  &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, which tried to reinvent the band  but ended up sounding just humiliating; &quot;Always&quot; is when Bon Jovi  remembers the &quot;ballad&quot; but forgets the &quot;power&quot;, leaving  Sambora and the band on auto-pilot, with Jon Bon Jovi's voice not nearly  good enough to carry such a somnambulant song; &quot;Lay Your Hands on  Me&quot;, brainless to the point of ridicule; &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;,  which started the band's hyper-irritating run of &quot;soft&quot; '90s  singles; and the band's worst pair of #1 hits, &quot;You Give Love a Bad  Name&quot; and &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, extremely poorly written party  animals with bad lyrics that are neither catchy nor meaningful, melodies  that crawl on their belly, and gung-ho metal arrangements with no  shadings.Aside from the exclusion of &quot;Living in Sin&quot;, this is  about the one Bon Jovi release where you'll get the fewest duds.  Definitely worth it if you want the hits, instead of buying the whole  catalogue, 60% of which is garbage.
What you're hoping to take away with this package will affect how good you think it is:1) An overview of the band's 'best' material from "Bon Jovi" forward...OR2) A collection of the chart hits that were blared out of radios and on MTV throughout most of the late 80s.If you're in the #2 group, this will be pretty good. Bon Jovi is at his best with huge sounding arena anthems, not sensitive singer-songwriter tunes. 3 big ones are missing ("Living in Sin","Born to Be my Baby","Never Say Goodbye") and you don't get "It's my Life" or "Thank You for Loving Me" since they weren't released until 2000's "Crush" (this collection came out in 1994) but those are the biggest nitpicks with the collection.There is a Japanese import version that adds on "Never Say Goodbye" and "Tokyo Road" from early album "7800 Fahrenheit" (no crappy "Livin' on a Prayer" remake either)(ASIN:B0000677K0) but it'll cost you nearly 3 times what you're paying here.#1 category fans who insist the two most "metal" albums are the best stuff won't be happy: 1 track each from "Bon Jovi" and "7800 Fahrenheit". There's nothing from the "These Days" album at all.The liners are nonexistent. No lyrics...no context for the songs..just a pic of the band moping in a diner.HIGHLIGHTS:Their most indelible material remains what came out on the mega-hit albums "New Jersey" and "Slippery When Wet": "Livin' on a Prayer" still sounds great played loud on your car stereo, macho fantasies "Blaze of Glory" and "Wanted:Dead or Alive" get my testosterone flowing, and "You Give Love a Bad Name" is a fist pumper everytime. Outside of those, "Keep the Faith" is a surprisingly strong later period effort that rides its chorus on shattered tremolo guitars and "I'll Be There for You" was one of their best power ballads, "sensitive" without being mawkish. "Runaway" was the breakthrough tune for the group and holds up pretty well even with the 80s-ish keyboard on the intro.LOWS:"Always" takes the worst excesses of power ballads and amplifies them. All awash in strings and syrupy sentiment, it's a pile of goo. "Bed of Roses" wastes what could have been a good song by not bothering to write a good hook and letting it run WAY too long (6 1/2 minutes of this dreck? Please...) His lyric about being on the road away from his woman ("Well I'm so far away/That each step that I take is on my way home/A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night/Just to see through this payphone") is one of his better ones but it's wasted here. "Prayer '94", an unplugged remake of "Livin' on a Prayer", was probably an attempt to place the focus on the lyric (which to be fair is a good one) but it saps all the power out of the song. The song just NEEDS to be pumped up with Sambora's guitar chords.BOTTOM LINE:Bon Jovi is a singles band. Buy this and you've got most of their best. You'll probably want to get "New Jersey" and "Slippery..." used cheap to have the missing 3. You can always burn them onto your own anthology.3 stars (lost a star because of liners/missing hits)
BON JOVI-CROSS ROADS: BON JOVI always amounted to the poor man's SPRINGSTEEN and as far as New Jersey rock acts go, SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY & THE ASBURY JUKES also possessed more chops and blue eyed soul power, even if they lacked BJ's movie star good looks and mass recognition. The guilty pleasure hat trick of YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME, LIVIN' ON A PRAYER, (both co-written with song doctor to the stars DESMOND CHILD) and WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE from their big-hair breakthrough album SLIPPERY WHEN WET cemented the band's crafty, radio-ready brand of "bubble-metal", goosed by JON BON JOVI's non-threatening yelp, RICHIE SAMBORA's slick six string licks, and hooks big enough to hang sombreros on. Subsequent singles BAD MEDICINE, LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME and KEEP THE FAITH milked the arena rock formula a little too thoroughly, even as the band climbed into the upper echelon of pin-up pop stars. Sure, you can hum this stuff all night long, but will you be able to respect yourself in the morning when it's still clingin' to your tongue like dry-mouth?RATING: THREE CANS OF MOUSSE
Bon Jovi's first greatest hits album is entitled &quot;Cross Road&quot;.  The title is appropriate because by the time of its release in 1994, the group had really reached a true crossroads in their career.  Bon Jovi had rode the wave of the hard rock/metal-like influence on the pop music scene in the late 1980s.  By the time of 1992's &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, they still were doing what they do best - but now Alternative Music was beginning to dominate the pop scene.  Therefore, I think its very appropriate that the group put out a Greatest Hits album - and look back to determine what the next steps should be in their career.  This is what the band did on &quot;Cross Road&quot; - a compilation of 11 Bon Jovi songs spread over the groups' 5 albums (plus one Jon Bon Jovi solo effort) as well as the inclusion of 3 new tracks that are truly reflective of this &quot;crossroads&quot; theme.It's important to know that this is really a sampling of Bon Jovi's greatest hits.  This collection doesn't attempt to go deeper.  It really took the most popular songs from the group's previous albums and included them on one collection.  I think the reason for 3 new tracks was to try to attract the pure Bon Jovi fans who were looking for more  I was disappointed there was only 1 song from &quot;7800 Degrees Fahrenheit&quot; (&quot;In and Out of Love&quot;) and one song from the self-titled &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; album (&quot;Runaway&quot;) .  It is also worth noting that Bon Jovi has done other Greatest Hits compilations - such as the live album &quot;One Wild Night&quot; and the acoustic-sounding remake of their greatest hits on &quot;This Left Feels Right&quot;.  This is going to be the only pure studio recorded greatest hits album that has been released.Of the three new songs, the best of the new songs is &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot;.  I feel the &quot;cross roads&quot; theme is very evident here as this has a very acoustic like theme to it.  Jon Bon Jovi has some great vocals, but it's Richie Sambora's guitar and background vocals are going to make this song stand out.  The lyrics are catchy and melody are both catchy.  Sticking with this &quot;cross roads&quot; theme, Bon Jovi re-recorded an acoustic, slower version of &quot;Livin on a Prayer&quot; - this one is just called &quot;Prayer 94&quot;.  On the &quot;This Left Feels Right&quot;, there is a much better acoustic recording of this song, but the Bon Jovi fans should still appreciate this song.  The group also includes the &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; version of the song as well.  The final new song is &quot;Always&quot;.  Once again, this is consistent with the crossroads theme of a calmer, more mellow Bon Jovi sound.  Despite the fact that &quot;Always&quot; has more of a classic Bon Jovi sound with Jon's vocals and David Bryan's keyboards - this is a pretty weak song.  &quot;Always&quot; seems like it was custom made for Top 40 radio.  I was surprised that &quot;Always&quot; got the nod to be the single released over &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot;. One final note, I do think Richie Sambora provides some nice background vocals again on this single.As for the other albums, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; is represented by the megahits &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot;, and &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;.  &quot;New Jersey&quot; is represented by &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, and &quot;I'll Be There for You&quot;.  &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; is represented by &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; and &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (I thought that &quot;In These Arms&quot; should have also be included).  &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, the single that Jon Bon Jovi recorded for the &quot;Young Guns II&quot; movie (from the &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; album he recorded) is also included on here.  I think &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; is a great song, but it isn't a pure Bon Jovi song and I would have liked to see another song by the full band included in place of this song.The liner notes for this album are extremely poor.  The credits are pretty poor as well - there basically are some footnotes making it tough to read. There are no lyrics included for any of the songs (including the new ones).  There are pictures of the album covers, but the associated albums the songs are from are not corresponded with the songs.  I also thought it was interesting that a picture of the album cover from Richie Sambora's album is included, but yet none of his solo stuff is included while one of Jon's solo songs was.  Much of the liner notes is a fold-out into a picture of the band in a New Jersey diner with a pseudo autograph &quot;Thanks for Believing&quot; signed by Jon Bon Jovi.  The songs aren't in chronological order and usually I prefer a greatest hits album to go in that order.I'm hoping that the band eventually will release a boxed set that goes much deeper with their music portfolio.  This album is a nice way for someone to get an introduction to Bon Jovi.  It also does keep with theme of &quot;Cross Road&quot;, so that is a plus.  However, if you are a pure Bon Jovi fan - stick with the original studio albums.  Finally, once Bon Jovi reached this &quot;cross roads&quot; in their career - I don't think the band was ever the same in terms of their later releases and never captured the magic of the earlier days.
If you are a fan of Bon Jovi or even just like a few of their hits, this album is for you. Some of the songs are somewhat corny, but generally speaking this is a great album. I can't wait to see them in concert in May!
Made in England being Elton John's 1995 release and his 25th studio album contained such hits as Believe, Made in England and Blessed. The booklet is ok with a bunch of photos of Elton John and the lyrics are easy to read. I have no idea who Denis Gauthier is or Peter Williams but they must have mattered in Elton John's life to mention them. 3/5.
I find this disc to be wildly uneven veering from the soaring heights of "Believe" (one of Elton's best anthems...honestly...of his career) to the lows of "Man". (a hymn of sorts affirming the essential worth of the human).The good: "Believe" as already mentioned, is Elton's rewrite of "All You Need is Love" and it's a good one. The trailing harp/string instrumental at the fade particularly is a nice touch. This one's a winner.Rocker "Pain" personifies Elton as our collective hurts, the stab that's been here for "Nineteen hundred and ninety-four years" (the CD was a 1995 release but the song had been copyrighted prior) and strikes us all ("You're all I ever wanted, I'm all you'll ever be).Other highlights are the simple Rickenbacher dusted ode to growing old together ("Please") and "Lies" where Elton insists everyone, including himself, is two-faced except about what really matters ("I've lied about most everything but I never lied to you"). "Blessed"  is a longing for family that promises the world to an as yet unborn son or daughter and, while using a few cliches, ("I'll pick a star from the sky") is winsome.The valleys come not so much because of "bad" songs: the only truly awful one on here is "Man". But too many songs combine a beautiful melody with a lyric that never really fully settles in such as "Belfast". Copping the string fade out to "Believe" at its start, "Belfast" is musically gorgeous. And the lyric imagery is great, too ("smoking black roses on the streets of Belfast"). But Taupin seems to have forgotten to write a legitimate "hook" for the chorus.."House" likewise is a great harp-laden ballad. But Taupin's lyric (which one reviewer states is a paean to John Lennon) is so oblique as to not register. It seems mostly like an "I Am,I Said" rewrite. Even looking at the lyrics again, I can't find a way to tie to it to the Fab One. And whoever thought that "Latitude" would be a great metaphor for long-distance relationships?Buy this one used. For the good songs, it's a bargain at around a buck. But the 4 and 5 star ratings for this are seriously overrated.
Yes, Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player was one of Elton John's recordings that was released during his peak years.  Somehow, it falls short of some of his other releases during that period.The two singles, the bouncy Crocodile Rock and the gentle easy going Daniel are true gems.  Edelberry Wine and High Flying Bird are two strong album tracks.  And Have Mercy On The Criminal is fairly memorable as well.  As for the remaining songs, they are not bad but not too great either.  I have listened to this record about four or five times over the last few days and tunes like Blues For Baby And Me and Texan Love Song just do not jog my memory too strongly.For my money, this is a pretty good Elton John record.  However, I prefer Honkey Chateau, Goodbye Yellowbrick Road, Caribou, and Captain Fantastic to this batch.
You know sensitive piano ballad albums, they often have a moody front cover, a photo of our hero looking 'emotional', perhaps as if deep in thought, awakening that inner genius to write some great lyric or spine-chilling melody. Or, perhaps, since back in 1970 no-one knew who Elton John was, a moody photo of someone looking emotional was, somewhere by themself, was to entertain the idea this was some how sensitive singer/songwriter piano ballad music. And perhaps, the listener will be rather pleased in that regard, most notably the 'sensitive' part.Elton John's sophomore 'debut album' shows Elton wearing Bernie Taupin's heart fairly and squarely on his sleeve, which means, well, I guess you could say 'heartfelt'. Although a fan's favourite target, 'First episode at Hienton' is particularly engaging, with it's ringing, eerie synths, and the harpsichord driven delicacy of 'I need you to turn to'. It is definitely his enthusiasm that drives the rockers; there aren't any guitars on them. And then there's that Paul Buckmaster. What an imaginative lad he is, and this is possibly his finest outing (with Elton)Elton wouldn't be one of those people who believes in 'too much of a good thing' now would he? Oh ok, so it's just a coincidence that a lot of these songs sound VERY SIMILAR. He has proved over the last 40 years how diverse he can be, even if this album is narrow-focused. Be sure to pick up the bonus tracks for the energy assault of 'Bad side of the moon', don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds! Rating ***1/4 (3.25)
Trust me I've always loved Elton John.He and Bernie have written a song for virtually every occation in my life and his music is really great to party with too,or better yet bob your head and sing along.And who doesn't feel that way?I doubt many but for those of you unlucky enough to make this 1969 debut release your first Elton John purchase you'd be making a serious mistake.'Empty Sky' actually embodies every clishe' there is about debut pop albums-the artist hasn't yet found his music nitche,the songs aren't catchy and the material is very uneven.But musically speaking I can't fault any of these songs-each embraces ideas that Elton would use to great effect on his upcoming classics-take note of his signiture pounding piano work on the title cut,just a hook or two away from being a good first single.But,despite everything else here being too uninteresting to even mention Elton made the best choice of his career when he decided not to release 'Empty Sky' in America at first and banked on his first big single "Your Song" instead.And once he got the ball rolling he released this album in the US in 1975-at a time when he was so hot that anything with his name would sell something.And that being said there are only three kinds of people who might find this album a treasure-completists,pop music historians or anyone curious about Elton John's beginnings as a solo performer.Other then that 'Empty Sky' is a work in progress and an aquired taste best left to these types.
Elton John's first album Empty Sky dates from 1969, which was near the end of the 22-year-old Elton's pre-fame period. The album was produced by original Elton producer Steve Brown, and features voice and keyboards from Elton, guitar from Caleb Quaye and session men on other instruments. It is good, and is now collectible owing to Elton's huge commercial success later on in the 70's, and represented an initial opportunity for Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin to try for some recognition in the world of progressive album-orientated art-rock. Unable to compete on the charts at this early stage due to a severe lack of public awareness of Elton John's music and lack of radio airplay, Empty Sky did at least catch the ear of some discerning rock listeners and reviewers at the time.Best is the early classic Skyline Pigeon, a lovely melody for a tale of the yearning for freedom. Elton's harpsichord works beautifully on this excellent song. Also good is Lady What's Tomorrow - also a nice melody. Sails has peculiar lyrics and the electric guitar sound also heard in the slightly-psychedelic rockout title track Empty Sky. Val-Hala is a good early example of Elton John tunecraft- even at this stage he could write a good chorus melody. The last track is the haunting tale of deceased farmdog Gulliver which segues into a snippet of groovy instrumental stuff called Hay Chewed (an Eltonian pun on Hey Jude!!). A rather unnecessary Reprise sort of spoils this track (yes, one of those annoying medleys of bits of all the songs on the album right at the end) as it then segues onto the end of this.I discovered this album in the local lending library on vinyl way back in 1990, and liked it. It was not a big hit at the time of initial release, but charted in the US Top 10 much later in 1975 when Elton was the hottest pop/rock act in the world. This US version had different cover art.A significant addition to the album has been made with the inclusion of Elton's four sides of 7&quot; vinyl singles from 1969 as bonus CD tracks here. Best of these was Lady Samantha - a really good track that gained some limited airplay on minor stations in 1969 in England as Elton's first record to receive any recognition at all(though not a hit)and it's an acid-rock tinged tale of a lonely wraith! Its B side was All Across The Havens. It's Me That You Need was an early orchestrated pop love song that was not a hit, and its B-side was Just Like Strange Rain. These songs were recorded at about the same time as the album, so add to make a nice collection of 1969-model Elton. His fine voice makes a strong first impression here, handling soft and hard, loud and quiet equally well.
First released 1969 in his native England, John hasn't yet teemed up with long-time producer Gus Dudgeon and you can hear Steve Brown trying to create a sound. On "Western Ford Gateway", he fiddles with echo and panning (using the mixing console to change where the singer "appears" to be singing from..going from speaker to speaker..) effects before placing Elton dead center in the stereo image. Other experimentations include flowery instrumentation that includes harpsichord ("Skyline Pigeon"), flute ("Hymn 2000"), and congas ("Empty Sky") at various times.Frequent listenings favour "Empty Sky" as you take it more on its own terms and less as "failed" Elton John. It's probably as good as many 1969 rock/pop efforts and better than some.The best efforts may be the title track, although it runs a bit overlong and contains an ill-advised segment where the music fades far into the distance and Sir Elton whispers "shh" and "get down with it,baby.." (This happens about 7 minutes in..). A fade at about the 5:40 mark after the last lyric would better it..maybe with the flutter of wings passing by as the final coda to keep it "heavy, man" without it passing into inanity. Despite it being a bit pretentious, "Val-Hala" is also a better effort, sounding like a classical consort sitting in for a "Tumbleweed Connection" outtake, along with "Western Ford Gateway" (which has an odd 'click' during the last guitar part..noise from the analogue reel?)The bad: "The Scaffold" is artsy-fartsy indulgence ("In Orient where wise I was, To please the way I live, Come give the beggar chance at hand, His life is on his lip") that manages to name-check Eldorado and minotaurs. It's the stuff of comic book nerds. The harpsichord and panned voice production render "Skyline Pigeon" too proper and precious to make it as a good pop song. "Gulliver/Hay Chewed/Reprise" is a three part tune which starts with a decent elegy that ends with an echoed scream from Elton segueing into...a jazzy (complete with horns) rock instrumental...and closing out with snatches of all the songs that have gone before. Completely awful.Worth getting if you are a serious Elton fan, or if you have his hit collections and 70s material and you find it very cheaply. Otherwise, I'd pass on this one...THE BONUS MATERIAL: If you already have this one, here's the bonuses for the remastered material. Early single "Lady Samantha" was a minor English hit for him. "All Across the Havens" is a mid-tempo affair with some odd cavernously reverbed drum at times. Nice but not great. "It's Me that You Need" is probably the most realized of the extras here. A nicely orchestrated tune and one you'll be glad to have.
Admittedly, this is the least favorite of my early Elton John CDs, yet it shows much of the promise which Elton John and Bernie Taupin would soon fulfill in their 1970's albums produced by Gus Dudgeon. The two most memorable songs on this CD are &quot;Skyline Pigeon&quot; and &quot;Lady Samantha&quot;. Absolutely this is a must for Elton John fans, though unlike the next CD, &quot;Elton John&quot;, it is certainly not one of his essential recordings. Gus Dudgeon and his team have done a fine job remastering this early album.
There's no denying the John/Taupin talent--it's just that most of it isn't on display here. This early effort suffers from poor production and a collaboration that had yet to catch fire. The title track and Skyline Pidgeon are two of the strongest songs on the album. The rest is pretty easy to dismiss (including the bonus tracks some of which are horrid).The most important songs that point the way to the big leap in development as songwriters for John/Taupin are the title track an expansive epic that runs over eight minutes, "Skyline Pidgeon" (which John would re-record as an elegant piano/vocal arrangement) and the concluding track "Gulliver/Hay Chewed/Reprise" with its jazzy jam at the end of the song. Producer Steve Brown (who would convince Gus Dudgeon to produce Elton)provides a simple, spare, uncluttered production style for the songs.The second album would be the "real" debut for the John/Taupin songwriting team. Yes, "ELTON JOHN" has its weaknesses as well but, over all, the songs are better written, arranged and the lyrics less haphazardly thrown together. Even Elton's weakest albums during his "prime" had the superb production of Gus Dudgeon to salvage even the weakest material. Fortunately, Steve Brown recognized his own shortcomings as a producer and hooked up Elton with Gus.
Let's see, this one's got a self-indulgent concept (Elton and Bernie's rise to fame), painfully campy cover art, a title that seems to have been dreamed up from a parody of a '50s superhero radio show, a couple of glitzy, Vegas-like rockers ("Meal Ticket"; "Better off Dead"), a few melodramatic ballads ("Writing"; "Curtains"; "Bitter Fingers", with an awful synthesizer part). And yet, if you can look past all that, if you go in expecting something less than a full-on confessional masterpiece, you might find plenty of interest here: the majestically overdone ballad "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" was the hit, and there's more where that came from ("We all Fall in Love Sometimes"). The folksy, down-home title song actually does have a bunch of strong imagery about the duo's roots; "Tower of Babel" has a killer guitar part; "When the Whistle Blows", a strong vocal. Among the bonus tracks are two #1's: the disco-till-you-drop "Philadelphia Freedom", which is a lot better than it sounds, and a disgraceful cover of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", featuring John Lennon on backup vocals.
Elton John / Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy:  There are several radio friendly tunes here, all sounding like they came from The Partridge Family, or a concert from `Up with People'.  If this is a concept album, nobody realized it until decades later when they proclaimed they were making a sequel to it.  Elton and Bernie took all the Wrong lessons away from their "Yellow Brick Road" masterpiece and became `hit' makers instead of album makers.  This CD can serve as a collection of Elton John's mid `70s radio hits, but that all it's worth (and we still get this stuff over the radio anyway).  This marked the death of Elton John as an artist.  I'll be generous and give this one Three Stars.
The cover is about the most interesting thing about this record. The title track starts the record off in promising fashion and &quot;Bitter Fingers&quot; shows flashes of the old Elton, but the rest is somewhat  boring. Sounds very dated to listen to it now.
Overall, I think this album is very over rated with only a couple of really good songs -- Someone Saved My Life Tonight, Curtains and Meal Ticket.  The rest are ok, but nothing else stands out and there are no other really good distinctive melodies.  OK effort.
Slow down guys! Just because the name of this album is Captain Fantastic doesn't mean it is so great. I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars. On this album there isn't good songs like Philadelphia Freedom or Pinball Wizard which are also from 1975. Title song is boring,Tell Me When The Whistle Blows and Writing are also not very good songs. The best songs are SSMLT,Tower Of Babel,Better Off Dead and We All Fall In Love Sometimes and other songs are ok. I am a big Elton's fan and I was listening this album thousand times and I think that GYBR and Dont Shoot Me are much more better than this. But don't get me wrong,this is more than good album!
Elton, having conquered country rock and pop rock, now wanted to conquer art-rock. HOORAY!! And what better way to prove you've gone progressive than call yourself 'captain fantastic' and have a front cover with all types of weird creatures from little tea pot men doing calls on nature in front of everyone to half finch half human creatures. What a way to prove how artistic you art... I mean are.And then proceed ten songs that portray Elton and Bernie recounting how life was so tough but they were so brave and strong and overcame all the huge obstacles, all nicely topped off with a smug look of 'IIMM friends with JOHNNNN LENNON you know'. And, not taking all that too seriously, it's only meant to be entertainment (although they don't really give anything away that they 'don't really mean it')(!)But you'd think an album that is basically meant to be inspired by late 60's psychedelia and 70's art-rock would be better than this? Still, 'Bitter Fingers', 'Better off dead' and 'Someone saved my life tonight' are excellent psych/art-rock melodies, with gorgeous vocal harmonies, and the gut-wrenchingly gorgeous ballad 'We all fall in love sometimes' is even better. And if you expect the rest to be as outlandish or as much fun as the front cover might suggest, then you may understand the 'brown dirt' reference. Rating ***
This album has inexplicably been elevated to almost God-like status in the past few years which is curious because this is far from Elton's best work.  He was still two years away from reaching his pinnacle with &quot;Goodbye  Yellow Brick Road&quot; and the stark fact is that there are only two  outstanding songs on this disc. The first is the incomparable opening  track, &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; which is one of EJ's greatest and most  melodic songs. This was proof of the riches that were to come in the  1972-1975 period. The other fine track is &quot;Levon,&quot; with some of  Bernie's best lyrics.If you are beginning to sample Elton's early work,  this is not your best pick. Chose instead &quot;Don't Shoot me, I'm only  the Piano Player&quot; or his greatest album, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road.&quot; Unfortunately this disc has worn well but never contained much  interesting material to begin with.
This is NOT one of Elton John's more varied recordings.  Most of the songs are sad sounding ballads.  In addition, the instrumental backing consists of piano and a string orchestra.  Where is the supporting band?  Razor Face  and Rotten peaches add the only oomphs to an otherwise dreary collection.  And the second half of this recording as three tracks which are pure  throwaways.  Tiny Dancer and Levon are two beautiful tracks so with that in  mind the status of this record is clearly elevated.
The best three songs from this nine song collection are onthe box set. Strip away those three and the rest of "Madman" ranges from album cuts that do no damage to one rotten exercise in filler. Were I to pluck a fourth track for the box set it would probably be the album closer, "Goodbye".That's not to say that the box set snaps up all desirable Elton John tracks.Tumbleweed Connectionis an excellent album and is woefully underrepresented considering that the box is a 4CD set. The single album live set11-17-70is also highly recommended. That album of Elton raucously burning down the house back in his nightclub days is entirely unrepresented on the box set.One gets the impression that after this album Elton, with or without the discreet advice of label execs, decided that he'd taken the singer-songwriter path about as far as he could. He wisely foresaw that the singer-songwriter fad would be running out of steam in the next year or so, and with his next albumHonky Chateauhe steered a course toward pop. Like "Madman", its three best songs are also onthe box set. This was a transitional time in Elton's career as he laid the groundwork for delivering some of the best pop singles and albums of the early-to-mid-70s.
Not his best album.  Some songs are just average.  If you are a completist like me, then purchase it and burn the best songs onto your own disc.
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer..."Levon" is one of my all time favorites and "Tiny Dancer" is also a classic. While there are some other good songs shuch as the title song and "Razor Face", overall there are too many forgettable tracks mixed in to make it a four star album.
Yeah, EJ's a great pianist. Whenever I hear this, it makes me wish that I had stuck with piano for more than six months. Oh well, onto the review.Honky Cat: 7.5/10. It could have been better, but there's too much electric piano (I hate electric pianos for the most part) and Elton's falsetto hurts my ears. But it is catchy, and clever.Mellow: 7/10. Would get more points if it weren't for the grinding fake organ. Generally I like organs, but this is an exceptions.I Think I'm Going to Kill Myself: 3/10. That's great for you.Suzie (Dramas): 5/10. Aaack! Not more filler!Rocket Man: 9.5/10. This is a great song. HOWEVER, I have to knock points off because of its title. "Rocket Man" sounds like something you'd call astronauts if you were in first grade. The dumb psychadelic sounds don't help much, either.Salvation: 5.5/10. Let the string of filler begin!Slave: 5/10. It continues...Amy: 4.5/10...and continues some more.Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters: 10/10. The album's best tune by a whole lot, very mature with good piano playing and acoustic guitar in the background. I also like how Bernie Taupin cleverly combined the first and second verses for the third.Hercules: 7.5/10. Good, clean fun. A nice way to end the album.Average: 6.45. Not a bad record. I'd reccomend it, all because Mona Lisas and Hercules aren't available on many EJ comps.
After the sprawling sounds of his first four albums, Honky Chateau finds Elton John moving in a more commercial direction.  The songs are shorter and punchier.  While this produced one his most enduring songs, &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, it doesn't always work.  &quot;Rocket Man&quot; is a certified pop classic and has become so identifiable with Mr. John that it has become an appellation of his.  &quot;Honky Cat&quot; lives up to its name with its honky tonk keyboards.  &quot;Mona Lisa &amp; Mad Hatters&quot; is nice ballad and &quot;Hercules&quot; is a spry rocker that closes out the album.  The rest of the album is spotty with songs like &quot;I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself&quot;, &quot;Mellow&quot; and &quot;Susie (Dramas)&quot; being misses.  The change to a more commercial direction was a wise though as Honky Chateau became Elton John's first number one album and started an incredible streak of seven consecutive number one albums.
This is the third album in a row from Elton John to feature fake southern accents and stories from the country.Notably for this album, Elton has gotten rid of the big orchestral sound of the last album, and actually there are very few big arrangements. The sound is stripped down a lot, too. Wonder what Paul Buckmaster was doing? Elton is playing his piano like he was in an old Western saloon and the guitars are rootsy and often twangy.The boppin', joyous, exuberant opener 'Honky Cat' is definitely fun and features some fantastic organ work. Another highlight includes the cynical 'I think I'm gonna kill myself', which is quite homourous, the vocal gets the point across perfectly. Then there's the rocking 'Suzie', which has a good groove, passionate vocals and a memorable chorus 'share a little lovin in the moooon shiii-iiine'.'Rocket Man' is a classic. The backing vocals contribute so much to the main hook of the song 'rocket maaaaaann', and that haunting guitar, courtesy of Davey Johnstone. Very few songs try to straddle the middle ground between folk and psychedelia, and fewer still pull it off as memorably as this song. The album closer, 'Hercules', is a fun rock 'n' roll song, though could have done with a more enthusiastic vocal, like a few of the songs here.There are some weak songs. The second half of the album starts with a couple of awful, awful folk songs, the flat, colourless 'Salvation', and 'Slave', which has one of the worst and most unconvincing fake- Southern accents ever. The music is a bit of a rip-off for the Drifters' 'On the boardwalk'.Then there's 'Amy', which is more enjoyable, but for a song where he is supposed to be *so* in love with his girl, he sounds a bit half-hearted. Some of the lines are delivered with real indifference. 'Mellow' is filler, a bit meamdering, but it has charm.But nothing's perfect, and Elton made a good move stripping away all the souped up arrangements of the last album, and getting back to a more basic sound, and it would be his last acoustic folk-rock album for a while.
I consider myself a really big ELTON JOHN fan and this album is just lousy .In context it's a bit more rocky than the 1970 -1975earlier lps.But after listen to this album even after many of his lesser "hit albums" it just doesn't do it for me now or then.ISLAND GIRL though a big top 40 hit is down right corny.I really don't give a hoot about DAN DARE or the STREET KIDS.The only saving grace is I FEEL LIKE A BULLET..On a possitive note SUGAR ON THE FLOOR one of the cd extras is a vocal beauty and a really nice song written by kikie dee.The other down side is that this was the first album without the likes of NIGEL OLSSON and DEE MURRAY
Probably the best quality about this release is that it rocks pretty hard.  Yell Help, Street Kids, Grow Some Funk Of Your Own, and a few others have gritty styles.  Dan Dare is probably the standout piece here because of the  funky wah wah guitar lines and Elton John's elaborate vocal stylings.  However, as songs go many of the melodies are quite forgettable.  Its funny  that this record debuted at number 1 when it was released back in 1975.  Now this release just pales in comparison to many of Elton's other releases  before and after.
"Westies" was released a mere month after it's predecessor "Captain Fantastic" and unfortunately it shows in the rather rushed tone of the album.  Major changes were in the works for Elton's band as both Dee Muray and Nigel Olsen departed prior to the recording of this one.  For me this is where Elton's creative slide began.  It is not a bad album and there are some great songs on it, but overall it does not stand up to the material he had released the previous 5 years.  The album is probably one of Elton's hardest rocking discs with a heavy dose of funk also in the mix.  Unfortunately the material here does not stack up against earlier works.  The two singles "Island Girl" and "Grow Some Funk Of Your Own" have never been favorites of mine, and much of the rest of the album, although not terrible, just seems rather pedestrian and average for Elton.  My favorite song on the album is the ballad "I Feel Like A Bullet", which is a great Elton / Bernie composition.  Relations between the duo were becoming strained by the time of "Westies" and they would only do one more album together before a lengthy sabbatical from each other.  In the end this album is worth owning, but there are lots of other ones that I would recommend ahead of it.
There's one thing that can certaintly be said about Sweden's the Cardigans : this is a band which was never afraid to be happy . Their debut album &quot; Emmerdale &quot; and 1995's &quot; Life &quot; were stunningly carefree pop albums with so much interpid sweetness that could melt even the coldest heart . Songs like &quot; Our Space &quot; , &quot; Over The Water &quot; , &quot; Carnival &quot; and &quot; Sick And Tired &quot; displayed the personallities of five highly gifted youngsters who loved music and didn't seem to give a damn about hype .&quot; First Band On The Moon &quot; now is probably their most widely known record yet since it contains &quot; Lovefool &quot; , their biggest hit ever which was included in the Romeo &amp; Juliet soundtrack . Although not by any standards dissapointing , it's clear that some of the magic of the innocence of the early days is gone and replaced by an attitude of some sort , especially on tracks like &quot; Losers &quot; and &quot; Been It &quot; . The sound texture is slightly changed and one can even find some explictic words here and there . Ofcourse the Cardigans were and are talented people and that can be sensed here as well . There are moments of pure pop brilliance like the run-till-you-fade &quot; Never Recover &quot; or that amazing ( from every point of view ) transformation of &quot; Iron Man &quot; . It's just i guess that the band members have grown up...and to be fair you can't expect them to daydream forever .A few years later the group gave electronica a try with the multidimensional , deeply experimental &quot; Gran Turismo &quot; while in their newest offering &quot; Long Gone Before Daylight &quot; we find them returning back to the basics . All these albums and furthermore their seperate solo projects ( especially Svenningsons' dark and magnificent &quot; I Sing Because Of You &quot; released under the name of Righteous Boy ) are music propositions truly worth exploring . Still those early two ones stand out for picturing with such a beautifully crafted way the joys of... well , being twenty years old again .
How much you love pure pop will probably determine how good you think this album is. Most American listeners remember this one for the Top 40 hit "Lovefool" ("Love me, love me/Say that you love me/Fool me,fool me/Go on and fool me...") but outside of that Nina Persson and her band weave some effervescent pop with dashes of alt-rock cynicism to keep it from being too Tiger Beat-ish.HIGHLIGHTS:The hit "Lovefool" still dazzles today...seemingly effortless pop that you have to make a Herculean effort not to sing along with. "Been It" was a worthy followup that got some Modern Rock radio play. A loungey cover of Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" will be heresy to headbangers, but it lodges itself in your head and you'll find yourself humming it eventually. "Never Recover" has another hugely catchy hook for a song about living with the Ghosts of Relationships Past.LOWS:Most of the rest of the album doesn't really bottom out, but it's aggressively bland. It's unfortunate that the album is bookended by these types of unmemorable numbers ("Your New Cuckoo" and "Choke" respectively.)BOTTOM LINE:Most people may like a handful of songs here, but it's not gonna be a band you'll trumpet as a great lost wonder of the music world. If you really, really, really like pop...pick it up. Otherwise, you probably only need to get "Lovefool" on a compilation. Here are some you might look at:(ASIN B0006M0CA0), Woman's Touch (all female artist 2CD set..all over the map stylistically but 14 of them are solid hits..ASIN B00006RY1S), Big Shiny 90s, Vol.2 (decent selections, ASIN B00011CYIY), and Best of Shine (focused on U.K. acts..ASIN B00000G43K). The soundtrack to "ENRON" is probably the oddest place to find it (ASIN B0009HLC0Q) sandwiched between Billie Holiday and Tom Waits. (?!?)
&quot;The Cardigans&quot; were one of those bands that got popular suddenly, and then vanished the same way, in the US anyhow. They have released a few albums, but &quot;First Band On The Moon&quot; was their big one. &quot;Lovefool&quot; was the hit from this, and it was also on the &quot;Romeo And Juliet&quot; soundtrack. The rest of the stuff here is good, and much like that song, happy and 60's sounding. In fact, half these songs could be about death, and you wouldn't know it because the delivery is so pop and catchy. &quot;Been It&quot; and &quot;Step On Me&quot; are good, and there's also a cover of &quot;Iron Man&quot;, that people will either love, or shoot themselves over. Anyway, it's a good album, and a nice slice of 1996 alt-pop.
Blackout is seen by many as the point where the Scorpions became what they'd be known as throughout the 80's. Basically pandering power ballad lightweights. The again with the kind of sales figures they were racking up it's unlikely the band cared, they'd paid their dues with albums like Virgin Killer and Taken By Force and documented their rise on Tokyo Tapes.Here we see the band roar out of the blocks with the title track, a metal tour de force with a line of humou running through it. Top stuff. But proceedings take a shift with the next three tracks, Can't Live Without You/No One Like You/You Give Me What I Need and this is sort of the blueprint for so much that went wrong with the band. Individually not bad songs, actually hits in some territories, but stacked up after one another it certainly drains the energy away.The rockers that come later do restore some order but aren't exactly awesome. But we do get an example of the famously bad Scorpions song title schtick with the albums closer When the Smoke is Going Down. But fans have loved them for such silliness for years and I can easily forgive them.Rock journos lauded this album as a link between the metal cred 1970's and the more generic hard rock juggernaut of the bands 80's and 90's output. That's as may be, but I can't help but feel a little let down by this album. Some great songs but for some reason it rarely hits my stereo, my vote going to Virgin Killer for that less commercial kill factor.
Shania Twain was never really an artist that captured my attention, mostly because she sings country music, a genre that I have never found overly appealing. However, upon hearing (and falling in love with) "From This Moment", I decided that I might as well be fair and give Shania a chance.  Anyways, to make a long story short, I found Shania's album "Come On Over" online and, upon learning that it was more of a pop album than a country album, I decided to listen. It also had a couple of songs I was familiar with so I figured it would be a good way to start listening to Shania's albums. Upon listening to it, I found that it was not the revolutionary album that it was made out to be, but it was enjoyable nonetheless."Come On Over" starts off with the upbeat single "Man, I Feel Like A Woman!", an enjoyable but somewhat meaningless pop track. Despite the fact that the song really doesn't talk about anything except how Shania thinks it's good to be a woman, it is a great pop song. The only real downside is that the constant shouts of "Whoo!" get annoying after a while (especially at the end of the song). Next up is "I'm Holdin' on to Love" which is sung extremely quickly making it difficult to decipher what Shania is singing. This song is average at best but forgettable. "Love Gets Me Every Time", a much more country-sounding song, is up next and is far from the best song on the album. The lyrics are extremely repetitive ("gone and done it" is repeated far too many times throughout the song) and the song seems somewhat out of place.Maybe I spoke to soon though, as "Don't Be Stupid", another country-style song comes next. This songs talks about a jealous/over-protective boyfriend who doesn't seem to trust Shania. The bridge of this song sounds great but otherwise it is an overused topic that has been done so much better before. Next is the definite album (and possibly career) highlight "From This Moment" which is really Shania at her best. This ballad has exceptional lyrics (compared to the rest of the album) and would make a really great wedding song. Most people pass it off as another sappy ballad, however I think it is genuinely beautiful. The song is a duet with Bryan White and the two singers sound remarkable together.  This stunning song is unfortunately followed by another mediocre country song, the title track, "Come On Over" which is lyrically extremely simple (and cyclic) and vocally subpar. However, perhaps it only seems so mediocre since it was placed after my personal favourite Shania song."When" follows and while it's lyrically bizarre ("I don't mean to sound so pessimisticbut I don't think that cow really jumped over the moon") it is saved by Shania's vocals in the bridge and the chorus ("when money grows on trees..."). The song is a guilty pleasure really. Most people can't help but like it even though they know it isn't really saying anything. This song is followed by two more uninspired country songs "Whatever You Do! Don't!" and "If You Want To Touch Her, Ask!".  Neither of these songs offers much lyrically though they do suit Shania's voice (especially the first of the two).  Following this is the somewhat sappy "You're Still The One" which seems like a toned-down version of  "From This Moment". While it's not a bad song, it is not as good as its predecessor either though it is still a nice addition to the album. The lyrics are slightly too repetitive for my taste but it is still a nice song."Honey, I'm Home" follows and is simply another kind of corny country song. The song doesn't suit Shania's voice very well and she actually seems to be speaking most of it instead of singing. "That Don't Impress Me Much" follows and is much better. Lyrically, it is trite but entertaining and Shania once again seems to be speaking instead of singing however it sounds good. The bridge in particular is a strong point in the song. ("You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine"). The rather odd "Black Eyes, Blue Tears" follows. It is lyrically odd but strangely appealing at the same time. It doesn't exactly stand out but it isn't horrible either. The two songs that follow, "I Won't Leave You Lonely" and "Rock This Country" are extremely forgettable. "I Won't Leave You Lonely" has half-spoken, half-sung lyrics that make it sound awkward and "Rock This Country" is just poorly written.  Neither of these songs stand out or are very memorable. Lastly is  "You've Got A Way", which is similar to "You're Still The One" but is also a nice ballad to have on the album. This song showcases Shania's vocals better than many of the country songs and this is a great way to close the album.Overall Mark: 3/5Overall, "Come On Over" is mostly inconsistent since it is supposed to be Shania's breakthrough into the pop market yet many songs are more country-styled. Fans of Shania's earlier work will appreciate this, however others who wanted to see how Shania did with other styles of music, will be disappointed. Shania really shines on the ballads like "You're Still the One", "You've Got A Way" and particularly "From This Moment" and even on some of the other tracks, namely "That Don't Impress Me Much" and "When". It seems that my ability to sit through this album in its entirety depends on my mood. Sometimes I am able to but other times I find myself growing bored halfway through a song (mostly on the country ones but that may just be because I do not really like country music). I would recommend LeAnn Rimes' "Twisted Angel" over this album, while it does have it's high points, if someone were to be looking for a solid country/pop album.
Nothing too complex here, just some catchy radio friendly pop songs. Shania is not an extremely powerful singer, but the arrangements work well for her and this CD showcases her ability to &quot;sell a song.&quot; I wasn't expecting much but was pleasently surprised.
After a whirlwind of success with THE WOMAN IN ME, Shania returned in late 1997 with her follow up, COME ON OVER. COME ON OVER is much more easily accessible by those who were lukewarm to her more country albums before, which is nice, but however there are many things about this album which leave a bad taste in my mouth. Yes the songs are extremely catchy and make you smile, make you want to sing along, all those things. However, lyrically this album is very disapointing. Not in comparison to THE WOMAN IN ME, but in general they are very immature lyrics in many areas, and for that reason the album is very patchy and not very creative. Songs filled with cliches and catchy phrases make this a very accessible album, not to mention her marketing of the album to a pop crowd with this country version (which is still very pop country) and the release of the International Version of this cd in 1999, which was the songs remixed to suit a more pop radio market. I have nothing against pop country music, however it just seems she sacrificed her image in favor to sell more records, and this album has sold close to 20 million worldwide. Some songs which just seem childish and boring to me, like "When", "Don't Be Stupid", "Come On Over", "Whatever You Do! Don't!", "If You Wanna Touch Her Ask!", among a few, however there are a few gems in here such as "Man! I Feel Like A Woman", "Love Gets Me Every Time", "You've Got A Way", "You're Still The One", "Black Eyes Blue Tears", and "From This Moment On" (although the solo version is far and beyond better than the duet with Bryan White). Overall its a catchy album, but artistically is is quite disapointing.
It is true that Shania Twain is the most over-rated singer of the 90s. And it's true, if it wasn't for her husband we would have never heard of her. And it's true, she has greatly benefited from heavy promotion and her belly button. And it's true, SHE IS NOT A COUNTRY SINGER! However, I can't help but to like this album. Despite the fact its corny and cheesey, it's still funny. Let's hope when she returns from vacation, this almost 40-something new mother will have something to say and not write lyrics like she's still in high school.
I thought this album was ok. I enjoyed a few songs, but was mainly disappointed. Sample it before you buy it!
If you're looking for a crowd-pleaser of an album that won't challenge the ears, Shania's gazillion-seller "Come On Over" will suit you well.  It's a collection of crafted pop tunes with a slight country twang courtesy of producer/husband "Mutt" Lange (AC/DC, Def Leppard).  "You're Still the One," "From This Moment On," and the catchy "That Don't Impress Me Much" are all agreeable ditties that have found a welcome home on radio.  There are better pop records than this, but there are also twice as many that are worse.  "Come On Over" does the job as a record that aims to please and nothing more.
Big Picture being Elton John's 1997 release and his 26th studio contained such hits as "Something About The Way You Look Tonight", "Recover Your Soul" and "If The River Can Bend". The booklet is a mixed bag with a strange cover, but with lyrics that are easy to read and also a list of whom plays what on the album. 3/5.
What a disappointment. Although this isn't one of Elton John's worst albums, it certainly doesn't rank among his best. Perhaps he and Bernie Taupin were a bit rushed, but Elton's singing doesn't sound as soulful as his singing on his previous 1990's collaborations with Bernie Taupin (&quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Made in England&quot;), or his later masterpiece with Tim Rice (&quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot;). Yet there are a number of great songs on this album that deserve listening, starting with the first two tracks, &quot;Long Way From Happiness&quot; and &quot;Live Like Horses&quot;; the latter is definitely one of the finest ballads from the John/Taupin team, an underrated classic worthy of comparison with &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot;, &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot;, &quot;I Guess Why They Call It The Blues&quot;, &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, and &quot;The One&quot;. And there are a couple of other great tunes too, such as the hits &quot;Something About The Way You Look Tonight&quot; and &quot;Recover Your Soul&quot;, but most of the rest is filler. If you buy this album then it should be for these songs only.
Oddly enough, "The Big Picture" was Elton's last top ten album of new material. The historical reason was, in 1997, Elton's remade "Candle In The Wind" tribute to the recently deceased Princess Diana was released the same day, and many record shops (including the one I purchased "The Big Picture") bundled them together. "Candle In The Wind (Goodbye English Rose)" went to number one and stayed there for months, and "The Big Picture" peaked at number 9.As an Elton John fan of many years, that is kind of saddening. This was Elton at his most Adult Contemporary predictable. The album only once moves above mid-tempo on the dull "Wicked Dreams," and maybe on "If The River can Bend." Otherwise, this is a ballad heavy experience. The arrangements aren't that varied and the songs start to mesh together in a non-exciting way. Only "The End Will Come" stands out, production-wise.Even more frustrating is, if you take some of the songs apart from the album and they could have been standouts. "Live Like Horses," "If The River Can Bend" and the title track might have had a better chance to shine if they weren't buried in all this pudding. Maybe it was the fact that his close friend Gianni Versace had been murdered that made this album such a down tempo affair, but this is not an Elton Album that has held up over time.It took him another three years, but Elton regained his groove on "Songs from the West Coast." If you're looking for proof that Elton has what it takes in the present day, listen there or "The Captain and the Kid." (And avoid "Peachtree Road," which is almost as dull as this.)
This album is exactly what the title implies, a collection of Mellencamp's singles recorded during his first decade.  For what it is the album is a decent enough collection.  You get no album cuts here, just the big hits and as the title implies there is nothing from any of his albums after 1988.  So, there is a lot missing here.  If you are just looking for the hits this is ok, but Mellencamp's work goes much deeper than this.
Okay, as a huge Moody Blues fan, I'll admit this is not one of their strongest albums.  The songs on this release, with the exception of the minor hit single "Sitting At The Wheel" (which is one of the best rockers the Moodies have ever done) sound like the cuts that were deemed "not good enough" to be included in their previous album "Long Distance Voyager", which went to #1 on the album chart in 1981.  My advice is to first obtain and absorb The Moody Blues "Classic 7" albums (Days of Future Passed thru Seventh Sojourn), then bounce back and grab this album so it will be more appreciated. Worthy of 3 1/2 stars.Now how about nominating The Moody Blues for induction into The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame??  LONG OVERDUE!!!
This is definitely not in the same league as LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER, but that one's definitely hard to beat. The songs that make this album desirable are "Blue World", "Sitting At The Wheel", and "Meet Me Halfway". Not really a bad album though, it just doesn't have the six great songs that LDV did. But everybody's different and some Moody Blues fans might just fall in love with this one. Enjoy!!!
After the great "Long Distance Voyager", The Moody Blues had to top it, they couldn't, but it still had some very good music nothing less.  "Blue Water", was a great leadoff track, the bass part by John Lodge always reminded me of The Move.  Hayward's "Meet Me Halfway", is one slick piece of pop-rock.  Their top 30 hit "Sitting At The Wheel", was a nice rocker by the Moody's, another song that comes close to ELO.  "Hole In The World", love the military drumming by Graeme this song leads into "Under My Feet", a nice little ditty by Lodge.  "Running Water", got a little airplay back in '83, very nice ballad by Justin.  And the disco mix of "Sitting At The Wheel", a nice treat for a few listens.  Not as strong as "LDV", from 1981.  They almost got too mellow here.
"The Present" is basically very similar to the Moody Blues' prior album, "Long Distance Voyager" -- not great, but a solid effort.  Justin Hayward's "Blue World," John Lodge's "Sitting at the Wheel," and Ray Thomas' "I Am/Sorry" are similar in quality to, respectively, "The Voice," Gemini Dream," and "Smile/Veteran Cosmic Rocker" which are the three best songs on LDV.  Of the remaining songs, "It's Cold Outside of Your Heart," "Running Water" and "Going Nowhere" are melodic, albeit somewhat sappy.In listening to "The Present" one realizes that the Hayward and Lodge songs rely a great deal on synthesizers to create the layers of sound.  Unlike Mike Pinder, Patrick Moraz tends to dominate a song instead of just trying to blend in.  His synthesizer, in fact, can be quite intrusive at times.  Pinder's voice is also missed, in that the four part harmonies of the classic seven albums are far more powerful and memorable.  Also missing from the Hayward and Lodge songs is Ray's flute and Justin's acoustic guitar, which were both so mesmerizing on, for instance, their superb album "To Our Children's Children's Children."  Hayward and Lodge's love affair with synthetic sound (and ever increasing corny lyrics) would become even more problematic on the band's subsequent albums.In short, If you like "Long Distance Voyage," you will like "The Present" as well.
The Moody Blues formula held true on their 1981 &quot;comeback&quot;  album.  Take a few good songs, in this case the excellent &quot;The  Voice,&quot; &quot;Talking Out of Turn,&quot; and &quot;Gemeni Dream&quot;  and surround them with a lot of forgettable filler material.  By the time  you get to the closing track &quot;Veteran Cosmic Rocker,&quot; your  patience is about at an end.  Nevertheless, those first three songs almost  redeem the whole album.
After the Moody Blues released the disappointing "Octave" following their six year hiatus, fans had to wonder whether the band would ever approach its former glory.  Perhaps it never did, but with the release of "Long Distance Voyager," they proved that they still had some good songs in them, albeit of a more pop-oriented flavor.  Patrick Moraz, who replaced Michael Pinder, the mellotron maestro, was a good fit for the band's new sound, though his synthesizer could be over-bearing at times.The first feature of the album that one notices is the superb cover art that seems to depict Victorian England.  It's the kind of cover that makes you want to immediately buy the album, run home, and play it.  (Of course, cover art lost pretty much all of its resonance with the advent of cds).  The first song, Justin Hayward's "The Voice," clearly established that the band had rebounded.  It may, in fact, be the best Moody Blues song from "Octave" on.  "The Voice," in my opinion, sounds even better in concert, where the band tends to slow down the pacing of the song.Next, John Lodge's "Talking Out of Turn" is melodic, but I think too long, and over-orchestrated.  When I first heard "Gemini Dream," my first reaction was, "What are they doing?"  But, the song has grown on me, and it is infectious when they do it in concert.Unfortunately I don't really love the rest of the album, until Ray Thomas' "Veteran Cosmic Rocker" which is inexplicably omitted from the band's box set "Time Traveler" (once again, Ray getting the short end of the stick).  I really like the circus atmosphere created by this song.  "Meanwhile" has the usual nice Hayward hook, but that's pretty much it.  I find Edge's "22,000 Days" plodding.  I also question his math, in that this amount of days translates to slightly over 60 years, which is well below the life expectancy of a human. (Oh well, he's a drummer, not a mathematician)!In any event, "The Voice," "Gemini Dream" and "Veteran Cosmic Rocker" make LDV into a decent album, although I still don't think it really is comparable to any of the classic seven.
Unlike their previous six albums, this recording is in a mostly blase funk until the rousing closer I'm Just A Singer In A Rock 'n' Roll Band. Isn't Life Strange sounds like a mediocre Bee Gees song.For prime Moodies, check out Lost Chord, Threshold and Childrens Children.
I have the 80's first issue on cd of this but this remaster makes a crackling sound coming through my speakers, pretty regularly throughout this whole album. Call it crackling or distortion, whatever it is, it's incredibly annoying!!! I still have the first issue and it does have some crackling but it's minimal compared to this remaster. It's a slight possibility that the master tape is degrading a bit but I'm just not sure. When the recording isn't messing up it doesn't sound like it was remastered but that it's been compressed making the volume louder than the original issue. I played my original 80's issue of the cd "On the Threshold of a Dream" the other day and it distorted or crackled a few times but it wasn't very bad. I may just sell all of the classic seven remasters and keep my original unremastered cds but I'll think about it. This is a 2 star review just because of the sound quality but it's a 5 out of 5 star review for the content of the album. The best of the 12 tracks is the first 7 closing with the song "Voices in the sky". I think the last five are subpar in comparison but still fairly good. I like THRESHOLD from 1969 a bit better than this one because every single song is a winner. I would tell your customers that they should buy the much cheaper original issues of the classic seven from the Amazon third-party sellers. You'll probably be quite satisfied with the sound quality. Bye!!!!
But still, when it works, it's great.  By now, the MBs world view is incorporating environmentalism (we'll spoil the seas with the rivers we've lost, concrete caves with iron doors), give-and-take with relationships (the tide rushes in), and sobriety (the overall feel of the album is certainly less spacey).  Especially for Pinder's contributions, their familiar themes are for the first time sounding a bit weary, like the interminable "Melancholy Man" and the sappy "Minstrel's Song", and the more-preachy-than-protest "How Is It".  Justin Hayward's songs are top-notch, "Question" I find a bit disjointed but the two parts that comprise it are brilliant.  "Dawning is the Day" is a beautiful song, brimming with optimism and Ray Thomas's best flute break (if you can call it that).  "It's Up To You" is a fine, uptempo rocker with very nice guitar/bass interplay.  John Lodge's "Tortoise and Hare" has a mesmerising 12/8 beat (but you don't have to know that to like the song, which is a hard rocking musical version of the old fable), and "Minstrel Song", once you get past the sappiness, has beautiful melodies and harmonies.  Graeme Edge makes his songwriting debut here with "Don't You Feel Small", and it's actually a very effective song.  Ray Thomas's only song is a bit lightweight (Tide Rushes In) but inoffensive, and the song he co-writes with Edge, "The Balance", shows admirable restraint, given that it is widely seen as a standard pompous portentious philosophic statement that is supposed to end this particular opus.
I hesitate to even write this because I know I am going to feel guilty for speaking ill of my beloved Moodies. In posting, it will be evident that I am not so biased in my love for Hayward and Lodge that I can't give a critical assessment, contrary to what some of my other glowing reviews might lead one to believe. I did give AQOB 3 out of 5 stars so I didn't think it was ALL bad: my all-time favorite Justin Hayward song (written/sung by him for the MB'S) is on this CD.The Hayward-penned 'Question' is reason enough to own this album. This is the BEST of his Moodies songs, bar none. It should be the one Justin is remembered and lauded for, not NIWS. This brilliant song is superior to 'Nights' in every way possible- arrangement, melody, tempo, lyrics- not to mention the way JH absolutely sings the living daylights out of it. The fact that the song was an "accident" just shows the depths of this man's awesome talents. He tells the story of how he needed a song at the last minute for a recording session and didn't have one ready. He did have 2 songs that were both unfinished AND in the same key. He decided to just go to the studio and fake it, as he put it. The result is just pure brilliance!  Unfortunately nothing else Justin contributed to on this album appealed to me at all, save his great backing and harmony vocals on Lodge's 'Tortoise and the Hare'.Speaking of my dear Lodgie and 'Tortoise': this is a rocking, fun, little song that for some reason has been sadly over-looked. I love the unique way JL re-tells the classic story. The words, music, beat and tempo are great, not to mention the great harmonies from J&J.; John's other offering, 'Minstrel's Song' has taken me some time to warm to it, though I don't quite know why. Perhaps this song is a reflection of how John sees himself: as a simple minstrel traveling around singing his songs for the people. Both Graeme's percussion work and Justin's guitar riffs are outstanding on this song, and John's voice is so strong and pure. I have to say though, that I am liking 'Minstrel' better and better every time I hear it. Maybe it's one of those songs you have to listen to several times to fully appreciate how good it actually is.Ray Thomas' 'And the Tide Rushes In' is a breathtakingly beautiful song and Ray sings it to utter perfection.Apart from the one song from Justin, one from Ray, and the two from John, this album really just didn't "do it" for me, sorry. Nevertheless, it's still infinitely better than 99% of the drivel that's passed off as music today.
The Moody Blues were a big part of my musical life back in the first half of the 1970s. I had several of their albums, and I saw them in concert a couple times. As I drifted more into jazz, the Moodies sank slowly into my listening past. Then, in the 1980s, I found a cassette set entitled This Is The Moody Blues and have regarded that ever since as an excellent overview of their first seven albums. And, after hearing a couple of their CDs from the period covered by that compilation, I remain of the opinion that it is one of the most aptly compiled "best of" albums I've heard.Recently, my interest in progressive/symphonic rock music revived and I tried to find the aforementioned compilation here on amazon. As it seems to be either out of print or just plain unavailable, I instead settled on picking up on CD the Moody Blues early releases I did not already own on vinyl. A Question of Balance was the first as it contained some songs I remembered from back in the day.Well, after listening several times, it came to me that most of the songs and the instrumentation sound quite dated. In the remastering, the tambourine is far too prominent. There are some excellent songs on AQoB, but its clear that the greatness of the Moody Blues lies not in the great quality of any particular album, but in the fact that they were able to mine the same musical vein for so long and come up with a remarkable number of great songs scattered amongst the dross spanning the period from Days of Future Past to Seventh Sojourn.Question is without question the "hit" that powered this album. I like the song just fine despite that radio wore it out, but I think the best songs on this album are And the Tide Rushes In, which highlights a new sensitivity in male/female relationships, and the introspective masterpiece, Melancholy Man. I also enjoy Tortoise and the Hare as well as Its Up To You.Though this is not a CD I will have in frequent rotation, its a great one to have at the ready for a "Big Chill" type party for folks of a certain age. Give it 3 stars plus.
Though a shade better than To Our Childrens Childrens Children, this album is still a far cry from the glory days of Days Of Future Passed through On The Threshold Of A Dream.The album starts promising enough, with the brilliant "Question," but even that is not as good as the original 45. You can get the original 45 mix on Voices In The Sky. Still another mix on This Is The Moody Blues, is better than the Question Of Balance version, too.After "Question," things go down hill very fast. This is almost a two star effort, but only my enormous respect for the Moody Blues upgrades it to three stars.
This album usually gets high praise (for having all the original members) or absolutely shrugged off as unworthy.  But it's neither.  It's less a serious, focussed effort than a transition album from their old sound to the newer poppy 80s sound.  It's got songs that show how each of them has developed musically over the years, with mixed results.  Despite the fact that there is no transition of albums from 1972 to 1978, through the years, all of the group's members were taking in the new musical developments, picking bits of it that they liked and incorporating it into their own music.  Had the Moodies stayed together possibly we would have heard their sound EVOLVE to what it was in Octave, or at least something close.  Not only had years passed but there was significant parting of the ways philosophically for members of the group, unfortunately Pinder got fed up with things and left halfway through the making of this album.  Patrick Moraz was hired to help finish off the album with the now somewhat dejected band, and as a competent keyboardist certainly would have been an asset to the band.  I don't even mind the direction the band went in, it had to change, and I actually liked their albums until TOO MUCH keyboards and sequencing (which are absolutely smashing when used wisely) put an end to what I thought was their creative strengths - putting together music by carefully choosing what sounds they needed for each well-written song instead of churning out 3 chord bubblegum songs with lyrics more childish sounding than when they actually were teenagers.  There's no mellotron on this album - the spacey mood that crude late 60s sampler keyboard imparts is entirely gone at this point, but I'm sure the band members were beginning to sober up somewhat by now, and just weren't INTERESTED in writing stuff along those lines, which is all they had been doing for years.  I suspect they were not doing it so much for the money anymore either, they already had experienced that and fame as well, so they were more interested in writing songs that would bring in money to their record label and allow them to tour and at least, as a band, make more money than they spent (artists traditionally make their money from tours, not records, so I would imagine this was their plan).  There is no real mood (besides an overall tinge of regret) to this album, the production seems a bit distracted and the sound veers from one extreme to the other.  I think there was some disagreement with Tony Clark at that time too, but he's listed as producer of this album.Ray Thomas probably comes off worse on this album - 'Under Moonshine' is a somewhat dated orchestration backing a pleasant enough song, with a bit of sadness expressed about someone departing, who had good and bad points, but will be sorely missed *cough*  "I'm Your Man" on the other hand, is a very frightening bit of 70s cheese, that has not aged well.  Well, I guess that's a bit harsh to say.  Nothing on this album is really AWFUL but there are some very cloying moments.Graeme Edge surprisingly has a good song (though the ending shamelessly copies Moonage Daydream).  An upbeat, rocking song, lyrics sound like they're about his son, with good guitar work by Justin throughout and some nice piano flourishes during the fadeout.As for Pinder, he has one song with "One Step Into The Light" which outlines his religious beliefs and trust in a higher power.  The song is actually not bad, a lot of it feels like it was added after Pinder had left, around his vocal line.  The guitar in it, in particular, in parts feels a bit disjointed and like its in the mix to hide a flub or something.  When Pinder sings "play my mellotron for you", the strings that immediately follow do not seem to be mellotron but some kind of a string synthesiser, a keyboard that had been developed by then that was cheaper and more reliable than a mellotron, though less of that spooky character.John Lodge has picked up some 70s cheese as well, with the meaningless "Stepping In A Slide Zone" at least presenting a good time feel, "these boys can still rock" start to the album.  As some reviewers have noticed, it is rather a gimmicky sound compared to their stuff on TOCCC or any of their classics.  Survival is getting pretty cloying (but that rot had set in with "minstrel's song") and a strong hook saves it (just barely) from sounding like something Barry Manilow would do.  The orchestra in it is at least more reminiscent of their older classical outings, than the more R&B; strings in "I'm Your Man".  R&B; is somewhat explored in the odd "Top Rank Suite" which is a bit surprising until you remember they always had a bit of R&B; influence in their songs from John Lodge.  "Ride My Seesaw", "Just A Singer", "Simple Game", to name a few.  Lots of inspired backing vocals and simultaneous different harmonies, and the result is actually the best of his three songs.  The saxamaphone makes it authentic though somewhat cheesy.Probably because it's co-written by the hitmeister Justin, who rescues this album with his superb guitar playing throughout and his excellent singing.  Plus the fact that he writes a good song or two.  "Had To Fall In Love" is a teeny bit dull, but still a beautiful song with close harmonies, probably the best harmonies on this record.  "Driftwood" was the hit, and it's a pretty good song too, a bit on the poppy side but still undeniably classic.  Moraz provides a nice string background without intruding very much on the band's sound at this point.  A mellotron would have given that song a completely different feel, for the worst IMO.  "The Day We Meet Again" is the album's emotional high point, it is also pretty obviously about Pinder though it never gets too specific.  It sounds rather wailing at times, and it ends the album off with a rather mournful mood.
Their first project of new material in six years, the Moody Blues reunion album "Octave" was the last  studio recording featuring original mellotron man Michael Pinder, whose heart wasn't really into staying with the Moodies anymore, and was somewhat disappointed with the results of this album.  I can understand why.  All the songs have a more muddled, murky and unfocused sound quality to them compared to the Moodies previous works, and even more so in comparison to their "Long Distance Voyager" album which bolted up to #1 on the Billboard album chart three years later in 1981.  "Octave" sported two singles in "Steppin' In A Slide Zone" and "Driftwood", and compared to previously released singles from years earlier, neither charted very well. "Top Rank Suite" has the cheesiest lyric on any Moody Blues album; how does "a good bowl of chili at the jazz club" grab ya?  Seriously, it's there! It's not a great Moody Blues album, but no doubt Moodies fans were overjoyed just the same to see the band back together and more importantly, STAY together as a group for many years thereafter despite the eventual departure of Pinder. And Pinder's last musical testament as a member of the Moodies, "One Step Into The Night," is included on this CD.  Worthy of 3 1/2 stars.Now how about nominating The Moody Blues for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame???
There is nothing wrong with this album. It's a slightly different Blues offering, but there's not strange about that, after all six years had passed afte their last release.It's a good album, and my favorite song is "Driftwood".
OCTAVE was a reunion album after the Blues finished their seventh sojourn and took time off for personal projects.  OCTAVE is also one of my least favorite Moody offerings.  Other than the elegant ballad DRIFTWOOD, there isn't any real OMG tunes.  The album's only hit STEPPIN IN A SLIDE ZONE is an average up-tempo track that doesn't break any new ground for the MB's.  A required inclusion for Moody fans but not recommended for neophyte listeners.  Go to SEVENTH SOJOURN for a better representation of the band's musical genius.
This album is sort of the "missing link" between the classic seven albums of the late 60s and early 70s, and the significantly lesser quality of the Moody Blues albums starting with "Octave."  The vinyl album did not include Hayward's "Blue Guitar," which closes the cd, and is, in my opinion, the strongest track, with superb vocal and electric guitar work from Justin Hayward.The rest of the album is somewhat uneven with some of the hackneyed lyrics and forced, over-orchestrated, melodies that would come to define the band's later albums.  I do like the opening "This Morning" and "I Dreamed Last Night."  "You" and "Remember Me My Friend" work okay as more hit oriented songs, but I don't think either has the lasting power of their earlier songs.  Some of the soundtrack sounds downright warped, but not to the advantage of the songs, as was the mellotron in the able hands of Mike Pinder.Fans generally agree that Hayward is the best songwriter in the Moody Blues, and Lodge is probably second, which is why this album is an historic curiosity.  However, half of the songs really have little substance, and foretell some of the bad habits that the band would get into in later years.
3 1/2Creative classic rock digs deep with some memorable melodies, evading excellence from the little disposable hippie pop and fuzzed-out overkill heard.
When I was but a wee lad, I made the important and fortunate decision to purchase this masterpiece album by T for F.  This record album was so listener-friendly even me stodgy mum and pa enjoyed it.  In fact, the record album spun on our record player non-stop.  As a family, we literally played this record all the time, and I think we wore it out.  Sometimes I'd play it outside and the music would blare and echo amongst the hills of beautiful Scotland.  At any rate, there are some very diverse sounds on this T for F record, which will please all listeners of the world.  The bursting energy of &quot;Shout&quot; is a stellar leadoff tune, and I used to sing this song to myself a lot before getting ready to play golf (a fun game that began in Scotland).  Quickly, however, this record delves into a jazzy sound on the second song, and from there the music is wide-ranging in terms of depth and sound.  There were several hits from this record album, but even the ones they never played on radio were quite good.  It was made in the '80s and is thus a little shorter than record albums made these days; but shorter albums in the '80s seemed to have better songs, because the artist had limited recording space.  Yeah, these guys were creative, and they went on to make other great albums.  They kind of have a pop/adult contemporary vibe, so that even your pa and mum will enjoy them.I have many other favorite American pop bands, but T for F might be one of my favorites.From Scotland, signing off...Thank you
Rain Dogs is one of several items in my collection that I'm "supposed to"  appreciate, but rarely listen to. The reason I say "supposed to" appreciate  is because Waits is a critic's darling, a musical vanguard, an artist's  artist. No argument from me on that point: Rain Dogs falls easily into the  category of "novel," and his first rate "I've been down so long" poetry is  as moving as that of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. When Waits' sticks to the  minimum contemporary standard of melody, harmony and rhythm; his  compositions are tender examples of melancholy. `Hang Down Your Head,'  `Time,' `Downtown Train,' and `Anywhere I Lay My Head' are accessible,  melodic and heartbreaking. The key to the success of these tracks is  "accessibility." They're "musical" and accessible because they provide a  melodic framework for Waits' poetry.Other tracks may be defined as  either primal, rough or boring; depending on perspective. `Singapore'  sounds like a march. Disagreeing with Waits' fans, tracks such as `Midtown'  and `9th &amp; Hennepin' are simply "abrasive noise," not musical  compositions. Rain Dogs contains some the finest tearful compositions ever  penned, and some of the worst garbage anyone has attempted to pass off as  music. Love him or hate him, Tom Waits is Mr. Alternative, a trailblazing  rule breaker.
3 1/2As diversely experimental as anything he's done, Wait's often classic tweaks upon various genres bends in momentum only to its predecessor.
This was the 3rd album from Tears For Fears, it followed the tremendously successful &quot;Songs From the Big Chair&quot;. I liked the song &quot;Woman In Chains&quot; but this album was quite a departure from the last two by TFF. Although this CD is technically well constructed and shows off the group's musical talent, I was not very moved by it.
Further from the eighties TFF strode, the more they had to compensate sheer memorability with overproduced arrangements, starting here in lovingly crafted, sometimes hollow and self-important expression.
This is an important historical document in the career of Trevor Horn, perhaps the most influential British producer of the 1980s.  I have never worked out how Yes decided that he was the man to revive their fortunes, given that this album was the only evidence (at the time) of what he could create.  This album is pure pop, aimed purely at the Top 40 singles chart.  There are two important tracks on the album: 'Video Killed the Radio Star' was a catchy No. 1 that accurately foretold the past.  And 'Elstree' is a great tune in its own right.  (I spent the first half of my life living just two miles from Elstree, and although the spirit of the song doesn't convey the memories I have of the place, it's nice to have people write songs about your home town!)After this, Trevor Horn (and Geoff Downes) were brought into Yes and helped create the amazing 'Owner of a Lonely Heart', complete with all its boxy effects.  Horn repeated these effects, with the help of some of the members of Yes, on the Frankie Goes to Hollywood album, 'Welcome to the Pleasuredome'.This album is nothing like Yes.  It is more like 10cc, Duran Duran, Human League, Depeche Mode and other UK pop bands of the early 80s.  There's nothing offensive here, but the era from which it came has now gone.  For nostalgia and pop history only.
Originally released in 1980, I'm sure everyone knows (by now) their hit "Video Killed The Radio Star" was the very first-ever video that appeared on Mtv - BIG deal! Have to admit, though - that 'The Age of Plastic' turned out a bit better / more listenable than I had expected. I mean synth-pop (with me) is sort of a crap shoot - but I did get a certain amount of enjoyment out of this CD reissue. Tunes I was sort of impressed with were the previously mentioned - quirky "Video Killed The Radio Star", "Elstree", maybe "Johnny On The Monorail" and the semi-cool bonus cut "Technopop". Personnel is a duo - Geoff Downes-keyboards & drums and Trevor Horn-guitar, bass & vocals. Keep in mind that both players are huge Yes fans. Should appeal to fans of Naked Eyes, ABC, Soft Cell, Kajagoogoo and possibly Haysi Fantayzee (anyone remember them?).
The Age of Plastic consists of some pretty quirky pop.  The Buggles are an interesting band.  This album has some really good keyboard work on it.  Geoff Downes is a great keyboard player.  The bass guitar work is also  tight.  I've had this album for some time now.  It's never been a personal  favorite, but there's no doubt that it has some good moments.  My favorite  tunes are &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; and &quot;I Love You  (Miss Robot).&quot;  The rest of the material is listenable, too.  Trevor  Horn does well with the vocals.  He's got a good voice.  Geoff Downes lays  down some cool keyboard work on &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star.&quot;  The album's production, musicianship, and songwriting are satisfying.  The  Age of Plastic is definitely a different kind of listening experience.  It's catchy and quirky.  Worth a listen.
Sure,most of Mr. Clapton's stuff is reasonably good, but really that's only when it's compared to the immediate competition. Truly, when one is a rather naive 17 year old, some of these tunes may not sound half bad! But with some musical and worldly experience, this album, like just about all "Rock", fades away into the realm of adolescent sentimentality,bordering on noisy nonsense. Indeed, listening to say "Bell Bottom Blues" for a wizened old timer (now over 50) is simply an embarrassment, and the idea of these performers playing them now is even worse. Same with just about everything here. And the copy cat version of "Little Wing", originally written/recorded by Eric's old rival, J. Hendrix, does not come close to the original! Really, the best Clapton can still be heard on the older (1967-68)"Cream" albums, much of which still sounds fresh and unique, not just thumping re-treads of 3 chord blues with banal lyrics.
Her 3 top ten hits: Just Another Dream, Touch Me All Night Long and C'mon And Get My Love are included here; as far as the rest is concerned, Too Many Walls stands out as a pleasant ballad, but overall, this album fails  to move one because Cathy sacrifices passion on the altar of versatility.  Her girl-next-door voice does not succeed in making anything special of the  songs, which suffer from insipid backing. Her silly pageboy hairstyle on  the cover further exacerbates one's exasperation with the versatile but  passionless Cathy.
Black Sheep was indeed the proverbial "black sheep" of the legendary Native Tongues collective, the New York alternative hip hop crew which also included Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, and A Tribe Called Quest. Where their comrades made headlines for their musically artistic, abstractly creative and socially relevant rap, Dres and Mista Lawnge were the Billy Carter to their Jimmy Carter: the sillier and less serious little brothers. Black Sheep's sound is recognizable and artistic; Dres' laidback delivery and Mista Lawnge's spacey beats were distinct even among their headlining mentors. The duo possesses a real charm, and their clever characters and old school B-boyisms evoke a uniquely New York sound that is often funny and brimming with style.However, despite its strengths, "A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" does not rank among the Native Tongues classics of the early 90s. Although "The Choice Is Yours (Revisited)" is regarded as one of the premier old school hip hop jams, the album is not.The Low End Theoryand3 Feet High and Risingwere timeless pieces of music; in contrast, "A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" sounds quite dated. Dres' wit is great, but grows tiresome over 73 minutes of running time, during which multiple tracks sound nearly identical. Part of the dated sound comes in the prevalent subject matter. The majority of the rhymes concern hittin' skins, drinking, partying, and sucker MC bashing. And while Mista Lawnge's beats are never bad, they are frequently uninteresting and similar. They rely heavily on samples, and the looping, bouncy sound is quite subdued, consisting of very sparse production and few instrumentals. The album is structured like an early De La album, with tracks of varying lengths interluded by silly skits. "A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" is an enjoyable old school LP, but is bloated and fairly redundant.After an intro, the album opens with the hilarious "U Mean I'm Not," which parodies an Ice Cube song and sets the scene for their blatantly not-hardcore style. Lines like "Aaahh! Somebody used my toothbrush!" delivered in a snarling yell are sure to make the listener laugh, before Dres arrives at the realization, "I dreamed I was...hard." "Butt in the Meantime" and "Have U.N.E. Pull" are both likable old school tracks. "Strobelite Honey" is also humorous, concerning women who only look attractive by the strobelite effect. The original mix of "The Choice Is Yours" is not as good as the classic mix included later, but still solid. "To Whom It May Concern" and "Similak Child" are both decent, but "Try Counting Sheep" is already familiar. "Flavor of the Month" and "La Menage," a sex track, are a bit more memorable. "Gimme the Finga" has one of the album's stronger beats, while "H... We Knows" is forgettable. "Black With N.V. (No Vision)" makes its mark as the sole track with social relevance, and "Pass the 40" is a party track featuring a strong posse of Native Tongues rappers. After some more filler, the classic "The Choice Is Yours (Revisited)" finally arrives, a classic party cut. This is one of the finest cuts from '91, from the great verses to the glorious "Engine, engine, number nine..." break. The album closes with "Yes," which recycles a beat already used earlier.Although the singles created sizable buzz for the duo, by the time they followed up their debut in 1994 withNon-Fiction, they had quietly slipped into obscurity (in 2007, they dropped their third LP,8WM/Novakane, which is suprisingly good). Fans of the Native Tongues sound who already enjoy all of the ATCQ and De La releases should pick this up, aware that it is not on the same level of genius. More casual fans should be satisfied with just the classic singles. "A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" is a good album, clever and enjoyable, but it has its share of weaknesses as an LP.
For some reasons in the industry, may radio stations, and media outlets don't give enough credit to the female singer-songwriters in the industry. Nonetheless, in the media today, that is where they've cornered Melissa Etheridge. Since her career started in the mid 80's, Melissa never recieved enough credit for her talents, and sadly in today's music scene, as you have to be thin-looking and anorexic like Britney Spears, and dance all the way like those dopey boy bands, it still shows that same way.Her 1993 breakout album, Yes I Am, reflected Melissa's image, and how difficult it was for her to come into terms with being bisexual. Surprisingly, the industry really welcomed the record. The album is as tough as the rain it came down on. Songs like I Am The Only One, Come To My Window, which its video starred her ex-partner Julie Cypher, and If I Wanted To.Many people still think of Melissa's fall in the industry with artists like the Indigo Girls, and Sarah McLachlan, nevertheless, it is always worth hearing every other time. Hopefully, people will try to see Melissa Etheridge that same way again, radio.
Nothing amazing but a good listen. Worth picking up and I'm sure if it's from your time period it's really great.
While viewed as somewhat of a dissapointing follow-up to his massive mega-hit debut album, &quot;Doggystyle&quot; when it was first released, &quot;Doggfather&quot;, Snoop Doggy Dogg's sophomore album seems a lot better in retrospect. Despite the abscene of his production mentor, Dr. Dre and his deceased comrade, Tupac Shakur, Snoop's ryhmes of survival pack a punch on this album.Opening with the title cut, Snoop seems happy, fresh off beating his much-publicized murder case though somber at some points of the Shakur killing. Tracks like &quot;Snoop's Upside Ya Head&quot;, &quot;Vapors&quot;, and &quot;Groupie&quot; are fun party-oriented jams as opposed to the demonic story-telling of his past on such hits as &quot;Murder Was The Case&quot; and &quot;Serial Killa&quot;. Snoop is not as caught up in his world of gangstas and guns as he once was.&quot;Tha Doggfather&quot; is no &quot;Doggystyle&quot; but it certainly has its moments. Snoop the artist is as as good as gold here but without the beats from Dre and a few other factors, this one just isn't as memorable. Compared with the Snoop of today, this one is certainly superior though.
Thus was the make or break, for snoop and death row being that dream had left to former after math. Snoop had enough to stay a float before going to no limit.
The phenom Snoop that killed verses on The Chronic, Doggystyle and Dogg Food is no where to be found on here. The whole vibe is gone. Without Dre by his side, Snoop was half a MC. It would be years before Snoop showed any resemblance to his old self.
This is my favorite 2Pac album, although it's not the best. The raw hip hop emotion that he shows on this album is just to hard to describe. Makaveli is just full of classic material like Hail Mary, To Live & Die In L.A., Against All Odds and Bomb First. This is a definite MUST have.
Let's face it--&quot;What's Up&quot; was their only hit but it's worth buying this CD for it.  (Also, it wasn't released as a single).  The song deserves to be heard.  Linda Perry's musical genius flowed through the song and captured every person's desire for emancipation from this patriarchically-dominating world.The rest of the album isn't as ambitious as &quot;What's Up&quot; but this is the only reason I bought this CD.
Linda Perry is obviously a powerful singer-songwriter-instrumentalist, although this interesting little curio from the early '90s is not necessarily the showcase for her.Except for the timeless classic "What's Up", and the magnetic and melodic "Dear Mr. President", and the defying-all-description "Drifting" (with an unidentified instrument - an electric oboe?), we have alot of material that's just a bid difficult to sort out.Perry seems to be a big fan of Heart, Led Zeppelin, and Chrissie Hynde, and on too many tracks we get too big a gulp of such a mix out of the musical blender. Her voice is powerful, but hopelessley lacking in dynamics, save for "Drifting", where she reaches high for afew notes and provides some relief from the "Brass In Pocket" sonics.You may find this CD in the "Used CD" bin - not to promote such practices - but get spellbound by that incredible track - you know the name - look up the track number.Beautiful artwork and booklet.
Helmet caught everyone's attention with their monster song &quot;Unsung&quot; in 92.  I saw the video on MTV's Headbanger's Ball and used to sit in rapt attention every week hoping that Rickie would play it.  Just so I could hear that wall of guitar sound...the beautiful reverberation of the snare head and the pounding of the kick drum....ah.  That was heaven.  I purchased the album and immediately liked some of the songs, especially &quot;In the Meantime&quot;.  While this disc was a trendsetter, some of it just sounds blah and repetitive.  Most of the other tracks do not standout or contain anything terribly interesting.  That said, Helmet knew how to rock.  They had a tight sound that was delivered no-holds-barred.  I appreciate their enthusiasm and delivery, however, at this point in their career they had yet to become GREAT songwriters with the exception of the above mentioned tracks.  So if you see this disc lying around and have not heard it give it a try, maybe it will be your thing.  You are sure to like at least some of the tunes a lot.
Hard-hitting sophomore starts strong, but throughout a brief ten tracks does show signs of uninspired repetition which weighs its total down quite a bit.
I thought this was pretty damn good when I got it and I still do. Helmet is a really over looked band, I dont know what musical genra that fit in but who cares they are great. The Guitar playing on Meantime is superb, the solos are over the top, I have no clue who the front man/Lead Singer is but he has a great rock voice. The main highlight hear would have to be 'Unsung' The songs is great there is no other way to put it, its one of the better songs I have heard in a long time, its got a great beat, and all. I was really surprised in listening to this album because I thought it was gonna be 'Unsung' and nothing else, but it was the exact flip side of that its a non stop thrill ride thorugh great hard rock, this is Helmets strongest and most consistant album to date, None of their other albums were as consistant or as succesful, if you are a Metl fan, I strongly belive you will enjoy Meantime.
Refusing to take a seminarial back seat to his fellow Long Beach counterparts Dr. Dre &amp; Snoop, Warren G releases &quot;Regulate...The G-Funk Era.&quot; Filled with breezy, atmospheric, sun-splashed beats,  typical of the palm tree ladened Long Beach sound. Warren G serves up an  impressive and captivating introduction to the G-Funk sound. Noteworthy  tracks include the west coast classic &quot;Regulate,&quot; the mellow,  tweeked out sound of &quot;Do You See,&quot; and the pionner-speaker bumper  &quot;This DJ.&quot; Melodic flows and innovative delivery make this a  remarkable debut and the perfect musical complementation for the car, the  beach, or the mid-year barbecue.
this is more like 3.5 stars. the beasties were a fun band and this is pretty much a fun album, but I think that the samples don't add that much to the music and honestly, it seems stupid to me oftentimes.  when I am feeling strange and funky inside I put this on, but it is not something I come back to often.  It is also not very consistent, and varies little from the "yo I'm so bad" format and repeats itself a lot.that said, songs like "no sleep til Brooklyn" and "girls" are highly enjoyable, and it was songs like those that convinced me to keep this cd.  The beastie boys typically have a good amount of filler, but the whole point of the band was to be "terrible, and admit it" which is a fun and self deprecating thing for them.  you should check this out sometime if you feel curious, it is kind of a novelty from back in the day.
I was raking leaves and bang this on my ipod. It is a hip hop head's pal. You can tell that Redman is a real steward of the game.
Hip hop icon, Jay-Z with his foot in the game coming from the classicReasonable Doubtcomes with his second album Vol.1 In My Lifetime (part 1 of a 3 part series). Jay's second album has less street appeal and more of a pop appeal, possible because he switched major labels from Priority to Def Jam (the rest is history on that note).I'm not sure how much the death of Notorious BIG impacted the recording of this album, but you can tell it did is sort of a way. The second song, "The City Is Mine" has a verse dedicated to him. Jay-Z really starts the album on a strong note with "A Million and One Questions/Rhyme No More". "Streets Is Watching" is another notable song (aside from the fact that it's edited). "Friend or Foe '98" continues from the previous back on the last album, and it actually sounds better than that version too. The album most introspective track is the last song "You Must Love Me" where Jay-Z looks back on the negativity caused in his life and how it's impacted him (especially with him shooting his brother). Other great tracks include the single "Who You Wit", "Where I'm From", and "Rap Game/Crack Game".Portions where the album fails are the songs with a pop appeal. Of course back in '97, Diddy (or who was Puff Daddy) had his hand in almost every single from the east coast, and him with Lil Kim coming in for "I Know What Girls Like" just doesn't fit, and sounds way dated in my opinion. "(Always Be My) Sunshine" with Foxy Brown isn't "Ain't No ***** part 2" either. Also "Imaginary Player" sounds dry.Overall Vol. 1 is a solid, very good release. Some, as myself, might see this a little dated. Jay-Z might have lost a step or two coming fromReasonable Doubt, so I can easily see many people disappointed. This used to be considered his worst album, that was until he madeVol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter, andBlueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse, but now people will see this as him enjoying the success of pop life, and would carry him on throughout his career. Either way, Vol. 1 should not be overlooked, and is worth a purchase for the millions of Jay fans. Peace.Lyrics: BProduction: BGuest Appearances: B-Musical Vibes: B-Top 5 Tracks:1. You Must Love Me2.

Definitely not his best album but it went platinum. The beats are hot. The way the lyrics are uttered is creative. You get contributions from Backstreet, Babyface, Foxy Brown, Lil' Kim, and of course P.Diddy who made the beats for most of the album. Check out the first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, and thirteenth tracks. 12 of the songs have been sampled though from even other rappers' songs!
Jay-Z second album "In My Lifetime, Vol 1" (1997) is a solid release. I liked the way Hov used Scarface samples in his intros, he started this joint off on a good note with "A Million and One Questions/Rhyme No More", which benefits from some deadly premo production. Jay-Z then delivers a standout cut with "The City Is Mine", the Blackstreet hook, and the track beat is ill. The next two tracks fall under skip material for me, and then Hov drops some on point rhymes on "Streets is Watching"- don't know why this was censored.  Jay-Z shows some heart on the laidback "Lucky Me", rhyming well backed by a smooth female chorus. The album then hits a low point for me, not feeling the next three tracks at all, find them to be weak in lyrics and production. Jay-Z picks things up again for two more standouts: "Real N****z" feat.  Too $hort and the albums closer "You Must Love Me". Its an artist gift and curse to deliver a classic, because later albums often get compared I won't lie though after "Reasonable Doubt" this was a disappointment for me, while there a number of standouts, there is also a lot of skip material. What I really missed was the consistency in production found on his first album, I wasn't interested in buying into Jay-Z claim of the throne being his, was bumping Big and Pac (and missing them big time) classics and wondering where Hip-Hop was going. 3.5.
Jay-Z's 3rd album (if you count "Streets is Watching") is probably his second worst to date (behind Vol. 3).  It does have some good songs on it, track 1 is my favorite - it's hot.  Numbers 5,6,& 9 are all pretty good too.  Not recommended as it doesn't show his best work or his talent fully but it does have a few good ones on there.Shawn Carter -- b. 12/4/69 -- Marcy, Brooklyn, NYP.S. - Check all my Reviews1
There's a fine line between the Jay-Z who created the Big Willie Movement and recorded the Aspiring Player's Guide to Life (&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;), and the MTV-... Jay-Z who recorded the bland &quot;Hard Knock Life, Vol. 2&quot; and the even-worse &quot;Vol. 3.&quot;&quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1&quot; is that fine line.DJ Premier kicks off the album with the excellent &quot;A Million and One Questions/Rhyme No More,&quot; two short songs with two phat beats. And there are plenty of highlights to be found here. The lush &quot;Imaginary Player&quot; rolls along nicely, as well as the paranoid strings in &quot;Streets is Watching.&quot; The sequel to &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; is just as good as the original, and even though it's got some commercial glitz, &quot;Who U Wit II&quot; still gets the neck nodding.Even some of the more commercial cuts have some flavor, like the Trackmasters-engineered &quot;Face Off,&quot; in which Jigga and Sauce Money swap verses in a song laced by a chorus originally penned by the late B.I.G. Also, &quot;Rap Game/Crack Game&quot; effectively compares the two, defining Jay-Z's soon-to-come hit-making formula.But there are also some flavorless moments. The dull Too $hort collaboration &quot;Real Niggaz&quot; doesn't hold its own against the rest of the album, and neither do the Miami-Vice-inspired &quot;The City is Mine&quot; or the Puff-Daddy/Lil' Kim-assisted &quot;I Know What Girls Like.&quot;This album is hit or miss. Either you like the commercial appeal-type songs, or you're diggin' the underground-type vibes. This is Jay-Z right before he lost all credibility and ... . This album is still worth a listen.
&quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; the song is among the best that Simon and Garfunkle ever recorded.  It is folk rock with an edge, in the spirit of Bob Dylan's best work.  The album of the same name, however, is a dicier proposition.  It feels like it was assembled as a launching pad for the song, rather than recorded as a conceptualized whole.  There are other strong points, including the poigniant &quot;Like a Rock,&quot; the suicide lament &quot;Richard Cory&quot; the haunting ballad &quot;April Come She Will&quot; and &quot;A Most Peculiar Man,&quot; which is as engagingly strange as its title.  The rest of the material, however, is spotty, dated, and of lesser interest.Overall, I would recommend this album for Simon and Garfunkle completists only.  Casual fans would be better off with one of their numerous anthology albums, all of which contain the title song.
When &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; came out as a single in late 1965, I was already becoming a thirteen year old devotee of folk-rock--the Byrds, the newly gone electric Dylan.  It somehow took hold of my adolescent brain.  The lyrics seemed intelligent and poetic, and the Beatles themselves had taken a few cues from Dylan and had started penning &quot;meaningful&quot; lyrics.Into this mix came two sensitive NYC boys with &quot;funny&quot; names. I remember thinking that like most duos of the era--Peter and Gordon, Chad and Jeremy, Sonny and Cher--that &quot;Simon&quot; and &quot;Garfunkel&quot; were their FIRST names.  Oh, well, what do you really know when you're thirteen?  I also thought that &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; must surely be a masterpiece.  And when my college aged brother used to stick his head in my room when I was playing it and say, &quot;What a stupid song!  'Sounds of silence'! That doesn't mean anything.&quot;  Sigh! If only I had the vocabulary then to say, &quot;It's an oxymoron, you moron.&quot;  (He was no dummy actually, he probably knew that and was just trying to get my goat.)A few years later, I was past Simon and Garfunkel and into more avant-gardesy kind of stuff like the Velvet Underground.  I started to believe that &quot;poetic&quot; songs like &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; were pretty darn pretentious and sophomoric, after all. Sort of like the poetry my friends and I were all writing at the time (yes, we knew it was bad, but we weren't commiting it to vinyl either).Of course, Paul Simon was all of 21 or 22 (maybe younger) when he penned these songs.  I should have been more generous.  I mean, look at that cover shot--just a couple of kids! Besides, melodically, the songs all held up.  And despite its pretentions, &quot;Silence&quot; still holds a spell over me that almost no other Simon composition does to this day.  Something about that misterioso inserted bassline, the &quot;neon lights&quot; and &quot;people talking without speaking&quot;--very science-fiction, even if it wasn't meant to be.The song &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; was probably about as Dylanesque as Paul Simon ever got lyrically.  The imagery of an &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; or &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; (not included here) never got so deliciously contorted, the conceits behind those songs much more obvious.  &quot;Blessed&quot; tries for a folk rock toughness a la Dylan circa '65 and does an OK job of it, but already Simon's strong suit was turning out to be narrative songs (&quot;Most Peculiar Man&quot;) and richly textured love songs like &quot;Kathy's Song.&quot; All in all, much more straightforward stuff than the title song.Listening to it now, some 38 years later, it seems pretty clear that Paul Simon was off to a darn good start.  Now the question arises, am I turning out to be enough of a fan to take in their reunion concert at those outrageous prices I've been hearing about.  Landsakes...
Content: 4 stars; Sound Quality: 2 stars = Overall: 3 stars.This album represents the best work that Sly has done from his "happy", optimistic period before he had a severe attack of pessimism (realism?) shortly after so evident on "There's a Riot Goin' On".  Lots of good singles here that would make it on any best of compilation of the band like "Stand!", "I Want To Take You Higher", "Sing A Simple Song", "Everyday People" and "You Can Make it if You Try".  That's 5 out of the total of 8 tracks from the album!  Other than "Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey", the other tracks resemble little more than filler and that's especially the case for all 14 minutes of "Sex Machine".  Still, this album is a classic for the impact that it has had for the future of funk music and its influence on music since then cannot be underestimated.  This mini-lp replica sleeve version very faithfully recreates the original lp design down to the inner sleeve and includes a 12-page colour booklet which has an essay by Barney Hoskyns and all the lyrics.  There are 5 bonus tracks as well which are single versions of "Stand!", "I Want To Take You Higher" and "You Can Make it if You Try" and two previously unreleased tracks: "Soul Clappin' II" and "My Brain".  The only disappointment for me of this version of the album is the poor sound quality.  For an album that's supposed to be remastered, you can only presume that the quality of the master tapes have deteriorated so badly that this is the best that they could do which doesn't amount to much sadly.  A shame really; Sly's classic really does deserve better.
If you were a kid in the '60s like i was.  I was born in 1959.  Or if your older and have more vivid memories of the '60s.  Then you remember that Simon and Garfunkel were everwhere.  I thought at the time they were as rock an roll as the Beatles or Elvis or anybody else.  But as time has gone by there songs to me sound more folk music.  I mean what kind of song is The Boxer?  And Scarborough Fair is an old traditional English folksong.  I think they just put a medly together with Canticle to get songwriting credit.  Mrs. Robinson from The Graduate may be there biggest song.  The Sound Of Silence, I Am A Rock, Homeward Bound, and of course Bridge Over Troubled Water are all songs that could be some of the biggest songs in the '60s.  And Art Garfunkle singing lead on  Bridge Over Troubled Water had the perfect voice for that song.  It is a very hard song to sing.  I always thought he was very underrated.  I could see though how there could be trouble between the two of them.  Paul Simon played guitar wrote all the songs.  And Garfunkle just stood at the microphone and sang.  The rest of this cd is good.  And I cant remember the movie but I think that El Condor Pasa was in the sound track of a movie also.
The Great suburban showdown, roberta, Los Anginos are standouts, Excellent remaster for it;s age
this being the first Post Motown Album finds the Jacksons with the Genius team of Gamble&amp;Huff.the cuts that work for me are Blues away one of the first solo songs ever written by Michael.enjoy yourself was alright.but Let  me show you the way to go is the Jam.Michael's voice is Fantastic on this  SOng.the Guitar and his voice takes this song to another Level  all-together.much of the material on a hold though is 2nd rate.better  ALbums would follow like Destiny,Triumph&amp;the Live album.
This album has two minds:  The first is a rock-out fest including Barracuda, Love Alive (to some extent) and Kick It Out.  The other is a rather melancholy affair more in keeping with the cover art (pastels and pastiches of country wooing and musings).  Dare I say I'm hearing some prog-rock?  Shades of Genesis between the guitar licks songs?  What I'm not hearing is the emotive power so consistently displayed on Dreamboat Annie.
Sci-prog is about half gimmicky cheese, and two quarters technically proficient/inspired fluidity.
How about that- I was about ready to bash this album when all of a sudden side 2 came on, and things changed dramatically.  Seriously, the second side of the album is when the good stuff arrives- you have a hit song, a fairly lengthy rocker to kick things off, and a beautiful ballad to end the thing called "Angela".What about side 1, you ask?  Well, the opening track is a really good melodic instrumental piece, but the rest of side 1 to me sounds like just a bunch of obnoxious tracks that don't really know if they want to be ballads or upbeat rockers.  It ends up sounding like a big mess.  Actually it sounds like inexperience, which probably explains why Toto's songwriting improved as the years went on.Stick with it though, and you will be rewarded for the final 20 minutes of the album.  So overall, it's an album where 55% of the album is memorable.UPDATE June 13, 2007.  I was WRONG!  I gave this album another listen and the ENTIRE thing clicked!  I now love every song.  The songs I thought were originally average on the first side are now really good and melodic.  What was I thinking?  I now give this album 5 stars (too bad amazon won't let me change the rating).
The formation of Toto was a logical idea from the beginning.  Founding members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro had both worked as session musicians and played on a number of the same albums--they both played on Seals & Crofts' 1974 album "Unborn Child" before they were even 20 years old, a record that also featured original Toto bass guitarist David Hungate.  Paich, Porcaro, and Hungate all played on Boz Scaggs' 1976 album "Silk Degrees" which has writing contributions from Paich on a majority of its tracks including the classic "Lowdown".  Steve Lukather had begun to make a name for himself as a session guitarist in his own right by 1978, & vocalist Bobby Kimball had done sessions also.  So, the formation of Toto allowed its members to make their own records in addition to contributing to the records of others.  All that said, Toto obviously had no shortage of stellar musicianship, plus they were able to handle a variety of styles with ease.There was another crucial key factor as well.  David Paich was already an accomplished songwriter by the time Toto formed, and he dominated the songwriting on the first couple Toto albums--8 of the 10 tracks here are Paich solo compositions.  That said, it seems clear that Toto was, at the beginning, largely Paich's baby and an outlet for his songwriting.Toto's debut album is ultimately an uneven affair.  There's a frustratingly high amount of pomposity here, as if the group was trying to compensate for a lack of strong material by mixing in exaggerated crescendos all over the place, generally to annoying effect--the relatively short album-opening instrumental "Child's Anthem" is a prime example.  "I'll Supply the Love" has arena-ready (if overly slick) hooks, but it's underdeveloped and has a tacked on and overblown instrumental coda.  Kimball's "You Are The Flower" has him delivering an overwrought vocal and has an annoyingly tuneless melody.  "Girl Goodbye" repeats a simple riff excessively to headache-inducing effect and also suffers from its aimlessness.  The main ballad portion of the album closer "Angela" is stately but dull.On the more positive side of the coin...  "Georgy Porgy" is an infectious R&B-flavored; tune very reminiscent of Boz Scaggs with its flutes & Steve Lukather's vocals seemingly trying to imitate Scaggs somewhat--unfortunately, it's let down a little by the obnoxious Cheryl Lynn vocals toward the end.  "Manuela Run" and "Rockmaker" are both rocked-up pop tunes with nice hooks, and the big hit "Hold the Line" is an undeniably catchy song that neatly mixes doo-wop with hard rock.The best song though is Steve Porcaro's transcendent, wistful ballad "Takin' It Back", additionally graced by a really nice (though brief) acoustic guitar solo; again, it is marred a little by the annoying sudden musical "pows", but it's a minor complaint in this case.  The reflectiveness and personal nature of "Takin' It Back", not to mention its sheer sincerity, is striking in the context of the album--it's perhaps a shame Steve didn't pursue a solo album during this period.Overall, QUITE a mixed bag of an album, but a respectable debut from the guys.
I've always liked this debut album from Toto.  It's almost as good as Toto IV, but not quite.  Toto IV is just a bit better than this disc.  All of the songs on here are listenable and energetic.  The album does sound  dated, but that doesn't take away from the tunes.  Personal favorites are  &quot;I'll Supply the Love,&quot; &quot;Georgy Porgy,&quot; and  &quot;Takin' It Back.&quot;  Steve Porcaro's vocals on &quot;Takin' It  Back&quot; are really nice.  Steve Lukather is a good guitar player and  lead vocalist.  I've always liked his vocals the most compared to the other  Toto singers.  This album sports good production, musicianship, and  songwriting.  It's worth a listen.
It does not deserve a five stars, I would give it to "Wish you were here" for instance.  It is not a four stars also, this kind of rating would go to album like "A momentary lapse of reason" The conclusion, each of these are greater albums than David's first solo effort.  One thing is clear, remember that this album has been issued between "Animals" and "The Wall"It is clear to me that David, with this album, is showing that he is not the genious for the Floyd's, this title defineately goes to Roger.Overall, a good cd, not a masterpiece (five stars) and not close to it (a four star, so this one deserve a three stars, but it is a good album after all.
I first became a fan of ELO when I heard the "Xanadu" soundtrack after first watching the movie and then listening to the "Time" album which is still my all-time favourite album of theirs.  I then discovered "Discovery" and these 3 albums represent their best work for me.  I also went back and got their greatest hits album to learn more about their early days and as the years passed I realised that I grew tired of much of that album save for 2 tracks which I never seem to tire of: "Evil Woman" and "Strange Magic".  For this reason I decided to get "Face the Music" and it is now my favourite "early" ELO album.  I know Jeff Lynne himself prefers "Out of the Blue" and "A New World Record" which are perhaps more complete and "filled out" but I think that up to "Discovery" this is ELO's best album.  With the exception of "Poker" and "Down Home Town" there are no weak tracks here as we get to hear many of the elements that have become Jeff Lynne trademarks over the years make an appearance here.  Jeff Lynne himself oversaw the remastering of this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release but truth be told the improvement in the sound quality is subtle and it is the bonus tracks that are real treats for fans.  His "stripped down mix" version of "Evil Woman" is very good and I find myself liking it more than the original!This release also includes a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well as a 12-page colour booklet containing an essay on the album as well as a short note from Jeff himself about the album.  This mlps release though is a bit of a mixed bag as the design and assembly is poor when compared with what is out there and with what Sony Music is capable of when compared to their other mlps releases in the past; it seems for some reason Sony decided to go cheap with the ELO mlps releases as this is the same with the "Time" and "Discovery" mlps releases as well.  Thankfully, the sound quality and the content somewhat makes up for this which explains the 3 stars.Very good content, good sound quality but poor mlps design makes this a mixed bag.  MLPS collectors will be disappointed and for the rest, you may want to check out the cheaper jewel case versions instead.
I agree with another reviewer's comment about the opener "Fire On High" and why it wasn't considered for compilation albums. Maybe because we got beaten to death with it as a sportscast theme. Rock fans have always used "commercialized" as a generic negative when they want to ridicule something when they don't really know what to ridicule about it. It's the whole punk cliche, I guess, when all punk music is just a bunch of dweebs who don't know how to sing or play but still want recognition. But there are still the classics like "Evil Woman" and the Bee Gee-esque "Strange Magic" which did make the hits sets. Really, there are only two clunkers on this set. "Poker", which is nothing but an exercise on how a synthesizer can be played the way Eddie Van Halen can play guitar--pretentious in its 1980s looky how fast I can play, dude crapola. And the alleged "country" of "Down Home Town", with its ripped-off riffs from Copland and its uban/ suburban snob bias against those of us who come from towns too small for high-rises and drive-by shootings. And this from an Englishman who only knows firsthand the America of arena venues and Hyatt hotels! I guess Lynne felt Sir Elton's anti-rural "Texan Love Song" wasn't enough. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you! Back home in Blighty, as among us Yank yokels, that's where the food you eat is grown. This album was obviously written during a dry spell and suffers from not enough valid material.
I must have some nerve thinking that I can review any album by the Electric Light Orchestra - especially this album. Somehow, against all odds, I managed to ignore this band when they were in their prime, and "A New World Record" certainly represents E.L.O. at their height of fame. Considering that their prime coincided with my own high school years, that was not an easy thing to do, but it is dubiously impressive. Back then, key tracks from this album were played incessantly on the radio, and most kids my age accepted the band without any hesitation. I didn't. I thought of them as fatuous, overtly commercial and derivative copycats. In retrospect, it's hard for me to understand my nasty, or at best indifferent, perspective. My own youthful limitations certainly had something to do with it; E.L.O. weren't as cool or hard as Led Zeppelin, their musicianship wasn't as intuitive as the Allman Brothers, and their arrangements were less intriguing than Yes. They were completely different, but they were caught on the same stylistic middle ground as Elton John, and in 1977, that wasn't a particularly cool place to be.So, naturally my aged prejudice now informs my present opinion. As I listen to this thirty year-old album today, it sounds like I should have liked it then, so what gives? For starters, my tastes in music have changed dramatically since 1976, so I can finally hear what my peers heard when we were teenagers. I was ill-equipped to admit it then, but "A New World Record" is consistently good throughout. The album's equalization still sounds oddly flat, like somebody lopped off the high end, but the music holds up in ways that I never would have imagined. "Telephone Line" is artfully written ands tastefully arranged. The string arrangements that once struck me as grandiose and pompous now sound quaint and simple. "Do Ya" still sounds like a rock and roll composite of one thousand other bands, but nobody else could have combined so many ingredients as skillfully as Jeff Lynne does here. "Livin' Thing" impressed me even then (`tho I never admitted it), and its combination of schmaltzy pseudo-classical references with wise-guy doo-wop is much more original than I originally considered it to be. Will a new audience reap the same benefits as me? I doubt it. This album will offer little to today's high school crowd, but if you remember the bicentennial and graduated while wearing Earth shoes, you may owe it to yourself to pick up a new copy of E.L.O.'s "New World Record."

Remasters are like turkey at Thanksgiving; some people prefer light meat and some people perfer dark meat and there's rarely anything you can do to change their mind. Trying to get someone who likes one to try the other and like it can be an impossible task. That's the story with the Audio Fidelity "52nd Street".As one of my favorite albums I might be biased because I liked the original pressing on vinyl and found the Sony gold edition, although it featured a bit of compression  because it gave Liberty DeVito's drums a bigger, booming sound appropriate to the material, quite nice In search of the perfect version of this on CD I've gone through the first CD pressing from Japan, the Sony Mastersound disc, the Ted Jensen remaster and now this one. They all sound a little bit different. For the record (pardon the pun) I don't have the SACD because it wasn't a hybrid--I prefer hybrids so I can listen to the disc anywhere and having the choice of the redbook layer and SACD layer is nice in those instances.The Audio Fidelity favors Joel's vocals and has a nice midrange but it also sounds veiled compared to previous remasters and darker. This will really come down to your system and what you enjoy. If you prefer something on the brighter side, you'll enjoy Jensen's remaster more than this and the drums have a little more kick there. If you enjoy a flat transfer of the mastertape warts and all (as well as a very different experience)with a darker sound (and it does sound veiled to me although there are some little details that pop out more because of the increased focus on the midrange)this one is for you.I'm not one that necessarily likes brighter mastering either so I was surprised that I didn't care for this (although it's primarily due to the fact that it does indeed sound somewhat veiled).I personally prefer the original Japanese edition (the Japan for U.S. is also very good and sounds very similar--I can't claim it's the same mastering but it sounds darn close)and the Sony Mastersound to this edition.The indexing appears to be fine as far as I can tell. The beginning bit on the title track where Joel does his count-off is correctly indexed.The artwork here includes the lyrics and it looks quite nice. Of all the Audio Fidelity products this is probably my least favorite (although I do wish that "Pretenders" hadn't been peak limited in that case it kind of works in the albums favor given that it was designed to play loud but it isn't my go-to version for that album).My suggestion--if you can find it inexpensively and you like ALL of Steve Hoffman's work pick it up and judge for yourself but be prepared because it is a different listening experience and, even if it isn't messed with, it still sounds veiled by comparison to other versions. It's not as bright as previous remasters but it also lacks some of the depth and sounds a bit muffled compared to others (no doubt due to the increased focus on the midrange here).I'm sticking with the versions I like which doesn't include this one. Your mileage may vary depending on your system, your ears and what your expectations are for the album (a fact rarely discussed--our exposure to something in a different medium and how we hear it the first time CAN inform our expectations later since we can't hear the master tapes--having said that if the master tapes sound like this, I prefer what previous mastering engineers have done to them to improve their sound because of this bias).
First, I never owned the original album which was Michael Jackson's first album as a solo performer. This album only hints at his genius with his sound and the disco dancing of the time. If this was his first album, it could be seen as a potential of what came with Thriller.Anyway, this is a must for Michael Jackson fans. I have to say I was disappointed because it's not his best work but most artists don't give their best up at first. Anyway, I was troubled by the fact that my computer Itunes needed the album information such as songs and artist and album name. Also, I was disappointed because the last tracks of the compact disc (the so-called extras) didn't have a name not even on the Compact disc. I know a couple of them are other versions of the same song and interviews with Quincy Jones. I found the interviews to be just bits and pieces and not explained enough for me. I still have listed as the track numbers and I wished that they did name them after the song listings. That's my one pet peeve about this compact disc.
Discovery being ELO's 1979 release and sounds like very similair to Bee Gees 70 recordings but lacks the same quality of lyrics and vocals. Allmusic gave this album 2.5/5 which I find to be a bit unfair. 3/5 is more what it should get as a mark. The cover is quite nice and has a mystical feel to it. All the lyrics are inluded and also get a list of whom plays what on the album. 3/5.
ELO hit their sales peak with the massive hit &quot;Don't Bring Me Down,&quot; from the album &quot;Discovery.&quot;  And while the song is one of their best, the album it is drawn from is inconsistant at best.  Other songs that stand out include the catchy &quot;Last Train to London,&quot; &quot;Shine a Little Love,&quot; and &quot;Confusion,&quot; all worthy follow ups to &quot;Don't Bring Me Down.&quot;  The rest is a peculiar mixed bag of filler material including the really awful &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp,&quot; which represents leader Jeff Lynne's songwriting at its most theatrically horrid.  Note that the best songs here are also available on ELO's various anthology albums.Overall, an uneven album that contains some very good songs.
As a longtime ELO fan, when I bought this album, I retitled it "Disco...(very)", which I've called it ever since. One fan site I was on the other day described it as "a mixture of dance tracks and ballads. Some of the songs here seem a continuation of their previous release "Out Of the Blue", such as the ballad "Midnight Blue". "Horace Wimp" reflects Jeff Lynne's well-known Beatle influence as a story of an ordinary man living his ho-hum life, right out of "Sergeant Pepper", or maybe "Abbey Road". Except the chorus seems lifted from Brian Hyland's oldie "The Joker Went Wild", note-for-note but uptempo. But have you ever noticed that when Lynne adds his R & B chops to Fab Four tonalities, it comes out more like the Bee Gees when they were first moving towards disco? Like the Gibb Brothers' telegraphed punch "Jive Talkin'"? The opener "Shine a Little Light" is the best example of that here. And the opening hooks to "Last Train To London" sounds like alternate backing tracks for the Heatwave classic "Boogie Nights". As the song wears on, it sounds like something Lynne might have tried unsuccessfully to get onto the "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack. Even in retrospect, I find it ironic that disco acts were always a bewildering mixture of a lot of technical skill but hardly any creativity. "Out Of the Blue" was enough of a nod to that empty genre as it was without this release going over the top. This one gets three stars from just one song: the single "Don't Bring Me Down", a track more consistent with "New World Record" or "Face the Music". Which is to say, this album's only rocker.
