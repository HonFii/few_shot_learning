I have looked at several of these...and this one is the best if you are giving it as a Christmas or Easter gift.
What a great teaching tool.  This product arrived super fast (I Ordered it on Friday Night and it arrived Monday Morning).  It is in a beautifully hand made box with inlaid mother of pearl designs.  The contents are understated, but the perfect object lesson for that traditional reading of Luke 2 on Christmas Eve.  I am in love with this little box and cannot wait to unveil it on Christmas eve.
This is a nice piece.  I purchased it to go on the wall of a zebra-inspired bathroom... It's whimsical, well made, easy to hang and lightweight.  I will say, however, that I shopped around and found it cheaper at another online site by thirty bucks...
My mother purchased a set of these for my children almost a year ago, and I wasn't sure we would like them at first.  We have 7 children, the oldest is 18, so we have tried LOTS of children's plates over the years!  These are now my favorite!!The features we love:-The &#34;lip&#34; on the plates keeps stuff in!  Great for spaghetti and other things that might slosh around, and keeps meatballs from rolling off when a young child carries their plate!  We've had other plates with raised sides, but these are high enough to actually keep food on the plate!-I love that they come in 6 colors.  Each child has their own color, so there is no grabbing of a sibling's plate!  Since we have 7 children and these come in 6 colors, the baby has baby plates and the older children use these plates.-Dishwasher safe!  'Nuff said!-They are thick and STRONG!  No toss-n-take quality here!-They are durable!! Our first set is a year old and they still look like new!-The size is great for a child's portion or small adult's portion.I like these so much that I purchased these two sets from Amazon and took the other children's plates out of the cabinet. The cups that match are the perfect size for small children, up to 6 or 7 years old.  The utensils that match are great for all ages.I can't think of anything I don't like about these plates;  I'm sure you'll love them, too!
These are perfect.  I absolutely love these for kids!  They are a great size and the sides of the plate make them perfect for children that need a good lip on their plate for not only trying to use silverwear but also when they carry the plate, like from the table to the sink or to the table to sit down.  These allow the kids to carry them without the food falling off.  They are just perfect for kids - very durable and sturdy.  They go great with the Kalas bowls!
l like these plates very much. They are strong and durable. These plates have upturned edges resembling a mini bowl. This is great for soup and other liquid type food as well as regular food. Since these plates are so durable l also use them as food and water bowls for my puppy. Another good use is a plant saucer for my small to medium house plants. l use them daily . Great multiple use plates !
I think we have used these everyday since they arrived.  We take our lunch to work each day and they fit perfectly in our small ice chest.  The lip on the edge is a great feature to keep everything on the plate or when a child needs to chase their food. Great colors and love that they are microwave and dishwater safe.  It was nice to get twelve plates...two of each color.  They were packaged as six plates so we will be giving one set to our daughter for the grand-baby.
My kids love choosing different colors.  Machine washable and microwaveable.  Sturdy.  Great price for perfect quantity (at least for two kids).
Once again it is summer time and these plates are great for outdoor barbecues.
These work great and take up very little room.  Happy that they are microwave and dishwasher safe.  They are the perfect size for my 5 year old.
Great product. Love the fact that they are microwaveable and dishwasher safe.
For years, we've served our cats' half-n-half (with NO digestibility issues; what a crock) on 7&#34; disposable plastic plates (since paper ones get soaked through too fast). The supermarket we switched to doesn't carry much disposable plastic tableware, so of course we turned to Amazon - but found prices on the high side. We ordered a stack of affordable ones (which, though thinnish, turned out to be no more fragile than most supermarket versions). But then we developed concerns about the source of their recycled components, especially since they are black.Luckily, while searching for the disposable plates, we ran across these non-disposable KALAS plates from Ikea and decided to give them a try (okay, we also liked the colors). After all, if we're going to wash them anyway, we don't need disposables. We just need food safe saucers that are sturdy, easy to wash, and not white or light colored (cats can't see there's half-n-half on the plates if it's white on white).Well, they work great. Though we'd prefer them a little smaller (they're 7 1/2&#34;, not 7&#34; . . . and a 6&#34; plate would do fine for our purpose), it's not a big deal. They have a fairly generous lip, which - unlike the standard disposables - doesn't have an embossed edge that flares out to the side, thus providing a perfect spot where half-n-half can get trapped (and worse, fuse itself to the plastic). We were a little concerned about the series of textured concentric rings near the center of the plates, but so far they have been easy to keep clean.Though not labeled as such, the Ikea site says these plates are BPA free, and the claim is substantiated by internet descriptions of the different types of plastics used for serving food. The mysterious (to us) symbols we spotted on their undersides indicate they are dishwasher and microwave safe; a maximum temperature is even indicated. All in all, we're happy about this turn of events since we are now producing less un-reclaimable waste while exposing our kitties to fewer potentially toxic substances.Oh, one more thing: someone near an Ikea store could buy a set of six for $1.99 - considerably less than the $10 or so (including the added shipping) we paid for two sets of six here on Amazon (not that we mind; not having to hike through Ikea was worth it, and they got here fast).
I love this product it more than exceeds expectations! Great for both pets and people!  Great product. I highly recommend.
dishwasher safe, microwave safe, stackable, perfect size, adult or kid.... and CHEAP I know someone who has had these for like 12 years and they are still great.
I use these with my daycare kids and they are my favorite.  The sloped sides help keep food on the plate and off the table.
I bought these for my two-year-old, and they're perfect.  The lip of the plates comes up just enough to aid my son in not spilling as much as he learns to transition from a bowl to a plate.  They're a good weight, wash well in the dishwasher, and are a good size for the amount of food we prepare at a meal.  I love them!
I love these plates. We have no IKEA near me so online ordering was my only option.  The have held up to my 5 kids use and abuse. So far no plates have been broken. Which is a record in my house.
Very colorful and well made...the fact that the product is BPA free is very important to me. My grandchildren loved it and enjoy choosing the colors that they like!
I have three kids and when the Tupperware sets I purchased finally gave out I needed new plates.  These are colorful and seem to be holding up well to food, the microwave, fridge, dishwasher and the general abuse they get from routine use by kids.They are a lot cheaper and seem to be built to last.  Plus they look full with less food so my tween seems to be taking and eating less (go figure).So far so good.
Nice plates.  Really colorful and a great match with my kitchen.  I love the fact they are microwaveable.  Great for the price.
dish is perfect size for a little meal hold food real good will not slip out of dish because of high side
My husband and I are loving the meals I can prepare in the Deep Covered Baker provided by the cook book. My husband said it was the best roast he had ever had.
This cookbook is full of wonderful ideas. definately worth purchasing, My husband has loved every meal I have made in the deep covered baker.
This pan is fabulous!  A whole chicken will fit inside to fry up at once and it will be the best tasting you have ever had.  It has multiple uses because of the size and it can be used on stove top, in the oven or on a grill or over a campfire.  I primary bought it for fried chicken, but I find myself reaching for it more and more for other items.  Cleanup is easy &amp; it will llast forever.  The price is great &amp; you won't be sorry you bought it.  You might even wonder how you survived without it before!
Can't say enough good things about this item.  It was easy to season and is very versatile.  Seems to get better the more I use it.
This cooler is great. Being that summer is just 'round the corner, now is the perfect opportunity to suit yourself up with one of the finest coolers on the market. I've had those smaller (6-pack) personal coolers, but they just can't handle enough...ummm...soda... to get me sufficiently..umm...hydrated... but this one does the trick. It is sturdy, the handle is great, and you can sit on it if you want. Pick one of these up, and even though your liver may be telling you a different story, you will not be sorry that you did.
Great pizza pan.  Had to throw my old one away as it did not have a protective coating and everything stuck to it.  This pan has a great coating and prevents sticking.
I've had one before and they work so well for what we bake in the oven.  I like the &#34;handles&#34; on the side as well...they cool quickly after removing it from the oven/
I have several "High End" knives in my collection (Henkel 4StarPro) as well as some "low end" knives such as the MiricleBlade.com knives.  This knife is the finest I have EVER used.  I had to stop myself from slicing a steak too thinly.  I really like this product.Buy it you will NOT regret it.
When you make pizza at home this makes cutting the pizza soooo much easier.  It makes it easier to serve the take home pizza ie.reslicing them cutting the melted cheese.
Like all OXO products great design and functionality...purchased for a friend who loved mine...a product that every kitchen must have
I own one of these and got one as part of a wedding shower gift. I have had mine for a couple of years now and it cuts just as it did the day we got it. It washes up really easy (no rust spots from the dishwasher).
Easy grip handle is great for limited grip strength; large diameter wheel makes cutting easier, because it doesn't require as many cuts.  Shipped and delivered as promised - 2 days - included with Prime membership.
This is a sturdy, big, 4-inch pizza wheel, complete with thumb guard, which produces clean, straight-through cuts on the first run every single time. Its smooth-running, beveled wheel blade never seems to need sharpening and its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand, making it require less force to operate than the more traditional lightweight cutters do, and rendering it perfect for pizzas, pie crusts, dough, etc.Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, this one is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use. Its elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to move back and forth between the kitchen and the dinner table.Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years, and its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away.After submitting this product to over two years of normal use, mine is still just like new.--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar
Quality wise I have no complaints about this product. It fits well in my hand and has been through the dishwasher a million times. I do wish I bought the larger blade wheel though. However this one has always gotten me though!
I love all of Oxo's Good Grips utensils.  They are excellent while working in the kitchen. Sometimes your hands are wet, and handling sharp utensils can be dangerous, but with good grips, that is not a problem.This pizza  wheel is no exception. It has a very sharp wheel for easy pizza cutting, no  matter what thickness your crust is, and it is a breeze to clean.I  recommend this to all people who are looking for a good pizza wheel at a  bargain price.
I have never used a spade to scoop ice cream, and i was not sure how i would like it.  But now i love it.  it is so much easier to use than the old fasioned scoop.  you dont have to dip it in hot water to help the ice cream come out easier.  i would recommend this product to anyone to loves ice cream.
My husband was skeptical when I bought this tool - how could it possibly be better than a regular ice cream scoop? This handy tool changed his mind. Now we both use the spade every time we get ice cream. The spade is especially useful for getting ice cream out of the edge of the carton, and hard ice cream isn't a challenge any more.
This is the best ice cream scoop ever!  Its flatter blade makes the ice cream easier to dig out of the carton and the ice cream just slides off the scoop into your dish!  No digging out the scoop with a teaspoon like the old plastic scoops, and no mechanism to get all gummed up like the ones that have a 'release' handle on the scoop.
Still use this today after 5 years.  Heat it up and it melts the ice cream like butter.  Excellent build quality.  Buy it.
Perfect transaction...what more can I say besides I highly recommend this product and this seller!
I love this knife!  I have small hands, and it is the perfect size for me.  I use it everyday.  The peeler I have only used once, and really didn't buy this set for that, but it also works well.
This garlic press works awesome!! I have not had ANY problems with it, like those mentioned by others. Also, other folks said that you had to take off the rubber handles prior to placing in the dishwasher but I never have and the press works like a dream even after I have done so probably 50 times since I purchased it 6 months ago.I use garlic in a lot of my recipes so it gets used a bunch. The handles are thick and easy to grip, it can press a lot of garlic at one time and since YOU CAN put it in the dish washer as is, there's no trouble getting it clean.
After a back surgery it was painful for me to squeeze hard with my hands, and I found OXO Good Grips Garlic Press is the one I could use without being in pain.  This is a lever-style garlic press and it lets you mince cloves with minimal pressure.  In addition it has an ergonomic grip that is very comfortable in my hand.To prolong its life I don't wash it in the dishwasher, I wash it by hand using the build-on rubber cleaner.  The press flips backwards and the red plastic head aligns with the press to clean it.To make it easier for me to press (and it is probably easier on the garlic press itself too) I peel garlic cloves before pressing them.I have read a number of reviews that report that the press breaks at the hinge, but I have been using mine for over a year and it has been fine so far.  I also read in one of the comments that OXO replaced the broken press even past the warranty period, so if the press break I will follow that advice and contact the company.If you have weak hands or a medical condition that makes it difficult to squeeze the handles this is a particularly good garlic press to have, it really helped me enjoy cooking with garlic even post surgery.Ali Julia review
I used to have a standard garlic press. It was hard to actually press and impossible to clean. The OXO one is heavy so it's easier to press the garlic, and the red bumps make cleaning so easy! No more poking at it with a toothpick for an hour.I trust OXO's stuff to last and I love this garlic press.
Every Garlic Press should be this good.  The handles are real easy on your hands as they are wider than most.  The self cleaning part works good, too.  A blast of hot water when you're done will get what the  &quot;fingers&quot; don't.I peel my garlic the easy way; cut off the  root end, crush under the flat side of a wide knife (carefully!), hold the  pointed end of the clove and pull off the shell.  The clove will be a  little out of shape, but you're going to finish the job with the press  anyway, right?Bon Appetite!
I love my OXO garlic press, so much so, that we gave them out to everyone as xmas gifts one year.  We have been using this same one for 5+ years.  I like how it's easy to clean out the left over mushed garlic by flipping the red part inside of the other half.  The holes are easily cleaned out by the bumps on the red side.I believe the instructions state NOT to put this into the dishwasher.  I never have, and I don't have problems with water getting inside the handles.  I usually rinse it off with a little soap right after using, and lay on my dish drainer to dry.  Ta-dah!  Ready for next time.Sometimes I try to put too big of a clove in there, and it may take two hands to mush it, but I've found that with any other type of hand-held press.
Unlike more cheaply-made versions, this garlic press feels firm and weighty in your hands, and it does an excellent job of producing finely minced garlic. The red rubber fingers ensure that the piece cleans easily and thoroughly. I did experience a problem with the garlic press, however: recently, the red cleaning fingers would no longer line up with the holes, and after I continued to use it this way for a few more weeks, the press eventually broke in two. Luckily, when I contacted OXO via email, they told me that they stand behind their products 100%; they sent me a new garlic press free of charge, and I received it in less than a week. You can't lose with OXO!
I had one of these for 5 years and it finally broke. Can't say I was surprised - we cook a lot and a garlic press gets a lot of mileage in our house. Picked up another brand and was I sorry! The OXO is just SO much easier to use. I have small hands and just don't seem to have enough hand strength to prep large cloves of garlic unless I use the OXO. It does take on water in the dishwasher until I started placing it on its side in the top rack. Problem solved! I'm here to buy another.
What a great garlic press.  The ease of handling and pressing two cloves of unpeeled garlic at one time was so nice. It is especially easy to clean.  This is a product that I would highly recommend.
This is the best garlic press I have ever owned.  I bought  my first one about two years ago and it's still going strong - never had a handle come off or metal crack. Every pod of garlic comes out as well as the first because of the rubber knobs on the back side.  You don't have to try to pick  garlic remains out with a knife before squeezing another pod .I purchased a new XOX garlic press about a week ago for use in my motor home.I've seen those little green sleeves to remove the garlic skin in speciality stores. I'm glad I read the reviews, I will purchase that product next.
This garlic press makes short work of as many cloves as you want. You don't even have to remove the skin if you're really rushing. It also seems to be very sturdy.
I love this! It is easy to use and easy to clean. Totally beats mincing up fresh garlic and easy enough to substitute a jar of minced.
Even knowing it will probably break, it is still the best press available. I am here because I need another, ours broke too, but it gave 2 years of  heavy use and excellent service until it died.  It is easy to use and does  a thorough job, unlike the ones with the little &quot;foot&quot; that allow  all the garlic to squeeze up the sides inside of through the holes.  I will  contact the company to let them know they have a major problem with the  hinge. I will still get another OXO, now knowing that the breaking was not  a fluke, but, oh well!
GARLIC MAD. GARLIC SMASH.I was cooking for my friends, and going through about 3 heads of garlic. Since I wanted speed, I did peel the garlic first. Then, I pushed it through the Oxo garlic press. PERFECTLY pressed garlic in seconds, with very little effort on my palms, AND it didn't fly all over the counter. I had a very bad taste in my mouth from the awful Oxo V stand grater, which was a piece of garbage, and broke very quickly. I didn't think I was ready to love again.I think I'm ready now.I got a text from the husband just yesterday, "This one is so much easier to clean than your old one." I was easily able to fit three small cloves of garlic, or one very large one in the chute. Also, I have found that if you take the stuff that was left behind in the feed chute, and fold it over, and re-press it, you get even more garlic out of it.For the heft of it on my hand, the power of the lever, and the size of the garlic feed chute, I would give this little press every star I can find.
I must say I'm surprised by all the bad reviews this press has gotten. I got one as a gift about 5 years ago, and always found it incredibly easy to use. The garlic remnants come out very easily with the two way hinge that allows you to push out the skin. I have always put it in the dishwasher (layed flat on the top rack) without any problems of water being absorbed by the handles. When my press finally broke a few months ago (the metal mesh part cracked along the edges), I bought a different kind of press without the good grip handles and without the two way hinge, and I HATE IT. I am longing for my OXO garlic press, and I don't think I'll ever buy a different press again.
OXO GOOD GRIPS GARLIC PRESS WORKS REALLY WELL! ESPESCIALLY ON BIG CLOVES. THE SELF CLEANING FEATURE IS REALLY NICE. IT APPEARS TO BE VERY WELL MADE OF METAL. THE STRENGHT IN MY HAND IS WEAKER AS I AGE BUT I COULD PRESS THE GARLIC WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL.THE NONSLIP CUSHIONED HANDLES ARE REALLY NICE! I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GARLIC PRESS.
I've owned this for a few years. I quickly learned to move the handles down a bit before I put in the dishwasher. Give it a good shake and let dry and it's ready for the next use. I use it at least once or twice a week for the last few years. This by far is the best garlic press that I've ever owned. I love the fact that you can clean it by inverting the handle and that it can go in the dishwasher. I've had other garlic presses and this is the best that I've used thus far. It is easy to use with arthritic hands.
I have had this garlic press for about 7 years now, and I have absolutely no complaints.  It is easy to clean (I do it by hand usually but also put it in the dishwasher), easy to use, durable and has a comfortable grip.  I read over some of the other reviews and I can honestly say that I have not had any of the problems others have had.  I would highly recommend this press to anyone.
Over the years, Oxo "Good Grip" products have come to make up most of the "cook's tools in my kitchen. The old plastic measuring cups and spoons and the cheap potato peeler were some of the first tools needing to be replaced. Noting Oxo's overall great ratings, I opted to pop the extra buck or two and have never looked back.My new OXO Good Grips Garlic Press arrived in the mail this morning, just in time to help with my bi-weekly batch of red sauce.The first difference I noted in comparison to my old press is that the Oxo press looks and feels like professional grade.With my old press, sometimes my hand would cramp up before I was finished. Not so with Oxo's press. It has a hefty feel and works without fatiguing the hand.The other big plus was cleaning it afterward. It very simply reverses, flipping backward and pretty much cleaning itself. One quick rinse and back to the drawer.Other reviews mention that it does not work well with unpeeled cloves. I cannot comment because my mama taught me long ago that it's better to peel cloves before pressing. If not, you have to stop after every other pressing to pick out skins which just wastes time and is plain aggravating.Besides recommending this press highly, I also recommend figuring out a way to take advantage of Amazon's 4 for 3 promo when you order to get it at an even better price :)
Having a tool of any kind that works well is fantastic but to have one that works well time after time and does not fail is awesome.  This garlic press replaces another OXO of similar design but this one is better designed.  The handles on this one fit my hands better and operate easier due to the soze of the grips.  I simply take a garlic clove and insert it in the pocket, squeeze into a container and there it is:  a perfectly ready minced piece of garlic ready for what evers.  We buy and use garlic by the bag and this little tool is perfect for its every day usage.  Cleanup  is simple and easy.  I do not put it in the dishwasher but do not need to.  Some folks do not like to see black olives in a salad or dish and I disguise them by running one or several through the press and only the taste remains.  The olive meat sorta hides with all the other goodies.  Frankly, I could not ask for any better press than this one and it is made to last a long time.
I don't review many priducts but I had to come to the defense of my favorite garlic press!Maybe I'm just unaware of all the stellar garlic presses available nowadays, (this is the only kind I've ever owned) but I find absolutely nothing to compain about here.We bought one of these witha agift certificate we received for our wedding - 16 years ago.  No, we don't have that same one - it broke, but I blame my misuse more than any flaw in quality or design. If you put more than a big clove or two in together it does strain and if the rubber handle cover has slipped down it can put too much pressure on the actual handle. That's exactly how ours broke and I recognized my error ... we've never had a problem with the replacement.Yes, part of the outside layer of the garlic is left in the device but I figure if it's not tender enough to be pushed through I don't want it in my dish anyway.I also REALLY like the ease of cleaning it. As soon as I'm finished with it I use the cleaning part and run it under some hot water at the sink and it honestly looks like new even though we've had it for over 10 years now.I give these often as wedding/shower/going to college gifts with a couple other gadgets I have found to be indespensible in my kitchen.
Works great.  I am smashing garlic like it is nobody's business.  The handle is very comfortable it is easy to use.
The number one quality of a good garlic press is heft! and this tool has a great, heavy, professional feel. It pulps large cloves in a flash (skin on or skin off). The trademark rubberized handle of the &quot;Good Grips&quot;  line is also a plus. It has a great built-in cleaning feature that makes  clearing the holes a snap.
I've never experienced this breakage business, and I had my last OXO  garlic press until I lost it in an interstate move. And believe me, I LOVE  garlic and used it up to five times per week! This is the best garlic press  available. Well worth the extra expense!
I love it.  It works so much better than my old garlic press and it's so much easier to clean.  I intend to keep this for years.
We use garlic frequently and the worst thing about garlic presses is trying to clean the things - especially if you forget and let it sit for a while.  This one beats them all by a mile.  Very easy to clean.  We are big supporters of OXO products - their design team is tops.
I have had an OXO garlic press for at least 15 years, and I love it.This one I bought as a gift for a family member.
First of all, let me start out by saying that my wife and I have been using OXO products for a number of years now due to my wife's arthritis.  In all of that time we have never come across a product from them that we were not happy with.  Since we use a lot of garlic in our cooking, we wanted to find a garlic press that was easy on her hands and that also did a good job of pressing garlic cloves.  Here is what we liked:1.  The grips are big enough and rounded enough to make it easy for either of us to use.2.  The handles are comfortable to hold.3.  The press works very well.  While the two metal parts do not come completely together (there is about a 1/8 inch or less space between the two heads) it does press most of the garlic.  We just open it up and move the remaining garlic together and press one more time.  What is left over is small enough to just go into the dish we are making.  (NOTE: If you do not want any small bits of garlic, just press another clove.  What is left over is not very much and I would guess that better than 90% has moved through the press.)4.  The press reverses direction to bring a set of plastic teeth to push any stuck garlic out of the holes.  I have not had any issues with the teeth not lining up perfectly to push out any stubborn pieces of garlic.Here is what we did not like as well:1.  If you insert the press into the silverware holder in an upright position, you will get water in between the metal and the rubber handles.  This really is not a problem because if you insert it this way, you will not be getting the inside of the press clean anyway.  What we found works well is to open the press up and place it in the upper rack lying flat.  This cleans the inside surfaces of the press and we have not had water in the handles.2.  After two years of constant use, the hinge metal just broke when I went to use it.  The metal looked like it has fatigued.I went to the OXO site and used their form to contact Customer Support about the problem.  They promptly responded to my inquiry, asked for a couple of pictures (which I sent to them via e-mail) and they issued a replacement to me that same afternoon.  This is what Customer Service should be like from any top notch company!!!  Verifying that it is their product, checking the problem, then standing behind their Satisfaction Warranty and replacing the tool!!OXO's website states that your satisfaction is guaranteed and they have stood behind that promise even though I have had the tool for two years and used it every day!!!Based on the ease of use of the tool, the performance of the tool, and the performance of the company in backing up their product, I would highly recommend this tool or any other product that OXO sells.
The one thing that I like the most about this press is the super easy cleanup!  I would recommend this product.
This garlic press is well made, love the rubber grips and because it is so easy to get the garlic skin out I am using fresh garlic again!
I have a great deal of arthritis in my hands (and elsewhere).  I had given up having crushed/ pressed garlic - too painful with my old garlic press.  Oxo has another winner with this Press.  I can do one garlic bud one-handed; and with both hands, I can crush 3 buds at once.  Also - not to be scoffed at - the red &#34;hole cleaner&#34; really works.  I turn the Press inside out, close the handles under running water, and all the detritus rinses away.  I plan to get an Oxo Garlic Press for my sister for her birthday - some may not think this a very appropriate gift, but for those of us with arthritis hands, it is a godsend.
I had bought and tried so many different garlic presses in the past and have finally found a winner.  The OXO is a pretty heavy duty press that really does a number on those garlic cloves.
I've had this garlic press for five years now.  This one is by far the very best one I've owned.  Pressing the garlic thru the holes is very easy.  The very best feature is the red self cleaning side.  After you've pressed your garlic, just flip the handle around and push the red "cleaners" thru the holes and you've just gotten the garlic out of the holes.I like this press so much that I've given lots of them as gifts.As others have written, it does get water under the rubber handles.. the way I handle this is to just pull the rubber off the handles, maybe 1/4 inch.  No problems.
The OXO Good Grips Garlic Press is the best garlic press I have used.  It has a wide opening to put even the biggest clove of garlic in it, or 2 or 3 smaller ones in it.  It gets all of the garlic out leaving only the skin.  It is easy to use and makes fast work in pressing garlic.  One side of it is a cleaning tool to clean it which works great!  I certainly reccommend the OXO Garlic Press as I have quite a few OXO products that I have been very happy with. Happy I'm replacing a very old garlic press that is way smaller than the OXO Good Grips.
The Oxo easily crushes garlic in the skin, and the hole cleaner pushed out the remains, making it very easy to clean.  I had been extremely happy with the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press, which is more than twice the price.  After using both, I would save the money and just buy the Oxo.  The main complaint of others is that it breaks.  Mine is still intact, so I can't reduce the score for durability.  Overall, the Oxo is a great product.
I had purchased a zyliss garlic press years ago on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated, and while it was great at pressing garlic, the finish was starting to wear off and it was a pain to clean. It would get left in the sink, as the garlic bits slowly got crusty and hard to remove because it was just such a pain to clean out. This one is SO EASY to clean, no one in my house leaves it dirty after using it now. You simply press all the garlic you want, then flip the handle around so the red pokey bits go through the holes and rinse the garlic bits off over running water. So easy! I'm very happy with this product.
This Garlic Press looks a little clumsy when you first look upon it, but rest assured it does its job and then some.I have tried many garlic presses which have made me hate the word &quot;garlic&quot;. You either had  have the strength of Superman to press it, or it did a terrible job in  actually pressing the garlic, or, it took forever to get it cleaned.But  then I bought this press, and I was truly amazed.  Pressing garlic was a  cinch. Garlic came out of the other side more than minced, and cleaning up  was a charm. Nothing sticks to this press.I do not understand the  earlier reviews of how this press &quot;breaks&quot;. This is one of the  most durable kitchen tools I have. I cannot imagine how those broke, unless  they were a different brand.Take it from me(a person who loves to  cook). This is a great kitchen utensil, you would be better off WITH.
This is a very sturdy, heavy-duty garlic press. The rubber grips keep it from slipping out of your hand and spraying garlic all over the kitchen. The design of the press also means that not a lot of hand strength is required. I absolutely love it.
My OXO garlic press is a bit different than the one pictured here...it doesn't have the cleaning head, but does have a removable basket, which makes it very easy to clean.  No garlic press is going to get all of the clove pushed out of the little holes, but this one comes pretty close (I just toss what's left in the basket in with the rest).  It's the best press I've used, and I'm guessing I got a revised model based on the comments
I think this is an excellent garlic press for the price.  I can't speak on how long it lasts though.  This is one of those products that I wasn't sure if I would actually ever use, but now that I have it, I wouldn't do without!  I used to always just peel the cloves, smash it with the side of my chef's knife, and then mince away.  This is a very good method for preparing garlic, but can be time consuming when trying to mince a lot of cloves.  This garlic press very easily cuts my prep time by a LOT - I just peel the clove, press, press, press - done.  I'll run the knife through the pressed cloves real quick to make sure I have a pretty consistent paste, but that's it.  It's very easy to clean too, as you just flip it over and the built in cleaner pops out any garlic out of the holes to help clean it quickly.  It seems to be built well, looks good, ergonomic, and very easy to use.  Pressed garlic will have a stronger taste than chopped garlic, so be prepared to adjust your recipe as needed.All in all, I think this is an excellent product and I hope it lasts.  I don't see any reason it shouldn't, but there are enough reviews on here about that very issue.  I will update my review if my press breaks.
I'm a garlic fanatic, and use garlic in nearly every meal from breakfast to dessert! OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I have used my OXO press hard for about two and a half years now, and it is head-and-shoulders the best garlic press I have ever used. The head is heavy-duty and solid, and the grips fit my hand and make pressing a breeze. The cleaning feature works well too. I was surprised to see any negative reviews of this product. I guess if mine had broken early in its life I might be negative about it too, but as it is, if mine broke tomorrow, I'd waste no time in buying myself another one.
I am a VERY amateur chef.  :c)  I have to use these every time I make something.  They are constantly being washed, either in the sink or dishwasher.  I have really abused these things at times.  They still work, and I don't think I'll have to replace them soon, unless they get stuck in the garbage disposal.  :c)
These items are very handy and helpful in every day usage...
I have always heard that OXO makes excellent products.  After buying the OXO Bagel Grip, I now fully understand why customers prefer this great product. Quality is rated superior. I will buy OXO type products in the future.
We have 4 kids so crumbs are a daily part of life but this little crumber really does a great job containing those table messes!  I am what you would call an anal person so when the crumbs are all over the table I prefer to get them there before they hit the floor.  It's easier to clean them up off the table rather then getting them off the floor.  So I looked into the crumbers to see if I could find something easy and convenient for us to use, I found the perfect one.  The little brushes pick up most everything on the first try and if not certainly the second try and then it drops into the crumbs into the little side slots on the underside of the top which easily comes off by squeezing the sides.  You dump the crumbs into the garbage and off you go.  Now if I were working in the food industry then this thing absolutely would be indispensable but even at home this thing is awesome.  I think that's enough said!  Buy it.  :-)
The brush works great and is easy to clean.  Have had a previous battery operated little table vacuum, but this one does a better job!  Recommend.
No more shaking out the tablecloth! This crumb sweeper is the BEST! It just rolls over the tablecloth and picks up the crumbs. Crumbs stay in the trays inside the crumb sweeper until you pull it apart and empty them.
I usually buy these crumb sweepers when I am in Europe because any bought at home have not worked well.  This one finally does.  Love the soft grip, and it picks up just as my European ones do.
So easy to use and handy. Get rid of crumbs on table between courses and after the meal without changing table cloth.or having to shake it outside.
This is one simple and neat product.  Works well on bare tabletops or on tablecloths.  It picks up crumbs without swallowing tablecloths.  It is very easy to dispose of crumbs.
received an expensive knife set for X Mas...had a meat fork that wouldn't hold 1/th lb of meat....this fork is sturdy, inexpensive and SHARP....would recommend highly to all but don't run with it as you may poke your eye out....(channeling mom's words as a kid but true in this case)
Held up well to my 25lb turkey at Thanksgiving. Was sturdy and the handle didn't fall of like my last one
I defy you to find ANY large meat fork at your local super market in the kitchen gadget aisle or at Bed, Bath, and beyond, or even at most Dept Stores.  You might find very expensive ($28 up) ones, but rarely even then.  This was about $8. and very good quality.  Look no further - OXO rules!
This is a well made good quality fork! Feels nice in the hand, comfy handle, and nicely balanced. And it's reasonably sharp. I REALLY can't believe someone dinged it for being too sharp, hello! It's a fork! What good is a dull fork?
We didn't have a long fork to poke stuff with, so we bought one. This one sure does the trick.
its ALL YOU COULD ASK FOR IN A FORK, AT ANY PRICE. shopped AROUND FOR A CARVING FORK, everything was $30.00+++. This one was one half of that, made with 18/10 stainless, comfy grip, long tines. Just terrific. Could not ask for anything better.
Good Grips couldn't have found a more appropriate name!!! Easy to handle, easy to clean... just EASY!! I love it!!!
Mine broke after many years of use and it took me some time to find one I liked as well.  I tried several before buying this one and so far it fits the bill.
Ordered this for our Thanksgiving Turkey and it worked great. The larger handle is just the thing when you hands get greasy. Easy to hold on to and still keeps your meat in place.
What took me so long to buy this. This is an essential kitchen tool.Fair price, high quality. Solid. Comfortable grip.
I'm starting to love OXO Good Grip items.. I have now ordered other items by them because how much i liked it.. The price is alittle more but its a great quality that will last a very long time
Hard to find carving forks individually. this one feels quite sturdy, has a good grip and is very sharp.  found my 2 lost one the day this arrived after months of searching.  still keeping this one because it is much better.
I went looking for one of these in the grocery store with no luck.  Then I tried a kitchen specialty shop.  I guess they have been denied shelf space due to possible liability concerns or some such dumbness.  But good grief, knives are surely more dangerous!  It does what is needed very well, it holds down the steak or roast or turkey as required for slicing as you would expect.  I have not tried using it as a weapon or anything like that yet.
I bought 4 pieces for my daughter for her Mothers Day.  Along with all her other gifts, she just loved them. With all the good food, we both were happy Campers.
It is what the package says it is... nice long fork, has a comfortable handle, has sharp ends, is good for cooking and grilling, comes safely packaged, will get used, and I can't believe I haven't reached twenty words yet.  Seriously, Amazon?  This is a fork, not a car seat.
I needed a new fork and OXO always seems to have sturdy products.  This one is a better replacement for my old fork which takes its place in my camper.  I am happy with this, the handle is comfy on the hand.
Wow, do I love this pan! I was hesitant to buy a $10 bakeware for something as delicate as angel food cake, but I'm happy I went with this one. I've used it several times with absolutely no problems. The tiniest bit of baking spray is all that's needed to make the cake release perfectly. With other pans (for different desserts, so maybe that's the real issue), I can grease and parchment paper the bajangle out of them and still end up with patches of stuck desserts.It's a great size for a typical angel food cake recipe. It washes up beautifully. I believe the instructions say it is dishwasher safe, but I haven't had to test that. A simple rinse and swipe of a dish cloth is adequate. If the cake does come out of the oven adhered slightly to the edge at the top, it's easy to release it with the tip of a rubber spatula, so you don't run the risk of damaging the nonstick quality by jamming butter knives down the sides of the cake.I don't own any other bakeware by this brand, but I plan to purchase more. The price range is perfect for my budget, and the quality of this particular piece is outstanding. I plan to purchase this as a gift. It shipped relatively quickly and arrived in perfect condition.
good quality.Bake excellent angel food cake. Did not fall out the pan. Easy to remove cake from pan with detachable part. Easy clean up.
This is the best angel pan I have ever used. The thick gauge of the metal bakes a very professional looking cake and cleans up like a whiz.
I had to return this because it was too large and I was looking for a tube pan that did not have a removable bottom.
I got one of the best prices I could find on the WEB and in a B&M store. Turns out the quality was pretty good as well. Certainly better than any of the other higher priced ones. Get the best of both worlds here.
This pan has a hefty and substantial feel. All of my cakes have cooked through and released quickly and evenly.  The manufacturer recommends only a butter brushing before filling with batter, but I have used a mixture of shortening, oil, and flour, brushed in with a pastry brush, and sometimes dusted with cocoa (if I'm baking a dark chocolate cake), with excellent results as well.  The pan is deep enough to accomodate any recipes I've tried, they have never overflowed.  The inner shelf around the ring allows for a little extra decoration with piped icing, sugared nuts, candied fruits, etc., if desired, or looks fine if left alone. This can be the only bundt pan you ever need.
Bet you never thought the simple spatula could be improved upon so much.  The head of this spatula is long and flexible, but strong.  It's narrower  than a standard spatula so it goes more places.  The handle has a nifty  little notch in the side to keep it from sliding down into the bowl.  Throw  out all those old cracked, warped, spatulas in your kitchen and get a  couple of these.
that is an exelent product i use it to enjoy whit my friend's ocasionally
If you're making drinks, you need one of these whether it's this one or another one.  It's cool looking and solid, and it will last forever.  It also goes perfectly with the Pedrini Stainless Steel Shaker
This double jigger adds accent to your bar. Very authentic and proffesional. Pedrini does it again with their quality craftsmanship in bar accessories. A must have for any bar owner.
Sensible, yet affordable.  The functionality of a double jigger and the bragging rights &quot;Oh this, it's Italian.&quot;
It is easy to forget that ice was once delivered house-to-house in thick sawdust-covered slabs. Manageable hunks would be hacked off with either an axe or a pick. Of course these days are gone. Nowadays, we can effortlessly command our refridgerators to produce ice, cubed or even crushed. However, for those of you who yearn for chunky, irregularly shaped ice chips, an ice pick is a necessity.This particular ice pick is an updated version of the classic tool. The plastic handle and ribbed, rubber swath at the bottom ensure that the pick stays well in hand. One of the main deficiencies of older ice picks was that they either had a metal handle (which got slippery when wet) or a cork handle (which would inevitable deteriorate with use).
I have two of these and I love them!  I searched the 'net for a third one, but I can't find them.  I even contacted Metrokane and was told they no longer manufacture them.  They said to consider the alternate plastic, white one.  I really want the stainless one!  I have been watching Amazon for a used one with no luck.
This works fantastically.  No matter what I make, this separator separates the fat perfectly and is so easy to use.  Just refrigerate for a little while.
There are different kind of plastics.This is made of durable and translucent lexan and it is microwave and dishwasher safe.Plus it does not break if it falls down. It is safer than using glass. It was rated number one gravy separator in a well recognized U.S. magazine.I'm very proud of this product because I am the manufacturer.
I have had this separator for over 10 years & it is wonderful for skimming fat when making broths, and gravies for a crowd.  We are a family of 6 so this 5 cup size works great. I make a lot of soups so this large size is perfect.  I have 2 cup glass one from an expensive kitchen store that I use when I need to separate small quantities, but that one is hard to clean.  This one is easy, a bottle brush fits down the spout or I can toss it in the dishwasher.  My glass one has such a small spout that I have to use pipe cleaners to clean it.  They both have their place in my kitchen, but this is my go to separator.
I think this thing is great. I have tried the silicone peelers - and unless you have a heavy cleaver and a nice chopping board, you can't use a knife to smash garlic like this thing does.Fits the palm of your hand perfectly. You can smash down hard, or just kind of crack them open. It's a hollow steel item, so it is not nearly as heavy as it looks. I find this one much more effective than a heavy french chef's knife. If you use a heavy cleaver and heavy board now - this is the same effect. If you don't have a heavy board and cleaver - get this thing.it's fun.
I like this cooling rack because it's very sturdy.  I also like the grid design instead of just the single wires across, because, as other reviewers have noted, cookies and other things won't fall through.  I've been looking for a good grid rack for a while, and I've seen similar ones for at least twice the price.  As for those people who commented that they didn't get the protective feet, I just called Nordic Ware (you can check out their website) and a very nice woman said she would mail me some replacements.  I am sure I will get a great deal of use out of this cooling rack, especially when I make my candies at Christmas.
I already had one of these but wanted a few more.  The newer ones have rounded parts rather than the flat parts of the original.  I like that feature.  They work great are nice and large and nest well in my cookie sheets.  Nice had strong and wash easily.
This cooling rack is heavy-duty, easy to clean AND it has a nifty grid that doesn't cut into the surface of your cake.  I also use it when I host parties to hold breads for slicing.  Put the rack on your cutting board and the crumbs fall away from your bread.  It makes for easy clean up all around.
very well made and extremely dependable. i dont know why i DIDNT have one all these years?  i perched it full time right next to my stove. instead of having to scramble for potholders to protect my counter or dropping the hot dish i put everything on the cooling rack now to transfer it to a plate since i have a small kitchen sometimes i CANT put things on the burners and i heat the majority of my food in the oven so its been getting a workout this past month.  Scones from the nonstick scone pan i also bought thru amazon which i love for many reasons i turned it over and the cooling rack was sizable enough to catch all nine Scones without tumbling them to a counter something my dinner plates dont do. Scones gave me a headache because you leave them in the pan or put them on a plate hot and the bottoms get damp. not with this rack i flipped the scone pan over let them cool a bit and perfect to eat warm out of the oven. this racks holds my heavier pans the scone pan and my commercial cookie pan with no bending issue. easy to clean popping it into the dishwasher.I just love this cooling rack even if you dont make baked goods but a major help when you do its perfect for people who heat things in the oven.
Very nice and sturdy rack to use for (cooling and icing) your baked goods. I don't think I would use this to bake on since it might ruin the finish.
OK, a cooling rack seems like a stupid thing to get excited about, but this thing rules. Most cooling racks have just horizontal bars, instead of the grid pattern on this one. The problem with the &quot;horizontal&quot; cooling racks is that when your cookies are a little soft, they tend to sag around the horizontal bars, and are hard to pull off later. The cooling &quot;grid&quot; keeps the cookies from drooping, so they stay a nicer shape, and can be easily removed. Also, when you're fiddling around with cookie placement on the rack, you can easily slide soft cookies in all four directions (top to bottom, side to side), without tearing the cookie or having it slip through the horizontal bars.
I would recommend this product; it is strong and well crafted. I bake often, so a cookie rack is a must. I'd buy this one again.
What can I say? I haul my cookies out of the oven and drag the parchment paper from  the Nordic Ware quarter sheet onto this rack. Before the next batch is done, I've hoovered up the first batch because they cooled quickly on this nice rack.
When I first read reviews of the Hoffritz Six-Piece Stainless-Steel Bar Tool Set in Modern Drunkard Magazine, I wrote them off as market-insider over-hype. I simply could not believe that this bar set could do everything the MDM editors claimed. In fact, I couldn't think of any advantages a professional bar tool set could offer over my trusty old collection of mason jars and Lil' Abner shot glasses.But boy oh boy, was I in for a surprise when my ex-girlfriend gave me the Hoffritz for our last anniversary (literally, our *last* anniversary). The kit came with a stainless steel shaking apparatus. For shaking cocktails! I'd always thought that was just a turn of phrase (you know, like &quot;on the rocks&quot; doesn't really involve rocks). But now I'm shaking all my vodka and I feel as smooth as James Bond. Not only that, but the whisk-type thing is handy for beating eggs, regardless of whether you like to fry them with bacon or pour them into your beer! Three cheers to Hoffritz, the choice of the discerning conoissiour.
This will make rolling out noodles much faster, it twice as big as my old one. Can't wait to use it this week-end.
My husband has big hands, and the regular size rolling pin dragged his knuckles on the board.  This one gives him the room he needs.  He loves to make breads, pizza dough, Christmas cookies, etc.
I've been baking pies for almost 40 years, having learned at the elbow of my mother, and after using this marble rolling pin for the first time last week, I produced one of the finest, flakiest pie crusts EVER!Whether it was the weight of the marble or the chill of it, it rolled out my pie crust easier than I've ever before experienced.  PLUS, because the dough barely stuck to the marble while I was rolling it out, I used very little flour.I'm very, very happy that I purchased this marble rolling pin.  I'd actually wanted one for years, but never got around to actually ordering one.  Now, after getting such amazing results, I could kick myself for waiting so long!
I love this rolling pin.  Wanted one for awhile and so happy I finally got it..
I bought this for my wife as she kept complaining her rolling pin was too light.  Received it in great shape!  She loves it; has not complained since she started using it!
I have been looking forward to using a marble rolling pin for a few years.  Now that I have received it, I use it to make pie crusts.  The weight is perfect and the coldness of the marble make rolling out the crust a "breeze".  I will also use it when I make homemade rolls.
I got this rolling pin because my previous wooden pin was not heavy enough to roll out pastry without a great deal of effort.  (I recently started baking again, after a gap of several years.)  This one works much better, and it rolls easily with good-quality bearings.  You shouldn't expect it to be lightweight, but that's not what I was looking for.
I love cooking gadgets.  I have several rolling pins:  an old handmade one that was my mother's, a french style, a long solid one with no handles, a few springerle rolling pins, and now, (thanks to a great friend and my birthday) this one.  I used it today to make three different items.  I was surprised when I rolled out cinnamon roll dough - it glided over the dough without sticking.  I think the weight made such a difference -- I didn't have to fight with the dough to get it to spread out, it rolled out very easily.  I also rolled out three pie crusts -- it was a dream.  I loved the little sound of the ball bearings, the handles are comfortable (in red to match my kitchen) and the marble is pretty.  All I need now is a pin display rack to show it off.
My favorite brand of drum sticks, now my favorite rolling pin. Well balanced, ergonomically pleasing. Thank you, Vic Firth, what else have you got?
I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She is so happy with it. And it looks good too.
This is a nice, heavy rolling pin that has saved my shoulders when applying weight to roll out pie crusts.It goes much faster and more enjoyable.The marble is an asset because you can place it in a cold area to chill, making the process more efficient.I've had many other pins, and the search is finally over.
I got this rolling pin as a gift for my Mom and she loves it.  It looked exactly like the picture with blonde handles and white/grey marble.  I would highly recommend this product.
This is my first marble rolling pin and I'm very satisfied with it. It's made from good quality, heavy marble and is great for pastries.
My wife loves this marble rolling pin.  She has several different types (21" aluminum") and others for different types of doughs.
I used to push and pull with my old wooden rolling pin, butwith this, it is heavy and practically rolls the dough outby itself.  It's very easy to use once you understand youdon't have to push and pull anymore.  Rolling out pie doughis a breeze.
This is definitely the best pod only machine I have ever used.Always consistent, no special tamping, just put in a pod and have a really good espresso right away.
I received this and the salt mill for Christmas from my son. The set adds to my kitchen table.  The handles are so easy to squeeze.  The salt or pepper come out the size I choose.  This is a great gift and a useful product.
If you EVER eat pepper, you need the pepperball! It allows you to add pepper with one hand and stir with the other, and it's just so fun to use!  Besides, how can you resist freshly-ground pepper? It has even earned the affectionate nickname in my home--the bunnyball! With a cute and easy-to-use design, this invention is a winner!
My pepper ball just came apart at the seams.  I have had to glue it with 'crazy glue'.. I would like somone to give me the address of the company so that I can send it back.
I've had this pepper (and salt) mill for about 2 months now and I LOVE IT!  It's one of my favorite and definitely one of my most useful kitchen tools!
I love the big handles, and it is indeed refillable.  There is a clever sliding door on the side of the ball that gives access to the peppers.
This pepper ball is always on the table as it looks so good. People comment on it whenever they are visiting.  It has been the best pepper mill I have ever had!!!!
This is the trick: there is a small cirular pieceof tape that is holding the slidind door shut.  Once you peel that bad boy off it slides open and closed like butter!
This pepper grinder is great, It grinds whole peppercorns onto your food just by squeezing the cute &#34;bunny ears&#34; over your plate, and it only takes one hand. Great for folks with only one good hand. It stands  flat upright on it's base or, if you like, it clings magnetically to most kitchen appliances. I have stainless steel and it hangs on like  mad!  I love Amazon's great selections. i detest shopping at malls and big-box stores.  Give me Amazon, all pros, no  cons.Cute and functional.
I may be lazy, but when rubbing a boston butt or something similar with olive oil, I used to have to wash my hands to remove oil in order to use the old pepper mill, then do the salt, rub again, and then wash my hands again.  With the Pepper Ball, I've got my messy hand and my work hand.  One hand stays dry and clean to operate the Pepper Ball, grab salt, mix something, etc.  The other hand gets dirty, rubs the oil, salt, pepper and whatever else.  It's also cool to look at.
This was a great buy. I got it as a gift, and I was worried that I should have invested more into one of the wooden peppermills. However, after quick shipping, I discovered that the risk I took was well worth it. It's a great peppermill, albeit a little small.
What a fine addition to a tabletop or spice rack!I have used a number of saltmills.  However, the Mr. Dudley is the best. It's so superior, in fact, that I'm hard pressed to think of a single negative comment.Key Features:1.) FINE GRINDS - The salt comes out in fine, consistently-sized pebbles.2.) GOOD FLAVOR - The salt grinds (thankfully) lack the metallic taste that often occurs with salt from other mills.3.) EASY CRANK ACTION - You won't have to exert much force to get nice grinds. The turning action is very smooth. (Note: Since the turning action is so easy, be careful not to over salt your food. In testing this new kitchen gadget, I almost ruined my dinner!)4.) NICE PRICE - I've seen similar grinders cost as much as $30 or $40.5.) STURDY ACRYLIC CONSTRUCTION - Since I am a tad clumsy, I've already dropped it twice. However, Mr. Dudley survived without a scratch.6.) SALT INCLUDED - I was pleasantly surprised to receive my salt mill already filled! Just whip this out of the box and you are ready to go.Enjoy!
The Mr. Dudley Cardan Saltmill looks a little better in person than in pictures. The acrylic body has a nice shine and looks more like glass than I thought it would. The saltmill also has a pleasant heft when filled. The fact that it arrived filled was a nice touch.I can't speak to the long-term durability of the nylon grinding mechanism, but the lifetime guarantee is reassuring. It grinds salt well, and with little effort on most settings. The finest setting is a little balky, but that's probably to be expected.There are two small screws visible through the saltmill's clear body. They're at the bottom and apparently serve to hold the grinding mechanism in place. They're well-hidden, but they do detract slightly from the saltmill's aesthetics.All-in-all, the saltmill is a great value. I didn't order the matching peppermill, but the saltmill has convinced me to reconsider.
I love the salt mill, but in trying to remove the top to refill, the top broke.  Since it has a lifetime guarantee and I still had the box and paper that came with it, I sent it to the address on the box and it was returned, &quot;delivery attempted&quot;.  Now I have a guaranteed salt mill that is broken and I cannot return it.  I really love the product, though, unbroken.
Kind of a hard item to review.  Plug it in, and it gets hot.  That's about it.  No problems.
These very nice quality mixing bowls nest beautifully within each other, in case cabinet space is scarce.  They are also pretty enough to use for serving bowls.  The different sizes are so handy and useful, a practical  and beautiful gift for the chef!
I was recommended this product by various baking blogs. To get that perfect shade in cake batter and frosting. I haven't been dissapointed. I have gotten bright amazing reds, deep blacks, vibrant blues, and it doesn't water down my frostings. It does take a lot of some colors to get deep shades (duh!) and these are pretty tiny bottles. But if you are experimenting with it, then this is a great package to try. I used it when decorating cookies with my family, and each shade was beautiful. I also used it to make a union jack colored cake, and the cake was truely vibrantly colored. I recommend this to everyone I know that bakes. I really love this product. I will probably buy the colors I use more in bigger containers, because I can't imagine going back to store bought liquid food coloring.
The spectra paste food colors are simply fantastic. They provide a depth and clarity of color that is impossible to achieve with liquid food colors. And the hues are beautiful and distinctive. The black and red, two colors which are very difficult to get when dying frostings, etc. are especially nice - probably the best of any manufacturer I have tried.For those who had questions, I am not 100% certain about the sizes, but if the set is the same as mine, the bottles are 3/4 ounce. While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material. So there is plenty of coloring ability in each bottle - many, many times more than a same sized liquid food color bottle.Highly recommended and at a really good price at the time of this review.
I could spend a year explaining how delightful it is to have all these colors and they are a good quality and excellent value. My daughter who loves to bake turned me on to these.You will have so much fun controlling and mixing and being a color scientist.  They blend well, mix well, have a  good consistency and came delivered well packaged and make Easter a whole new thing. Have to get some chickens to keep up with the color combo's/
If you want bright, vibrant, jaw dropping baked goods, get this. It's AMAZING. A little goes a long way so it lasts for a long time!
The drip spout is awesome! The colors are rich and consistent. They are so potent I've barely used any out of the bottle! So much better than the paste.
The colors provided were exactly as shown, I am yet to use any but i am looking forward to seeing the colors that can be produced
This dye produces very bright and nice colors. The only problem is a few of the stickers don't match the actual color so it is better to go by their name.
It was while at a friends home watching her use the grocery store food colour she had bought that I was reminded of why I love these Ateco full spectrum food colours. I am very very French in what I eat and how I bake and the products I need/want/use.Being a gel, you need less and the colours can be soft or bold.  If you are new to the gel I recommend using a toothpick to get a wee bit to mix in the dough, frosting, candy, cake, cookie you are making to better see if you actually need more.I love the violet for when I make my B&eacute;reng&egrave;re Abraham French macarons which calls for purple food colour to match the violet extract flavor.  Or green for when I make his Pistachio or  Kiwi macarons.  And the orange colour is magnificent and is used for one of my favorite orange liqueur frostings.Fact is these food colours are unlike any run of the mill food colour.They have the USA-K symbol on the box which I denotes kosher in the USA.
I give these Color kit FIVE STARS!!! I bought these colors for a rainbow cake and they were SO pretty. Everyone at the party loved the colors on the cake. The best color kit I've ever used, Thank you so much!
I had a cookie exchange at work, and being the perfectionist that I am, I purchased the Ateco Food Coloring Kit to ensure that I would have a wide variety of colors for cookie decorating!Price: Excellent! I can't go into a Michaels, Hobby Lobby, or any other local bakers shop or hobby store and find these, let alone something similar to this without paying a lot more!Ease of Use: VERY easy to use! It's a squeeze bottle, and I did find that the bottles were difficult to squeeze on SOME, but not all. For that, I just used a toothpick to pull out the dye so that I could add it to my frosting mixture. That seemed to work just fine.Shipping/Delivery: I used Amazon Prime. It arrived very quickly, and in good shape.Colors: The colors are terrific! I did purchase some in store before ordering it online, and I found these colors to be a lot more rich and true-to-life.Overall, I found this to be excellent for my use. I would recommend it to anyone doing cookie decorating!
I wanted to make a rainbow cake or cupcakes, but it was very hard to find food coloring in Seoul, South Korea, where I live. The few times I did find them the colors were very limited (only blue, green, and red). Also, the food colors were typically flavored as well, which I didn't want. So I purchased this 12 color food coloring kit and recently tried them out! I didn't end up using all of the colors, but I did make rainbow cupcakes using 6 of the 12 colors: purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.I used a yellow cake mix and at first was a little worried because it wasn't white cake mix and I was afraid that the yellow batter would some how alter the colors of the dyes. I divided the yellow cake batter evenly in six cups and squirted a bit of each food color in its corresponding cup. I was really pleasantly surprised at how a little went such a long way and how beautifully rich and vibrant the colors were! I only used the classic rainbow colors, but I'm now really excited to try some of the more exotic ones included in the kit (like fuschia, teal, etc).After I mixed up the colored batters and piled them into the muffin tins I baked them! Again, I was worried that if they were baked the colors might not be vibrant once they were cooked as they were when they were just mixed in the batter. However, I was again very pleasantly surprised! The baking only enhanced and blended the colors more beauitfully!I made cream cheese frosting and iced the cupcakes and they were a huge hit. They look like they would taste fruity, but they didn't, they tasted the same as just the regular yellow cake mix would taste like so that's good.Add a punch of color, and preserve the original flavor of whatever you're making! I highly recommend this product :)
This review is a based on the use of multiple Amazon fulfilled products purchased across time.  Numerous products were used to create a tinker bell themed cake, and this review touches on each of the products used.  This cake was baked in the Wilton Decorative Preferred 12-by-18 Sheet Cake Pan.  I used one standard cake mix in each layer.  I cooked each layer using two Wilton Flower Nail Decorating Tool #7 equally spaced in the pan, and I watched for cooking time.  The layers are very thin, but easily moved if you use parchment paper to line the bottom of the pan. I find cooking layers separately easier than using a cake splitter.The cakes were placed in layers on Wilton 19-by-13-Inch Cake Board, 6-Pack I used two boards to provide support knowing that the cake would be heavy.  I used a variety of butter cream frosting recipes from allrecipies.com, and within each recipe used Wilton Clear Imitation Vanilla 8 Oz Bottle to avoid adding color to the frostings.  To add color to the frostings I used the pink, green and blue colors from Ateco 1112 12-Color Food Coloring Kit.  I agree with other reviewers on the coloring that the squeeze/ drop bottles are much easier and cleaner to use than other "tub like" colorings.Once the cake was assembled, filled and dirty- iced with butter cream, the decorations began.  The theme of the cake is "Tinker Bell" and the six pack figurines from Disney Fairies Secret of the Wings Exclusive Figurine Playset PVC 6-Pack [Tinker Bell, Periwinkle, Iridessa, Rosetta, Silvermist & Vidia] were a perfect size for this cake and theme.  There were a few imperfections on the figures, but I managed to work with them. For example Tinker Bell had a long silver finger (clearly left from the mold used) which I stuck an edible butterfly on.  I left the figures tied to their stands and placed the stands in the cake (last thing before presentation).For decorating the cake I began by frosting the (rice crispy treat hill) with green tinted vanilla buttercream, and placed that on the top corner of the cake. I then traced a path (using a butter knife) in a slight curve along the cake and filled the path with regular sized m&ms; using yellow and brown.  There was not enough yellow m&ms; in three packs to complete the path so I had to improvise at the end and use all brown (sigh!).  I then sprinkled green decorating sugar over the path and gently wiped the sugar off of the m&ms; and into the path spaces to fill the white with green. This also gave it a nice shiny/ sparkle look.  The water by Silvermist (fairy with long dark hair and blue dress) was made by swirling some blue icing (store bought in tube) into the white butter cream on her corner.  All of the "Rocks" you see throughout the cake are Candy Rocks - Pebbles 1lb Bag.  I agree with other reviewers that these rocks were too big and I had to cut them in half not only to be the right size, but also so they fit snuggly to the cake.  I choose these candy rocks because of the variety of colors. I needed the blue tinted ones for the water and winter fairy sections, and the other more earthy colors for the hill, the garden and the "fast flying" fairies. It was strange that these are not chocolate rocks; I knew this though when I purchased them, but having a "black licorice flavor bean" in the same mouthful as a vanilla chocolate strawberry cake is somewhat strange.The grass seen in the cake was made through two different methods.  One, for frosting grass, I used Multi-Opening Tip #233 sold by Larks cake and candy, with a piping bag and a coupler I had on hand. I had also purchased another size tube (SS EXTRA LARGE TUBE#234) from larks but this proved too big for the coupler I had. The more tube like grass on the cake is created though the use of Twizzlers Pull and Peel Green Apple Candy (12 oz Bags) 2 Pack.  I cut these to the desired size and pulled apart slightly to make the tall grass feel. This amt of twizzlers is WAY TOO MUCH for cake decorating and in total I probably used maybe 1/3 of the bag. I now have a whole bag and more leftover which I may or may not use...All of the edible paper items on the cake were purchased through Amazon and sold by sugar robot. These came in very nice packaging, were already cut to size (a huge time saver on a cake endeavor like this) and were colored beautifully. I will say that the image in the photo of the ivy leaves on line is MUCH MORE BLUE than they actually were. The ivy is a true evergreen (see photo), and not blue. I was hoping for more blue.  This cake used: Edible Ivy Leaves - Set of 24 - Cake and Cupcake Toppers, Decoration, Edible Pansies - Pink, Purple, and Blue Set of 12 - Cake and Cupcake Toppers, Decoration, and Edible Butterflies  - Small Assorted Pink and Purple Set of 24 - Cake and Cupcake Toppers, Decoration.  I did have leftover Pansies (they were quite large for what I needed them fore and in hindsight would have gone with much smaller flowers (maybe by half).  The butterflies were just the right size and beautifully colored. As for the taste of these items... not much to them, but I believe that the novelty is that you CAN eat them... not that you eat them for the taste.Also featured in this cake are Edible Ladybugs Sugar Decorations (12 pc), and Winter Christmas Snowflake Sugar Decorations Cookie Cupcake Cake 12 Count, both sold by Larks.  These were slightly larger in size than I may have wanted but had great flavor and coloration.  I had leftover snowflakes, which is more based on my design than the item, but we did use all the ladybugs.  Another decorative feature on the cake is the sugar Bees, 2 of Bees Cakes Decorations #45148 - Bumble Bee Shaped Edible Hard Sugar Decorations, 16 pcs.  I purchased two sets, and one would clearly have been enough. The flavor size and coloration were all GREAT on these decorative items.Two final items to consider in this review were the cupcake cups Wilton Color Wheel Mini Baking Cups, 100 Count (under the pansies at the top of the cake)  worked well and I would use them again (I will have to since there were 100 of them in the package and I used 12 of them.  As well as edible glitter Dress My Cupcake DMC28011 Glitter Sprinkles for Cake/Cookies/Desserts, 0.25-Ounce, Rainbow, used to create the rainbows surrounding the light fairy.  A few additional items were used in this cake and not purchased through Amazon... Oreos for dirt under the pansy flowers, gummy worms in the garden, the "2" candle, and of course parchment paper and food safe cardboard for making stencils for the rainbow shapes.Lastly we packaged leftovers in bright colored to go containers,  Lot of 12 Assorted Bright Color Cardboard Treat Boxes Party Favors, after placing wax paper along the bottom of each box.  These boxes were just the right size for a to go chunk of cake, but the weight of the cake pulled on the bottoms of the boxes a little.  The colors were great with the theme though, and you can't beat having people take cake away in these cute containers!As a review on all the products used in this cake and mentioned in this review, we are Amazon Prime members and all items shipped timely and safely.  None of the decorations were broken or damaged, all items met or exceeded expectations, and the result was a very impressive cake!!!
For those wondering, the bottles are each 3/4 oz. and they are a gel food color.Very vibrant, the amount goes far for me.
I have gotten so many compliments on baked goods made with this food coloring!  They're so vibrant and concentrated, and pretty true to the colors indicated on the bottles.  I've used them in macaron shells, buttercream frosting, and royal icing, all to great effect!
These are great, colors are true.  You do have to use quite a bit of the color though. Highly recommend
I buy these a few times a year because my kids like to make their own play doh and these colors are so bright and vibrant that they are endlessly entertained!  They also work amazing in frosting for cakes :)
I've only used two colors so far - leaf green and royal blue.  I was super impressed with both colors though and the fact that it didn't take much gel to achieve a rich color.  This far surpased the Wilton gels I've been using in the past!I ended up running out of green frosting and had to color a second batch and it was amazingly simple to get a good color match between the two different batches.  I'm wondering if adding more gel would have made it a darker green or if I would have always ended up with close to the same shade of green...I think to really maximize the use of this product to get full color spectrums would be easy with a color mixing chart!
I was a bit hesitant to buy these online as I had not heard of the brand. I have been very pleased with them. Lots of colors, good consistency and easy to use squeeze bottles. The color is strong without diluting the ingredients you are adding to. Would definitely buy again.
Pros:- Nice selection of colors- Bottles are easy to dispense from (lid flips open & gel squeezes out a small opening, allowing you to add just a drop or a whole squeeze)- Gels add nice vibrant color with just a little to get strong deep color - not like you have to use the whole bottle at once.Cons:- None that I have found so far!
I bought these to decorate some dia de los muertos skulls with icing.  The Ateco food coloring gave nice bright, vibrant colors and mixed with the icing very well. I was totally satisfied with the purchase.
Very pretty colors, true to their labels. This was one of the only brands I could find that offered the fuchsia that I needed at the time, and the color turned out great.
I love all of the cool colors in this set. So glad I bought it. Would buy again but it will be a long time before I run out!
All I can say is I made the egg white icing and had the wilton gel paste colors run so I wanted to try something new a few days latter.The icing color stayed put and the Americolor Cake Colors Mp-20z Meringue Powder tasted great.I will always use the Ateco (Americolor) food coloring and Meringue powder.
My food coloring order arrived and the color selection was well represented as expected; no problems; I would definitely re-order this product.
I'll admit it.  I am a food coloring novice.  For my entire life, I only thought food coloring came in 4 colors.  Bright red, bright yellow, bright blue and bright green.  If you wanted orange, you had to mix the red and yellow.  And if you accidentally added too much yellow, you had to add more red.  But then you could accidentally add too much red and have to add more yellow until you have a whole bowl of orange food coloring and all you wanted was to color a little bit of frosting so you could put it on a dozen cookies.Happily, I was wrong.  There aren't just 4 colors of food coloring.  There are at least 12.  And I bought them.  Not only did I buy them, I used them and loved them.  I little of this food coloring goes a long way.  Long gone are the days where you end up making gallons of coloring for a dozen cookies.  Gone are the days where you could never get the color just right without having to sand your table and rip out the grout of the tile on the floor because the coloring is everywhere after you tried to mix them.  These are amazing times where you open up the color you want and add just the right amount of exactly the color you were looking for.This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to color their food.
Love it, love it, love it!  So much more wonderful than those of the grocery store.  I can be so much more creative and different!  Thank you for making such a thing!
I have only used three colors out of this box but they look just as advertised. My son and I love popcorn so I have been adding a few drops when making kettle corn on the stove. The colors are nice and bright and my son loves them. Price was also reasonable for how many colors you get.
I was very impressed after purchasing this Alteco 12-Color Food Coloring Kit..The bottles may only be 3/4 oz., but with gel food coloring, a little bit goes a long way. They produced vibrant, lovely colors.Overall, the best gel food coloring I've used. I will buy this again when I run out.
They do what they are supposed to do.  I like that all you have to do is squeeze the bottles to get the color out.
This was perfect! I make homemade playdough for my pre-k class and the colors are vibrant! I Highly recommend this!
These are some beautiful colors. vibrant. I used them for homemade play dough and it came out awesome, threw in some glitter and you'd think i bought it from the store.
These small vials contain every color one can think of.  It only takes one to two small drops to get vibrant colored frosting.  Will certainly go a long way.  Great product.
I have only used one color so far, but the results were amazing!  I used a very, very tiny amount of pink to a batch of butter cream icing and the result was a beautiful and rich colored icing that my granddaughter loved!  Highly recommend this food coloring--much better results than I had from the Wilton food coloring paste.  I look forward to baking my Christmas cookies and trying the other colors!
I'm really glad I bought the Ateco 12-Color Food Coloring Kit.  I found it searching for Black food coloring for my Halloween cookies.  I just finished my Christmas cookies which turned out amazingly thanks to this food coloring kit.Each color is very bright and solid.  The pastes mix very well with frosting (I have not used them for anything else yet).  These are the nicest/brightest Christmas sugar cookies I have ever made.You don't need to use a lot of coloring, just a drop or two, to get the perfect shade.  As such, each bottle will last a long time.
I was amazed at the colors I was able to achieve with this food coloring.  I have used it on a cake - red, blue, green, yellow, and purple - each color was beautiful.  I also made cupcakes with a brillant blue icing.  No change in consistancy or taste in the frosting. I will not go back to the "other" brand.
Okay. So I am a rookie cake maker and decorator. I bought these because I had a wild hair to create a four layer ombr&eacute; cake for my daughters birthday. It was sooooo easy to turn the shades from lighter to darker and took such a little amount! I will NEVER use liquid again. These rock!
