The pictures and recipes  are nice but they could have come from any cookbook.Very expensive for such a short book, would send it back but it would cost me more to return as it was part of a larger order.  I wouldn't consider buying any other books in this series unless they were in a discount book store for a couple of dollars!
I loved this press for 3 months. Used it nearly every day. Then it just fell apart at the hinge. I am not Arnold. I am 60+ arthritic, do not work out and I used it easy. It should NOT have broken!
Although this is a nice looking product, and it lives up to the 'good grip' promise, I went back to the company twice for a new one after the metal broke apart at the stress point (the hinge).I will say that OXO stood behind their product, shipping out a new one with no fuss.  But after getting two replacements, and seeing the third break in exactly the same place, I'm done.
Purchased this a few years ago. After 5 uses, the metal part of it snapped in half. It worked well while it lasted. Same thing happened to my mom. I guess they rather put out quantity than quality.
I'm probably pretty hard on garlic presses, as we cook with garlic almost every day, but I still couldn't believe that I managed to snap the handle off of this one after only a few months of use.  Luckily, I had never loved the press - the way the block fit into the bowl always seemed to result in some garlic coming out of the sides and not being pressed through the holes - so this gave me the opportunity to get one I really like (the Zyliss).
Imagine my suprise when after less than a year of use, the metal grid broke, bending outward while pressing a clove of garlic.  Very dissapointing.  And while my hands never slipped of the &quot;non-slip grip&quot; the grips themselfs often (every use) slipped down on the metal handles. I think I'll try another brand this time!
In contrast to some of the other reviews, I find this press harder to use than others that I've owned.  This is surprising given OXO's typical track record in usability.  In fact, the press that I replaced with this one was also an OXO and worked much better in terms of hand strength required.  The reason I replaced the other model was because its coating came off in the dishwasher and it was harder to clean.  This is the one real benefit for this model as it is far easier to clean than any other one I've used.  The one strange thing that happens with mine is that water will get trapped in the handle and leak in my drawer after it comes out of the dishwasher.  It also leaves behind more garlic when pressing than other presses that I've used which feels like a waste.  In the end, I'm going to go back to using my old press until I find one that is both easy to use AND easy to clean.
This press is considerably heavier than the Zusi 2 and has a bigger capacity, but although you don't have to have super-strong hands to use it, it requires bigger hands and more hand strength than I've got. If your hands are very large and strong, you'll probably like it, but if not, forget both of these and buy the Kuhn-Rikon Easy-Squeeze instead.
I love garlic, and I thought this would be a great press. Not so much. My handles never leaked, as some reviewers have mentioned, rather they suddenly fell off completely, after maybe two years of moderate use. The metal handles inside are not pretty or comfortable--I use them in a hurry, but now I chop or slice the garlic by hand. I thought that the red attachment would be helpful for cleaning, but I don't find it to be significantly helpful. I also  think that the reservoir that holds the garlic could be a little larger. I don't recommend this garlic press.
I generally love Good Grips products, but this garlic press is not up to the standard of the other GG products.  It does not fit together closely enough to press all of the garlic through the head - leaving a lot of unpressed garlic in the hopper. My Zyliss was damaged in the dishwasher (live and learn) but I am determined to get another.
I know I shouldn't complain too much since I used it for three years, but I just get upset when you buy a product that breaks after several years.  It cracked on both sides of a handle and wouldn't put any pressure on the garlic to push through.  I'm now on the market for a new one and don't recommend this one.
If you're looking for a garlic press that produces minced garlic, keep looking. This is a garlic squasher, a garlic masher, a garlic crusher, but NOT a garlic press. No actual minced garlic emerges from the little holes. I was so disappointed! My husband finally repaired our old, no-name, made-in-Taiwan garlic press, and we're back in business. Caveat emptor!
Generally I have chosen to purchase OXO products because of their durability.  I am very disappointed in OXO this time.  After just one year of use, the hinge on my garlic press is broken, and I am now pounding out garlic with a mortar and pestle until I can get to the US to buy a replacement.  Unfortunately, I will not be buying another OXO Good Grips Garlic Press.  I wish I had read all of the helpful customer reviews before making this purchase.  It seems OXO needs to read them as well.
It worked well for two years (used about twice a month), then the body cracked and will no longer press the garlic thru the holes. Disappointing.
Like others here, I've owned this press for a few years.  It was great in the beginning; easy to clean and use.  No problems with the handles, in fact I loved them.  I have cleaned it both in the dishwasher and by hand.However, after a few years of infrequent use, it became harder to clean for whatever reason.  Then it became more difficult to mince garlic with it and then finally the thing broke at the hinge, again, like others here.If you want something pretty to put in your kitchen and intend to only use it once or twice a year, buy this one.  If you intend to make good use of your garlic press and want something that LASTS, keep looking!
If you put a large clove in this one, you will be hard pressed (ha, ha) to squeeze it through unless you have large, strong hands. Mine ended up in the trash after one of the handles snapped clean off.
I love the older Oxo garlic press that I have had for many years and when I went to buy one for the RV I decided to get another Oxo just like my old one. The style was changed, which I wasn't sure about, but bought one anyway. I didn't care for the feel of it as much my old one, though it seemed to work almost as well as the older style at first. But today I was using it out in the RV and I wasn't able to get hardly any garlic pressed out of it. I finally went into the house and brought my old one out and it worked perfect! I don't think much of the new style and as so many people have stated that theirs has broken, I am going to replace it with a Zyliss. My older one in the house has gotten tons of use and is still working great while my newer one, which I think I may have had for maybe 2 years give or take, has hardly been used at all (especially since the RV sits all winter) and now the press doesn't work. My old one gets 5 stars, but this newer version only 2.
I really liked this garlic press, until the metal broke.  It has not undergone heavy use and was not that old.  I haven't fared much better with other Good Grips products - I purchased two dish scrubbers in a row and BOTH broke within a month of use.  After the garlic press, I am not sure that I will purchase Good Grips products again.  They feel like they should be sturdy, and the rubberized handles are comfortable, but they don't hold up.  Considering their cost, it's unacceptable.  I do like their measuring spoons, however.
I used this for about 2-3 years before it broke when crushing a clove of garlic.  I was squeezing down pretty tight when, bam, the metal just broke.  I also have to say that it was always a pain to put in the diswasher b/c whenever I took it out, water would leak out of the handles from in between the metal and the black plastic coating.  I'm not a fan.
This press is ok if you don't mind throwing away the rubber handles.  I hate the stagnant water that gets in there, like everyone else said.  I discovered the water while pressing some garlic and it got over everything.  It just gets nasty in there so I no longer use the handles.  It hasn't broken on me, I've just been too lazy to get a new one.  It does leak garlic back onto the handles also.  Not worth your money IMO.
Worked while it worked, but not sturdy enough -- hinge broke within a few months.  Rubber handle bulky for my smaller hands.  Rubber grip also tends to slip off.I had one zyliss last for 10 years, another about a year -- hard to know where to go for a press now but it's frustrating without one or, worse yet, a poor one.
This is the first garlic press that I have ever had.  The one thing that is inescapable is that it takes a lot of hand strength to use it.  This fact is the overriding reason for my three-star rating.  Admittedly, my hands are fairly arthritic, but it still takes a great deal of force to press the garlic through.  For that reason alone, I would not recommend this tool for anyone experiencing ongoing pain in their hands; this press will surely aggravate it. The tool itself is sturdy and well made, although I'm also unimpressed with the cleaner feature; it still needs to be manually cleaned.  The press goes through the dishwasher just fine.  However, it's pricey to me at almost $15; it should be more like $10.
After a couple of years we tossed our Oxo press into the garbage can.  Early on, the rubber handles would slip off when in use or they be full of water from washing and leak water all over when in use (minor anoyances). After about a year the plastic cleaning face popped off and wouldn't stay on (bigger anoyance).  Finally the press lost alignment and was useless (dead). It's performance and ease of cleaning were never very good and now that it's gone, we now have an excuse to find a different press.
The grip handles take in water and drip into other dishes.  It's quite annoying.  However, atleast this one doesn't rust.
I've had 2 of these now. They both worked fine. When the first one broke, I wrote it off as a fluke. Now the second one broke as well.I gave it 2 stars as it worked pretty well while in one piece.If you are looking for a "temporary" garlic press, this is the one for you.For the rest of us looking for something that will last, the search continues.(BTW, I had an Oxo grater that broke too, so I think I am done with this brand for good).
I have the Kuhn Rikon garlic press and I much prefer that little gem to the OXO.  For one thing, the OXO is much harder to use.  I'm not a weak person, and I usually have to use both hands or have my husband help me with this one.  I can use the Kuhn Rikon without peeling the garlic cloves and that is impossible with the OXO.  The grippy handle on the OXO seems to retain the garlic odor where the complete stainless steel construction of the Kuhn Rikon means that there is never a residual garlic smell after washing.  The Kuhn Rikon is easier to wash, too.  I have not had my OXO break yet, like some others have mentioned, but I don't use it very often.  I usually like OXO products, so I am very disappointed with this tool.
I really tried to like this garlic press but, alas, I don't.  While the cleaning mechanism works well and the handles are comfortable, it never completely crushes the garlic clove.  Instead it leaves a good 1/4 of the garlic clove stuck to the bottom of the press.  To use the entire clove, you have to fish out the garlic remains and then mince then by hand.  The problem seems to be that the two sides of the press don't meet tightly.  In frustration I bought IKEA's inexpensive garlic press and it works wonders.
I've always appreciated the Good Grips line because of the comfort handles. I have a lot of their kitchen tools. Unfortunately, I'm not so crazy about this one. It's comfortable, yes, but as a time-saver, it fails. The surface area of the press is so large (1 1/4&#34; x 1 1/2&#34;) that the garlic simply spreads out on the inside when you press. I think the big square holes diminish the pressure that squeezes the garlic out, too. I'd say not even half comes out of the press. The rest I have to fish out with a knife and cut by hand. Before the garlic even emerges, you get a splashing of garlic juice, and if you're not prepared for it, it'll end up all over you. The red pad that you flip up to clean the press is a great feature. Maybe you make up your time there, without the hassle of cleaning those tiny chambers with a brush. But, bottom line, for me it's back to the generic press that I've used for decades.
As with most garlic presses much of the garlic stays in the press and even when you reverse it to push out the garlic with the little prongs you still end up scraping it out with a little knife. If you are pressing many cloves as I usually do and you don't scrape off the garlic on the outside before putting a new glove in, the handle can swing too far open grabbing all the garlic you just pressed out leaving it stuck in the prongs. This press is heavy in the hand but it takes a good amount of pressure to push the garlic through and it you have arthritis you probably would not be able to use this. The hinge part takes a lot of stress I would not put more then one clove at a time I think it would eventually snap off. Not my favorite item from a company that makes so many wonderful gadgets. I would much rather use my little grater and give it a rinse much faster and far less of a mess to clean. Not lovin this item.
As a garlic press, this one is ok but not great.  It leaves a fair amount of garlic behind in the press, though what makes it through comes out in nicely even small pieces.  It can't seem to handle unpeeled cloves well either.  Definitely not if there's more than one.But the biggest reason for my low rating is that, like several other people here, our press tore completely in two at the hinge after just a couple of years of modest use.  We're about to buy theTrudeau Garlic Press, which was a best buy in Cooks Illustrated's latest review.
It took a couple of years of use, but ours broke at the hinge, too.  Worked nicely while it lasted, though.  The plastic cleaner is very handy and effective.
There are 2 major problems with this garlic press:1) Much of the garlic gets stuck inside the hopper of the press and will not come out.2) The holes in the press seem to be too large so mince is not as fine as I would like.I owned OXO's garlic press (Item #: 97-6067011) from WS and it was perfect until the cheap coating started to flake off and within a year it completely broke. I got this garlic press as a replacement from OXO but was disappointed with these 2 problems. Still looking for an excellent replacement. From the reviews, it seems that all of them have some type of flaw.
We received a whole set of OXO tools as a wedding gift wears ago.This garlic press broke after three years of infrequent use.  The metal snapped near the hinge.  The rubber handles also slide off easily.  Sounds like I am not the only one.The OXO kitchen scissors also fell apart after one month of use.
Like a few others here have reported, the OXO broke right below the hinge. I would call it an average press with a better hand grip. The plastic hole clearer tended to stay lined up and worked ok. It broke while being used in normal service.
As noted by many.  If you use a lot of garlic--which I do--and do a lot of cooking--which I do--this will break by the joint.  It is not stainless, but an alloy of a different nature.Other than that the comment on the handles is right on.  They will fill with water and over time they slip off more and more.  Don't be fooled by initial heft, feel, etc.I generally LOVE OXO, but they failed on durability here.
I bought this garlic press about 5 years ago.  It has done a good job for the past 5 years, but a month ago it broke on me.  I didn't do anything extraordinary.  I was just using the press like normal and the hinge broke.  Also, the black rubber handles slide back and forth allowing water to get into the handles
It's not made of steel. Nice grips ... but not durable.
I remember using something like this when i was a busboy to pick up crumbs on tables. This, unfortunately, didn't work well at all for me. The wheels on the bottom of the roller left white marks all over the tablecloth, the roller would not spin freely, and the housing hit the table too. Just not a good design for my type of tablecloth, which is the plasticized cloth wally-world special. It's ugly, but waterproof. Maybe this would work on a nice cloth tablecloth.
As Slothrop said, this jigger is not in a useful size.I think the most useful size is 1 fl. oz. on one end, and 1-1/2 fl. oz. on the other head. With a jigger of this size, 3/4 and 1-1/4 fl. oz. can be easily &quot;measured&quot; by underfilling, and 1/2 fl. oz. is always easy to measure with a tablespoon.If you are looking for your first jigger, I recommend you to look around for a 1 and 1-1/2 oz jigger while reviewing the recipes for your favourite drinks.
Yes, the item in question is attractive and well-made. But ask yourself whether the units of measurement--3/4 oz. and 1-1/4 ozs.--are what you're likely to use. Since most standard drinks involve measurements of 1 oz., 1-1/2 ozs., or 2 ozs., I've found this isn't a very practical &quot;jigger.&quot;
This is a sturdy cooling rack that fits nicely in a half pan, but the non-stick coating started peeling after a year or two of only occasional use.  Disappointing to find the coating coming off onto the food (and worse yet, that we likely had been ingesting it!).
There are two different cooling racks with the same part number.  One is gridded with rubber feet and is 10 x 15.25.  The other is not gridded, has no rubber feet and is 11.5 x 16.75.  I ordered 2 from Amazon wanting the 10 x 15.25, which is the one described, to fit inside 2 pans I already own.  I ended up with the larger racks, which I can't use for what I wanted them for.  Both are pictured on Nordic Ware's website ([...]) for the part number 43342.  I copied the second picture from their website and added it to Amazon...I see this as a Nordic Ware issue, not Amazon, and contacted them on their website.
I wanted a marble rolling pin with handles and a longer-than-10" roller.  This one had good reviews (here and elsewhere), Amazon's listing says it's 20" long, it's listed elsewhere as having a 12" surface and a review here called it 12", and I didn't care that it doesn't come with a base/stand.  Unfortunately, what I received is only 18" long with a 10" marble roller that has some small chips and divots.  And yes, it has metal ball bearings, but I can't imagine they're supposed to rattle noisily every time the rolling pin is moved at all.I called Amazon to see whether this was some sort of replaceable fluke or I should just get a refund.  A very helpful customer-service person told me this pin's in their system as refund-only, no replacements, because they're pulling it to check its description -- apparently because they've been getting a lot of returns.  She promptly and cheerfully refunded not only the purchase price but also shipping costs, even though I told her I got free shipping on the order; she said they'd add that amount anyhow to apologize for the trouble.  Great!However, when I asked whether I could be notified if they find or get the advertised longer pins (reviews were positive enough that despite this one's specific problems, I'd be willing to try again with the correct length), she said they can't notify me but that I could check the site again in a month to see if the pin was available again.  I explained that it's *currently* available, labeled "In Stock" and apparently orderable, and she simply suggested I could try ordering it again in a month or so to see what arrives.  So, kudos to Amazon for their lovely return/refund policy and the nice customer-service person I reached, but boos to them for still listing and selling this item even while investigating it after many returns.This is supposed to be a review of the pin, though, not of Amazon's policies.  It's 18" instead of the listing's stated 20", and it arrived with a flawed rolling surface and really noisy bearings.  I'm giving it a second star because it does roll very smoothly and has comfortable handles.  It'd probably do a fine (albeit loud) job, though not on smooth things like fondant with those chips.
Great potential, but very disappointing as even on the finest setting, the pepper comes out very coarse. Would not recommend if you need a fine mill as well.
I ordered this to try because of all the great reviews, but was not pleased with the outcome.  The color didn't seem to be any different than what I could get using Wilton icing coloring.  Also my icing started to separate in the bag while I was trying to decorate the cake which also made it darker than the icing I had already put on the cake.  I guess it was separating from the heat of my hands holding the bag.  I have never had this problem with the Wilton colors.  I guess I will continue to look for a coloring that can make my icing brighter and darker shades.
This dye is very thick and not as easy to work with as those for little bottles from the grocery store. We had a difficult time regulating how much would pop out of the container. It was fun to have premixed colors.
I bought this set mainly for the red.  I bake and decorate with frosting/icing quite a bit, so I was excited to get so many colors that were supposed to be of better quality than Wilton.  I used an entire bottle of red in 3 cups of buttercream frosting.  The darkest it would get was a watermelon color.  By the time I got to that point, my frosting had broken and looked terrible.  The royal blue wasn't much better.  The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I haven't used all of the colors yet, just red and blue.  I will stick with store bought red frosting and Wilton gel colors for everything else.
This smart-looking, relatively easy-to-clean cookware has several drawbacks. The hollow handles look like they would stay cool, but in fact they get blazingly hot. If you want to use it for everyday, any kids in the kitchen must be warned. It is fairly lightweight and so food tends to burn, even if the heat is low. Not what you would expect, for the money. The stockpot is fine for boiling water in which to cook pasta (for example) but for simmering, a heavier pot would be more suitable. Not a particularly good value.
After having read all the good reviews (none really bad) I feel I must have bought a lemon.  It arrived with the bean container broken.  Had to send it back.  The basket seldom went back into the correct position.  For some reason water would leak down the front of the machine and get all over the warmer/burner and the counter.  Coffee grounds would also be on the counter.  We sent it back yet again.  After having it for not quite two years it stopped making coffee (don't know if electronics were haywire) even when buttons were pushed manually.  It even burned a spot on my counter while giving off an extremely offensive burning smell.  To its credit the grinder still works.  But since the rest of it doesn't work it is a very counterspace grabbing coffee grinder!
Without contradicting the comments of the other reviewers, let me get right to the point.  There are a number of things wrong with this coffee maker that make it frustrating to use:1) The digital controls are hard to read.  You have to get your eyes down to the counter to be sure of what you are doing.  The buttons are small, and the LCD display is about the size of the watch your kids get for free at the bottom of a box of Fruit Loops.  This is complicated by the fact that when the filter is in position to recieve the ground coffee, it obscures the display.  Dial controls would have been better.2) You set the grinder to grind the right amount of coffee, but the machine has no idea how much water it's going to use -- it just empties whatever you've poured in.  This isn't foolproof, because the depth gauge inside the water reservoir is impossible to read.  The charcoal filter insert is black plastic.  Even with direct light shining down the reservoir, you've got no idea how much water you've poured in.  You have to use the carafe to measure the water properly before you pour it in.3) To fill the reservoir or empty the coffee filter of spent grounds, you lift the cover from the machine.  No big deal, right?  Well, this cover is HUGE.  You can't place the machine on the counter underneath your kitchen cabinets and operate it effectively because the cover is so darn big it won't lift up all the way.  So you have to slide the machine towards you, fill it, empty it, whatever, and then get it out of the way.  All of this is unneccesary.  The cover could've been split -- hinged at front and back -- to separate the water reservoir and the filter cover.4) This is not a smart machine.  It comes with warnings in the manual about how to do things just right so you don't screw it up.  (E.g., (paraphrasing) &quot;Be sure to place the carafe over the warmer with teh handle facing forward to avoid allowing steam to rise into the grinder and clog the grounds.&quot;)  The potential for making a BIG mess is very real if your coffee maker is programmed to go, but you forget to place the carafe in the right spot, or the filter in the right spot, etc.So what happened to your [money]?  Where are they spending all your dough?  It's hard to tell.  The grinder is excellent.  It's not too loud and it yields a very uniform grind, which you can adjust to some degree for desired fineness.  The coffee is very good, provided you get it all right.I bought this for my wife for Xmas, but now I can see I made a big mistake.  She used to grind the beans in a burr grinder, fill the filter and water reservoir, etc. every night.  Then one of use would just flip the switch on our beat-up cheap-o Braun machine in the morning.  (We never could train our 13 year old to handle that part!)  So I was getting great coffee with very little effort on my part.  Now we find out that this labor-saving automatic machine that I bought her is so darn complicated that she doesn't want anything to do with it.  Guess who cleans, fills and programs the night before now?  And if I don't get it right (which happens every other night!) I have a grumpy wife the next morning to remind me how great I had it before this machine came into our lives.In retrospect, I just should've bought her jewelry.
I have to say... My co-workers and I are coffee-addicts. We drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee per person a day. More if we are chasing a deadline! To cut down on our office coffee spending sprees at cafes, we bought this Capresso product. It seems silly but... It took four of my co-workers to figure out how to operate it.We have been using this product in our office for a little more than a year now. Within the first year, the grinder broke three times. The first time it broke, the grinder just stopped working. The second and third time it broke, we rudely found out that the grinder cannot grind oil-rich coffee beans because it clogs it up. (Shiny-looking coffee beans are rich in oil.) Since the product was still under the one-year warranty, we sent it back to the manufacturer each time for repairs. They were pretty good about it. We only paid for the shipping and handling.Unfortunately, the product has been with us for over a year now. The grinder broke or stopped working again for the fourth time. We are so frustrated with this product that we do not feel like spending money to have it repaired. (We have a feeling it is just going to break again and again and again.) We would like to give it away or maybe even throw it out the window, but it is such an expensive paperweight to do so. We decided to just buy a $10 coffee bean grinder from a local grocery store to remedy the problem.The bottom line is... This product does produce great coffee. However, it is not meant for the office; it is for home or light use ONLY folks. Also, DO NOT grind oil-rich coffee beans unless you have the time and money to keep sending it back to the manufacturer for repairs.
My wife and I enjoy strong coffee (espresso roast) and the Capresso seemed to be a great machine - for three months - and then it started clogging and clogging and ...Thought we just bought a bad unit and returned it for a new one.  Sadly the new unit suffered the exact same problem with the oily beans clogging up the chute.We now use the Krups gring/brew and it is worse!  At the end of the grind/brew cycle, the Krups emits steam (to cleanse the machine.)  The steam ends up running down the sides of the machine and all over the counter.  Needless to say we are still looking for a &quot;bulletproof&quot; grind/brew coffeemaker.Based on my homework - people who enjoy really strong coffee seem to suffer our same fate.  We continue to look.
I wanted to love this machine.  We had it two years and it made a great cup of coffee.  But, the burr grinder jams on hard beans.  Twice it did that, and we had to send it to Capresso for repairs, at $45.00 per event, = $90.00.Then, a couple weeks ago the grinder started grinding at odd times, on its own.  The only way to stop it was to unplug the machine. Capresso said to leave it unplugged and the electronics might reset themselves.  Seemed to fix it, but only for a day.  Then, it started grinding again, in the middle of the night.  I feared it might overheat and start a fire.  Capresso said to send it to them again, for another $45.00.  Well, that's 3 times and enough.Then we discovered the Miletta Mill and Brew ($89.00).  Only had it a week now, but we are pleasantly surprised that the coffee is just as good tasting as we had with the Capresso, PLUS, the two most irritating features of the Capresso are absent in the Miletta:  no coffee &quot;dust&quot; on the body of the machine and counter top after grinding, and no dripping carafe.  We used to always have paper towels under the Capresso and on the counter to catch the dust and drips.  NONE OF THAT WITH THE MILETTA!The Miletta grinder is a blade, inside the bean basket, the same one the water runs through.  Clever.  You therefore don't have a problem with oily beans clogging the chute...there is no chute.  The noise of the grinder is about half that of the Capresso. It's &quot;footprint&quot; on the counter is about a third smaller than the Capresso, too.We'll see what happens over time.  For now, we're somewhat sad to see the old Capresso go to the junk yard, but the new Miletta is quickly diminishing our grief and then some.
As most have said, this Taylor thermometer unit itself is great.  It does what everyone says and will last forever.  The problem is the inferior probe. The probe can't handle high heat or being washed in any way and will break down after only a year or two. The $16 thermometer has $13 replacement probes??!!  What a waste of money and more junk in our landfills.  Shame on you Taylor.  They know this is a problem, the reviews go back many years of consumers all saying the same thing.
I purchased this thermometer for homebrewing. The relationship started off well, but soon the bottom fell out and I find myself in the market for a better model. Taylor is touchy, fussy, inaccurate, and not always willing to show you what you want to see: the current accurate temperature. For the short time we were together and things were working out, it really was nice, but it faded so quickly.
I used this a handful of times on both in the oven and on my gas grill. It has all the features I want, but like many other reviewers...my probe fried itself and now doesn't work anymore. :(The magic number seems to be 350 degrees.Another customer says you can buy replacement probes for $5 from Taylor directly.I wouldn't recommend this product. Frying at 350 is just unacceptable.
The probe broke after 2 months of use.  I used the thermometer about 3x per week.  A replacement probe is about $8, which is half the cost of the original thermometer.
I owned my Pyrex digital thermometer for years, but when I was brand new to grilling, I learned the hard way that you can't leave the thermometer in the grill with the lid closed like you do the oven (Duh, so obvious to me now)... Sooo, I replaced my melted thermometer with this Taylor 1470 digital thermometer. One year and one month after purchasing, with gentle/light use (and no grill use, period, hehe), it died on me. I am VERY upset that I've barely used this and now it's junk. I would go back to Pyrex, but I don't see them for sale anymore, so the hunt for a quality oven thermometer continues...
Another piece of short-lived Chinese crapola. I've had 3 of these in a little over a year. The first one lasted 3 grillings; the 2nd one-- which Amazon replaced free (wtg,Amazon!) melted; the 3rd one sits beside me now as useless as a clown hat on George W Bush.I'd give it one star except that it worked beautifully the 7 or 8 times in worked at all.In short, if you want China to own a little more of the USA, and you don't mind spending $2 every time you want to check the temp on your meat, then buy one of these. Otherwise, tell Beijing their Taylor 1470 sucks by not supporting them any longer.
i want to buy one of these but  am disappointed by reviews on this Taylor and Polder!! how is a person to decide??? does anyone else have a recommendation???
I am on my third unit for this digital thermometer. The first one I had, my kids lost the unit and I could not find it anywhere. I had the first one for well over a year with no problems.I bought another unit to replace the lost one. I noticed the cord on the probe was different. The first one was a metal wire, the second one had gray insulation around it. The 2nd unit bit the dust in about 2 months. I just bought my third, hoping the 2nd one was a fluke. Nope. The third one worked ONCE and that is it.I am tired of this brand and will be looking for another.
I have purchased 2 of these units over the last year... Both have shorted out (I believe due to the aforementioned temperature issues).  If the probe touches the grill or oven grate, see you later.  They are fantastic when working, I just wish they could make them with some sort of circut breaker.
This worked as promised, but only for a short period of time.  After several uses, the probe failed and replacement probes are not available.
worked for about a month before it started to think room temp was 100f, and recalibrating wouldn't work.  Has a nice probe and timer/temp monitoring features but their useless if the thing cant accurately tell temp.  Cooper Atkins is a munch better brand.
Had high hopes for this cheap thermometer, but after about 6 months of use and probably 20 actual uses, this temp probe stopped being accurate. This apparently just can't stand up to the obvious high temps that will be seen when grilling meats. If this probe is used solely in an oven, it should be fine.
I picked one of these up last Thanksgiving for the turkey and it worked wonderfully.  It responded so fast that it I was able to use it almost like I would an instant read.  And, unlike the Polder probe thermometers, there is an on-off switch you can use on this unit.The bad news is that while it still works wonderfully as a probe thermometer, it is useless as a timer because it no longer can make any sounds.  I use it solely as a back-up to my new Polder at this point, using it when I'm making two roasts at once or need to monitor two temperatures separately (such as white and dark meat of fowl).If you don't plan to use it too often or only need it for the big holiday meals, it's worth saving a few bucks and choosing the Taylor.  However, if you have need of a high-quality probe thermometer for long-term use, go with a different brand.
I've owned at least 3 of these and in every single case, the sensor gives out after some period of time.  Just tonight I tried to use the thermometer and when I turned it on, the temperature reading was 127 degrees.  That's BEFORE I inserted it into the food.  Other eviews state they have the same problem.  Be very careful of this one.  You could easily ruin a dinner.
bought this for our restaurant since I didnt want employees using my expensive one, and the manual dias take so long to register a temp. Worked well at first, but its stuck on a set desired temp and we can't get it off. Also, after a couple of weeks of use the cord has gotten a short in it- you have to jiggle it a lot. In fairness I will add that we use it over an open flame broiler,so maybe thats too much for the cord.
This was great when it worked. Stick the probe in the meat, put in the oven, set the alarm temperature, and a few minutes later I would hear a beep. Take the food out, perfect.Unfortunately this lasted a very short while, in the neighborhood of a month.Too expensive to replace this item or the probes monthly.
This is my second digital timer/thermometer. The first was a Ploder and the probe died after a couple of years. This product arrived with a broken button, so I can't adjust the timer or temperature. I'm admittedly too lazy to return it, so I'll use it as a digital thermometer without the alarm or timer. Reading the other reviews on Amazon for both this product and the Ploder begs the question: why doesn't someone make a quality digital thermometer/timer?
Owned for a year or so, used it maybe 10 or 15 times, stopped working. I changed the batteries, and I'm not sure what else I could have done. The readout went all wonky and that was that. DO NOT recommend.
Worked once just like I wanted it to, but the second time it only registed HI. I could get it to work for a second or two by moving the cord which leads me to believe the preoblem is with the probe and wire but a replacement cost the same as the complete unit.
I got this thermometer right before Thanksgiving to use on our turkey.  The ON/OFF switch on the unit broke the second time I turned it on.  As the unit was stuck in the "ON" position I used it on the Turkey and it seemed to work fine, but the quality of the unit is not great and I would not expect it to last.  I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement unit, so I'll see if it holds up.
Nice, inexpensive and compact. The hinge for the screen only has two options. One is too far down to see, the other two far up.That's not the real issue though.I used this on my propane grill (which was why I bought it) and it burned through the probe wire in a matter of minutes. It is still hanging on, but another couple of tenderloins and this is going to be done.Rather than bother with replacement probes, I'm just going to get a more durable model.This is probably good for oven usage.
While admittedly this worked for months, suddenly it became a pile of junk. Turned it on one day and the display went haywire. Every segment of the LCD display was activated but many of the individual ones were unlit. Changed batteries, same deal.Should have known that buying ANYTHING these days made in China is an exercise in foolishness destined to lead to a non working product.
I used this thermometer maybe two dozen times.  It appeared to work well while it was working. I am a fussy cook and followed the Taylor's instructions.  It now reads "hi" no matter what I probe.  I cannot recommend this thermometer given its short life.
The probe may last 1 cooking session or 3 years.  I've been through 5 of them and finally asked the manufacturer why they keep going bad.  Apparently you're not supposed to use the probes in a bbq or smoker.
I have an older model that had lasted about 5 years, but the new replacement I bought only lasted 8 months. Very disappointed
I purchased this product to use while cooking.  Out of the box it failed to give me a proper reading and displayed about 30 degrees hotter than the soup.  I would not recommend this product.
Used only two times and it stopped working. I'm gonna buy another probe and give it a second chance, but I'm not very confident...
It works, and its temperature reading is accurate.  BUT, there are no presets.  That would be ok, but setting it manually requires that you press the key tens of times to change the temperature.  It does not even have the feature of &#34;keep pressing&#34; for quick increment/decrement.  It does not remember old setting either. So, each time i use it , i had to press the button like a hundred times to change the temperature.  We ended up discarding it after a few weeks.  Just too frustrating.
This item broke a few days outside of the Amazon return window even though we carefully followed directions for use. It was extremely difficult to return and took forever to get a replacement. (I had to write an actual written, paper and pen, letter before I could get a response. They ignored my emails and phone messages.) That being said the replacement is working fine.
I bought this alarm at the same time that I bought a Thermoworks one for about the same price. I found that the Thermoworks version was more accurate and more reliable. Now the Taylor alarm has stopped working because the control buttons do not respond any more. Don't bother to buy this.
I ordered this Thanksgiving of 2011 and for the first use it was great. But I tried to use it this past Saturday and the probe exploded off the wire in my turkey, the product is now useless and to get a replacement probe it costs just as much to just buy a whole new unit. It made a LOUD SSSPOP! noise, I thought my oven had exploded! almost gave me a heart attack! Useless, dont waist your money.
From the other reviews, I guess I was lucky to get 6 months out of my probe before it broke.  Taylor will send me one free replacement -- in 2 months.  While the remote feature is nice, most of the time I just need an instant read thermometer, so I'm going to get one of the digital instant read stick thermometers that Cook's Illustrated recommends.  I'll save my remote probe thermometer for the times when I really need to have constant real-time temperature monitoring.
This thermometer worked flawlessly for the first 3 months, then the probe broke. Don't ask me how it broke because I cannot see inside the metal do-hicky. A replacement probe is $10-15 provided you can find one.It seems all these units have problems with the probes. Well, enough for me. I'll go back to my traditional thermometer.
Up/down settings stopped working. Can only reset using down arrow. Questionable temp. accuracy. Battery doe's last along time. Alarm is okay.
I've owned three Taylor 1470s. I picked the first one up around Thanksgiving of 2010, and cooked with it for about 6 months. It had all the features I was looking for; a long, flexible cable; timer or temperature alarms; and a magnetic back. I figured that even though it wasn't much of a looker, it would do just fine.Six months later, the probe stopped reading. The current temperature display would read "Lo" unless I had the cable's connector positioned *just right*. It was frustrating, but not the end of the world. Within two months, getting used no more than once a week, the thing stopped reading entirely. I trashed it, and picked up a replacement 1470 at Target. Three months later, the same thing happened. I trashed it again, and bought an OXO which my Mom decided would work great at her house, so away it went.I was back at Target a couple weeks ago, and picked up a third 1470 for some stupid reason. Three weeks(!!) later, and I'm seeing the same symptoms. This thing sucks.
The base unit is a fine thing, simple and easy to use, but (and I'm obviously not the first person to make this point) the probe is hopelessly fragile and the guarantee is gutless.  When I first received one of these as a gift, it came with a supposed "lifetime guarantee."  The first time it started malfunctioning I didn't realize the probe was at fault and I sent the whole thing back (postage at my expense), and received a replacement promptly.  The second time it happened it was obvious that the probe was at fault, so I called Taylor rather than mailing it in and was told that the first replacement probe would be free but they would cost $5 each thereafter.  Already the "lifetime guarantee" was being undermined.  The third time it failed I mailed the whole unit back to Taylor because I wasn't willing to pay their $5 for just the probe.  Again, they replaced the whole thermometer, but the new unit carries only a one year limited warranty.  At thie point, more has been spent on postage for replacing faulty probes than was spent to buy the unit in the first place, and the original "lifetime" warranty has been effectively erased.  On average, each probe has lasted for less than a year of occasional use.  I would not buy one of these again.
Seemed like a solid purchase at first but after two uses the temperature is wacked by 30-60F and seems to be getting worse. Gave it another try this weekend for a 2.5 lb roast, after 75 minutes in a 350F oven the Taylor registered 57F but was actually done to 140F by measurement of my 20 year old dial thermometer. I will let you know if Taylor will stand behind their product which is only 5 months old.
This thermometer worked awesomely for about 6 months (used about once per month). Then, as another reviewer has mentioned, the temp reading stuck on the reading "Hi". It doesn't work anymore, even if I jiggle the cord like the other reviewer suggested. I tried changing battery, but no luck. And, to make matters worse, I can't find warranty information on Amazon (of course, I don't have the packaging anymore).Nicely designed item, poor durability.
Breaks very quickly. I don't understand a gadget like this that stops working after a few months.  What gives with that?
I have had this thermometer for a little over a year.  I really liked the temperature alert, and the fact that I can also use it as a timer.  It was  been working great until one day when it inexplicably decided that room temperature is 146 degrees.  so now it's useless for me, and I'll be shopping for a different thermometer in the future.
Ours caused trouble for the entire year we used it before it finally failed. It would randomly flip to Celsius, the temperature alarm never worked, it would sometimes reset itself for no apparent reason, and the on/off switch didn't work reliably.After a year of dodgy performance, it insisted that a piece of meat out of the refrigerator was 80. We tried replacing the battery, resetting it, etc. After 20 minutes of tinkering with it, we gave up.The only reason I didn't give it one star was I was able to use it for a year, but it really is a piece of junk. There are much better options out there.
Bought this thermometer in June and it broke by December.  The display will not function.We did use this once a week, every week, but I didn't expect it to break in 6 months.  Two stars for making it 6 months for the price.
Worried about covering of wire. may burn if touches grill. Had another thermometer that had wire only. Could get very hot/
I keep buying these because they're the only ones I can find in my neighborhood, and I do wish to keep a constant eye on the temperature of food when it's in my oven. But the probes are prone to shorting out and have never failed to malfunction, sometimes after a year, sometimes after a few months.  I can find no customer service contact information on the package or the 'manual' that comes with the product. If I could, I would contact the company to ask them to replace the probe.  Since the probe goes out without warning, one can never be sure of the actual temperature of the food, and that pretty much renders this item worthless.
I got this to replace a "pyrex" brand one that lasted about 10 years before finally succumbing to a fall.  On the plus side, the screen is large and easy to read, the buttons are easy to use, and the beep at the end of the timer is loud and persistent.  The problem?  With gentle usage and no significant mishaps (i.e. I never dropped it into molten candy or the sink etc), the "start / stop" button has completely ceased to function.  Great.  So - lovely machine, but not if you want something that's actually useful for more than a year.
I had this for about a year then it stopped reading temps properly, shortly thereafter it died altogether. I liked it while it worked...hence the second star.
The thermometer on this device wears out quickly and you cannot fully submerge the 'dipstick'.  I would warn against this for brewing applications.  I thought it would be good for mashtun and lauter tun temperature monitoring, but it did not work out.  After being submerged once in the mash, the temperature readings were all way off and I found myself doing too much math to know what the real temperature was.  Wanted something quick and easy, and this was not it.Might work better in basic cooking applications though, but couldn't say.  A thermometer that you can't get wet is pretty useless to me.
The thermometer worked great for about a year and I was careful not to let it stay in the oven above 392 degrees, as the instructions stated. Lately the temperature has been jumping around: 250 degrees, then 310, then 180, all in in the space of a few seconds, so I assume the probe has malfunctioned.  In the end I'd say that I got my money's worth since it lasted a year and I used it and the timer at almost every meal. But I'm going to look for better quality for my next purchase. The only question is, is there anything better made out there?
I bought 2 of these to make beer.  It varies widely from my glass thermometer making it useless for this application.
Was happy that it worked ...but then it died. Not happy...Will see to return it. Have bought a standard temp probe without cord
I've used three of these for homebrewing and if the sensor even goes anywhere near a flame or over boiling temperature it dies and never gives a good reading afterwards.
As others have, my probes seem to melt and stop working after several uses.  I had one last about a year and another last six months.  Annoying.
Very handy item, but not very durable.  I use it for low 'n slow BBQ cooking at approximately 230F. I wrapped my probe lead with aluminum foil to help protect it, but after 5 uses the probe cable had become brittle and snapped at the probe, so splicing was not an option.  I suppose it will make a nice refrigerator timer.  Unfortunately, it snapped just as I put 16 lbs. of pork shoulders in the Egg.  I'm going to try a Polder with a metal braid probe cable rated for a higher cable temp.
I bought one of these a long time back because Alton Brown said it was the best multifunction thing around.  I used the old one for Thanksgiving turkeys, steaks, chickens, pork roast and even cooking oil for frying.  The cord on the thermometer is plastic coated and doesn't look like it could withstand high temperatures.  It wouldn't even register a reading most of the time.  We made a hybrid taking the thermometer out of our old unit and plugging it into this guy.
Had this for 4 months before it stopped working.  Changed the batteries, changed the probe - still doesn't work.  I agree with other reviewers:  it's too expensive for a disposable thermometer.  Great idea, but poor execution.
Shoty Quality Control it was off by 20 degrees wrecked a10 gallon batch of beer.  Otherwise it was a nice idea
It worked great for about five or six times then it would max out the temp every time you plugged in the cable. after going on google and searching this problem I found out this quite common problem for this product and all you can do is replace the temp cable so if you are alright with that it works great.
The Taylor cooking thermometer worked great for about two years then one day I stuck it in my chicken and it read (LO) which ment it was below 32 degree. But I knew my chicken we about 150 degree. I tried and tried it again and again, Even changed the batteries but it still would not read right. Now it is in the garbage. Just more garbage made in china that never lasts like it should. They make these products in other country's to save money and take jobs from Americans. Oh yeah they save money but we don't. Not in the long run. We have to buy more stuff more often because it does not last long. I'm sure making this product would not pay alot but having a job is better then no job at all. I think this product would of lasted about 10 to 15 years if it was make in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. And not in china.
After my first try using the thermometer in the bbq, I now have a sensor that reads HI, then jumps to 200F, then to 70-something and back again to HI. If you twist the cable juuuuuuust right, you can get an acurate reading. Now I'm surfing looking for a replacement sensor.
I sent it back because it was inaccurate.  Boiling water only registered 198 degrees F instead of 212 as it should have.
At first I loved this product. It worked great, was easy to use, met every expectation. Until I had it for about 4 months and all of a sudden the reading was like 30-40 degrees or more off at room temperature. It read around 108F in a room that was about 72F. Makes me sad because I liked the damn thing.I realized the issue when I was cooling a yeast starter (I homebrew beer) and the temp would not go down.. It seemed to get stuck at 85F... well... I finally gave up, took the probe out and it showed over 100F in open air. I measured with another thermometer and my starter was down below 55F... Had to heat it back up. I can only imagine the disaster my brew session would have been tomorrow if I had measured a mash with this thing. My batch would have been completely ruined.I gave it the 2 stars because I really think a product should work longer than this. I did not do anything outrageous with it. I did use it to measure oil temperature but that was only up to 290F... it is supposed to be good up to 390F I believe. No good reason to have broken.I recommend trying a different manufacturer for this if possible.
First, when you use the temperature probe, the meat temperature shows on the display. Also, it is very easy to set the temperature alarm. However, there is a small switch that must be turned on to activate the alarm. Good for one burned roast. Granted, a mistake you will only make once.Second, when the timer gets to zero, the alarm sounds, and the timer switches to an elapsed timer. A very nice feature. However, there is no way to shut off the alarm without stopping the timer. It will eventually shut off after one ear-splitting minute.Otherwise, it works.
The unit arrived seemingly undamaged and in a timely manner.  It looks and operates as described.  The timer function is easy to read, has a good loud alarm, and is accurate.  The thermometer, however, does not gauge temperature accurately.  When placed in a still very cold turkey, it registers at 97 degrees F.  Placed in a cup of cold water, it registers at 89 degrees.  Holding it in the air, in my home, it registers over 95 degrees (it's not anywhere near that warm in my home).  Tested the probe in a cup of hot water against three other thermometers (a glass candy thermometer, a pyrex analog probe, and the Taylor digital pen thermometer (model # 9842)).  Three of the thermometers agreed on the hot water temp, the Taylor 1470 read 15-22 degrees high.  As far as I can find on the internet, there is no way to calibrate this thermometer.  I was disappointed and will be getting rid of this item.  I should not have to double check the accuracy of a digital thermometer with a 2nd thermometer.  I'll be sticking w/ my Taylor 9842.
Life of the probe is too short for the thermometer to be worthwhile.  They should sell it with a few replacement probes or fix the problem.Sad situation because device worked well while it was alive.
Our old Taylor digital cooking thermometer/timer finally died, having been dropped once to often. It had lasted us a good many years, and the combined features of having a temperature probe and a timer just made sense. This was the only model like this we could find, and we loved our old one.But, someone decided to save the company some money and cheap out on the temperature probe. The old one was made with a metal cord that you could close the over door on and have the main unit by the oven, and could withstand temps up to 500 degrees in the oven. The new temperature probe's cord is made of plastic or teflon and is only rated to 292 degrees, which is NOT in the online description. (Who the hell only cooks to that temperature, anyway?) We tried to use our old probe, but it didn't work properly with the new unit and we overcooked a fantastic cut of meat.Also cheap: the glue holding the magnets to the back of the unit. We had this for less than a month before both magnets came off. Our old unit was in use for six years without having that happen even once.The timer does work fine, but I wouldn't recommend this product for people who really like to cook and depend on a good quality product.We are looking for a replacement.
It lasted about a year, then the timer stopped working.  Then another few months and the temperature reading also stopped working.
This product is poorly made and I suggest you do not purchase it. Mine broke after just 6 months of use. I returned it to the manufacturer since it comes with a 1-year warranty and they sent me a new one. Only 5 months later, the new thermometer has broken in a different way. This time the sound stopped working completely, which is extremely dangerous since a key feature is that it beeps to alert you that your food has reached a certain temperature and I was using it on the stovetop when it broke. This defect could easily have resulted in a fire.
I have one of these thermometers.  They should theoretically work well, and mine did for a brief amount of time.  This was nice because it would do candy, meat, chocolate and more.  Well after about six months of heavy use its primary function now is a timer.  Which isn't exactly useful since the stove comes with one.  This has an attractive price, and is much cheaper than Pampered Chef's very similar one, but it just doesn't last for long with heavy use.  This might be the ideal purchase if you aren't going to use this too often.  I seriously doubt it will outlive the battery you place inside of this.
I really loved the accuracy and convenience and price of this unit, but I cannot recommend it since the probes last such a short time. I have owned mine for about a year, but I only use it for roasts and turkeys, so it's only been used about 6 times. Now the cord has come out of the probe (in spite of gentle use) and I cannot locate a replacement. Silly to have to replace the entire unit. Even at their low price, it's kinda dumb that the probe doesn't outlast the battery!
I am on-line buying another probe - this has gotten to be quite a pisser!I really like the thermometer/timer but I am really tired of having to buy a new probe every 3-4 months.Taylor - take note and beef up your probes
When it works, it is good. But, the probe cable was broken after several months of light use. This was the second digital oven thermometer I bought, and both of them died the same way. No more cable-bound probes and no more of these thermometers. Stick to the dials that you stick in the food.
I purchased this in a brick/mortar store, not amazon, and thought I'd do a quick review because I am shopping for a new digital thermometer to replace this one.  It is a great idea, and worked good for a very short time.  You are supposed to be able to put the probe in then close the oven door or grill cover and view the internal temp of the meat as it cooks.  First, the grill lid "broke" the vinyl cover over on the cord - just separated in a perfect circle.  So then I just made sure to push the two plastic sleeve portions together  before using it and didn't leave it inside the grill cover (put the probe in and out). Shortly after that I was removing it from the chicken to close the lid and slipped from holding the end of the probe to the vinyl/plastic covered cord and the cord pulled right out of the metal probe. So, while I am looking for a similarly functioning thermometer, I won't be purchasing another one of these.  Too bad they don't sell replacement probes, since these don't last.
I'm not sure it ever really worked. I had trouble maintaining the proper temp when making Belgian candi sugar, so I checked the calibration with ice slurry as suggested by manufacturer. It read 59 degrees!!! Not sure how to calibrate. Directions don't say if I can calibrate. Manufacturer not answering or returning calls. I WILL NOT buy anything else from Taylor.
Purchased the thermometer/timer to replace our previous thermometer. I thought the probe had gone bad but decided to go with this lower priced therm/timer as a replacement. It worked okay for a few months. The default temperature was set at 122 degrees and would always beep like crazy when I turned it on. We started using the timer as a "time-out" timer but this feature only lasted for a couple weeks (used about once a day) and then the buttons to set the timer and start/stop quit working. Now we use the probe in our other thermometer (that we bought from Walmart) and it works great!
Had this product for about 2 years. The timer function is not working anymore. Thermometer does not seems to be very accurate.
The Problem is I don't know if it's the Probe or the Meter. May Meter was working fine when I damaged the probe. ( have two meter sets) I bought the two new metal clad probes now neither of the meters function. They power up but when the probes are plugged in the meter reads 141 deg without inserting it into anything. Is there a calabration that needs to be performed?
I've had three of these, and now own none.  The first became erratic and untrustworthy; I complained to the manufacturer and they replaced it.  The second worked for a while, then it, too, failed.  Of course, it failed in the middle of a complex dinner when I was depending on the thermometer for an accurate reading.  After several years, thinking that the technology might have improved, I bought a third.  It lasted for two months, during which I used it about three times, then it failed.  I returned it for credit.It seems like a good idea, and is useful when it works.  The technology, it seems, is not up to the promise.
Really liked the features of this unit, had the exact features I needed. Then it stopped working. Just said &#34;Lo&#34; on the temp readout. Contacted the manufacturer and they immediately sent a new probe. Great customer service. But then that probe failed, too. And the next replacement probe failed.  Everytime I called they sent another probe without flinching. Great customer service plus Crap device still equals disappointed customer.Not recommended.
I got this product a couple of days ago.  I was really depending on the measurements listed in the product description being accurate.  The ACTUAL product dimensions are: 4 x 4 x 1 inches.  Compare this to the dimensions listed on Amazon.com: "Product Dimensions: 7.3 x 5.1 x 1.7 inches ; 1.6 ounces".  Even the piece of cardboard it was wired to wasn't that big.  What's the problem?  Is someone is China trying to convert from 2.54cm to one inch?  Is conversion too hard?  Is the product packaging also too hard to measure?  Well sorry, but my kid's preschool class is really going to have some small gingerbread men for our holiday party.  Arg...  [...]
I agree that this is probably a good set for college students sharing an apartment. Light-duty, dishwasher-safe. For someone who does a lot of cooking the low-end Farberware is basically junk, cheaply made stamped knives. For affordable good stamped knives, the Farberware Professional series is a better buy.
I really wanted this to work but what I found is the vacuum is 50/50. I wipe down the inner rubber washer & the lip of the container & it's still hit or miss. Pricey for an iffy product; I'll search for better vacuum sealed container.
The egg cups are pretty funky looking but kinda cool I guess if you like the plastic look.  The egg timer ticked but didn't make any noise when it got to no time left which seems a little pointless.
I don't care for this item.  It's a nice tool, but it's too difficult for me to use!
I bought this and when it arrived the stand part was broken....They sent me a new one a few months later it broke too...I wanted to like this Wok...but its like most other electric ones I have bought...They dont get hot enough to realy stir fry...you end up steaming everything...If you like steamed food and veggies it fine for that....but not a real stir fry...I bought this because my gas stove wouldnt get hot enough to stir fry....this was worse...I wok outside now on a big side burner on my Weber grill...use a very old and seasoned carbon steel wok....they have used these and cast iron ones for 1000's of  years....nothing to this day is better...Big John
We have owned this item for over 3 years.  It still works but has been a disappointment.  Occasionally one of the levers will not stay down.  It doesnt toast evenly - no matter what you are toasting.  Im not impressed, and if I had it to over again, I would buy something different.
I guess I was lucky, I made it 1 and half years before my left lever decided to stop gong down. While I thought it was slow, I was always happy with the results. I never burned anything using this toaster. After looking into getting it repaired I think it would be easier and probably cheaper to just get a new toaster. Having the lever for the left side stop working seems to be a recurring theme with this toaster.I can forgive finicky darkness settings or bagle and frozen settings that do not seem to work to my satisfaction, as I may have unreal expectations, but the flaw in the design of the up and down levers is not excusable. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to design the up and down locking mechanism and when you think about it, toasters have been around for 100 yrs. Why would you design something new when there are proven designs that have worked for a century.Heck, I can't even open the darn thing to see if I can figure ou what the problem is. All the parts interlock. I'm afraid if I yank off some of the plactic parts they will never go back on.I do not recommend this toaster.
We purchased this but it is not exactly what we thought.  It's okay but a knife works just as good.
It is obviously too much to ask to find a toaster that lasts!  I have been through several with this being the latest.  The heat setting is stuck and cannot be adjusted.  The handle fell off.  Small appliances used to be built to last.  My grandmother has had her toaster for YEARS!  This started having problems after 6 months!  Beware.  Look for a better model.
This item is metal and looks like an old fashioned ice crusher, but it is so small that it is useless. Its only 9 inches tall, so if you are expecting a nice big heavy duty machine, forget it. I bought it because I missed the ice in the door of my old fridge, but after trying it several times, I sent it back. It is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter. I dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it, so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it. I takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup, and about 2 cups to fill a glass. You need 4 hands to operate it: 1 to hold the lid, 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place, and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place  (it slides out and then the ice lands on the base). Then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice, you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass. I broke the glass the first time i tried it. It hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear, making it even more wobbly. But as I said in the begging, it IS cute.
Does not do the job. I wanted crisp bottom to the pizza. I have a elect stove, is that why it does not work?
Spread flour on the pan and it comes out the holes onto the counter.  The pizza dough will stick to the pan.  Hard to serve and even harder to clean.  Using a cookie sheet is a much better proposition.
This was going to replace a pizza stone but with the metal pan the center of the pizza does not cook along with the outer edges so the outside is burned while a 3-4" diameter center section is still soggy. I tossed it out and went back to using the stone.
These are really nice - substantial weight, classic design, functional.  The white is a slightly blue-ish white - not at all creamy (if you've been looking at a lot of white dishes you'll appreciate the distinction).  The problem is that the manufacturer or distributor doesn't pack them with enough care.  I ordered two sets to try them out before putting them on my wedding registry. Both arrived with broken bowls.  Then I ordered replacements and one of those arrived broken.  So, after calculating that I'd have to field up to 32 boxes to get 8 intact place settings, I gave up.  Fortunately Amazon is very good about returns for broken merchandise...
I did love my intelliblend.  It is the only blender that crushes ice for smoothies or frozen drinks like a bar does.  However, I've used it maybe 20 times over the last 2 or 3 years.  Just like everyone else, the plastic teeth broke off the bottom. I cannot find the company to replace the part.  I'll probably have to get a new blender.  Great blender, but don't waste your time.  It's not worth all the effort for a 50 cent part!!!
my blender lasted about a year before the teeth on the bottom of the blender broke.  i've been trying to get a replacement for over 6 months now with no response from the company.  the piece must cost less than $1.  i told them i'd pay $10 and i still don't get a response.  i bought a new blender to replace it.
Filters were acting clogged after 30 days, had to replace 3 in a short time, one within days. Used store bought and did not have this problem.
better systems out there now. these filters don't remove all the nasties i thought they did (like giardia and other microbes). and then they just stop filtering. that means it's time to replace it. i suppose the filters last enough time, but there are better, more thorough filtration systems on the market now. we'll be moving to a new kind of system once these filters are used up.
I switched from Brita to PUR as the water tasted way better and I enioyed drinking it more.However the quality of the water filter has dropped after I switched to my new three pack.After drinking PUR for 2 years, I am very disappointed that I'll have to find a new brand (yet again)!
I have been using these filters for about a year now and never noticed the filters being wet in their packaging before today.  Today I opened a package and the filter was wet inside the package.  I asked my daughter, who uses them also, about it and she said that the filters have been wet upon opening for her several times before now.  Unfortunately, it is too late for me to exchange my package for a new one, so now I either have to use an old filter or one that has been wet inside its' packaging for several months, which is unsanitary and invites bacteria.  I am NOT happy.
I have only used the first filter of three,  but my water is tasting awful.  It was fine for the two months I used the original filter that came with the pitcher,  but after I swapped in a new filter, following the pre-soaking procedure,  it tastes bad.  I assume it is due to the filter, but I am going to pitch this one and try the next in the package.  Not happy with these so far,  though pleased with Amazon as always.
like most people shopping for PUR water pitcher pitchers, i was looking for those with the u-ring monitor on top. well, these guys finally fixed the picture associated with it with the correct one, but this wasn't the case when i purchased mine. because they fixed it, i gave them an extra star.the bad thing was, when i got the items, one of the boxes was completely opened, with two of the individual filters also opened inside the box! so i returned everything, even though i ended up paying for shipping myself. however, they did refund my purchase price including shipping when they first sent out the item.while the product description was confusing and the item was totally opened (and not just dented), i decided to give it 2 stars since they seem to be a nice store. btw, PUR stopped making those u-ring monitored filters in june 2006 or something.
I have been using the 950Z filters for the past 3 years or so with my PUR 18 cup pitcher. These filters start to clog up (all of the water does not flog from the top reservoir to the bottom reservoir) after only 25-50% of the rated usage. Really disappointed, not sure if this only with this supply , I never had issue when bough from Lows or Target.
I have bought a pack of filter and did not work. I asked for a replacement and Amazon did send another order, but I still see the water filter does not work properly. Looks like there is a problem with the filters.
This filter does make a difference in the taste and smell of water. However this is one major problem which I am not sure about the exact reason. The filtration speed usually drops significantly after using it for a few weeks, long before the recommended time to replace the filter. The filter can be taken out and shaken a little bit, to make the filtration speed back to normal for another week. But I do not know if this is the intended way to handle this problem, or I should just replace the filter.
My tap water falls into the normal range for tap water in the U.S. and I'm barely getting 20 gallons to a filter. I've owned the pur water dispenser for about 3 years and it seems like the filter replacements are getting worse.  It's obvious they're shortening the life of filters to get you to buy more. I'm now in the process of looking for something new.
I've been very satisfied with the Pur filters for several years. Replacement filters at Menards and Amazon were close to the same price, so I'd alternate between the two, depending on what was most convenient.  Then things went wonky a few months ago and I was replacing the filter twice as often as I had been.  I thought it must be our well water, though I had no clue why, until I read reviews on Amazon of other customers having the same experience.  So filters that had previously lasted approximately 3 and 1/2 to 4 weeks now needed to be replaced in 2 weeks or even less.  Then for the first time our local Menards wasn't carrying the three-pack of Pur filters any more.  I don't know if they were temporarily out of stock or Menards quit carrying them but for convenience sake,  I switched to ordering exclusively from Amazon and experienced the same short-life.The bottom line is I am replacing these Pur filters twice as often as I used to so now I'm looking for something better.  When I find it I will update this review.Update:  January 28, 2014I purchased a Clear2o pitcher from Amazon.  It's sturdier than the Pur pitcher, holds twice as much water, and has a hose that attaches to your faucet, forcing the water through the filter and filling it in under a minute.  It also promises vastly more refills before requiring the filter to be replaced.  I only gave it 3 stars because the filtered water didn't taste as "crisp" and it left a harmless but oily residue known as tea scum when I brewed tea.  But, after approximately 20 refills, it no longer leaves the tea so, I may upgrade it to 3 1/2 stars.  Because of the tea scum, I ordered a Brita 5 cup slim pitcher to use exclusively for tea.  (I had no idea the problem would resolve itself when the Clear 2o filter contained more sediment from my hard water.  At least, I think that's what happened, since I haven't changed anything else.)  The Brita water tastes better and leaves no tea scum from the first use.  I'll give it 4 stars when I write that review.Conclusion:  If the Clear 2o filter lasts a reasonable while, I'll probably order a refill filter, knowing I'll need to use the Brita for making tea for the first few weeks.  I haven't found the ideal pitcher filtration system yet.
As many others have mentioned, this new filter model replaces the original, which had bright orange indicators to allow consumers to track the filter's usage.  The new model is supposed to be disposed of every two months like clockwork, whether or not it's exhausted.The problem with that?  Not all of us use Pur's average of 20 gallons a month.  My average is closer to 8-9 gallons a month.  So the bottom line for me is that I'm now expected to pay more than double what I used to for these filters!  That's ridiculous.As for the quality, I'm not that impressed.  I have no idea whether the filters truly do their job or not.  I live in a city with highly chlorinated water, and I can tell you that the chlorine taste is very much present after filtration, so I can only hope that the filter is working properly otherwise.I hope that Pur will listen to the consumers' wishes and reinstate the original filter design.  This obvious ploy to indirectly double their revenue does not sit well with me.
The only work properly for about two weeks then they get super slow. Very poor value for the money. I will be switching to another brand.
These filters only filter out heavy metals and chlorine. Not flouride. That's unfortunate because flouride is toxic.
i was surprised to see the price as $19.99 for Pur water pitcher filters since the regular price for these at Walmart is $15.00
Just as others have been noting, this filter barely lasted 2 weeks, and now it's taking forever to filter water.  Previous filters (purchased from target) lasted months.
It doesn't remove chlorine (just the taste and smell -- see updated package), neither does it remove flouride, which regardless of what you hear, has NEVER shown any positive benefit to being added to our water. It just makes heart patients unable to drink it safely. Unit price also has increased again and the product is disappearing from store shelves in 3-pack.Where can one get water that's just water?? In my opinion this filter is better than nothing, but still a far cry than bottled spring water. I want the chlorine and flouride out. If you want to do some interesting reading, do some responsible research on the web about flouride.
Original filter worked like a champ.  The replacement filters are slow and leave at least an inch of water in upper reservoir.  Confirming design issue that others have noted continues.Tapping the filter periodically seems to clear whatever obstruction is causing the slow filtering; however, you have to wonder if you are damaging the dynamics of the filtering process by banging the filter around.  Hopefully I am still getting the benefit of clean water and not flushing old contaminants after knocking it against a counter top.
The first filter that came with my new pitcher worked great. I bought a four pack replacement pack and the first time I changed the filter the water did not move completely through the filter. I had soaked and flushed filter just like recommended. Seems to be a common issue. Hope they fix this in the future. When the filter works it is great tasting water.
This filter is the worst one I have ever used! It only last about 3 weeks and then the filter stops filtering. I only use the water for drinking and make a couple cups of coffee. Terrible filter!
This Pur system is so slow.It takes 8 hours to filter one 7 cup pitcher.I have changed the cartridge twice thinking it was defective.Still so slowI had a brits before and did not encounter this problem.The water quality is good but the time it takes to get there is unacceptable
Unhappy that the product carries the number for our water dispenser, but does not fit.  The dome on top hits the water resevoir.  I modified the filter to work, but will not buy this product again.
Updated April 2008 -* Pro's - You can find them just about everywhere, it can compete with Brita.Filters are easy to load.Blue/Clear/Grey colored pitchers look nice and come in different sizes.* Con's - Filters are Over-Priced & Over-Marketed on how good they are!Filters do not PERFORM as marketed, especially in 'hard-water' area's!Filters have to be "prepped first", before you can use them properly, so make sure thatyou have a gallon of store-bought filtered H2O on-hand, to any prevent contamination.Filters ONLY do not last more than 20 days in Hard-Water area's.Filters no longer have the 'Use Indicator' on the top, I believe that Pur made this move,in order to spend less on the filters.Pitchers start looking "corroded" after 6-months of use.Customer Support is non-existent.First of all, we live in a "Hard-Water" environment and I'm talking about City water! This Pur 2 stage pitcher works fine & better than some of the other ones, and believe me we have used all of them.The MAIN PROBLEM that we have been experiencing is NOT so much with theplastic pitchers, but it's the Pur 2-stage FILTERS ... They don't work very well in 'hard-water area's' period!They Only last not more than 20 days for just common things like making coffee every am or filling up the tea kettle or for just making a pitcher of sun tea! It's ridiculous that these 'Plug-In type' of filters not only don't last the referenced 60 to 90 days as per literature, but it's only a Stage-2 water filter, instead of a Stage-3 or 4 even!And Yes, we have tried Brita & Honeywell too!We don't even use this water for drinking purposes, we all use bottled H20.For the high cost that we all pay per filter, we should be getting a better product, instead of one where PUR has been cutting corners.I have Contacted PUR corp multiple times all thru 2006 & 2007, and GUESS what Folks? Yep, they have NEVER responded to any of my inquiry's!!!!We would be interested to know if there are any Alternatives or solutionsthat someone else would like to recommend please!
When opened I found water inside the individual filter pouches. This makes me think it is used. In the past have bought many of these filters never had any issues of water inside the filter.
I don't know because the light doesn't work to let me know if it is doing what it is suppose to do.
Works for the first few days, then just stops filtering completely.  Seems like a lot of other reviewers have the same issue so chances are you would be throwing away money buying this product.  It's strange how the company wouldn't test such a simple thing?**Here's the Fix**a second 15 minute soak, shaking the filter underwater, and then tapping the filter against the sink while upright.This is to compact the contents of the filter and eliminate any air pockets trapped within the filter, which can prohibit water flow.  This should restore full performance to your filter.
I've been using this filter for years with no problem.  But I notice that right after the design change, the filters don't last like before.  The filter usually last a month to two but I went through 3 filters in last month.  I have 3 more filters left and if they don't last like they did before, I'm buying something else.
I was extremely disappointed with these pur filters for the water pitcher.  I flushed the filter per the instructions and was feeling set for some crisp clean water, but after my 1st attempt at refilling the pitcher, the water no longer made it to the reservoir. I knew that I took a chance after reading some of the others claiming their filters clogged and I agree with the others findings.  I plan to contact the company.
The filter that came with the pitcher lasted really long.The ones that I ordered later on needs to be replaced frequently.
I've been using my PUR water pitcher for about 5 years now, and wouldn't want to do without it.  The faucet water does not taste good and the filter pitcher removes every bit of taste plus the lime and other minerals.Thanks for continuing to offer these products - even if they are not available in local stores.  Using AMAZON to purchase was amazingly easy and fast with fast delivery.Gretchen Dickinson
First off, I want to thank all the reviewers for having called to our attention the missing monitor feature on the new version of this filter.Like many others, the advice of replacing the filter every "one or two months" is of little help--our use varies greatly. These filters are not cheap!I called P&G;: they say the monitor was often inaccurate so it was removed.  They stick to their "replace filter every one/two months." HOWEVER, they also say: "replace the filter when you notice it takes longer than usual to filter a pitcher's worth of water; the filter will not leach impurities, simply begin to clog up and take much longer to filter the water."Considered switching to Brita but PUR filters out many more impurities than Brita.
Nowadays,Something really wrong with these refills . I Had to replace the cartridge every two weeks. Too bad. very disappointed.
These used to say they filtered out cryptosporidia & giardia as advertised, but the package now says you should not use them in microbiologically unsafe water.  Maybe they just changed the packaging in a CYA maneuver, but you can't advertise one thing on Amazon and another on the front of the box.  Stand behind your product!
I have had pretty good luck with this product in the past but the order before this one, 3 out of the 4 filters only worked about 3 to 4 times. The charchol filler kept running out and much was in the box when I opened it.When I held it up to the light, it was only half full on three of the filters. I was very disappointed with this performance as I said,I have had pretty good luck with this product before. If this latest batch of (4) does the same thing , I will consider a different brand filter. It's a lot of money to spend on a filter that only lasts less than HALF the time it is suposed to.I guess I would not recomend it unless things improve.I also feel some sort of compensation would be due under the circumstances.Sincerely,James D. Mack
I thought I was getting a great deal from this purchase.  Sadly, I was mistaken.  I've now had two of the four filters clogged within 3 - 4 days of being installed in the filter pitcher.  This in comparison to merchandise purchased at a store in the manufacturer's packaging which last approximately 30 days.
PUR CRF-950Z-2 Stage Repalcement Filters.This does not filter the stated amount of water.  I could only filter 8 gallons before the filter began to just trickle the water.  Did not care for them at all.
I don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but these filters are horrible.  After using the first filter it took forever for water to drain through much sooner than other filters we have had in the past.  I thought maybe it was something with the way the filter was prepped.  But, after anxiously waiting for the two months to pass so I could change it, the second one is just as bad.  We used to go 3 or 4 months before the filter would start to run slow.  Now we are counting the days to the time to change the filter.  I only looked on Amazon for these filters, in the first place, because we could not find them in the store and we had run out.  I will absolutely go back to buying these in the store.  The money I saved from buying these was wasted on the shorter time I have to use them and the loss in water that I have been able to purify.
I received this order today and noticed the filters provided were for PUR 2-stage Water Systems, but they were not manufactured or sold by PUR.  Rather they are knock-offs, if you will.  They are distributed by some company Kaz, Inc. and the filters are manufactured in Mexico.  I will not comment on their performance, because I have no clue how I would tell how they compare to actual PUR filters.
I haven't even read anyone else's post but used these shipped by Amazon and it is like the water won't filter thru.  I have had to directly spray water into the filter to almost jump start the filtering process and it isn't only one time, it is every time I take the pitcher out of the refrigerator.  I haven't reported this to Amazon yet - but the ones I was purchasing at the local store didn't give me this problem.  I followed all the directions on the preparation of the filter.  I thought it was only the first one I tried, but after 2 months of fighting with it, The same is true for the second one in the pack.
Seriously PUR! SERIOUSLY!!!  I have been using these 2 stage filters for 4+ yrs now and over the past few months it's apparent that Proctor & Gamble have let their corporate greed take priority.  Don't get me wrong these filters used to be the best I have seen (key word being USED) but what once worked for 2 to 4 months depending on use now only works for 2 or 3 weeks, if you're lucky.  As other reviewers here have mentioned I also thought it may be an issue with a particular batch or lot number, but having gone through 6 filters (2 sets of 3) ordered from both Target and online and having the same issue with all 6 it's obvious that someone in a boardroom asked why make a product that lasts as long as it does when we can sell the same thing with a shortened life span for the same $ increasing profits 3 fold....Sad but that's the case.*Hopefully if enough people voice their disapproval, PUR might revert back to what once was an awesome product.
I don't know what else to say other than I am now having to shop for a new way to filter water. One of the main reasons I used the PUR filters was the indicator on the filter. I am the only one in the house who uses the pitcher so the insipid stickers don't do me much good. When they factor in the use of the filter, I'm sure they use a family of four formula. This is why I liked the indicator.I'm now going to look at the Aquasana brand. Even though it costs a bit more, it filters out all the stuff I want filtered out that PUR didn't do anyway!
In my recently deleted review, I praised these PUR filters for their performance and the Automatic Safety Monitor.  Removing the Monitor has now made the filter much less reliable.PUR claims in an email reply that consumers prefer the calendar sticker to the Automatic Safety Monitor:"Hi there,As of June/2006, the PUR 2 Stage Pitcher filter no longer has an indicator life monitor; there is now a calendar sticker you put on the pitcher.I'm sorry you are not enjoying the improved version of our product.  Many consumers have contacted us praising the new version and telling us how much better they like it.  A lot of testing and research takes place before a new product enters the market or before changes are made to an existing product.  We test our products very thoroughly, not only to ensure the safety of our products, but also to determine and prove the benefits of the new or upgraded model.Change is difficult because there are always loyal consumers who like a product just the way it is.  Unfortunately, it's usually not practical to manufacture both the old and new versions of a product. Nevertheless, I will certainly share your comments and experiences with our PUR Brand team.Have a great day.PUR Team"The newest reviews here are a more realistic reflection of how the average and once-loyal PUR customer feels.  A calender sticker doesn't know the difference between a single user, a couple like my wife and me, and a thirsty family of six.  People who rely on a PUR pitcher or dispenser for health reasons must now be especially careful to monitor the filter life themselves.  Throwing out a filter before it needs to be replaced is expensive and wasteful.  Using a filter past the end of its life will put impurities back into the water.The filter's overall performance is on a par with competitors but the Automatic Safety Monitor was PUR's strongest selling point.  Sad to say, Procter & Gamble has turned the innovator in water filtration into another also-ran.
Years ago, the previous design of these filters would last me 6 months.  The new filters "950z" only last 2-3 weeks.  PUR really did a disservice to their customers with this design change.  It is a brazen money grab and I decided to throw this in the trash and move to a competitor.  Disappointing.Aside from the gripe of very short life, these do lead to water that tastes clean.
This would have been a great way to order replacement filters, because I have a hard time finding them in the store.  But one of the filters was cracked and broken, and I know that it didn't happen in our house because I stored them securely as soon as I got them.  The trouble is, you only replace the filters every 2 months or so, and they come wrapped in foil, which is supposed to stay on until you're ready to use it.  So by the time I realized it was damaged, it was too late to fix the problem.  Bummer, I would have liked to order them this way.
We have been using the older version of these filters for many years. They worked perfect. When we decided to replace them, we purchased these. We are very disappointed with the new ones. All the water doesn't go through and just floats on the top so we get less than half of the water available. It is very frustrating and we have to constantly pour more water in it.
I have been using PUR for 10 years and have seen several generations of PUR filters.  The last generation is the one with orange indicator that tells the life of the filter.Now, PUR has smartly integrate this indicator inside the latest version of filter, where the filter will stop filtering (water stop dripping down the container) around the 60th day of usage!  Now I have to rush to buy another replacement filter..., what a hassle!!
First one out of the box is a slow drainer.  We will see how the rest fair.  Have had our PUR pitcher for years and every once in a while will get one that does not seem to drain well.  I'll agree with other reviewers, the previous design was consistently trouble free.
I saw these at walmart the three pack for $15-$17. They were well packaged and last me a long time, but definitely cheaper in a store!
We are using pur water pitcher for three years now. First years the filters were lasting around 2 months, not anymore I kept buying them from different vendors but the result is the same they clogged up way before their assumed expiration date. Seriously looking for an alternative here.
I have been using these filters for a few years but in 2013 the quality of the filters diminished in this way:  1-2 filters per 4-pack malfunction after only a week of use and do not drain the water from the upper chamber to the purified chamber.Unfortunately, there is no option on Amazon to &#34;Contact Seller&#34; so I am left to write a poor review in the hopes of gaining customer satisfaction.At this time, following purchase in the past year of 5 faulty filters to date, I will need to explore my options for an alternative water purification method for my home.
I had to break out a 2nd one within the 1st week. The 1st one I used didn't let water thru. It was like it was a 5 month old filter. The 2nd one is better... we will see...
It is convenient to buy filters from AMAZON, it saves you a trip to the store, but the quality is not good.The filters get stuck too soon. Maybe some filters are reburbished?
