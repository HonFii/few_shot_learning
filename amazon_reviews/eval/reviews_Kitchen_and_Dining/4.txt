I am very satisfied with this product.  I purchased the matching recipe box too.  Both are good quality.
We use these for Microwaving small portions of food.  And sometimes the food has oils that heat up and score the plate.  But otherwise they do their job perfectly.Oh, and we can't find anything like this locally, so Amazon is our only hope for this type of product.
I really like these plates they are a great size. I do not like glass and tired of paper plates.
They work!
These plastic plates are made with non toxic nice quality material. Perfect for toddlers. The colors are true to the picture.  The best thing is that they are reusable. The plate size could be a bit smaller, but overall the plates are fine for childreen.
These are perfect for our grandchildren, and for the adults who need something to hold a small serving of food, or a sandwich. The material holds up well in the microwave and dishwasher, but they will get whitish spots if you allow food to cook too long in the microwave on them. I suggest putting in the top of the dishwasher. I only wish Ikea made these in a fill size, as we use plastic plates as alternatives to ones of breakable materials.
The product was great. I liked the various colors of the product. The product is microwaveable that's why I bought the product.
These plates do just what they are supposed to do.  I needed some microwave save dishes and decided to take a chance on these.  They are a nice size and seem sturdy.  My grandkids use them all the time.
This is a good pizza wheel for a good price. I've used it quite a few times on my homemade 12-inch pizzas and think it works well.It isn't perfect though. I have to go back over a cut sometimes. But maybe that's how it should be?
I am a big fan of OXO products, this was given as a gift and I already own a similar one and love mine.
I've been through a few garlic presses, and two things that have aggravated me in the past is that they eventually break, and that the garlic skin is a pain to get out of the press once you are finished pressing the bulbs.  You end up with "stinky garlic finger" the rest of the day trying to pull it out!Pros: Sturdy, ergonomically comfortable, great idea with the reverse deal that allows you to push uncrushed garlic back through the holes.Cons:  heavy, and a like clunky for the kitchen tool drawer.I recommend this for garlic press devotees, this one seems like it will last!
Easy to clean. Gets the job done. Nice that I can flip it and get the garlic out, although I almost always have to use chopsticks to get the garlic out of the press completely. The plastic grip handles seem to be a bit loose on mine and can slip off easily, but doesn't really affect usage.
I think this is easy to use and is a nice tool to have in the kitchen.
The chamber on this one is large so it does hold large cloves. The grip is bigger than other brands I've used but it's not padded. It hurts my hand when I squeeze it, and since I have a traumatic hand injury, I was hoping that this press would feel less brutal. I still have to use both hands. It does clean up easily, and it is so sturdy that it will probably last many years.
These two garlic presses seem to be the most popular on Amazon right now, and since I've used both, here's my two cents.OXO: this is a much easier press to use, requiring far less hand strength.  It's also the easiest to clean (just flip it backwards and the red plastic head cleans itself).  Mine has done just fine in the dishwasher top rack.  However, it can't handle unpeeled cloves, and does have a tendency to break at the hinge every 2 years or so (I used it almost every night).  It also leaves slightly more unused garlic residue inside.Zyliss Susi Deluxe: I bought this after breaking my third OXO.  It requires substantially more hand strength to use.  It can press unpeeled cloves, but you have to squeeze quite hard to do this.  It is slightly harder to clean than the OXO (use an included attachment), but still much easier than other garlic presses.  This one leaves practically no unused garlic residue inside.  I've only had it 4 months, so I can't comment on durability yet.Overall, I'd get the OXO if you have arthritis or if your hands aren't strong, or if ease of use and cleaning are very important to you; just plan on replacing it every couple of years if you use garlic every night.  I'd get the Zyliss if you have strong hands and don't want to peel the garlic cloves, or if the breakage rate (or leaving behind a tiny quantity of garlic) bothers you.  I'll probably stick with the Zyliss, but I'd buy my mom the OXO (and replacements).
Mostly I chop garlic, I've had a press for a long time that I got right here on good ole Amazon, but it wasn't THIS press! This press will hold a lot of garlic - hurray! It does a quick and easy job of squishing it through the holes and doing what you want done, turning a big bunch of garlic into tiny tiny pieces. It's easy to clean, too. The one caveat is it's BIG, including the handles...so if you have small hands (or stumpy ones like me) you might have a small (pun intended) problem squishing the handles with one hand, definitely not a reason not to get this wunderkind of garlic smooshing technology, though. Highly recommend it! :)
I have read the other reviews, and agree with both the positive and negatives comments!! LOVE the ease to use and the cleaning! Those red teeth work wonders! As for the collecting water in the dw, I found that it was the red section that collectd the water, NOT the handles!! I just removed it after dw and let it drain!! Mine DID break, but only after we used it to crush pills for our sick dog!! I'm going to buy another one!!
An absolutely brilliant garlic-press.  Wide-handled for ease and, dare I say it, power.  It feels like you can crush steel in the press.  The flip side of the press is affixed with a plastic push (the red part visible in the photo) which makes removing the remnants of the garlic clove very easy.  The only downside, as one other reviewed aptly pointed out, is that the hinge tends to break after time.  Truthfully, I've only broken one and that was after I tried to press three large cloves at once.  So, after having said that, perhaps you should take my &quot;tends to break&quot; comment with a grain of salt (or garlic as the case may be).In short, a very good and affordable press which you will enjoy for a long time. I've bought many for friends and family I love it so much.Lastly, to the reviewer from NY below who is amazed that the handles (which CAN be pulled off by the way) absorb water in the dishwasher...here's an idea:  try washing it by hand.  If you are unable to wash it by hand, just pull off the handles...they easily slide back on.
A friend of mine purchased this for me four years ago when I was just starting to really get into cooking. She had no idea if it was good or not, but it felt weighty and looked pretty. Thankfully for me, it also worked very well.I've been using mine since December of 2002, and I've never had the problem that many other reviewers have mentioned with the hinge. Mine is still going strong and works just the same as it did when I bought it. I specialize in Italian cooking and don't make mashed potatoes if they don't have garlic in them, so this gets quite a bit of use from me.It can be a little difficult to clean, and there's always a bit of garlic that's wasted. You definitely couldn't use an unpeeled clove in this one. Flipping the press around helps to get those hard-to-remove bits off the inside, and swirling it around in a bowl of hot water tends to get the rest of it clean for me. It's very easy to use and feels good in your hands, true to the rest of Oxo's Good grips line. It seems that I got one of the good ones, but I'd recommend mine to anyone else and keep my fingers crossed that they were as lucky as I have been.
I've owned my OXO garlic press for years now and I've never had a problem with it. I throw 3 cloves at a time and it does the job fine. Easy to clean and sturdy. My only caviat is that it's fairly heavy but you can't beat the sturdiness and comfort.
I've had my OXO Garlic press for three or four years now and it's still like new.  I use it approximately 3 or 4 times a week.  As said above, this gadget is extremely easy to clean.  Just scape out the residue pulp with a small knife, then run it under hot water - done!  Perhaps the secret in its longevity it that I cut each garlic clove lengthwise and place each piece cut side down before squeezing.  Highly recommend this item.
Well, the OXO Good Grips Garlic Press is a bit of overkill. It definitely crushes the garlic quite well, though there is a fair bit of residual left in the press. The cleaning element works better than expected but one still has to scrape out the last bits when cleaning.The thing is very big, very heavy -- the handles makes up most of the size and weight. Seems unnecessary and a bit of a pain to use. Plus it takes up a lot of drawer space.I probably wouldn't buy it if I saw it in a store because of its clunkiness --- something I often find in OXO products products even though I have many of their items I like very much.My partner says he's gone through two of them because they broke rather quickly. I suspect however, they must have been earlier models. I find it hard to believe that this would break easily. I think when he checked it out, he didn't think so either.But I will still look for a new garlic press, at least as functional as this and less cumbersome. But this one is good enough for me to use in the interim.
I used this press for more than 9 years approx 2-5 times per a month without problems.  Just recently the hinge has become misaligned so I feel I can not squeeze it shut all the way and it is not aligned when I invert it to clean out the holes.  I do feel I got my moneys worth.
I've had one of these presses from a few years and it recently failed. I sent an email to OXO and they promptly sent me a new one, no questions asked. Back in business and with service like that why would you buy anything else?
I love Oxo products and this is no exception. It's a nice garlic press.Pros:1. Presses well2. Very comfortable in your hand3. Helpful cleaning thingyCons:1. Nothing yet. I'm pleased with this.I often don't use a garlic press at all, favoring the Laurel's Kitchen approach of saut&eacute;ing the whole cloves of garlic and then mushing them with a fork when done. But of course, you don't always want to saute your garlic. And this is great for pressing.
I've been very happy with my OXO Garlic Press over the 5 or so years I've used it.  The problem is that over time, the metal hinge wears out and eventually breaks, leaving the press useless.  I've had this happen with two different OXO garlic presses, so I know it wasn't just a bad batch.  I did use it fairly often, so maybe that just comes with the territory.  For the third try, I'm going to try the Zyliss Susi press instead.
I like this garlic press's heft, the curve and  "good grip" of its handle, and its cleaning feature. It requires some force to press the garlic--more than I expected, but it isn't difficult for able-handed people--and the garlic shoots out of it more forcefully than I expected.I have had theOXO SteeL Garlic Press, Stainlessfor several years, and like this product better. This product produces a finer mince, its handles are more ergonomic and don't slip out of place, and it doesn't send as much garlic out the sides.
I've been pretty happy with this press. It's feels well made and is comfortable to use.I wash it by hand so I've never had the water in the handles problem that others have mentioned.After several years it cracked at the hinge, but Oxo replaced it at no charge! The new one has been redesigned in that spot, so I don't think it will break again.
After a couple of weeks use I am pretty happy with this garlic press. The handles are quite large with soft grips so it seems to take less force to use than my other, older press. It does a really good job with the garlic, producing a nice fine mince or puree. It's big enough to do two or three cloves at a time, though if you overfill it some of the garlic comes out of the sides. The red plastic hole cleaner is built into the opposite handle so it is always with the press and doesn't get lost in my kitchen drawer.My wife tells me that she finds it easier to clean than our older press and she especially likes that the cleaner is built into the handle. With my large hands, I actually found it a little harder to clean. When you press garlic, a layer of fibrous residue is left behind. The fact that the chamber where the garlic is pressed is triangular in shape means that sometimes some of the garlic residue gets caught down in the point where it's hard for me to reach.I am a fan of "Ten Dollar Dinners" on the Food Network, and I notice that this is the garlic press Melissa D'Arabian uses on that show.
I use a lot of garlic in my cooking, but I really hate dicing up garlic.  This thing does it for me in matter of seconds.  I just press it over the pan where I want the garlic to go and there it is - flavoring my food like a pro.It has good weight in that it feels substantial in the hand - like it's not going to break if I squeeze too tight - and it's easy enough to clean, which is a must since I don't have a dishwasher.
I've actually owned this garlic press for almost 4 years and used it a couple of times per month. Always washed it in the dish washer. The red hole cleaner cracked loose within the first or second year, but the press functioned properly until recently. Lately it has become misaligned and it no longer does the job.Overall, it was a great Garlic press, but I too agree that it should have lasted longer than it did.
I used the OXO Good Grips Garlic Press for last 3 months and I liked it. I crushed garlic, ginger, small onion pieces and it worked pretty well.It has a solid grip that works very well even when you need to press it very hard and I haven't slipped it once. The stainless steel body is of good quality and the hinges are well built. I used it reasonably everyday and didn't find any durability problem as of now. I also like the way one can flip the handle and use the plastic head to clean the pores.  On the negative side, I wish there was a better way to clean the pores automatically after every press and I wish the head was bigger.The tool works fine till now and I am happy with it.I recently used another garlic press, the one from ikea, its equally good, only problem it found was that cleaning OXO is easier, other than that i found both equally good, and the ikea one being just 4$ is a cheaper option
I've had one of these for several years and am completely satisfied.  It does a very nice job.  The last thing I would do is put it in a dishwasher--if you only use it for garlic a simple rinse works fine.  No utenzil with soft rubber handles should be put into the dishwasher--unless you want to pull it out before the dry stage.  As to the garlic oozing out the sides, just lick it off as I do!
As someone who frequently cooks Mediterranean menus heavy on fresh garlic, the Oxo garlic press is a chef's best friend. Rubber-coated handles make gripping and squeezing more user friendly than all-metal garlic presses, and cleanup is a snap. Like most garlic presses, you can choose to pre-peel the garlic before pressing it, but you'll still need to clean the press in-between uses. It comes with a built-in cleaner, and usually a quick run under the tap will remove most debris. The garlic comes out as more of a paste than it would if you were to chop it, and is a much faster way to add flavor to soups, salads, and more with minimal effort.I've owned my Oxo press for years and haven't had any of the problems that other reviewers mentioned (handles falling off, hinge breaking). I do usually hand-wash, and I don't prepeel my garlic, and the press is still going strong 2+ years later. Perhaps my press was subject to different quality control standards: I bought it several years ago and had it stored until recently.
This press feels good in the hand; it's heavy (firm in the hand but not too heavy) and the extruded garlic is nicely minced.  However, it does leave a lot of the clove behind in the press.  I always peel first, so I wish to use the entire clove as recipes call for.  I've found I can reverse press the residue, push it to the side and just throw another clove in and press again and so on until my last clove.  Then I release the residue and reposition it and repress and repeat.  Usually all that's left by then is mush which I can just throw in the pot.The repeated problem I've had with this press are the handles.  I purchased this at our local BB&B;, so when the handle grip on one side unglued, making it difficult to hold onto the press while pressing, I exchanged it for a replacement.  But now it's happened again.  It's not as bad as before so I'm limping along with it but I am no longer interested in replacing it and the glue's obviously unbonded and it's getting worse.I am looking at the Kuhn press...
I am reviewing this for Amazon who sent this to me give my honest opinions.  This is a fine garlic press, but I am a little disappointed, it is very heavy in the hand and it is a bit bulky.  OXO usually tries to make products so the people with hand problems can handle them. I own several of th eir products and use then daily and love them.  I have Arthritis and I hurt my hand on the first grip, I used fresh garlic and squeezed hard and my thumb is hurting.So it failed me there. If you have strong hands (and I normally do) this will work fine for you.  When I got the hang of it I was doing fine  I just used smaller garlic cloves.  The cleaner worked well also you just turn the handle around and press it against the back of the product and it loosens up the garlic skin.  All you have to do is take your finger and slip the skin out of the well.  When I washed it, it cleaned perfectly, no residue was left over and it was sparkling in no time. No leftover odor.Now I want to make a personal observation: I am Italian and my mother and mother in law would roll over in their graves if they saw me using a garlic press.  They feel that garlic should be chopped or sliced and the skin that is left behind when using a press is vital to the garlic's role in a dish.  I tend to agree, while this press is excellent and a very useful tool in any kitchen I prefer to chop by hand.
I was looking to replace my old, bent metal measuring spoons, and decided that since I already had and liked other Oxo products, I would get these (they are a good value).  I really like the fact that they handles are all  the same size and that they are color coded.  I only wish that they had  included a 1/8 tsp measure.
The one and only reason I grabbed this was because  I have kids that love bagels. I would cringe watching them try to cut one themselves and had a hard time resisting the urge to grab knife and bagel away from the preteenagers and do it for them. Bought this thing, and it solved the problem. I picked it up  at TJ MAXX for only  5.00, and it came with a spreader and offset bread knife - what a find! I've since bought one for a friend with arthritic hands, and she loves it. Admittedly, its probably something you can do without unless you eat a lot of bagels or have difficulty with your hands, but its a good product and a nice tool to have around.
I purchased a [price] electric bagel cutter for my parents last Xmas and after buying this nifty item for myself, I wish I had gotten them this instead. The problem both these gadgets solve is sliced fingers when cutting bagels. While both devices will get the job done, this thing takes up so much less counter space, it's easy to use and it's dishwasher safe. The black thing isn't a knob, just a large grip to hold it while you are slicing. One additional comment I'll offer about this gadget is that it actually clamps down on the bagels quite tight, so depending on the kind of bagels you get, real thick doughy bagels may not fit in it. (or you may have to pull apart the "grips" wider than you would like, possibly cracking the plastic!)
I first saw a waiter using one of these in Italy, cleaning off their linen table cloths.  I wasn't sure what he was doing until I saw this crumb sweeper, and thought I should try it out.  I'm glad I did.  My dining room table is a high traffic area, and I always have a table cloth on it.  This does a good job picking up the crumbs, and it's easy to clean.  I just open it up and rinse it out in the sink.  I highly recommend for those who use a table cloth regularly.
Perfect for cleanup after meals. Do have go over some spots a couple times before it picks up everything. Great to have if your husband and/or kids leave a lot of crumbs behind.
Price was good.  Paying a lot for a meat fork that nothing more than stab and hold meat is not smart to me.
Good secure grip Strong prongs that handles almost any cut of meat. I would buy this knife again and recommend it to friends.
I noted another reviewer commented the fork was quite sharp on the ends; boy was he right.  The two ends are almost like the end of a knife, very sharp and dangerous if you are not careful.  The plus side is they go into meat easily with little pressure.  The main reason I purchased this item was for the rubberized handle which is hand friendly.  It looks and feels like it will last a long time (the handle); the main steel is stainless and fairly heavy duty (it won't bend easily if at all); all in all, this is a quality item.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the chance you could be stabbed by the tool if you were careless; it's kind of like a knife, be careful with it and it will serve you well, be careless, and you may have two puncture marks on your body, and they won't be vampire bites.
As with almost all OXO products, this fork provides a good grip and makes carving easier.
Good sturdy fork good for everyday use. The handle has a good grip and is very easy to use. I like OXO products.
I think the person I gave it to is very pleased. Hope this helps you.  I know she wanted it to be all stainless steel.  Hope it was, but I was busy and did not examine it.
Sturdy, doesn't leak, easy to clean. That's what I', looking for in a cake pan. Wish it had &#34;feet&#34;, but sat it upside down on a tomato paste can.
It is a good double jigger for going to those tailgate parties!!  Solid.
This three part contains the proper tools that you will need to start your bar.  Anyone that enjoys hosting parties at home can find this, sharp looking set, useful.
The Pedrini egg cutter is fabulous.  It neatly slices the end off soft boiled eggs.  Great for use with egg cups.
This works well, and thanks to its design, it cleans up easily in the dishwasher. I have another one with a very thin spout and I have to wash it by hand if I let it sit at all after using it because the dishwasher jets can't seem to get into its narrow opening; it's a real pain. I do not have that problem with this design.To answer another reviewers' question on plasic vs. glass separaters -- I had a glass one and it broke despite being touted as heat resistant glass. When I poured hot gravy into it last Thanksgiving, the glass went flying everywhere as it broke right in my hand! Admittedly, that was an older one and perhaps the newer glass versions are more rugged when it comes to heat.
We roast meat a couple of times a week, and it's usually just for the two of us, as our six-month old daughter isn't quite up to roast lamb just yet. So the juice from our joint barely comes up to a centimetre from the bottom of this pot.This is not a problem for separation, as the juices stay at the bottom when you tilt the separator, and the fat comes off the top. So you can get rid of most of the fat, and this really improves the gravy. So it works well, but a smaller version would have been even more useful for a small family like mine. I would definitely recommend this if you do a big roast, and want to separate out the juices.
There were no rubberized protective feet as advertised.  I had read this on the other reviews, but took my chances.  I called the manufacturer, who was great, but they were unable to help me because there are no rubberized protective feet for this product.
Half of the protective feet were missing when my 2 racks arrived!  I thought about returning them, but realized the feet would just get lost anyways.  I suppose a dish towel under the rack will have to suffice to protect my tabletop!
The actual cooling rack is very different from the picture shown. As others have noted, it doesn't have rubber feet. Of course, when you get down to it a cooling rack is a cooling rack, and this one certainly looks built to last.
Mine didn't have the protective feet listed in the name. Solid, and works well, but a bit pricey.
When this rack arrived, it was already missing a foot. But that was okay with me, because the first thing I did was remove the two that were still on, and take them and the loose one in the box, and tossed them into the junk drawer.This rack fits perfectly in a cookie sheet, and makes a great draining/cooling rack for my deep fried foods and my roasts. The non-stick grid means all it usually needs is a quick rinse, but it's sturdy enough for a ride in the dishwasher.
The Amco Italian Oil Can is great! It makes a perfect addition to the dinner table. My guests and I absolutely adore it's shape and concept.  Also, it compliments any kitchen decor when not in use.
This small gift is perfect for that friend that enjoys hosting the weekend get-togethers.  While it doesn't have everything one might ever need to make those specialty drinks, it does offer the basic bar tools in a simple and classy stainless steel finish.  I would recommend this gift for all casual occasions or as a nice addition to your own beverage accessory lineup
A must item for any bar for the casual user. Durable, easy to use and clean. Looks nice and professional.
This grinder provides a decent amount of ground pepper. Contrary to the other reviewers, I find the size of the ground pepper to be fine -- it is obviously larger than the ground pepper that you're going to find in stores, but that's what you want from fresh ground pepper!Two words of warning: First, the pepper that comes with this product isn't very flavorful. You may want to replace it immediately with better peppercorns. Whether this is due to the mill sitting for a while waiting for you or something else, I don't know. But just be warned. Second: it's bigger than you may think. The ball is easily between three and four inches wide, and the handles go up a good distance -- maybe five inches. Don't think of this as the size of a normal pepper shaker (the pictures make it hard to see how big it is)
This pepper mill was purchased in hopes of finding one who's grinding teeth wouldn't wear out.  It's been almost ten years now and the thing still grinds like it was new.  The only complaint is that it didn't take long for the vertical pepper loading door on the side to lose its grip and now has to be held closed with a small piece of scotch tape. It has done a great job and is known around my household as the Pepper Bunny.
I love the convenience of the pepper ball. You can't beat one-handed grinding! My only gripe is that I can't grind the pepper to a fine dust like I can with my tall wooden old-style two handed grinder.
Bought one of these last year in Switzerland for a gift and was told by my Kitchen friends that they just loved it. I was so happy to see it again I bought one. It's definitely one of the best buys around and very easy to  use. After using my friends Pepper Ball I'm convinced it's the best one to  have in the Kitchen.
For some reason, I could get these colors to work great in doughs and batters, but was less than gobsmacked when it came to frostings.  Still, these colors are leagues above the kind you get at the grocery store and well worth the reasonable price for the variety of colors.
I purchased this product for water coloring for laboratory purposes. Although it does fulfill this task pretty well, it contains glucose, which sometimes gets stuck in the lab equipment. A similar product containing only colorant would be better for this application.
I like these because of the squeeze bottle.  There is no using a toothpick!  As far as coloring, I think they are equal to the Wilton brand which I use as well.
These food colors are a lot better than just the ones you buy and the grocery store and actually will give you the color you want. They also do not change the taste of the icing at all which is great, especially if you make home made icings. My only complaint is that I feel like I have to use a lot for a small amount of icing. I do eventually get the color I want without changing the texture or taste but I've used a good amount of the bottle.
Works like a charm with Royal Icing.  Black took a lot to get a real black, red a little less.  Green even less than red.  Add a little squirt at a time, mix thoroughly and you can get the shade you want.  If you have the time wait 15-30 min to let the colors absorb into the icing so you know the true color.  Would definitely buy again.
These food dyes work great. Colors are accurate and don't run. We use it to add some color to our home made yogurt.
I haven't used all the colors yet, but most of them are a good pure color. the exception is red. (isn't it always red).  I was using these colors for color flow work and the red came out salmon colored.  I thought it may dry darker, but it stayed the same color. I will try again to see if I can get it darker. other than that I am very pleased with this purchase.
These are so much easier than the Wilton colors! Squeeze bottles eliminate the need for toothpicks but the squeeze does make it a little harder to control the amount dispensed but I definitely prefer these!
I love making my own home made popcorn and these are perfect for tinting the kernels for colorful popcorn. They are also great for tinting frosting and cake batter. The colors are true and bright.
Will be using for a mardi grass cake that needs real color, hopefully it gets the job done as it is expected.
I got this set to color a 7 layer rainbow cake I made.  You only need a few drops to color anything.  This gel is far more powerful than the liquid food coloring you typically get at the store.
Not bad, except for the red - I seemed to have to use a lot to make it red. It looked coral otherwise.Colors did seem to bleed a little though.. I was making Xmas cookies and the colors bled into each other a little.. Could have just been the icing was made wrong.
I just started cake decorating so these are my first "professional" colors and I was really happy with the results. I colored fondant and gumpaste and overall it was a good experience. I would have given 5 stars if the bottles were a little easier to get a drop out of, for instance if the bottle cap had a conical shape like Visine rather than a flat cap. That is very minor though and these are very nice colors for a reasonable price.
I am happy with the colors. However, a little disappointed by how much color you need to put. I use it to color playdough and discovered that you need quite a bit to make a decent color.
I really love T-fal cookware. This pan is nice and roomy with deep sides so stuff doesn't splash out. The nonstick finish really does a great job of allowing foods to slip right on out. Easy cleaning, and the handle really does stay cool. If these guys didn't make the thermospot pans, this one would be what I would buy. But I prefer the shape of the thermospot line better.
The juicer worked harder than I had hoped.  My wife and I gave them as gifts to both our parents.  I am strong but so the juicer worked OK, but it was not enjoyably easy.We had relatives over and my parents brought the juicer to our house so we could treat all to fresh-squeezed.The juicer was squeeking a little so we decided to oil it.  We used cooking oil in a hand pressurized can.  You could use PAM or just drip some oil in the pivots.  The change was remarkable.  The force for squeezing was cut in half or even more.  Since the joints load up with great force at the bottom of the stroke due to the leverage, and since there are a number of pivot points, you can dramatically lower the hand pressure required with vegetable oil at all the pivots.Small or medium oranges are best, as the largest will squish out at the edges, with the fruit still intact at the perimeter.
I saw this juicer in a display at SFO, right by an OLPC and a SCUBA mask--it looked good, so I bought one.  Here are the results of my comparison of this juicer with a cheap Braun spinning juicer.When juicing oranges, the OrangeX extracts about 10% less juice than the Braun.  For this test, I squeezed each half orange once with the OrangeX.  Now I usually double squeeze oranges--the two juicers are probably about the same when I do this.The Braun is easier to clean up.  But both juicers are easy to clean, so this doesn't matter that much.The Braun requires less effort to use.  But both are easy to use.The juices from the two juicers are quite different.  The OrangeX puts a lot more rind oil into the juice and the Braun puts a lot more pulp into the juice.  For Washington Navels, the juices taste different, but neither is better than the other.  For Oroblancos though, the juice from the OrangeX is bitter and worse than the juice from the Braun.I haven't squeezed a lot of oranges yet, but the OrangeX looks like it'll last longer than the Braun.  However, it costs about 10 times as much, but it will not last 10 times as long.The OrangeX is a good juicer--if you love orange juice and want variety, get one of these and a cheap spinning juicer.  But if you want only one juicer, get a cheap spinning juicer.
This knife set is perfect for a relatively novice cook such as myself.  The last knife set I purchased retailed at over $100 and those knives pale in comparison to the quality of these fine blades.  I'm not familiar with all of the details to look for when evaluating the quality of fine knives, but I find they work especially well as my &quot;everyday&quot; knives.
The Capresso does an excellent job with regular roast beans. If you use dark roast or flavored beans you should not use the built in grinder. Oily beans (e.g., French roast) jam up the feed between the grinder and the basket. Sticky beans (e.g., most flavored coffees) fail to feed properly into the grinder and may also jam the feed between the grinder and the basket.You can still use the coffee maker for dark roasts or flavor coffees by using a separate grinder. But if that is your primary use, then cheaper coffee makers that don't have a built in grinder offer equally good quality and may have larger capacity.
I wanted a grinder plus coffee maker primarily to reduce mess and preparation time, but of course expecting a good cup of coffee.  I bought the Cuisinart machine seen everywhere for $..and was terribly disappointed.  The daily cleanup requirements were daunting and complicated, but worst of all, the coffee tasted bad.  It seemed to me to taste of plastic.  I even marinated all the parts overnight in extremely strong coffee hoping to season them, but it still did not taste good.The Capresso has been a good experience so far.  It is quite tall, so watch out for counter space.  The grinder works well.  The coffee tastes great.  I like strong coffee, so I find I need to set it to "6 cups strong" to get 2 of the size servings we use out of an indicated 4 cups of water input.  The downside in filling the carafe much over half full, you have to use two grinding passes to get really strong coffee.  Fill the carafe with as much water as you need, and start a standard cycle.  As soon as the grinder finishes and the filter holder swings over, cancel the cycle, pull the grinder over, and start a fresh cycle.This model does not expose the hot water and steam to nearly as much plastic as does the Cuisinart, which I suppose accounts for the greatly superior taste (or maybe the plastic is a type that does not contribute the same obnoxious flavor).I wish the grinder were a bit quieter, the display bigger and clearer and the general build a bit more robust seeming.On the less mess and trouble front, this machine is a huge win for me.  I get a tiny amount of dry ground coffee just under the grinder.  The only mandatory daily cleaning or prep is to dump the wet grounds from and rinse the gold filter.  There is a slow build-up of oil on the walls of the dry bean reservoir.  But nastly coffee residue is not building up elsewhere to the point I can even see after about two months of use.
This coffee maker is amazing.  The flavor is at least as good as what you get from your neighborhood cafe, and its timer lets you wake up to the java.  I clean out the chamber that drops the grind every two weeks, so it won't clog up and lead to dilute coffee.  I've never had a problem with dark beans clogging the machine.  The device is very plasticky, as are most home coffee makers today, but the filter holder basket has a piece of plastic to locate the holder into the machine, and it broke.  It still works, but I have to be more particular in setting the filter holder in place.  All in all, a definitely great purchase.
We love the machine, it makes great coffee.  Had a minor problem when we first got it and called the customer service number provided. Talked to a real person right away.  A new machine was sent out without any question and the return of the other machine was made very simple and free. Everything is working fine now and we awake every morning with fresh ground and brewed coffee..delicious!!
This is the second Capresso coffee maker I've purchased. Love it and recommend it to friends and family. Capresso adds little features with each revision. The &quot;plus&quot; added a charcoal filter to the water tank, a nice touch, if  you use tap water. If you are using bottled or filtered water, this feature is unnecessary.The grinder and automatic timer are great features and much less hassle than having a separate grinder.The only reason I held back a star from my rating is the display. The LCD is hard to read, especially determining which cup icon is underlined to set the desired strength.The machine might also benefit from intermediate # cups settings (1,3,5,7,9 are not available.)Overall this coffee maker/grinder makes wonderful coffee.Make sure you keep the &quot;gold&quot; filter and the filter holder scrupulously clean and you should have no problem making excellent coffee for a long time to come.If you run out of beans, it can also use pre-ground coffee, but once you've tasted coffee made from really freshly-ground beans, you'll never want to go back.
It seems that there are two camps - those who hate it and seem to have all sorts of build quality problems, and those like myself who love this machine.I have never had any problems with leaks or flavor. I keep the setting on the finest grade, and I also use the exact amount of water (not the recommended 'add an additional cup') - otherwise it tends to be too watery. I also keep the setting on the strongest possible.My only issue is the quality of the plastic used could be better. But in my search, features were my primary concern.
I love this coffee maker.  I got mine about a year ago, and it is still working great.  I was worried when I bought it that, because of the moving parts, it would be unreliable.  So far, it has worked perfectly every time I have used it.This machine caters to people who like freshly ground coffee, but don't really like having to take the time to grind the beans and dump them into the coffee maker every time they make coffee.  Sure, it doesn't take all that long, but it's still annoying, especially when you're only half awake and end up dumping half the coffee on the counter while trying to transfer it to the pot.  This system makes such mishaps impossible.The CoffeeTeam plus takes up quite a bit of counter space.  However, it probably only takes up as much room as a regular coffee pot and separate burr grinder.  I have very little counter space in my kitchen, so I am keenly aware of the square foot devoted to the coffee pot.Personally, I like to roast my own coffee beans.  I buy the beans &quot;green&quot; (unroasted), and roast them using Hearthware's Precision Coffee Roaster.  I dump the freshly roasted beans directly into the CoffeeTeam's hopper, then push a single button to start the grinding/brewing process.  The resulting java is simply out of this world.  As it turns out, green coffee beans cost about half what roasted beans go for, and the coffee roaster is only about ..., so it pays for itself after 10 - 15 pounds of coffee... ... ...  These are the same companies that will sell you green beans.Roasting the beans takes about 20 minutes, so it would be wonderful if I could just dump the green beans directly into a &quot;coffee brewing system&quot; that would roast them, grind them, and then brew the coffee.  Capresso, are you listening???
Bought one of these factory refurbished, but it came with a full mfrs warranty.  The coffee is excellent, except that on 2 cups, its a little iffy.  I always set if for at least 4.  But the taste is rich, the quality is excellent, and the customer service of Capresso is unbelievably wonderful.  I had a small problem, they shipped me a new machine that arrived in two days, with a return UPS label. (Didn't cost me a cent!).  I can't say enough good things abou this unit.  (except, as I mentioned, it doesn't work that well at the two cup setting.)
I've had my Capresso for over 3 years now and it has provided excellent service and great coffee for the entire period of time.  Unfortunately, the first one arrived with the grinder cone &quot;unseated&quot; (hidden shipping damage) but a simple call to the vendor resulted in a new unit arriving within 3 days.  Since then its just been chugging away, grinding beans and making very good coffee.It takes a bit of experimenting to get the right grind (courseness) and water (I use bottled) combination but once you have that relationship right the coffee is very consistant.  I use it with French Roast and because of this the interior of the coffee bin has become lightly coated with oil. Unfortunately the bin can only be replaced by sending it for service. (My reason for a 4 star rating.)
After reading great reviews on Amazon, I bought one of these for my girlfriend for Christmas a year and some months ago. It worked perfectly for about six or seven months. Then the automatic release that swings the filter basket back over the carafe broke. We called Capresso, and they sent us a new one immediately, asking that when we got the new one to send the old one back in the box. They prepaid the postage. We were VERY impressed with their customer service. Later, we noticed was that the new one seemed to leak water from the top. We let it go for a while, since we didn't want to abuse our relationship with Capresso. Finally we had enough of puddles on the counter, called them up, and they sent out a new lid, free of charge, which fixed the problem. Making the replacement was easy. We LOVE having freshly-ground coffee every morning, and this little gem is the pride of our kitchen, and we get a lot of use out of it.
I almost didn't buy this product after the numerous poor reviews.  I am very (VERY) particular regarding my coffee.  I have been using a tea kettle (to ensure proper heating) and french press (typically with an African coffee, but also like the LaMinta and some Indonesian coffee); however, of late, I have been entertaining more and needed a &lt;gasp&gt; regular coffee maker.My wife did some research online and I then looked at this maker as a possible choice.  The negative reviews really put me off.  However, it has all of the features I wanted and none of the gimmicks that a real coffee drinker needs.Let me address some of the misleading information in these reviews:(1) the filtration system is not &quot;messy&quot;.  It is easily removed if you already use filtered water and will dramatically improve the flavor of coffee made with tap water.(2) you do not need to &quot;eye mark&quot; the water levels.  the interior of the water reservior is clearly marked with water level indicators.(3) I do not find this coffee &quot;weak&quot;.  In fact, the conical gold-tone filter will enhance the flavor as the water is exposed to more grounds than the flat filters.  Furthermore, the filter will not absorb the coffee oils (unlike paper) which are an essential part of the flavor.(4) &quot;Small serving control&quot;:  put less water in, put less coffee in, and turn it on.  If you can't figure that out, you shouldn't be drinking coffee but kool-aid.  However, if small serving control refers to pulling out the carafe prior to the completion of brewing, then this capresso does not have that feature.  Please note that a coffee aficionado would NEVER use that feature anyway.  It results in brackish, bitter coffee from the oversteeping of the grounds.In summation, if you appreciate fine coffee, Capresso is the Cadillac of coffee makers.  Capresso makes better models than this; however, for the price you cannot do better.
Great idea, and just what I was looking for--a salt shaker that lets you choose whether it's a fine shake, big shake, pouring (for recipes), or closed (in humid environments).  Great product!
I'm pleased with this shaker.  Fills easily and holds enough so that you're not refilling it constantly.
These are great for the kids. They really love the shaped pancakes. They are a little challenging however. Make sure you put plenty of oil or spray on them before you add the batter or they will stick badly, especially the cow. Also use a lower heat setting than normal because the pancakes will be thicker and you need the top to set a little before removing the mold and turning.If you do that, they work great.
These are great kitchen shears.  They feel good in my hand, and are very sharp, they should last a long time.  After researching Lamsonsharp products, I thougt I was buying an American made product.  These shears are made in china!  There is an American flag on the cardboard sleeve next to "American made cutlery and kitchen tools since 1837".  Flip it over and it says "Made in china".  I am disapointed, I thought I was supporting American craftsman.  That is why I gave these four stars.
I received one for Christmas, when I opened the package I noticed the probe wire had been pinched and severed during packaging.  I was able to strip the wires and twist the bare ends together to make it work (I wanted to use it for New Year's dinner).  It functions well, I especially like the temp alarm letting me known when I hit a target temp even if I am in the next room.  I emailed the company and asked for a new probe and now one is on the way.  Pretty good customer service with no hassle.
It looks like you have to keep it clean and away from wet stuff in the kitchen. Also the plug for the temp stick was a little weird. At first it didn't pick up temp, so I unplugged then off then on plugged in and it worked. I admit I didn't read all the instructions and I could have been doing something wrong. Overall I like it! Simple, no clock, which is a plus..Wish there was a backlight!
Nice to be able to extend the meter into the oven and monitor internal temp from outside.  Appears to be very accurate and responsive. Only downside might be that max temp is 392.
I purchased this digital thermometer for Thanksgiving.  It was my first time cooking for our entire extended family on this particular holiday and I didn't want to take any chances on a dry or undercooked turkey.  Setting the thermometer to alert me when a specific temperature was reached was simple and very effective.  My turkey came out perfectly cooked and so moist -- more than one guest said it was the best turkey they'd ever had.Since then, I've used it when cooking roasts and large whole chickens.  It is much more convenient and efficient than opening the oven a few times to check the food's temp, only to find that things aren't quite done or has cooked a bit too long.
Really like the magnet feature on the unit.  Sticks to the side of my smoker and I can run the probe through the vent.
After reading the reviews and hearing the negatives on the probe etc, I was hesitant to order this unit. So far so good though. I have used the temp probe a couple of times now and found it to be very accurate when checked against another. Not sure on the durability of course, but it fits my needs to a tee so far. Loin roast came out perfect and I never had to open the oven to check it even once. When your piece of meat cost more than this thing, it does't make sense to guess at it's temp, and this saves me from monitoring it manually.One review thought the alarm wasn't loud enough. Maybe mine is the obnoxious type, but I found it plenty loud. I can hear it when sitting here on my computer a few rooms away, even through the high pitched ringing of my tinnitus. Gotta admit I don't understand the 'curved' probe, but maybe I'm just uninformed and someone will come along and explain it :) Do I think it's perfect? No, hence four stars instead of five. I find it hard to give five stars to any product. But for the price I think it's a good value. Would I recommend it? Right now without a doubt.
After destroying my first meat thermometer with my Thanksgiving turkey, I purchased this one for Christmas dinner. I use the timer quiet often and am pleased that I can hear it upstairs. It has a very long cord with the thermometer.
I like this thermometer, it's features and ease of use but question how long the stock probe will last due to it's light-weight silicone cable.  I purchased a third-party probe with braided cable as an accessory.  BTW, when testing probes, you have to turn the thermometer OFF for it to recognize the new probe if changed while ON.
This product works great when it works. However, my first unit has suddenly become very difficult to turn on and off. The switch is extremely difficult to move from the on to off or off to on position. It may have been because it was dropped, but I'm not sure. I ordered a 2nd one to have on hand when it goes. If I was more confident in the longevity of this device, then I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4.
I found this product to be very useful when baking in the oven, especially meats and poultry items. cook to Temperature of the internal meat, not the heat and time of your oven. this gives a much more accurate cooking definition to when your meat is rare/medium Done etc.The one problem i have with this item, is that the digital read out became unreadable, due to a 3 looking like an 8 a 1 looking like a 4 etc.Im going to try another one as i  WOULD recommend it. Super product, lets hope my Digi read out lasts longer this time!
I got this for making bread.  It worked really well when I used it last night.  I watched it to make sure it would beep at the 190...I'm a dork!
I use this product, and variations of this product, to monitor temp on my smoker. I use one thermometer for monitoring internal temp of the meat, and one for monitoring the cooking temp of the smoker. They are accurate within 5 degrees (boiling water test) and clean up easily.
OK, so I've had this almost 9 years and to this day I still use it.  It's a great timer and a great thermometer, have never had an issue with is and have only replaced the batteries twice, sometimes I have forgotten to turn it off.  This thing is simple to use, set the temp you ant it to alarm on and walk away, it hasn't failed me yet.  You have to make sure you get the probe inserted correctly, too close to a bone or not in the center and you will get misreads but that is standard for any thermometer.  I would buy this again and recommend it to friends.
Great timer/therm only thing that could make it better is if it had a stainless probe cord, just what I expected when I bought it, no surprises.
I've had this model of thermometer for a couple of years now and have really come to rely on it. I use it for everything from baking bread to deep frying french fries. It's a sturdy tool provided that you remember two things:1) The body of the thermometer is not heat or water proof, so be careful where you stick it.2) The probe is not water proof, so be careful not to submerge it.
I have had the same problem with this thermometer. It is a great tool, works very well and very accuratly. BUT... After a while the thermometer does not take temps. It gets an error message.
The alert works well, and provides a very audible beep when the desired temperature is reached.  I use it for roasting in the oven.  I keep the thermometer in the meat, and can close the oven door on the cable.  I have used it side by side with my manual meat thermometer to test for accuracy, and it is accurate.  I also like that it reaches a higher temperature, ie. 450 degrees F for temping candy, sugar, etc.  The controls are manual, meaning to set the desired temperature, you have to push a button which increments the temperature one degree at a time, so if I'm going from 140 degrees to 350 desired temperature....you do the math...that's how many times you have to push the up arrow.  No big deal since I don't use it on a daily basis.  The important thing is that it works.
My husband and I will use this on occasion for measuring oven temperatures (especially since the oven in our apartment is like 80 degrees hotter than it's supposed to be). It takes a little while to measure (definitely not instant), but gets the job done. It's pretty easy to use and has all of the features you'd need.
I have had this exact same thermo/timer since 2000 and it has never failed. Recently (Fall 2012) it stopped working and became a nice timer - no temp/no probe. Bought a new one, plugged the new probe into the old thermo/timer and it worked perfectly. Spend the 7 bucks on the probe before buying a whole new unit. At $19.94 including shipping, this workhorse cost me roughly $1.67 per year and I haven't even plugged in the new one yet. Highly recommended.
I have used it(thermometer) many years but only a few times per year. I used it for chicken , turkey and steak, they all came out perfect.High quality.
Not as nice as my original one which finally quit after 8 yrs.  The quality of this one is cheap and the on/off button sticks.  They say change is good but this updated change isn't.
I had an older version that had the meats listed by category which was really nice. but this one works and I like that even more
Did everything it was supposed to do. I took off 1 star because of the display. It was very hard to read anything with it on the grill outside. A little bit of sun and it is nearly impossible to see the digits. Indoors it is awesome.
I like this timer/ thermometer because it has a large clear display and it tilts up. Perfect for everyday use. The thermometer probe is long enough to insert into large roasts.
My $40+ CDN, knit metal-cabled probe thermometer died when I dropped it into a sink full of water. I bought it at a restaurant supply house where such a device is sold to restaurants and is intended to be used all day long. When such products are used all day in professional settings, but are also sold to the public, such products are also known as "Prosumer," the term deriving from a combination of the terms professional and consumer.Today's modern cooking techniques, roasting or baking in particular, can be greatly improved by using culinary thermocouple thermometers, called probe thermometers, such as this Taylor model with its four foot plastic sheathed cable. The low cost of such thermometers makes them accessible to almost everyone. They assure accurate cooking temperatures and roasting or baking outcomes because the oven door can remain closed keeping oven temperatures constant during the baking/roasting/braising period. Also, I use mine to measure brewing temperature when using my Frieling French press coffee maker.I replaced my old thermometer with this cheaper, purely mass-market consumer grade Taylor product. The main feature that makes this Taylor model different from my professional CDN model one is the thermocouple probe with its plastic covered cable instead of the CDN's knit-metal cable...a much more durable choice.Why did i go cheaper in price and quality? Because I do not use a probe thermometer as much as hitherto due to changing my diet...less meat and therefore less roasting, so a cheaper one for occasional use seems more appropriate. It works just fine, but some other reviewers here complain about cable durability. If you use such a thermometer that much, go with the knitted-mesh metal cable design: higher-end CDN, Taylor, or Polder models do come with such a cable.Recommended for occasional use, with its plastic sheathed cable...therefore, four stars.I hope this was helpful to you. If you have questions, please reply in the Comment section below...I would be glad to help.________________________________________________________________________________________MY BLOG: thegoodstuffreviews.blogspot.com
I use this most often during the holidays.  Great little thermometer.  I have purchased some as gifts also.  Would purchase again.
I could not ask for an easier to use product that did exactly what I needed it to do.Set it and forget it. Very simple instructions, very easy to use. The turkey came out perfect. I look forward to using it with other meals. Hopefully it will last a few years but for the price you can't go wrong.
This thermometer does a great job - it was designed by someone who knows what is needed for great smoking.
I bought this for home brewing to keep a constant monitor on temperatures during different stages of the process.  The alarm when it reaches a set temperature is very useful as is the timer feature.  My only concern is that last night while cooling a batch of beer it was reading a different temperature than I got off a conventional glass thermometer.  I'll have to check now on it's accuracy and see if it needs calibrating or something.
The meat thermometer is easy-to-use, and the magnetic base makes it easy to place the main unit close to the oven or the grill.  The probe is a bit long, making it awkward to place for smaller pieces of meat, but this is a minor inconvenience.  So far, I've used it about 10 times, and it has worked well.
I have not had or used this timer/thermometer a ton but I am very impressed with its ease of use.  This simple little gadget makes me smile everytime I use it because it is just so easy to set and walk away from without a worry.  I do kind of wish you could set the timer and the thermostat at the same time but on the other hand it may not be as easy to use if this was the case either.Durability is very important to me too so I want to be clear I have only used a dozen or so times but I have no reason to think it will not be at this point.  I am most concerned about the probe based on other reviews but so far it has worked perfectly even in hotter then 350 oven.  The part you stick into the meat is kind of long but I have found ways to make it work without too much trouble so far.If the probe fails me I will write a follow up review but for now I just can't give it less then four out of five stars if for no other reason then how perfect the user interface is.
We bought this as a replacement to a unit we had for about 8 years that stopped working. This one works well too.
Have only used it a couple times.  I've heard about the probe issues when heat is excessive so I've been trying to be careful.  For the price, it works great.
I purchased three of these to be used when I am using my smoker. So far they have performed well. They were all calibrated correctly based upon temparature agreement with a higher end thermometer that is calibrated at both 32 and 212 degrees F. The timer is an added bonus that has helped build my cook time datasheet.The only reason it got 4the stars instead of 5a is that the unit is neither waterproof or water rwsistant. I cook outdoors and have to seal it in a freezer bag when it is raining or snowing.
Used the Taylor Digital Cooking Thermo today for the first time and found it EZ to figure out and reliable in roasting turkey breasts. The timer feature worked as I expected and the birds were properly cooked. To soon to see if  the probe survives the oven heat, but I don't have high expectations. All else does what I need so it's a fair price for a good product.
The first one I got had a crack in the screen but Amazon replaced it very quickly.  This is a handy thermometer to have if you make lots of roasts, whole chickens, etc. in the oven.  It worked great for me!
My husband really likes this for checking the temp of meat.No more constant checking and heat loss from doing it the old way.I thought it had a longer warranty though.
It worked for 6 months.....quit.......I paid the postage to return it and they replaced it and now guess what?? Won't work again.  I love the item just wish it would work longer.  I use it to make cheese and yogert and need a reliable thermometer that will last!  I have not mishandled it or misused it and would love another but????????
A beautifully made piece of equipment that simplifies cooking.  I would prefer that the time count either up or down, but I may be the only cook who thinks so.  Also, the instructions say that the thermometer should not be left in an oven hotter than 350 DF.  That would rule out use in my indirect cooking grill.  I have not tried it yet.
WITH THE COST OF FOOD GETTING TO BE SO EXPENSIVE. IT'S A SHAME NOT TO COOK IT TO PREFECTION AND THAT IS WHAT THIS THEMOMETER HELPS TO DO.
I picked this up on a whim when I broke my candy thermometer. It met my expectations. I'm nervous about the future and how well the probe will hold up based on the other reviews but time will tell.
I just got this thermometer for my son-in-law who likes to grill.  I have had one for about two years.  I was a little hesitant after reading the reviews.  However, most all the reviews of similar thermometers were the same.  I have been very careful with mine not to leave it in the oven for a very long period of time or in my smoker for long periods and so far I have had no problem with the temperature probe.
...to estimating or hoping it's done because it "looks done."The cord from the sensor to the timer is a little short for my needs. But it's invaluable for cooking food perfectly and never having to worry if I'm going to give my family undercooked food.Remember when using this temperature sensor: always set it for a few degrees UNDER what you want the food to be. Once the food is taken out of the oven, it continues to cook, and you don't want an overcooked meal.I'm buying this for my brother's girlfriend and I know it's a great gift she'll actually use.
I used this as a timer, have used it to track smoker temperature outside, several roasts and such in the oven, and to test internal temp on chicken, pork, turkey, beef roasts etc.It is very convenient being able to set a target temp and have the alarm go off, so you can just sit back and relax vs., checking every 15 minutes with a stick in thermometer.Was worried the probe or wire would melt, but they are rated to over 400 degrees and although discolored now, they are not worn through or have any sort of breaks and tears in the wiring.I also have one of those probe thermometers by Taylor. The battery died in less than a year and when I tried to open it up and change batteries the screw cover snapped a part and would not lock closed.This Taylor thermometer has been 10x better.
The first time I used this thermometer it was fantastic!  The second time I used this thermometer, after the temp got above 140 deg, the display just read Lo.  I changed the batteries just in case, but until I turned it off, removed and reinserted the probe, nothing changed, it read the temperature for a while, then switched back to "Lo" and then back and forth with a temperature reading; very frustrating...I contacted Taylor, they said they would send a new probe.  I hope that helps, this would be a great item if it just worked.I called the manufacturer (Taylor) about this problem, they were immediately responsive and helpful.  They sent me a new temperature probe and I ordered a spare at the same time.  I sealed the end of the probe with high temp silicone and haven't had a problem since.  I now would heartily recommend this item.
We purchased this as a replacement for our original Taylor Digital Thermometer; it was nearly 10 years old! Our only recommendation is that you do NOT use the magnet to attach it to the oven. Excess heat from the oven vents may damage the plastic coating. We've used it quite a bit and think it works just fine; good bang for your buck!
I use this in my smoker to dial in the temp as accurately as possible. As long as the probe does not touch metal it reads accurately. If it touches metal the temperture fluctuates constantly by as much as 100 degrees. I've heard some people say they have had issues with their probes. I have used the same probe that came with the unit for over six months now with no problems. I only use it for my smoker (less that 300 degrees) so that may be a contributing factor. Also I love the alarm and timer functions. I set the alarm to sound when the smoker is at  the perfect  temp to add meat, reset it to sound if the temperature gets too high, and then set the timer. The magnetic base also keeps it exactly where you put it.
I love this thermometer.  I will wait to see its durability.My polder folded under easy use.I like the fact that it does not have preprogrammed meats.  I just want a temperature - I know how hot to cook things.BUT if you did not there is a chart on the back of the thermometer.
I am using this thermometer to make cold process soap.I didn't realize until I started using it that I wanted to temp alert to work in reverse of cooking applications.  I want to know when my lye water has cooled down to a certain point.  So when I rest the probe in the lye water and I set the gauge at 110 and it starts at 170, it begins to beep because my lye water is more than done cooking.  Oh well.  This is not the fault of the manufacturer, of course.  I have been using it for over a month in corrosive material and it is still going strong.
We use this on the grill mainly.  It was originally purchased to use with a turkey fryer but the cord seems to be made of a plastic-like material.  We use it on the grill and it did get black and charred but has worked relatively well.
We so loved this gadget that we ordered two more for the other cooks in the family. It is accurate, forgiving and simple to use. No more cutting and guessing whether the meat is done . . . and no more criticism from my spouse, at least about that.
This was a gift to my daughter-in-law at her request. She reports that it works great. She did find the alert tones rather annoying but otherwise she is very satisfied with it.
I like the thermometer but miss the low temps so I can check my freezer!  It works  great in my oven.
Maybe I got lucky, but my Taylor 1470 withstood about three years of very consistent use ( I am chicken paranoid and this ensured that my poultry is always cooked through but not overdone.I have definitely used it at temps higher than 390 as I do a lot of roasting and I didn't have any problems until it died one day when I was trying to roast a chicken. I am buying another one, but I think it did a fantastic job for something that cost less than $20.
This is a great device.  Stick it in a slab o' meat on the grill or smoker, and wait for the alarm to go off.  No need to continue lifting the cover or poking the meat to see if it's done.You will get some discoloration of the braided cable, particularly if you use it on a smoker.  The residue looks bad, but I didn't see an impact on the performance.I did learn a hard lesson, though - it appears the probe is not waterproof. I submerged the probe to measure the temp of water in a large pot.  The thermometer didn't work correctly after that.  Thanks to "A Kitchen & Housewares enthusiast" for the information on buying replacement probes.From my experience with the Taylor 1470, you'll find this a useful item in your kitchen tool collection.
This works fine but is larger than the 10 year old Poldor it replaced. I bought it due to it's lower price.  Remember that this model is not to measure oven temperature but the food in the oven.  Also, that the probe/cable are not water proof when you clean them.
It seemed more versatile than all in one without a probe. That being said it seems the probe is probable the weakest point.The on/off button seemed  to have problems.
In my business I need a thermometer/timer and this one has worked well for me.  Went the batteries wear down you get an inaccurate reading.  There is no way to calibrate. One of the first two that i bought, the thermometer is inaccurate, I think it might be the probe.  The new ones have a new type of probe.
does a great job of reading temp quickly. only beef I have is that the housing around the display looked like it was spreading apart near where it hinges. However, this doesn't appear to affect functionality.
The price was right and I'd been recommended these by other BBQ'ers on a forum.  So far so good.  Nice design with being able to set the display at different angles.  Makes it easy to read the display on whereever I'm standing.  The probe wires have a rubber coating vs. a steel mesh that most of my other digital thermometers have, so not sure how they're going to hold up over time and being used on my heavy metal smokers with heavy doors that rest on the wires.  We shall see.  But they've worked great so far.  Very happy.
I keep going back to this type because:1) Their customer service department sent me a replacement probe. Yes--believe it--a service dept. that does the job!2) The temps are more accurate than on-board oven thermometers and any non-digital thermometers.3) The numbers are BIG. Who wants to squint?Here's why I can't give it five stars: They don't last more than about three years. First the display gets dim, even with fresh batteries, then it goes blank completely.
I love this gadget. I like how accurate it is and it's fast w/a reading. Now knowing the interior temperature of the meat I'm cooking, Especially with pork or chicken. I like that the safe temperatures for the meat are right there on the back so I don't have to go hunting for it. I know right away what the temperature is.It is a little more complicated than I'd like. I guess maybe I should have shopped for something a little more simple, but that's not the fault of the product, just the user :) I need to spend more time reading about how to use it.
It's small, effective and does its job. I haven't experienced the issues that other people are having such as failures after the first use, so I'm pretty happy.
I've wanted a probe thermometer for a long time because I'm tired of my roast "spouting like a whale" (in the words of Alton Brown) after I've stuck the instant read into it four times in ten minutes waiting for that perfect temperature.  I looked around here on Amazon and found that ALL the probe thermometers received mixed ratings, but the conclusion seemed to be that the Polders are junk so I bought this one by Taylor.I used it for the first time tonight and so far I absolutely adore it.  The roast came out absolutely perfect and the timer alerted me to that fact with a nice loud beep.  No spouting whales!I understand from the reviews that the probe isn't likely to last all that long, but you know, if I can keep turning out perfect roasts and chickens for even six months, it's worth the inexpensive price.  I'd pay more than that to not have to worry about ruining a $100 prime rib roast at Christmastime.  (Almost happened -- I was unable to find a probe thermometer in stores and had to buy an old-fashioned dial meat thermometer, and to my horror on Christmas morning I discovered the LOWEST temperature setting on it was 135 degrees.  We eat our meat rare and it comes out of the oven at an internal temp of 110 and coasts to 120 before carving.  By 135, which the meat thermometer said is "rare" it'd have been shoe leather.  I had to use the guess-and-check method and fortunately I guessed right the first time and the prime rib came out beautifully.  The experience scared me into buying this Taylor.)The reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because for some reason, while I was test-driving it last night, I couldn't figure out how to use the temperature alert feature at first.  I had boiled some water and stuck the probe in there, then set the alert to go off when the temperature had dropped by 10 degrees.  Instead of performing correctly, the alert would go off once a minute briefly and then shut off.  After some guess and check I figured out that it only works when the temperature alert is set to a number ABOVE the current temperature of wherever the probe is stuck.  It does not work if the alert is set to go off when the temperature has dropped to a certain point.  I have no idea if this is normal for the Taylor or I'm doing something wrong or my thermometer is defective.  It doesn't really matter to me because I don't need to use it to keep track of a food that's cooling rather than heating, but you might want to note it anyway.
After purchasing other thermometers, I stuck with this one.  The biggest problem is that when you turn it on or change the temperature it makes an obnoxious beep.  If there is a way to turn the sound off, I can't figure it out.  Also, I wish that it went up to a higher temperature so I can use it for broiling.
I like this thing. A lot. The only thing that made me drop this down to four stars is the fact that the probe isn't waterproof at all. I've gone through two of these things due to water damage after trying to use it for home brewing.The timer setting, temperature detecting alarm was absolutely perfect for what I was looking for. I could set the alarm to let me know when my mash reached the right temperature so it didn't get too hot or too cool. I really wish the company offered some kind of waterproof probe. For the price, it would have been worthy of ten stars.
Unlike others I have purchased this Taylor 1470 Digital Cooking Thermometer/Timer has an "on/off" switch to save the battery!  I like it very much.
Haven't used it yet, but believe it will be fine since the reviews were mostly good.
Very happy with this product.  I had a previous digital Thermometer that broke after about 10 years of service.  These are great and use all the time because it's so easy to use.
a good buy at ... than the competition. And how often does a cook really need a constant read thermometer (as opposed to the instant read I usually use). It works well for turkey, the sole reason for it's purchase.
I've only used it twice.  So far, so good.  I like the temperature alarm feature.  Set it and forget it.
Overall, very good.  The on/off switch is not smooth.  It may become so with time (no pun intended).  Other than that, works well.  Taylor has a strong reputation.
Works as expected and appears to be accurate. The probes on these thermometers don't last long, I usually expect to get about 18 months from one before it needs to be replaced, but that's a small price to pay for the confidence that comes with always having perfectly cooked food.This is not an instant read thermometer, but rather something to be inserted into food at the start of cooking and then used to monitor progress once in the oven. It has a timer and a temperature set alarm that lets you know when a set warmth is reached. No cook should be without one, and this is as good as any available.
We bought this a while back and it worked well for a few years.  We really liked it because it has the timer as well as the thermometer and it was in larger print so that you could see it easily from across the room.  The main issue with ours was the thermometer.  That part of this instrument just stopped working properly.  It would not read correctly so we had to stop using it as such but we are still able to use it as a timer so it's not a total loss.  If it still worked completely I would give it 5 stars but since part of it stopped working I took one off.  Still when we first purchased it, it was only about ten bucks so it was worth the price we paid for it then and it did work well for a couple of years so not a bad purchase at all.  If you can get a deal on it then I would snap it up!
I am very pleased with this thermometer/timer.  After struggling to prepare well-cooked roasts and chops that aren't over-cooked, I decided to shell out for a probe thermometer.  So long as the probe is well-placed before going into the oven, on the grill, or in the skillet on top of the stove, I get consistent results.  The temperature guide on the back of the timer is handy to ensure meat is cooked to a safe temperature without being under or over cooked.  Finally, I'm cooking pork chops that aren't tough and dried out!
The thermometer works well.  We have had several - however the probes tendto fail after a few years and are hard to find separately.
This device works as advertised. Very reliable, good size buttons, seems accurate, and great value.The only complaint is that the probe has one of those nomex-wrapped cables, not a metal cable. Thus, it burns at temps over 390F, or so.
I really don't know how to rate this because I purchased it as a gift for my Grandson for Christmas!!
It works ok. One problems is it only works on something very thick or whole chicken. If you want to check something like &#34;a burger, brat, steak it is not accurate. Temp range is good. I did use it to check my refrigerator temp it reads as low as 32F. So i actually left it in there for a few day adjusted my Fridge temp. It saved me money because i had my temps at 33-34 and now it is 36-37. A couple degrees can save a lot of money.
LOVE IT - now hubby can't ask me if meat is really done!  He uses it too.UPDATE. After using this for about 7 months it started malfunctioning. I would turn it on, and it would read 300 degrees. Off and on again and it read 30+ degrees. Not cool. So I got an instant read thermometer and used the timer on the device. Okay- after burning several meals I realized that something was up with the timer. It was running slow. I chucked it. I now use my 8.99 thermometer and my microwave timer.Get something different.
Have only used it once and it performed as advertised. More uses are necessary to determine durability of the sensor.
We really like this product in terms of design and features, but had an issue with it.  A few days after this product could no longer be returned to Amazon, we used the probe temperature feature to monitor bread temperature as we baked it, and the thermometer didn't display the correct food temperature.  In fact, it read about 80 degrees too low.  We then tested it in both hot and boiling water, against an old thermometer using the same probe, and indeed, that was what was going on:  it was consistently reading about 80 degrees (Fahrenheit) too low.Since returning the unit to Amazon was no longer an option, I wrote to the manufacturer, Taylor Precision Products.  The very next day I received a reply stating that they would mail out a new unit to me.  I was amazed that they were that responsive.  I wanted everyone to know this, because it speaks very well of the company that makes the product.
This a duplicate of a thermometer that I bought a few years ago.  It works well for me and I recommend it for anyone to use in their oven or on the grill.
We use this daily in the kitchen.  Great for all meats and liquid testing as well.  Very accurate and like that the probe can be inserted into the meat the oven door or grill can be closed and you will get accurate readings.
Good price. All the features I needed for home-brewing. Checked the temperature reading against a different thermometer and the two matched.
Great product.  Very accurate temp readings, darn near "instant read" -- only requires 1 or 2 seconds to equalize.  The only downside is the probe.  The probe itself is stainless steel and thus is waterproof, but the junction where the probe meets the cable with connects it to the LCD display is instantly ruined by only a few drops of water.  Do not fully submerge the probe/cable, and don't let steam moisten it, and you'll get years of service out of the product.  I imagine a few dabs of waterproof epoxy or silicone could easily solve the weak point.  This is my second one, and I don't regret the buy.  Dirt cheap for the quality.
I periodically get one of these every few years as the technology gets better.  So far this is my favorite.  I also have a smaller probe that I use intermittently with this to test the true center.
Had one a lot like this tho not quite as good.  Was hurting bad without it.  This one replaces and then some.
Fast Shipping. Product is simple yeat very useful. It works great for all types of meats although a value for Turkey would be useful.
This is a decent unit unless you expose the prong cable to heat, or pressure. They get damaged quite easily. You can buy replacement probes, which I do, but I wish these were more durable, and better insulated. As far as accuracy, and reliability reading wise, it seems to be spot on.
If you are a serious cook this is a must have item...From seafood to Hamburgers with the Temperature Probe Know exactly when they are done without over or undercooking..Timer is very easy to use also..You do need to be careful with the Temperatur Probe because It can't handle too much heat
Bought this to use for homebrewing which involves boiling water. It looked like it worked ok, but I'm pretty sure the probe got toasted by the water. I've read you can waterproof it with fishtank silicone tubing. If you're buying for homebrewing, I have to recommend investing in a more expensive unit with a standard modular thermocouple probe.Otherwise great though.
I have had the Taylor 1470 thermometer/probe for a couple of years, thanks to Alton Brown's Good Eats.  When I purchased it, I found it to be great for a novice cook like me.  This past New Year's Day, I was cooking a ham and it failed to record the temperature.  Having depended on it to work, needless to say the ham was overcooked.  To top that off, my aunt stepped on the cord and it pulled away from the end of the probe.  From the critiques, it appears that the probe is the problem and I will be ordering a couple more for the price that one of the thermometers would have cost to purchase.  Hopefully, I will be back in business again as when I did use it, meats turned out perfectly.
If you don't want to keep opening hte oven to see if your food is done, this thermometer is perfect.It beeps when you set the temperature.  Easy no guessing or cutting up your food to see if its done.
I used this thermometer on Christmas on a 16 lb turkey and thought it worked great.  It provided a consistent temperature and cleaned up easily.  There were no issues with the probe reading but only used it once.
The thermometer has only been used a couple of times since I've had it, but, so far it performs as advertised.  Easy to use and accurate.
this is the best cooking thermometer for such a low price, BUT...the seal on the thermocouple (probe) needs to be improvedif you buy this model, get some silicone sealer of &#34;shoe goo&#34; or something similar to stuff in around the wire where it goes into the metal tip. If you don't keep liquids out of the probe tip it will loose all accuracy soon thereafter
FIRST: i am VERY PLEASED with this therm. i make candy sauces which require precision temp for edible results. it's always been a sort of hit or miss operation for me before, requiring a lot of babysitting to make sure i get the temp just right. for the first time ever, i'm not only making perfect sauces everytime but i'm not tied to the stove. the very audible ring allows me to do other things around the house while waiting.the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5?because its requires some creativity to attach it to the pan in a way that keeps it suspended in the liquid.i'm so pleased i was going to send one to my mom via this web site. that's when i stumbled upon these disagreeable reviews. puzzled that i was getting such good results with mine amid all these complaints, i measured the 'boiling point' of water as well, and several times it came out at 210 F. that's when my chem backround kicked in. i remembered...(and here's where my second point comes in)SECOND: for those of you who complained about it's accurracy, it's important to keep in mind that the real world boiling point of water is contingent on several factors including the purity of the water (i.e. softening salts), elevation, humidity and room temp. all will affect the final outcome. there is a wide variation (with 208F (97.7 C) being within the range) in the 'true' temp of boiling water. if you dont believe me, you can visit:[...] /index.htmlthis web site is challenging schools around the world to measure the boiling point of water, and has posted some of the results.i challege you to try something other than water that requires a measure of accuracy and see if you still have problems.
My probe has expired after 4 years and I am immediately replacing the unit. It performs perfectly as a bread, meat and fish thermometer. It is NOT an oven thermometer - despite being called that. If you use it that way you will 'fry' it. It MUST be immersed in food. It's upper temperature range is more than adequate for fish (135), Beef (150), Chicken (165) or bread (195). The highest I would use it is as a sugar thermometer. Do not let the probe tip come into contact with the oven sides or grills or pan bottoms. Local hot spots will destroy it.I do not really care if the thermometer is accurate, just repeatable. You learn the temperature you want for the way you like it. For example if I bake bread to 185, the inside is moist but the outside is soft and there is a slight yeasty flavor. At 205 the outside is hard but it will become stale (hard) inside very quickly. I may have to adjust my knowledge for the next one I buy, but I suspect not.
I don't use the thermometer for cooking . It is used for a generator to monitor the exhaust temp. It works so far . that's all I can ask for .
I used this to measure temperatures for brewing beer. It worked great at first, but I had submerged the entire probe (past the wire) into liquid. This caused the readings to go wildly off. Then I found out that you can fix this (if it happens by accident) by placing the probe in the oven at 350F for 20 minutes to evaporate the moisture out of the probe (I saw some moisture bubble out of the connection from the wire to the probe).Other than that, the unit functions well, at first thought that you had to physically press the up/down buttons to change target temp, but recently realized that you have to press it for a little longer than you would think. Magnet holds well on a metal surface.
Works great. Like the magnets on the back for grilling.
