Very disappointed in these plates - they are tiny, more appropriate for a tea party than for a kid's lunch.  Returned them.
I bought these pans hoping they were the same as an old Ekco pan I have used for years to bake my home made pizza. The old pan I have is black and has"Best" on one handle and "USA" on the other. These pans came to me with some dents and dingys in them even before I used them. Although the crust got brown it did not get crunchy as it does in my old pan. Price is cheap....the pans are cheap.Just more made in China trash.
It is definitely not one of the best OXO products.  The one we had in our apartment came apart: the plastic part of the handle separated from steel. The cutting wheel is inadequate for good slicing because it is small and flimsily attached to the handle.I used to work in a pizza place and have sliced plenty of pizzas.  Based on my experience I would recommend looking for a pizza slicer with a large cutting wheel that is firmly attached to a solidly built handle.One more tip: when slicing pizza hold your pizza wheel at about 75-degree angle in relation to a table - your pie won't slide around then!
This thing scoops out rock hard ice cream so easily. I've gone through many ice cream scoopers and I stuggled with all of them. Yes, it is more like a slab of ice cream than a scoop, but if it's going in a bowl and not a cone, then so what. No more letting the ice cream sit out for 10 minutes.*UPDATE*I should have updated this a while ago, as I threw this thing out a long time ago. It's coated in some non-stick material that I noticed flakes of in my ice cream. Since it's only used for ice cream, I can't imagine what caused it to flake off. It never goes in the dishwasher, either. I still love the design, but I'm not interested in eating teflon, or whatever they use to coat this. One star, not five!
the hinges broke after I pressed to crush the garlic. To the trash it goes. Now I use a small food processor to crush my garlic its easier and can crush a lot at one time.
This is junk, made of cheap pot metal. Like another reviewer said, we wrote off the first one breaking but then the second one broke doing what it was supposed to do.It's a nice looking product but don't waste your money.
I bought this press about 8 months back, using it only about once a week.  Today, it simply snapped in half while I was press a couple of medium cloves!  Oxo products are usually well-made, but this is a "lemon."
I was really surprised when this thing snapped.  The metal insides don't look like stainless at all, it's more like crappy pressed metal.  Weak.
This garlic press is next to useless.  I tried to press a whole head of garlic, one clove at a time, and the press was so ineffective that I ended up chopping all the garlic by hand.  Usually, a garlic press works at least a little but this one hardly even bled any juice out of its holes.  I tried whole cloves, half cloves and even quarter cloves.  I even tried pressing two cloves at a time.  Nothing worked.  I ended up throwing the press away and am ordering a new one - definitely a different brand.
I purchased this garlic press to replace an old cheapy garlic press I bought at the local grocery store years ago.  I liked the way my old one worked but it had a separate tool to clean out the holes in the press that I was constantly losing.  Without the little cleaning tool the garlic would not come out of the holes unless I poked them clean with a toothpick or old tooth brush.  When I saw the cleaning tool attached to this garlic press I though my problem was solved and I replaced my old press with this one.  What a mistake! Yes clean up is easier, but that is the only good thing I have to say about this product.  It requires far more hand strength than my old one and when I am pressing garlic it leaks the "juice" out the top and it ends up running down my arm (I love garlic, but not so much that I want to smell like it when I am done cooking).  These two things alone would not be enough to make me hate it; they would just be annoyances to put up with if the thing actually worked, but it does not work.  Every time, without fail, it leaves a touch over an eighth of an inch of smashed garlic inside the press.  While a touch over an eighth of an inch may not sound like much, you must understand it is over the whole surface of the inside of the press.  It takes the garlic, smashes it flat over the whole surface and then, if it is still thick enough, begins pressing it through the holes.  As a result, if you are using a small clove of garlic, 98% of the garlic stays inside the press and never gets pressed out through the holes.  If you want to actually get a small clove of garlic through the holes you need to add another clove so there is enough thickness to push the first clove through.  It is so aggravating.  If they had called this a garlic smasher I would sing its praises because it can smash garlic with the best of them.  But since this is suppose to be a garlic press I am throwing mine away and trying my luck with another brand.
As well as the annoying storing water in the handle (mentioned in other reviews), mine flat out broke.  It couldn't take the pressure of use and snapped the metal at the handle.  The cast metal parts didn't fit well into each other, either.Comfortable, yes.  But the grips are useless when they're on two different pieces.
It's really sad to read all of these reviews and see the same thing I went through. The majority of my kitchen gadgets are Good Grips, and I love them. These presses worked great for a while. The first one developed a crack at the hinge and stopped working properly so I threw it out. Tonight, my second one split at the hinge. These things feel really solid, but the cast metal they are made with doesn't seem to be strong enough.
I only owned this for a year or so and it already broke.  But I didn't like it anyway because of the leaking handles.
I collect all types of Garlic related items ,,, old and new. But I do want items that are functional and stand the test of time. Since I use alot of garlic in my cooking in my cooking forays I don't have a use for dysfuntuol tools. Thanks for the warning''' Pigfarmer
The garlic press was functioned reasonably well and cleaning was straightforward, but it didn't last nearly long enough.  Disappointing 1/5 stars.
This thing does not work well.  You could be pressing a massive garlic clove and you will hardly get any garlic coming through the holes.  Its not a tight fit so most of the garlic is wasted and squished to the sides.  I also managed to break mine so the 'self-cleaning' nubs do not line up with the holes any longer.  Buy something else!!
i used to like oxo products a lot.  oxo utensils i bought more than five years ago are still working and looking like new.  most i've bought in the last three years, i've thrown out.the reason is the same for them all--and one of the reasons i got rid of the garlic presses--the handles take on water in the dishwasher and then leak that water into whatever you're mixing.  just what i want in my food, stagnant water.as for the presses, there was a secondary reason--the results of pressing the garlic cloves, which have to be peeled to be pressed in the oxo presses, clumped in the pan when they were sauteed.  if i didn't want lumps of semi-burned garlic, i had to spend as much time separating the pressed garlic as i would have spent in mincing it.this is not a product i would recommend.
This thing broke after a couple of months.  I recently started to notice it wasn't pressing easily and then suddenly the entire hinge broke snapping the arms apart.  What a piece of junk!  Don't waste your money or time.
I had a Zyliss Susi Garlic Press for many years and just loved it.  However, I lost mine during a move.  I tried this OXO model and was very disappointed because it just did not work. More garlic comes out the sides of the press than out the front and you have to use a knife to scrap the garlic into your dish. It is just useless with garlic splattering all over everything.  I have found OXO products to be cheaply made and poorly designed.  I needed a garlic press in a pinch but learned a valuable lesson - you get what you pay for especially when it comes to kitchen utensils.
I've had two of these break on me now after normal use; the hinge gives way during the "cleaning" process.
This was used twice before the built in hole-cleaner broke.  I put it in the dish washer, and when I removed it, they had all broken off.  What a waste of money.
I have used this garlic press for a few years, it is too small and never really did a good job of pressing out all of the garlic. It would expel juice and a few bits of garlic. It did not work well at all with unpeeled garlic. But, it was better than anything else. I used it today for 1 clove, the mesh portion through which the garlic is pressed broke in half, and one piece of mesh fell out of the press. I had really expected it to be stronger than that. I will try something different now. Probably the KUHN model, there doesn't really seem to be a perfect garlic press out there, but the reviews for the KUHN look promising.
I owned my garlic press (which I purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond)  for several years. Eventually, the red platic part started to wear down (due to heat from the dishwasher, I suppose -- but these things are supposed to be dishwasher safe) and the hinge broke. I expect garlic presses to last forever -- especially if you pay upwards of $10 for one. I'm looking to buy a new one on Amazon.com now... Hopefully I find something better, but it is dependent on finding reviews, so I figure I'd give back to the community with my own review.  Happy shopping!
I love oxo products. I have a whole kitchen full of them.This garlic press is not as good as their other stuff. First of all, its not made of metal. Its made out of silver painted material (plastic?).Thus, if you put in a big clove, or dont peel the clove or maybe it just wears out, yours will break.I actually am on my 3rd one of these. The first snapped in half. Oxo replaced it no problem. Then the 2nd broke in the same way. Oxo replaced again. Now I have a 3rd. I hope this one lasts longer. The first 2 made it 6 months on average.So to sum up, its not a good press. Buy one made of metal. And if yours is broken, call OXO for a replacement.
i had the same problem with our OXO good grips garlic press as many others here.1) the rubber handles needed to be taken off everytime we put this in the dishwasher.2) the red, plastic, cleaning attachment fell off of it too.so because of these two reasons it was a pain to get washed every time we used it. then yesterday, it broke and i had just bought it a year ago. it snapped in half! overall, it was not a pleasant experience. the next one i buy will have less attachments and a heftier construction.
I have had 2 'OXO Good Grips Garlic' presses.  It presses garlic nicely and feels good to hold, however, both of my presses broke (metal broke) within a year.  I currently need another press and am looking for a different brand.  I will never buy an OXO garlic press again.
Folks, I am a HUGE, HUGE fan of Good Grips by OXO but heed this and other reviews on Amazon... STAY AWAY from this garlic press!The day I received this press, I pushed the cleaning spikes through the holes to test it and two of the spikes broke off.  I immediately had to return this product.  What kind of cheap plastic are they using???  I couldn't imagine what would have happened if I actually had garlic or ginger in the holes!!It is entirely worth spending more on a garlic press than buying this inconsistent product.  ...
Made the mistake of purchasing the garlic press.  Didn't work.  Mashed the garlic into a pad of paste. So irritating to use, I checked their "warranty" and contacted OXO to return and was given a run around - forms to fill out, copy of original receipt, mail it back.  "Satisfaction" warranty is a fraud and a complete lie.  Jumped through their hoops.  Then a smug company rep called and told me it was "not their product" and I would have to provide a prepaid envelope if I wanted it back. No refund, nothing. I certainly don't want it back. Well, it was their product. Solution is simple. I will never, ever buy another of their products again. And my advice to everyone - pick another brand, any other brand.
Like many of the other reviewers, I have been a fan of OXO for years, and have purchased the Good Grips version of almost every item I've needed.  Bread knife, check!  Hairbrush, check!  So I bought their garlic press many years ago, expecting it to be as wonderful as their other items, and, before long, it broke.  I actually brought the broken one to their wholesale showroom in Manhattan, which probably no longer exists, and the replacement also broke.  So, this is one OXO item I would not recommend.
I have a bunch of Oxo stuff (like a mixing bowl and apple slicer and such) that has served me well for many years and I like them... so when my old garlic press finally died and I saw this one, I thought, "Hey great! It looks durable and I like Oxo." One of the handle grips snapped off on the first use, and even trying to work around that by gripping further up (and fueled by anger that it had ALREADY broken) I could still barely get any garlic to come out the holes - mostly it left a flattened garlic mush inside. SO disappointed.
I have now gone through two of these. In both cases the hinge snapped when crushing garlic. Amazing.  Additionally, the rubber handles have a tendency to slip off the metal and the hole cleaner actually makes the cleaning more difficult.
No matter what you do, the garlic press rusts! It got so bad that I had to throw it away.
At first, this seemed to be a nice, durable garlic press. However:1) The black handles come off after a few rounds in the dishwasher, revealing metal handles with sharp casting remnants. You can slide the handles back on, but they never stay properly.2) Mine just broke while pressing one, peeled clove -- the metal itself gave way near the hinge.Not recommended.
Too hard to press together to squeeze out the garlic.  This looked like a good idea with the cleaner built in, but I can not press all the garlic out.  This was a waste of money.  I usually love Oxo products, but not this one.  I reverted to my old Zyllis.
This garlic press isn't sharp enough to push garlic through.  Must use 2 hands and squeeze very hard to press garlic.  Wouldn't recommend this one..
Hardly used this press over the years...maybe a dozen time tops.  Last week I put two old/small cloves of garlic in and the handle broke right off.  I was stunned.
I've had three of these until I gave up on Oxo garlic presses. The first one broke close to the handle within two weeks of moderate use. The metal fatigued and cracked. I took it back to the store and with Oxo's lifetime warranty, at that time, it was exchanged immediately, no questions asked. Then I got a second, which lasted a few months until the same thing happened. But I really like the design of the thing: it fits a large clove or two small cloves at a time, it's is very solid (even if a bit heavy), and cleans easily - just rotate in the reverse direction, run warm soapy water through it, and it's clean. Very convenient, very sturdy, very effective at pressing the garlic (virtually nothing is squeezed out of the well, through the sides of the plunger). So I went for a third try. This last time, it worked like a charm for about 3 to 4 years, but then again, the metal cracked close to the handle. This is the final straw for me: if Oxo cannot figure out a way to make the tool durable, I don't see why I should have loyalty to the brand.
nobody shoudl use a garlic press unless they must.As far as it goes this is fine,  but do avoid if you can.
Trust the other reviews.  Mine broke just like the rest.Pros (before it broke) --  +4 stars.* Comfortable* Worked well (including the rubber bristle for cleaning the press)Cons -- -3 stars.* It broke in less than 3 months.  Head area snapped off.Overall: 1 star...
I dislike this press for three reasons, and I don't recommend buying it.  1) The ergonomic design is poor--there's virtually no leverage on the garlic clove, and it takes quite a bit of hand strength to operate, even for my husband. 2) The plunger does not press the garlic clove all the way through, so there is significant waste left behind. I constantly find myself having to add an extra clove to a recipe to account for the unused garlic that inefficient press leaves behind. 3) Lastly, the metal material used for the hinges is poorly made. Due to #1, bad leverage, I found myself having to press both handles of the press against the counter (instead of squeezing it in my hand). The first one I bought broke the entire hinge, and the second one bent the hinge. I'm usually a big fan of OXO products, but this one is a loser.
Rubber handle grips will first accumulate water and later they will start comming off. It's so annoying that you will have to throw them away. At the end the hindge will brake and you will regret that you have spent your dollars on it.
This garlic press works well and the cleaning feature is nice, until, as so many other's have found, it snaps.  It is made of "pot metal" a zinc alloy (non-toxic) but Oxo needs to redesign it because I am willing to bet that ALL the broken ones listed here broke in the same exact place.  Defective by design!Updated 11/3013.  I have bought a Zyliss Susi 2 Garlic Press here on zon and am in garlic heaven. I highly recommend the Zyliss.
I've had two of these and they have both broken at the hinge with only occasional use over a short time.  I like Oxo, too, but this product is not worth it.
I would expect for a kitchen tool to last for many years to come.  A garlic press has become a must have in my kitchen.  This garlic press is great if it would only stand the duration of time.  At the suggestion of a friend, a mortar and pestle could serve the same purpose as a garlic press along with its many other uses and is less susceptible to breaking.
Ours snapped, under normal use -- not at the hinge, but on the shaft connecting the handle to the sieve half of the press. You wouldn't think a thick stainless steel shaft could snap under hand pressure. And probably it couldn't. But this press is not made of stainless steel. Once it snapped, we could see that it was made of some kind of semi-porous composite material with a chrome finish that makes it look like solid metal.
The reason I'm online writing this review today is that I'm looking for another garlic press, preferably one that is not made of pot metal.I was using the my Oxo press today, loaded it with two cloves, gripped it in my left hand and squeezed.  The result was a snapped hinge where the hinge and body of the press are at their most narrow.  C'mon Oxo, a garlic press ought to at least be able to press garlic without disintegrating!I recommend that you should stay far away from this product.
I've had mine for a few years and liked it very much.  The reason was it's fast, does a good job, easy to get the remains out and easy to clean.I had two other presses but they were hard to clean and one had a very small basket. The OXO sidelined those two and was used for a few years until it broke.  It broke at the connecting swivel which was disappointing in such a simple device.
I purchased this OXO Garlic Press as it appeared to be very solid, and well-constructed.I use large quantities of garlic, and really appreciate a good garlic press.This is NOT a good garlic press!!!It breaks quite easily, as imposing as it appears..... one can only press a few, small peeled cloves at a time.It is also not as easy to clean as one would assume.I recommend the large ZYLISS garlic press. It will press unpeeled cloves, large cloves, and is much sturdier.I was quite unimpressed by my experiences with the OXO Good Grips, try ZYLISS- ***************
Worked fine until it broke...the handle snapped clear through after about 6 months.  A friend who's a metallurgist looked at it and told me the metal was defective....Won't buy this brand again!
For some reason, this did not pick up the crumbs at all, even on a tablecloth, so I returned it. Very disappointing.
Most drinks recipes call for measurments in even sizes-- 1 oz, 2 oz, or 3 oz. This jigger is a 3/4 oz and 1 1/4 oz measurments-- which is not a useful size for cocktails. Please shop around for a 1 oz and 1 1/2 oz size jigger-- which is the standard jigger size. As a consumer I also recommend to shop around for the best price.Also if you like this jigger because of the stainless steel material, not to fret. Most jiggers are made with the same grade 18/10 or 18/9 stainless steel.
The stuff is cheap looking, I think that's why there's no picture for it. the handles are plastic with a small red grip for &quot;ergonomic&quot; support. For a pedrini product, I'm disappointed.
One should not have any hot liquid in plastic. It is not good for you health. Why not use glass
Unbelievevably, I have actually used two of these over the years. My mother gave me the first one a few years ago when she came to visit. It looked very good, and we started using it to keep olive oil. It is quite handy to have a pouring-ready olive oil container on the counter!Well, shortly afterwards, we started getting frustrated by the fact that there was a constant ring of oil at the bottom of the can, right over the base (there is a 1mm rim around the base). I would clean it every time I used it - to no avail. Pretty soon we became accustomed to having an oil mark on the counter every time we put the oil can down - to the degree that we would be able to put it right back to where it was by aiming for the base print on the counter.Of course, I got quite frustrated -  I tried everything - cleaning the drip of the pourer every time I used it, cleaning the can itself, inspecting it carefully to look for a leak - nothing doing. My guess is that the welding is not high quality and there is always a light leak, which adds to the fact that every drop of oil staying on the tip when you pour makes it doing to the base and stays on the base ring. Eventually, my wife gave me a very good looking oil can for a birthday and we tossed the old can.Well, a few years later, I really needed another oil can (so as to have cooking oil at hand on top of salad oil salad oil)- I went browsing and found another one of these for a few dollars- I still can't believe that I bought it. Of course, within a day, I had realized my mistake. I bought another model right away and am waiting to find an opportunity to go to Goodwill to get rid of this one.So, don't do what I did - learn from my experience - don't buy this oil can, unless you intend to keep it to a decorative use only!Take care all,camisdad
This things leaks.  I mean it leaked about a cup over night.  Do not buy.
I was pretty excited when I ordered this egg/mushroom slicer, and it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The wires are so flimsy and loose that it could barely slice into a white button mushroom, and it couldn't pass entirely through any mushroom. To make matters worse, one wire came off entirely the first time I used it - the wires are barely secured to the tabs on either end of the cutting area. I'd love to get a high-quality slicer to save time when I'm cooking with mushrooms, but this model doesn't fit the bill.
This set of tiny tools is a rip-off. It looks and feels cheap with all the handles made of cheap plastic. You can clearly see the bumps on both sides of the jigger. That shows you the craftsmanship, or lack of it to be correct. I guess the formula now is to give a fancy european name to a lousy product and put it on the Internet with a hefty price. Buyers have no idea of its actual size just by looking at the picture. Also few people want to go through the hassle to return stuff purchased online. Stay away, you have been warned.
The product looked like it was well made but the service stank.After getting my package home and taking the rolling pin to my clay studio to test it out and go to work I discovered the pin would not roll properly - oh great it's damaged.  So I boxed it back up, took it to the post office and thought just a few more weeks then I'll have my rolling pin.  A few weeks past and I received another slip in my p.o. box that I have a package - oh great my rolling pin is here.  When I went to pick it up I was handed an empty box. (Great.......)  So I refuse the package, the p.o. sends it back to sender and I'm still waiting for some kind of response from Amazon.  Hello is anyone there...............I want my money back!
Ordered and received it.  When inspecting it, the bearings didn't roll smoothly and the shaft was not installed properly or was bent as the handles were not plumb.  The description says 3" barrel; however, upon measurement it was only about 2 3/4" and my knuckles dragged on the rolling surface.  I e-mailed Amazon, they contacted the seller, who contacted me via telephone.  I spoke with him and explained things and he said send it back.  I did and he called a few days later and said I was absolutely correct and he checked his inventory and discovered that many were the same way.  He is contacting his supplier.  He refunded my money and even return postage.  Great seller, bad product.
I don't know how this item is as a rolling pin.  I only know that it arrived poorly packaged, in a box too big for it, with barely any padding (just some crumpled paper) and it was cracked in half with marble "sand" in the package.  It is only a 10" barrel as others have mentioned.  Although Amazon makes the return relatively easy, it's still a hassle to deal with it and I still don't have a marble rolling pin.  I won't be ordering another one of these for fear that I will run into the same problem.
I was giving this marble rolling pin as a gift, Not opening it to make it easier to wrap. Finding when the  person opened it the marble on the rolling pin was broken in two! I was really upset to find I had given a broken gift.
i have had this rolling pin for a short amount of time, under 6 months) and it did not hold up at all.  At the ends the granite was wearing off into my food products.  Needless to say this is no longer being used.
This is not a 2-ounce/1 ounce jigger.  This is actually a 1.5 ounce(one shot)/ .75 ounce (1/2 shot) jigger.  Anybody looking for a 1ounce/2 ounce jigger, look elsewhere.
I was looking for a replacement for my present 120/220 volt immersion heater. Not familiar with this brand name I assumed it was for international use. Nope, works at only 120V. Conveniently misleading name. Seems to be the regular "Made in China" quality you'd find in any store selling cheap imported junk, and would cost about $3.
I located this product in a search for dye free food coloring.  After a call to the company, these produts are full of food dyes that are chemically based, not naturally based.  Beware if you are looking to keep dyes out of your food.
Was sad that it turned out to be artificial the description did not tell me that on-line.  I SO wish it had been real.
This product contained &#34;natural&#34; in the description. Therefore, taking this into account and based upon previous comments that the colors were vivid etc., I chose the product to decorate Christmas cookies. My children are sensitive to artificial sweeteners and chemical (artificial) food dye. After waiting nearly two weeks for the product to arrive the kids were beside themselves to begin. I immediately noticed no ingredient information was listed and by the smell and vivid coloring-they were NOT natural dyes. However, I live in an area in which it is difficult to procure less popular natural products and so I explained we could decorate one cookie each with them and try it.  After making the cookies we each tasted one. The over powering physical reaction that followed was unmatched by other artificial dyes we have encountered. The petro chemical taste on the back of the pallet was so intense it took a very long time to dissipate! Our faces puffed up, itched, and we began to feel nauseous and irritable. This lasted for several hours! If you or your children and guests are sensitive, or suspect they are, to chemicals and possibly artificial sweeteners-AVOID-this product! We had to throw the entire package away and our annual Christmas cookie decorating party was ruined.
Dried out within the first couple months, never even got to use them.
Why are you calling me Squoog?? and I thought I was getting organic. The reason I ordered it was because I thought it was all natural.
If you read my review on the plastic version of these you will now be looking at the aforementioned culprit.  The one star isn't for the item, the one I got was solid, zesty and well able to handle the corn within.  There was no problem with it at all.  The problem (and subsequent uno star accordance) is because I ordered and paid for four (I guess I could say fore, for four but that would be silly).  Amazon credited me of course, but the supplier did not have the other three so I couldn't reorder.  Next time I'll order 7 and pay for 3 in hopes they'll ship the other four to a landing zone close to my place or further out.  But then again I am very happy with the plastic ones I now have because the look like crystal from a distance, so I keep them on top of my television (next to my stainless-steel salad waggers) to impress my guests, which are few and far between.
I could understand if an item was out of stock...as long as I'm informed of that.  But my order was for a set of 4 and only one piece was sent...no explanation.  When I went back to Amazon to see if I ordered the correct item, the item description said that it was out of stock and availability not known.  Customer service at its worst.As far as Amazon goes, I have to give their customer service props for the prompt refund and paid return address label...customer service at its best.
The "Zojirushi 2.01-Quart Thermal Air Pot with Brew-Thru Stem Stopper" is nothing more than a prettied thermos. For a ($) you could get several regular thermoses which would perform the same function.Also, the "Zojirushi 2.01-Quart Thermal Air Pot with Brew-Thru Stem Stopper" was a bit too heavy (when empty.) This meant that carrying it around with clam chowder in it was a real chore.Furthermore, although the "Zojirushi 2.01-Quart Thermal Air Pot with Brew-Thru Stem Stopper" was spacious, it was cumbersome. It didn't easily fit into anything and had to be carried seperatly.Don't buy this glorified thermos. Just don't do it.
I bought this with the idea that I have a grinder and a coffeemaker in a space-saving design. Until the grinder broke and gave it to service...I obviously did have neither a grinder nor a coffeemaker.Also I want to point out that the coffee flavor is not exactly what I expected - the coffee is not real hot. Cleaning of the grinder is inconvenient.I definetely will go back to my faithful Braun coffeemaker (KF187)that I enjoyed for over 8 years without any single disappointment. And they have a great grinder as well.Consequently, only one star for the concept. The performance and convenience aspects are lousy.
Every review is VALID.Whether or not the owners manual has a &quot;disclaimer&quot;, the reality is key information was missed by the consumer. Capresso doesn't clearly identify that they test the machine prior to shipment. That's the problem. Capresso can fix the documentation just as they can fix the water leak... if they chose to.Capresso should put a sticker on the machine that reads &quot;Machine tested and may appear used&quot;.  It would save a few machines being returned for no good reason.
My wife and I are on our 3rd CoffeeTeam Plus in 2 weeks and we are very frustrated. We also read all the great reviews. It seems to me that happy consumers are glad to review products as it also validates their purchase, however, only VERY FRUSTRATED consumers post negative reviews. Guess which I am?? Here' the down side...Our first CT Plus came out of the box in "used" condition. It had water droplets in the bean storage area and  significant amount of coffee grind dust all over it. We immediately exchanged it.The second CT Plus also had coffee grind dust, but not as much. I then assumed they test the grinder prior to shipment and just can't clean all that coffee dust off.  We fired it up and were surprised when every pot of coffee generated a wet counter! The water leaks from the top, drips to the coffee warmer and onto the counter. I called Capresso and while they wouldn't admit to the problem, the second question after "what's the problem?" was "Is the water coming out of the top?" Hmmm, it seemed to me to be an educated question...maybe they've heard this before??!!! They immediately offered to replace it, but I preferred to take it back myself.Today is Day 3 for our 3rd CT Plus. This one has the same water leak. It is from the same spot - at the top between the basket and grind chute.Sadly, that's it. No more. We love the features of the machine, but can't live with the quality. It is also a dated design having been out some time now which initially concerned me. Just look at the carafe - it looks like it comes from the first Mr. Coffee. Why not round it out??Our previous coffee maker was a Cuisinart blade grinder/drip coffee maker. It's a decent machine for less than $100, but we went through 2 in 3 years and cleaning the machine is a real pain. The design forces you to clean & dry the whole blade grind area vs. the CT Plus.What's Next?  We're searching the Internet for an alternative. We love the auto grind features of the Capresso & Cuisinart, but there just doesn't seem to be another option. We are seriously consider taking the CT Plus back and purchasing the Capresso C1000, which is a super automatic at a cost of $.... It's not a drip coffee machine, but the reviews give it high marks for coffee - and great marks for espresso.  Good Luck!
I was thrilled when I bought this coffee maker.  It promised to do everything I needed.  Unfortunately, I had nothing but trouble with the grinder.  It clogged virtually everytime I used it.  I think I may have had  so many problems because I prefer dark roast coffees, which can be oily.
This Capresso coffee machine is NOT made in Switzerland,as advertised,but in Portugal?
lets put it this way - no matter how flat the surface it - it will leak out - then you'll have mutant pancake shaped pigs and cows
It broke during first use and after loads of oil the pancakes stuck to it and tore coming out.Doesn't work.
The picture does not match the description.  I wanted the picture.  They ripped me off.  Obviously it isn't worth the money to sent it back.
These scissors rusted almost immediately, as another reviewer indicates. We own a set of Wustof knives that after a decade are still pristine, other than the blades needing to be professionally sharpened from heavy daily usage, so we are familiar with the quality of high-end cutlery, which these scissors are not.What makes the experience particularly painful is the customer service we received from Lamson & Goodnow. We returned the scissors, at our expense, and shortly after sending them to the company, received a phone call that they received the scissors and were awaiting new stock to send us new ones. It's now been over a month, and we still don't have a replacement.My suggestion is to seek an alternative option when considering these scissors. The extra $20 for the Wustof brand would, in retrospect, be my preference :-(
These scissors are made in china. After hand washing them from first time use they started rusting.  I have never seen stainless steal do this. I guess I will to spend more money for true stainless steal quality.
I was really excited to get these shears after reading all of the great reviews.  I took them apart to clean them before using them for the first time and found that the nut holding them together is stripped.  They don't close fully, and fall apart when opened wide enough to cut.  I'm really disappointed since now I am still in need of some nice kitchen shears.
didn't even last the day of thanksgiving.
Don't waste your money on this. I'm on the second one as this first one was replaced under warranty. Found the real problem was the probes. I upgraded to the more expensive S/S wire probe which failed after a few uses. It makes a dandy timer but for measuring temperatures, forget it! I originally purchased this to use for my home brewing when cooking mash, the thermometer has failed at critical times forcing me to rely on a stem thermometer. I recently ordered the Chefs Alarm at more then 4 times the cost of this junk and hopefully it will be an accurate, dependable and long lasting quality instrument.
use it for 6 times and now it broke ang give me wrong temperature
The original version of this product, the *single battery* Taylor 1470 Digital Cooking Thermometer was stellar. It lasted me about 8 years until the probe wire finally gave out, which wasn't unreasonable considering the probe was used in severe conditions.Disappointingly, when Taylor shifted to this new version of the 1470, they discontinued the old probes. So my probe-less old version become worthless and I was forced to downgrade to this new dual-battery version of the 1470.This new version is awful. It has now died on me too - the main body of the unit gave out (it will no longer turn on), not the probe. And it failed to last even 3 years.And, while the unit &#34;worked&#34; (powered on) it was frustrating to use anyway. The push buttons would stick. You often had to shift to the &#34;On&#34; position of the slider switch multiple times to get it turn on. Etc.It's really too bad that Taylor replaced the previous version which was so wonderful with this dud version. I'd re-buy the previous version in a heartbeat. But I'd caution buyers to stay away for this current low-quality incarnation.
I bought two of these thermometers. One stopped working within 3 months (maybe used 3 times) and the other after 7 months (might have been used 15 times). I would not waste my money on them.I must add that the malfunctions were not due to faulty probes. The display does not show up correctly (can not read at all) and they turn themselves on and off whenever they want. At first I thought it may have been a battery issue, but it was not.
I used this a few times and the prob wire started smoking and filled the oven with a toxic smell. I had to throw away 30 dollars of food and now I don't have a themometer. The last one of these lasted several years before it failed. Also, the timer does not work. So all in all this is now just an ornament and it is after the return window so I am out of luck. It lasted around nine months using it 3 times a month.
A couple months ago, I bought TWO of these digital thermometers for my daughter and BOTH broke already! One stopped working after using it only 2 times! She says the problem is with the probes. WHY WHY WHY did I waste my money! This is the first time I've ever written a review but I have to warn people not to waste their money on these things!!  My daughter said:  "The ones you gave us recently have both broken (stopped reading temps - it always says "lo" or shows some absurd temperature and jumps around a bunch)."
You get what you pay for, I guess. This thing doesn't work at all - my ancient stick-probe with the analog dial is way more accurate. This Taylor model registers 20-30 degrees higher than my old reliable. So sorry I didn't keep the packaging so I could return the thing.
Well, I should have gotten it at Amazon at least - it's about $9 cheaper than it was at the store I bought it at. I LOVED it while it worked, but now all it says is "lo temp" even though I've changed the batteries several times. I've tried resetting it and everything under the sun. It's possible that I just got a bad one. That said, when it was working it was great and I was finally not over cooking my food. I would stick it in roasts or turkeys and they'd come out perfectly, or just check my chicken breasts as I was pan frying them without needing to cut them open. Here's hoping that if you get one you get better luck than I had!
This would be a great product if the probes lasted longer. I've been through two of these now and the probe on both of them died after a half dozen uses or so.
Well, it didn't arrive in time to use for the 2010 Thanksgiving, so I left it in the package.  Thanksgiving Day 2011, I opened the package and put in new batteries (not expecting the year old ones to work) and the display worked for about 3 seconds.  I Tried different batteries, and even the cheapo ones it shipped with.  Still doesn't work.  Wish me luck on returning it a year later...
Don't buy this product. I purchased two of the probes and under light use, they failed within 3 months.  Registered temperatures were also from 1-4 deg F off.  They are typical low-end, Chinese-made junk.  There are some good US and European-made products out there.  If you need a good temperature probe, these aren't the ones!  I also purchased two similar Pyrex-brand, also made in China, which are slightly better quality (They still work), but that measure temperatures inaccurately.
I bought 5 of them for my co-workers at work. So far after only less than 6 months, 2 of them are broken already. We use it to make gelato. It doesn't register the temperature anymore. It only says "Lo"While my friend's thermometer keeps blinking and blinking and sometimes it's just dead!I don't know what to say...
We chose this thermometer because of features. We liked the termperature range for making candy and for oven cooking. We liked the alarm. We like that we could monitor temperatures without opening the oven but we specifically bought the themometer for monitoring the thanksgiving turkey. The Celsius/Fahrenheit switch wouldn't stay on Fahrenheit without tape. We followed the directions. At first the probe worked beautifully. After about three hours in the turkey, the probe began to misread by about 61 degrees. As many people know, 61 degree with meat is the difference between raw and dry. We were cautious and got an overcooked dry turkey. I would pay an extra ten dollars just to have a way to calibrate the probe for accuracy. To figure out how inaccurate the reading was, I allowed the probe to cool to room temperature. According to the probe this was around 140f. Then I put the probe in iced water. Iced water should approach 32f, however, the probe read between 98 and 96. Tell me this isn't a problem. We could have adjusted for the difference but we were already 4 hours into cooking the turkey and lost all confidence. We will try again thanks to Target return policies. We will also probably buy an analog backup just in case.
Unfortunately, after 5 months of light kitchen work the thermometer does not work.  As other reviewers have mentioned the thermometer stops reading numerically and only registers the word &#34;low&#34;.  I, as of yet, have not tried to get a replacement from Taylor.  I hope to receive a replacement.  While the thermometer was in working order it was a great kitchen tool.
I have spent hundreds of dollars on the Taylor thermometer and replacement probes ... nothing precision - word which they should delete, about it.Currently experimenting with Cooper-Atkins, which so far seems to be working OK - has a heavier duty probe with a heavier price...so, we'll see.
Neither my husband nor I could make it work.  It displayed 8888888 but when we took out the batteries and put them back in, it worked briefly. When we turned it off and back on it didn't work,just displayed 8888888. It refused to respond to taking out the batteries and putting them back in.It's in the trash.  Don't waste your money.
bought this for turkey day, and after that, the timer stopped working.  I changed the battery and nothing.  Very disappointing in the quality of this.  At least let the time work!
This is made of cheap plastic.  I used it once, it never worked again!  Horrible product.  My Polder digital cooking thermometer lasted over 5 years.  I will never buy this brand and perhaps from this seller again!!
DO NOT BUY THIS THEY DON'T WORK VERY LONG! Got it for Christmas 2013. I had this same model that lasted 7 years. It was made in China too but feels much better quality than the new one. I only use it to watch the temperature of milk when making yogurt so it only needs to go to 185 then I am done. So I would not say it has worked hard the 3 months it has worked. I am going back to the cheap ones that you get for $10 that just show the temperature. I'll never buy one of these again. From what I have read on the reviews on all the digital thermometer/timers is that China can't make them anymore. (Be sure you read the most recent reviews, Amazon likes to mix them up you can tell by the date that the recent years the product is really bad- don't be fooled by the old reviews). It was not the chord, because I actually have a new one of those it is the thermometer itself, reads all over the place.
I used this ONE time to smoke some pork butts. Smoker temp never went higher than 225 degrees. Probe recorded accurately. Everything worked fine.Went to use second time and probe won't register any temp. Just blinks "HI" under temp screen. Reset unit several times, put in fresh batteries, wiggled probe around...nothing.Another piece of junk that does not perform as intended. Plus it's Made in China were quality control means it looks the same as the last one. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
Used 5 times in oven. Never put in dishwasher, weber grill etc.  Stopped working, changed batteries, reset etc.  Seems to be related to the probe.  Something else for the landfill.
I bought two.  Both were broken out of the package.  One would at least register a tempature, but stop working as soon as you put the alarm on.  One of the probe cords came out of the package in 10 pieces.
The thermometer worked great for me right until the cable got spliced by an oven door.  And no replacement cables for sale.  Would not recommend getting because it is too fragile.
This is the second one that I have bought (first was through a retail store).  The thermometer at the crimp (just before the bend in the solid metal part) continues to break making the temperature inconsistent. I will not buy this one again.
I bought 2 of these timers and within a month one stopped making any sound.  The other is so quiet you have to be right next to it to hear it go off.  Not worth buying.
this thermometer is consistanly 20 degrees higher than any other thermometer i own. I have not been able to calibrate it.
I've had this timer for a few months and finally tried the temperature probe function. It lasted all of 45 minutes and then when "HI" and after removing it from my roast it stayed there. Now it's a timer and a timer only. Very disappointed and wish I had seen these reviews before I purchased this item. I didnt buy it here.Don't buy this... EVER
I bought two of these and one didn't work out of the box. Not only didn't the unit register any temperature, but the probe didn't work either (I tried in the other unit that worked).
I've had two of these. Both lasted about 6 months. I didn't do any to the things Taylor warns against.  I didn't expose the thermometer to water: direct heat or sunlight: I didn't get the sensor plug wet: I didn't use in an oven with temperature higher than 300F: I didn't allow probe to directly contact bone or use in a microwave.  Warantee requires you to send back to Mexico which is expensive. when I emailed Taylor Customer Service for permission to return to a USA address, I received no response.
This thermometer doesn't work.  Can't figure out where on the thermometer the sensor is, but it definitely doesn't work like the last one I had.  If the thermometer is in the wrong position it will be easy to over cook.
I bought this on line but didn't try to use it until time expired to return it.When I finally checked it out, it was totally useless. The digital display was garbled even tried to use new batteries. What a rip off!!!
Forget it, you shouldn't have to buy probes more frequently than batteries, which is what ends up happening. Hold off until someone makes something that actually stands up to real cooking or buy a thermapen.
i am writing this not because i am buying another taylor product but to share the wonderful (sarcasm) experience i have had with my 5 month old (now deceased) thermometer. first i must say that the one i had for more than fifteen years performed flawlessly. sadly it finally died. temp was about thirty degrees off sometimes. so opting for a new one i should have guessed something was wrong when i had trouble finding a new one at most stores. i finally found one. this is where i should have moved on to another. right out of the box i noticed the construction and materials used were cheap. probe cable was plastic not braided cable like old one. after the first few uses i noticed the temp would drop to low for no reason. wasn't removed from item being cooked just quit reading. finally after many annoying uses i found that el crappo probe didn't fit well. if you jiggled it around it would work for awhile then quit again. i had an old probe but reading was way off. so if you are thinking about this one don't. too much money for too little use.
worked great, for a very short time.  I seen other reviews stating the same, so I was very careful with this and it still died after only a few months.  the digital one I get for $10 at walmart is TONS better than this junk.  very sorry I ever tried it.
I have owned 4 of these, all returned and replaced. The 4th one just broke after the 3rd use. It is beeping non stop, says 290 degrees even when at room temp. Find another brand, I have no idea how this got to be rated so high.
My probe stops working after use a few times too. The replacement probe costs almost the same as the complete unit.
Not the easiest thing to set. Or reset. the cord is long enough to go into oven so the digital read is magnetized to hang on outside.I just think too many buttons for setting and gets confusing.
I used this thermometer for about 8 months, about 2-3 times a month. It was used for measuring the temp of milk for yogurt making. The probe quit, I have a fancy timer now. I am sure it would have quit earlier under demanding use. The cord is plastic so it cannot go into the oven. You got to wonder why a replacement probe and a new thermometer are the same price... Do not buy this one.
THE PROBE BREAKS TO EASY.  ONCE IT IS BROKEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW IT IN THE TRASH.  REPLACEMENT PROBES COST THE SAME AS THE ITEM.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
I bought this for home-brewing beer. Keeping the wort at an accurate temperature is critical to the success of the beer. I expected this thermometer to do the job. I placed it in the hot wort (I looked long and hard for something saying this thermometer could not be used in liquid, but could not find anything) to ensure I was cooling the liquid to the appropriate temperature. Somehow the readings on the thermometer were going UP as time was passing. Because this was confusing, I used two other thermometers to verify the readings, and this thermometer was off by a good 20 degrees.Unfortunately I cannot rely on this product for my intended purpose. Moving on to the next one.
I used the Taylor digital meat thermometer with my smoker at about 225f about ten times with no problem.  I used it on a turkey during Christmas in an oven at approximately 350.  It worked OK until I tried to use it the next time, it was dead as a doornail.  I will not buy another.
Don't buy this one, I used it once and the probe burned up.  I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
I am very disappointed with the Taylor Digital Oven Thermometer/Timer.  I have used it twice, and both times the unit ceased working properly.  The first time, I had the probe in a chicken casserole in the oven, and the display started to read "HI".  No temperature display ever returned.  I returned the unit and did receive a replacement unit (thankyou - the customer service was helpful at least) and used it for the first time last night, again for some chicken breasts.  Again, the display switched to "HI" and won't read a temperature. This is terrible product reliability if I only use the device twice and both times it breaks!  The company has said that the problem is the probe shorts out above 392 degrees.  That's not very helpful when cooking in the oven or on a grill.
The probe fell apart in the very fist use. So now a have one more timer that i didn't need
I purchased this item last fall with the hopes of using it this spring..Got everything set up and the thermometer worked for about 10 minutes and then the temp went to high.  its unreliability ruined a whole days worth of smoking ,  not to say the money I lost.  Contacted company with no results,  DO NOT BUY it will let you down
Bought this. It never worked. It always reads HI. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. Taylor should be ashamed of selling this kind of worthless product. Couldn't rate it ZERO, so realize that my 1-star rating means ZERO!
Works well while it lasts, unfortunately that's not much more than a year. Look for something more reliable than this.
I had an old version of this and it worked great for years.  This new version only lasted 2 weeks.  The probe is broken.  A waste of money.  Looking for a good high quality thermometer any sugestions?
Worked twice--and after that you had to wiggle the wire and deftly alter the angle of the display hinge to get any performance at all out of it. Gar-baage.
Purchased this product in Jan 12Used exactly four times"Silicone" burned down to bare wires this afternoonVery poor quality
This unit will fail at the probe.  The electronics are fine - but about 50% of the probes fail on day one.If the probe is any good?  Expect about 2 years of life - it will likely be the probe that fails.I give this unit a low rating because replacement probes are not available.
After only two months the probe is no longer measuring the temperature accurately and a our meat has been VERY undercooked.
I did not realize this did not have a remote monitor, like the Oregon talking thermometer that I owned and loved at my vacation house. It is only about $15 more and lets you leave the monitor on your table so you do not have to keep checking at the grill. The upscale model also gives you preset choices for different meats which makes things faster to set up. I would strongly recommend the Oregon Scientific Model.I did not read all the other reviews about the probe cable melting or I never would have bought one. The cable melted with the first flare up. A replacement cable is $14 so you don't save anything over the Oregon Scientific talking remote thermometer that has a metal probe cable so it is heat resistant to over 500 degrees. The cost of constantly replacing the probe raises the price of this model to more than the Oregon Scientific thermometer. One of the negative reviewers suggested the probes come in a ten pack. I suggest buying another brand such as the Oregon model with a heat resistant probe cable.
This Taylor thermometer would be nice, IF it worked. I like the big buttons, big numbers, and easy controls. However, there seems to be something faulty with its computer chip, because after just 4 or 5 uses all the numbers come up as "888" and it won't respond to any buttons. I tried replacing the batteries, "power cycling", holding down the reset button, and nothing will jar it out of the "888" mode. It is broken.I returned the first one (everyone gets a lemon sometimes) but the second one has the SAME exact problem. I believe it's simply not designed to last, and I will be choosing a different brand for my reorder.
Taylor Digital Cooking Thermometer/TimerI would give this item a zero if possible. Probe died after about 8 months. Try to get a replacement probe from Taylor... you can't. I wanted to purchase three and they do not have them and could not tell me where to buy them.
I purchased this in March, today is April 22 and I missed my opportunity to return this item by 3 days. I didn't have occasion to use it until today and it doesn't work. It room temperature roast at 140 degrees Fahrenheit so I tested it in ice cold water and it reads 60 degrees. If you're going to buy this - test it immediately!
The basic thermometer works great, but unfortunately the probes fail quickly. The stock probe failed after 2 uses. The stainless one was good for 8 uses and then it died.
This timer never worked right.  I didn't get it used much in the first 30 days, shame on me because now it is too late to return it.  I had a Taylor before that I had for several years that was wonderful. This one on the other hand was not nearly as sophisticated as the first and I'm sure there wasn't much price difference.  Taylor has gone downhill in my opinion.  I could never get the alert to work so why have a timer that does not alert you when it reached the destined temperature?  I will have to look at other brands in local stores.
I did not use item right away. The on/off switch broke off during the second use.  Returning costs were prohibitive.
This is my second unit. Both died for unknown reasons. The second one arrived with dead batteries. Probe stopped working after 3 weeks and now nothing works after 2 months. I tried the reset button, new batteries, nothing! This is simply a poor product and there is not a third in my future.
I had seen other reviews with similar complaints but decided to try it for myself anyway.  The one time it worked great but when I attempted to use again a week later the display simply read LO & would not change.
Don't buy this unit..... as previously stated,  the chord to the probe is extremely flimsy.  I'm on the second one and they only last for year-or- less.  My unit has a life time warranty, but I can't get Taylor to return my calls (have tried 4 times with no response!)  ... I think this company is in financial difficulties, probably from making such a sorry probe which they advertise as "made to our exacting specifications in China" !
When it worked, it did a great job, but it only lasted for a couple of times, and then went dead.
The timer works well.The probe does not.The first time I used mine, I couldn't believe my roast got done so quickly.  I used my 'standard' thermometer and compared readings.  There was a 30 degree difference!Now that I'm reading the reviews, I see this is not, by any stretch, an isolated incident.
I am on my 3rd one (the first 2 were replaced under warranty) and after a month of use all 3 have done the same thing. They  stopped working. Do not buy one. Absolute junk.
gave it to my dad as a gift - it was great for his first use, then, when he was preparing a dinner for guests, it wouldn't register anything but &#34;hi&#34; or &#34;lo&#34;- no temp reading at all...he has thrown away the packaging, so I am trying to replace it for him.  I have one almost identical that is now about 5 years old and still going strong.
I bought this item with high hopes and Amazon delivered it great with a fair price.  I've had reasonably good luck with previous digital meat thermometers, but this Taylor model broke the first time I used it.  It reads the meat temperature, but it's off by at least 70 degrees and doesn't track evenly, so you can't even use a temperature offset to measure the meat temperature.  The timer part works fine, but that's about it.  I ended up buying a Rosle digital thermometer and it works great.  You can't leave it in the meat while it's in the oven, which was the desired appeal of the Taylor, but it is a well-made digital thermometer and I recommend it highly.  Stay away from the Taylor.
Had one a few years, timer works fine tried smoking meat with the remote probe. It lasted twice and read &#34;HI&#34; and did not work again.Bought new one same thing. Good timer, thermometer probe junk!
I bought a Taylor thermometer several years ago (it has the wound wire sheath) and it worked and was reliable for a long time for my BBQ.  I bought 2 new Taylor thermometers, with silicone sheaths, in 2010 as backup and when my original died this year I tried one and then the other with only frustration. I replaced the batteries thinking that was the problem but that was not it. Neither one has worked well or consistently out of the box and the second gives only an 888 across the board display. I cook a lot on my BBQ and rely on accurate and reliable thermometers.  This is shameful product quality. What a waste of $$. Period.
I received the thermometer as a gift.  It was intended to be used for cooking meat.  It worked wonderfully one time after which all it will read is high or low.
I got this thermometer for home cheesemaking and it read about 30 degrees too high the first time I used it.  It becomes tiresome to get things new that are poorly made and have to spend the shipping to return them if you want a replacement.  Given that it didn't work on arrival, I'm not crazy about getting a replacement.  I just have to hope it will work better.  There should be a law that requires the manufacturer to pay for the return.  Then they might not make such crap.I've now been waiting a few weeks and still no word on a replacement for the returned item.  Apparently Taylor has poor customer service as well.
Don't waste your money! It did NOT accurately tell the temperature!! Does Not Work!! Buy a different one!! This one Did NOT work!!
Right out of the box it displayed HI even in meat that my instant read thermometer read 46F.  I am returning this piece of garbage.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.
Probe is junk. Wears out too easily. It's hard to replace, too expensive when you can find it. Manufacturer does reply to emails to customer service. Buy something other than Trutemp or it's parent company Taylor.
Had a chance to use at the BBQ and show all the neighbors just how cool I was the first time I used it... Lucky, becuase it never worked again. Like others I seem to have burnt a section of the cord and the temp is all over the place.
I have purchased 2 of these. Both have died the same death in about the same time frame. Less than 12 months, less than a dozen uses. The probes connection is poor. DO NOT TRUST THIS TO LAST!
I just called Taylor about my kitchen probe therometer that worked only three times. They told me they would be happy to SELL me another one. How magnanimous of them. I will not buy any product from Taylor again.
New Model has following problems.1. Times will not key in consecutively. If you press and hold down the key for your minutes, you will have to punch that key for EACH minute. Older models allow minutes to be entered with one press of the button.2. The probe did NOT work and would shoot up and down by ten to 15 degrees.3. Timer blinks and makes inappropriate noises???4. This is a MUCH POORER product than earlier models.5. AND OF COURSE IT IS MADE IN CHINA.6. Company rep was very helpful but when you have a small business and this product was crucial, it is wrecking my business.Probably won't buy again from this company.
Bought this for my girl friend for Christmas and she did have a need for it for a couple weeks.  When she turned it on the first time all the possible number surfaces light up.  Tried to reset or change settings but nothing causes it to change at all.  Do not waste your time or money on this item.
I was hoping I would get one of the good ones with the good reviews, but I didn't.  I used this for chicken one night.  It didn't work at first (the LCD said 'low' temp), but I finally did get it to work after sticking the probe deeper in.  After that it's been a struggle to get it to do anything. It does not take correct temperature. I put it in a glass of really hot water and it still said 'low'.  I tried another probe I use for my crock pot and it didn't work.  So whatever the problem is, it's not the probe but the machine itself.  I tried taking out the batteries and putting them back in and it did take a temperature correctly for a second.  Then it stopped working again.  I'm going to try new batteries once again before I throw it away.Bottom line - don't waste your money.  There is a chance you'll get a good one, but you also have a chance to get a POS.  I'm going to order a plain thermometer.  It won't be as fancy, but at least it will work.
I loved this but I have to give it the poor review because it stopped working.  It didn't get too hot or anything.  Just started reading far hotter then correct temperature.
Used this thing three times. First time was a chicken roaster, came out (165)undercooked. Second time was for a turkey, came out (165)undercooked. Last time before throwing it out was on a ribroast, (130)overcooked.
I had an earlier version of this unit that lasted for 4 years. It had a shielded metal wire from the readout to the probe. This one failed after one use. It had a plastic wire from the readout to the probe. I would not buy another.
Unfortunately I didn't check the accuracy of this thermometer before I started brewing. The functionality of the probe and temp alarm and timer all worked great. But after I finished brewing the thermometer was sitting on my counter and was reading 92 degrees.....it was about 23 outside and noway was my house at 92. I checked it in some water against another thermometer and sure enough it was reading 22 degrees too high. Because of this my brew wash didn't ferment properly and defeated the purpose of why I bought the thermometer.
This item arrived with the screen damaged, so I never got to use it. The screen shows up with all 8's on it and near the center of the screen, the numbers don't show up at all. Didn't get it returned within the "return window" and now I have to pay for return shipping and it just isn't worth it.
Hot temperature readings are increasingly inaccurate, only registering a reading of "Hi" after a certain point (WAY below the advertised temperature threshold).Heavily iced water reads at 45F.Product was tested straight out of the packaging.Ain't nobody got time for this!
The only reason I gave this product one star is because I couldn't give it zero stars. Worked great the first time I used it, but the second time was a different story. I thought it was strange when I was grilling some venison brats and the internal temperature was 206 degrees. Not sure, but I don't think the brats were six degrees away from boiling, I didn't even burn my mouth. I knew it was shot when I used it for the third time brewing an all grain batch of beer when it decided to quit. I got a reading of 200 degrees when my water wasn't even close to boiling. Thinking it might be some kind of anomaly, I turned it off, then on a few times. Still read about 30-40 degrees warmer than it should. Put it in the freezer to confirm my suspicions, and it read 68 degrees. Spend the few extra bucks and get a good thermometer.
The probe broke after the first use. It is now reporting a temperature 10-20 degrees hotter than the food really is.
My first digital thermometer. It was very useful and worked perfectly when I first got it. Then after about 4-5 uses, it just stopped working. I changed the battery a few times to no avail. I'll buy a different brand next time.
I have had 3 of these in the past few years and the last two were garbage bso QC seems to be an issure with this manufacturer.It is easy to use and the first one I bought was great and lasted for 2-3 years before it just quit working. The next two didnt read an accurate temperature so I suggest you look elswhere for a thermometer.
After nearly ruining a 20 lb turkey, we suspected our 1 year old probe thermometer was broken. Maybe the "Lo" indicator after 3 hours was our first clue. We put our other thermometer in and...Yowza...the breast was at a whopping 180 degrees! We were shooting for 161 degrees and 1 hour tented to 170 degrees.We immediately took it out and rested it, untented. Fortunately, because we had brined it, the breast turned out ok..not my best work. we had to gently rewarm in turkey stock to get it to the table warm.I am throwing away this entire unit...cant risk another $500 dinner.
Arrived in fresh, clean retail blister pack.  On Christmas Eve, ready for the first holiday meal, I opened it up carefully, removed the battery tab, and turned it on.  All the LCDs lit up (88:88 etc) and all controls were nonfunctional.  I pressed the reset button, reloaded the batteries, tried new fresh batteries, re-inserted the probe, pressed every reasonable combination of buttons - nothing changed.  Utterly useless and nonfunctional right out of the box.
Unit simply does not measure temperature correctly on second use. Worked fine on first use... it now reads way high (100 degrees F at room temp). Completely useless. Stick with either the more expensive units or non-electronic thermos.
Update: I sent an e-mail to Taylor, explaining the problem and mentioned that a lot of people were having issues with the probe and some people reported Taylor sending them new, stainless steel probes. The reply was 'It sounds like you have a defective probe, since you bought the item so recently, exchange it at the retailer you bought it from'. So Taylor, you want me to return it and potentially get another junk probe? Well, most likely get a junk probe considering how common this problem is. No thanks. Amazon has auth'd me a return and I will be giving another brand a shot.At first I thought I had a dud and I'll never give a bad review because of a dud product since it's usually not representative of the product in it's working form.Until I saw someone with the same exact scenario as I had. I was boiling beer and 212 turned to 220, 230, 240! I had to abandon the Taylor and go with my trusty float thermometer. Now the Taylor reads 122 in a 72 degree house. First use.I've never had a problem with Taylor thermometers in the past so I tossed the packaging. Now I'm not sure if I want to buy another one and return it defective, send it to Taylor (where they'll probably charge shipping) or throw it in the trash and learn my lesson.If you need precision (or even something with a terrible +/- tolerance of less than 20 degrees) stay away from this product!
I purchased this product as a gift for a friend and after 2 months of innacurate reading, we finally threw it away. I have the Polder brand unit and when my friend said he thought his wasn't working, we did a side by side boiling water test. The Polder read 203F, which is the exact boiling point of water in Colorado, and the Taylor unit read 159F. I ordered the Polder unit for him to replace the Taylor brand unit. Spend the extra $5.00 and buy the Polder unit first!
The thermometer arrived on time, but it doesn't work.  The temperature display reads &#34;Lo&#34; regardless of temperature.  I replaced the batteries and it still didn't work.  I reset it - didn't work.  I turned it off and on - didn't work.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with the probe or the unit.  Either way, it's brand new out of the box and doesn't work.  Thanks, Taylor!
I used to trust this until it malfunctioned Thanksgiving and ruined my Turkey. I suppose I should have been paying less attention to Football, but I was listening for the alarm that never went off. This is the second unit I've had that stopped working. I don't know if it's a cheap probe or some other problem, but I'm done with this brand as it never seems to deliver accurate temps anymore.
Not what I expected to get an oven thermometer with a plastic temperature probe cord. Now I must purchase a separate probe with a metal cord
While this thermometer served me well for many years, when it failed, it did so in an incredibly dangerous way: it was reading high. Fortunately I was preparing my own yogurt rather than counting on it to cook meat safely. (The yogurt will be safe; the question is whether the water bath temperature is high enough to make it good).I noticed when I was cooling the water bath: as I was adding cold water, the temperature dropped slower than I remember then never seemed to get below 125F. Incredulous, I tested the water with my hand and found it to be more like ~70F.If the thermometer failed and reported over- or under-scale in some way (e.g. it reports too-low when you unplug the temperature sensor) then it would be acceptable. But to fail by showing reasonable but incorrect readings is downright dangerous.The point of a thermometer is so you can count on it to ensure food-safe temperatures. The way this thermometer failed, it would be better to have no thermometer at all and rely on other was of checking temperature.
Used the thermometer to test heating water to prime temperature for homebrewing (Wort). I was CERTAIN to not let the probe become submersed in water. Everything appeared to be correct until the alarm went off before the water hit the desired temperature and was reading in the 250+ F range when the water (tested with another manual thermostat) was only 140F. Let it dry out, replaced batteries, and even gave it a rice bath (in case some moisture SOMEHOW got in there). Device goes off at 250+ even at room temp. Contacted support and they blame me for using it to test water temperatures even though I didn't submerge it. They wouldn't replace the unit or the probe. $15 wasted.
Totally inaccurate. I tested the unit by boiling water in the microwave, and plunking the probe into the still boiling water. The highest temp this POS would register was 140F. In the garbage.
I am buying a different thermometer; I am through buying new probes.The quality and lifespan of the probes is going downhill and the most recent one was good for about a month. It's crap. Very frustrating because it is a decent product otherwise (accurate enough, built in timer, alarm)
The functions and features of the product were great! While it lasted.I purchased two of them, one after the other, thinking they were great. However, a few months afterwards the magnets fell off of both - Think of how unfortunate this would be if you had this on a metal surface above something you're cooking (plop). Then, one of the probes stopped working so I replaced the probe. A year later, the batteries would not stay in one of them, so I had to prop them in. A few years later, the buttons do not work on either, they're both in the trash now.
All I got was an empty box.  Please ship UPS in the future, not USPS.
I bought 3 Thermometers for Christmas presents, HOW EMBARRASING! After a couple of uses, I turned it on and it shoots right to HI and the irritating buzzer starts blairing! The other reviewers were too nice describing this problem. Find ANOTHER brand and buy it, because it is a great way to get a tempature.
I used this thermometer once.  The second time I used it, it didn,t read temperature but read "Lo" and then "Hi".  It's worthless.
hello,hello,hello,taylor are you out there?if you as a potential buyer dont heed the probe warnings then feel free to throw away your money.cant use on a bbq,cant exceed 350f,cant get them wet.being stubborn i have been through a few probes and babied them and they still failed.its obvious taylor could care less.
I loved this while it was working.. But in less than an year it suddenly stopped working and can no longer return this item. A big waste of $$$$. I will be writing my complaint to TAYLOR as well.
I purchased three of these units, fully expecting them to be less then perfect and I was not disappointed. For the money they should be just fine for any low temp (less then 350f) indoor use. I had to use them to monitor two smokers and the meat. I plugged them in and got them setup in the early morning and all was going well until the sun came out. With the bright sun it was impossible to read. It just looked like all the LCD segments were lit. Nothing buy 8's. Then as the sun got higher and hotter the screens when completely black. Not recommended for any outdoor use.
It came with a 1 year warranty. The probe stopped measuring temperature three months after the warranty expired.  Otherwise, it was an okay product.  I thought the jack for the temp probe was a bit flimsy.  But it worked well and was easy to read  -- until it broke.
I got mine 3 weeks ago, used it twice, all the features works, except the main purpose of measuring temperature. Now I plug the probe at ambient temp of 90F and it shows HI all the time (above 392F).If I put the prove in the freezer, It will show 180F.I ended up with an expensive timer with a probe that does not work. Now I can't even return it, as I'm not in US. Shipping by mail will be more expensive then having the money back.Read carefully the reviews before adding to cart.Very disappointing
According to the manual, the probe is supposed to be good for oven temperatures up to 392 degrees. I tried to use it for baked potatoes (oven temp 350, potatoes done at 220). The probe failed. Well, at least I didn't lose a roast.Judging by what others have written, the probes fail a lot, so the real cost of this thermometer isn't $17.00. It is at least $27.00--add $10.00 for a replacement probe (and, $10.00 for another replacement probe... etc, until you give up). I am going to gamble $10.00 on one (1) replacement probe. If it works for years, then $27.00 will be the real cost of this thermometer to me. If, as I think likely, the replacement probe fails then I'll have thrown good money after bad. In the latter case, I'll be the proud owner of a $27.00 kitchen timer.Plus (potentially) the cost of a ruined roast, the smoldering remains of which may the ONLY warning that a probe has gone bad, plus the cost of a brand new thermometer by another manufacturer, when you finally get tired of throwing out food and buying new probes.Clearly, Taylor's business model is to make money selling probes. If they were interested in making a useful product, they would include a spare probe with the thermometer, and sell the replacement probes two at a time: $10.00 for one replacement is outrageous.
I ordered this for my mother in law only to have mine start giving false temperature readings just as it arrived.  I can't really recommend it to her now.  It is such a shame that the probe cannot be replaced as I read in other reviews.  I don't think I have used it above the temp recommended but I cannot say that I was aware of it when I first bought it so it is possible.  I have only used it a handful of times.  What is the point of having this if you cannot trust the reading?!!  I made some very undercooked chicken because I trusted it.  Realized it after the stove was too cold to recook it.  I would love to hear of a brand name that can be trusted for future purchases.  Taylor has lost my trust.  Especially since I have an instant read thermometer also from them that claims to be waterproof but always has steam in it.  Another one I had before that stopped working after it was exposed to steam.  I thought getting one that said waterproof would resolve that issue!
It is our second one.  The first one lasted about 10 uses, but we don't use it often.  The second one made it halfway through it's maiden voyage.  We kept it as a timer--it does do that well.Never again!
Hello, this is my first review.  This was because I typed in 'best oven meat thermometer in google and this listing came up.  I am looking for a new one because this is the one we have and it never worked right.  The audio alarm doesn't work and it frequently reports the temperature wrong.  Look for something else, period.
This timer only sounds an alarm about half the time; otherwise, when the time is up, it remains silent and starts counting up the time you've overcooked something. I just burned a large pan of peanuts. Not happy. And now I find out that the return window is only one month. Great.
