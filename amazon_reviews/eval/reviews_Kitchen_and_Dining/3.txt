It is really an attractive gift, but I didn't appreciate just how small it was until it arrived. still a nice gift, just smaller than I would have liked for nearly $60 including shipping.
A bit thin, both in terms of its actual size and of its information content. Not much here of value.
These are fine as long as you don't put them in the microwave.  The description states they're safe for microwave use, however, after warming up something for a little over a minute, one of the plates melted in the center.
The plates are nice, good colors and durable but very small. Good for toddlers and smaller servings. A sandwich made with a loaf of bread filled the entire plate.
I have yet to use this book due to the fact that all the recipes are for more than six people.  I wanted it for just my husband and myself, so hopefully I will remember to use it next time we have guests.
A bit loose in the wheel, but it does a decent job for the price. The guard on the handle makes storage a bit of an issue. It needs a deep drawer if you can't hang it up.
got this for our cabin....it's just ok...probably better deals out there and certainly there are better quality pizza cutters. It barely squeaks by as acceptable.
Works fine, good grip.  Tried to give it 4 stars but the option wasn't available(?).
This is a good tool for the price, but my kitchen Aid is better.  This tool will cut through a thin thickness of pizza (I use it for brownies too), but it's so flimsy and many times you have to go back and forth over the same spot multiple times (and I'm a strong guy) before it makes it through thicker slices.  Maybe it loses sharpness or just isn't very strong to begin with, but since it was so cheap I knew what I was getting before I bought it.  The grip is great and what really gets 4 stars, but the blade isn't very sturdy.  I recommend spending you money on quality rather than convenience.
Our Oxo Garlic Press broke, too.  First the red rubber/plastic "spikes" didn't fit in the metal (for pushing out garlic bits) anymore.  "Weird, I thought" until it explained itself a few days later when the press broke completely.  It gets 3 stars anyway because we used it regularly for a long long time (my wife says 6 years or so - she had it before we met!)The holes are pretty big, so it's not too hard to press garlic through it; but in the end I guess we did a dry-ish clove or two too many.  I don't know if the newer ones aren't made a well of course; but I doubt it.  As others have said - we're used to Oxo being great quality.Anyway: yes, it broke - but it lasted a good long time first and worked just fine until then, so that's worth 3 stars at least.  Now we got a Kuhn Rikon press which does seem much studier.  Over time we'll see if it's worth being twice as expensive.
After reading all the reviews of people who have had this press break on them, I thought I'd toss in a word with my experiences with it.First, I will agree about the rubber handles slipping down from time to time. This is a minor issue - they don't really slide enough to cause a problem, and you can push them back up. It isn't like they come loose and fall off - it takes a bit of effort to pull them down.The red piece that fits into the holes make cleaning up much, much easier - I've had much quicker cleanup with this press than any other I've used - though garlic does tend to gather around the hinge also, and that can be a little tough to remove. The red piece has come off a couple times, staying stuck in the holes it's supposed to clean, but goes back on to the other side easily enough.I've had mine for about two years, and still no signs of breakage, or any problems other than the minor ones already listed. There may be better ones, but this is much better than your run-of-the-mill garlic press, I know that much.Addendum: About two months after initially posting this review, I discovered exactly what others were talking about when referring to the hinge breaking - suddenly, while pressing garlic, the hinge just gave way.  No warning, no signs of stress beforehand.  The hinge just broke and the press died.  I've thus realized that while this is a nice, useful press for the time it does work, it will likely eventually break on you.  Something to consider.
When it works (small, peeled cloves and when it is new), it's fine. But after about a year, daily use, mine broke --- as have Oxo knives at the handle. As comfortable as Oxo products are to use, they're not long-lasting at all.
Over the years I have accumulated an abnormally large collection of garlic presses for various mundane reasons.My favourite of the lot are the Zlyiss (regular/original, Susi, Susi Deluxe & Susi 2) presses because they consistently extract the maximum amount of garlic from each clove whether peeled or unpeeled.  However the Zlyiss presses have a few cons:1) Coated in a non-stick finish and not dishwasher friendly.2) Non-stick coating scratches off easily3) Separate plastic cleaning nodule that can easily be lost in a drawer or deformed by misuse.4) Uncomfortable handhold.The OXO solves many of the Zlyiss' above problems with a large rubberized rounded grip, attached cleaning nodule and a chrome finish that has so far been impervious to scratches.  However it does have a few cons:1) The unit weighs 3x that of a comparably-sized Zlyiss (Susi 2)2) Does not extract as much garlic out of each peeled clove; there is still smashed garlic in the bowl of the press.3) Even less successful at extraction with unpeeled cloves.Overall I would recommend this press over the Zlyiss based on individual hand comfort and ease of cleaning.  But base strictly on performance, I would still prefer my Zlyiss presses.As other reviewer's have complained about longevity, I will continue testing this alongside my Zlyiss garlic presses (youngest of which is 2-years) and report back if the OXO's hinge does fail.
I loved this garlic press the first few times I used it. You don't have to press hard, Oxo's signature rubber-encased handles are easy on the hands, and I liked the red plastic backing with little teeth to push residue back through the holes.But after a while I realized that it's not so perfect. For some reason the residue tends to stick to the metal. Eventually, when you wash the press water gets between the rubber covering on the handle and the metal underneath, only to emerge when you next squeeze the rubber. The biggest disappointment was when the metal broke near the hinge (as I see has happened to others). I've had several old-fashioned garlic presses and this is the first where the metal has actually torn. It seems Oxo just didn't invest in sturdy construction on this one. I'm going to give the Zyliss a spin.
This garlic press is better than most, particularly because the pressing head flips over to clear the crushing face --  a big plus compared to the zyliss and farberware presses, that you either have to pick clean or use a separate (included) tool.  No thank you!  I regularly crushed two cloves of garlic at a time in this press.  However, I broke it while trying to crush ginger root.  I think it's because this press is made of cast aluminum covered with chrome(?) plating.  If you think you might be crushing lots of garlic or the occasional ginger root, go for the stainless steel OXO version.  Well worth the additional $$.
Just wanted to add my experience to others here who've had their press break after about a year. The hinge breaks and is essentially un-repairable. However it's comfortable and does a good job. So if you don't mind spending (dollar amount) every year or so for a new one, this is a a good press.
I loved this garlic press. Nice wide grips-- probably good for folks with arthritis, etc. It has a good heavy-duty feel to it. I used it. Daily.I always handwashed. One day the red hole-poker fell off. A few weeks later the hinge went &quot;POP&quot; on a dinky but stubborn garlic clove. So, the garlic press is now swimming with the fishes and I'm back to mincing by hand.
i LOVE all my oxo stuff and the company really stands behind their products, but my garlic press broke after a few years at the hinge of all places...right through the thick metal part...crate and barrel did say that that is how long they are suppose to last though, so...you be the judge!
My spouse and I really liked this garlic press.  We didn't think it was too hard to clean - just average.  We liked the rubber handles, they were comfortable.  We had it for about 5 years and used it frequently.  Then the metal broke just below the press, above the handle.  There is no way to repair it unless you weld it, but even then, its strength would be compromised.  So we threw it in the trash.
As other reviewers have noted, this OXO garlic press looks better than it lasts.Mine too broke after a few years of the most occasional use, with one of the metal halves separating just below the hinge.I have now switched to a Calphalon with a more traditional articulated plunger design, and we'll see if that proves more durable.It's too bad this OXO broke, because it does have a nice design and APPEARS to be sturdy.  Appearances obviously can be deceiving...PROS:* Attractive design.* Comfortable grips.* Red rubber raised surface enables quick cleaning.CONS:* Not very durable.
I've been a huge fan of all of the OXO products throughout the years because they are cheap but well made.  It was a no-brainer when I needed a garlic press to pick up one of theirs.  Unfortunately this one didn't perform as well as many of my other OXO products because it made a huge mess of my unpeeled garlic cloves.  Pieces of garlic shot out of the sides of the press, most of them ending up on my floor.  After this happening for quite a few garlic cloves I tried peeling the skin off of them and inserting them in the press.  No problems when the garlic is peeled but my old garlic press didn't require the extra time of peeling them first in order to use it.  Cleanup is a snap but overall I'm kind of disappointed in the product.  The good news is that at 6.99 these aren't going to break the bank.  The bad news is you won't be all that impressed with your purchase.
It looks good, it feels good in the hand, it doesn't require too much pressure to squeeze out the garlic.  There is some seepage out the sides but that never bothered me much.  What does bother me is that, like it has for other reviewers, the hinge breaks.  The store where it was purchased replaced it, but now the new one is also broken, after only 6 months or so of use.  My next one will be a Zyliss.  Until then I'm putting the garlic cloves in a baggie and pounding them with a hammer.
I've had maybe six of these over the past 10 years and they've ALL broken. Some break faster than others. You just never know when it's going to give. But I've gone back again and again because it really does a wonderful job.I've always thought it was just me (and the heavy work load I put on these -- I cook with garlic sometimes 3 times a week) but I see here that breakage is problem for others as well. My last one broke last week, so this time I'm going to try the Trudeau Garlic Press, which looks very similar in design and has better reviews.Happy crushing!
While in usebut without any excessive pressure the hinge snapped leavingme with two pieces in my hands.  I am so disappointed.  I will not buyanother until I know that OXO has improved this fault.  Naturallymine broke shortly after the one year warranty was up.I loved the comfort of using the press.  I also loved theease in cleaning it...Wish it had been more durable.
The OXO garlic press is great for crushing garlic.  And I never had any problem with water in the handle, but of course, I don't run items like this through the dishwasher.  However, I only gave it 3 stars because the metal hinge just snapped in half.  I don't even use it that often, maybe once a week on average so it's very disappointing. I'm going to check other garlic press options before buying another OXO.
The Oxo press works wonderfully, pressing large amounts of garlic easily for about a year, then the metal fatigues and breaks. I've gone through two of them. If you don't press a lot of gralic then it is great, or if you need the padding, it is super, just not durable.
Like most garlic presses, the OXO garlic press minces garlic well enough and has a cleaning tool built in to get the garlic out of the holes. It works well at these two tasks with a sturdy grip that Oxo products are known for as well as not requiring too much strength due to its decent size. The reason I say it's not great is that, like most other mass produced, consumer grade presses, the male and female parts of the press don't fit closely enough together and allow a fair amount of garlic guts to squeeze past the sides of the plunger. It also leaves some between the end of the plunger and the screen that you have to dig out.
while the sweeper is described as crumb sweeper I was hoping it would also pick up pet hair from furniture. The bristles are a bit soft to do so effectively.
Does the job but you need to go over stuff more than once. Plus when you store it, make sure that you do not lay it on the brush opening. They will get flat if you do,
This crumb sweeper works very well on table cloths, fabric placemats, even the couch or recliner. Picks up crumbs & pet hair. Unfortunately it does not work on solid surfaces such as wood tables or plastic/vinyl placemats or other slick/smooth surfaces. Easy to clean out and ready for next use.
This fork is just what they say.  However, it is dangerous because of thesharp prongs which have an inner very sharp area.  You can't jsut put itin a drawer or store it without a solid covering over the prongs or you'llget seriously stabbed or cut.
It was not quite the pan I wanted as it is a two piece cake pan, but the description of it did not state it was a two piece item.
I use this jigger at home, and it is definitely well made and high quality, having been dropped on the floor many times with no dent or crinkles.However, as other reviewers rightly point out, this is not the usual size for a jigger, and it is an odd measurement amount of 1-1/4 and 3/4 oz, when most drinks are calling for multiples of the half-ounce in the ingredients.Still, this is handy for some of those classic cocktails that require some odd measurements/rations of ingredients (such as the Aviation or Floridita), where you will need 1-1/4 ounce.So get this one, because you will likely need it if you truly venture into the world of classic cocktails, but get yourself first the standard size jigger first. Or better yet, get both and a bottle of marschino liquer (if you can find it) at the same time, and go home and whip up yourself an Aviation, and wax nostalgic of days gone by when bartenders knew how to bartend, and the US hadn't yet invented the abomination of the blended Daquiri or blended Margartia.Also get yourself a copy of Paul Harrington's &quot;Cocktail: THe Drinks Bible for the 21st Century&quot;, the essential cocktail book that will explain and show you how to make a true cocktail, sometimes even how to enjoy it, and teach how not be a cultureless alcohol-obsessed buffoon who thinks sugary, alcohol-taste-covering drinks are &quot;all that&quot; so that you can go to a fine bar like the Rainbow Room and order drinks like Cary Grant or James Bond knew how to do, and not order them like you're a college Freshman or a newly-minted MBA on an expense account.  Then get yourself a copy of the Waldorf-Astoria cocktail book.Also you'll want a good shaker, martini glasses you left in the freezer, and some good friends for conversation as your lips become loosened and the words and ideas flow like water from your mouths.
I measure by halves and wholes--but one thing this jigger has that nothing else in my booze cabinet has is undeniable. I'm always busting the glass ones with the right measurements in the dishpan, and this stainless jigger will serve as an invaluable backup until I can find replacements. After all, not every store carries the measuring glass jiggers all the time...Think of this as your "emergency jigger" and it's worth every penny.
A nice product, although small--it isn't big enough to cool a full tray of cookies.  Also, no protective feet as listed (no big deal, but the product listing should be changed).  I returned mine, to buy the bigger size ...
I really like this cooling rack. I was a little disappointed that it was made in Taiwan instead of the USA, like most of their products. But it is well made. But i am trying to buy only USA made products and i wish it would have said in the description that it was imported. I would have kept on looking.
I was a bit disappointed when the product arrived.  I purchased this rolling pin because of the promise of exquisite workmanship from a local American factory with a reputation for the world's finest drumsticks.  I was willing to pay a premium price versus cheaper imported versions of the same product. When I first spun the roller and held it up to the light, it was obvious that one edge was not cut perpendicular to the rolling surface.  It gave the appearance of a wobbly bicycle wheel.  Also, the roller edges were not rounded over or polished, they were lightly chamfered with the grain of the raw marble giving the appearance of dirt around the edges.  Functionally, the product worked great; heavy, smooth rolling, and non-stick, and it cleaned up easily afterward.
I have purchased several marble rolling pins and many had faults, off center drilled holes, marble pin surface defects, handles that were not drilled straight.  This Vic Firth was almost perfect, almost.  I ordered one and then an exchange, returned both.  Here are what I've found.  Amazon and Vic Firth states "made in USA", great...except it is not.  The marble is made in Taiwan, which all the other cheaper mables I tried on Amazon (see my other reviews) are from.  It could very well be the same exporter that makes the others also makes this one.  So only after I receive product, I find the fine print that it is assembled in USA, marble from Taiwan.  This is the most critical piece of information, as my poor rating in reviews for other marbles lead me to order this "made in USA" rolling pin.The good part is perhaps Vic Firth's quality and tolerance is better than the other cheaper marble rolling pins.  Vic Firth does put a very nice wooden handle on this, and the only one I've seen with stainless steel ball bearings, plus holes on both end of the rolling pin are drilled through the center!  If you ordered a Vic Firth and get a good marble, it's a keeper.The bad part is the marble, it is still from Taiwan, the two I received, one had scratches around the areas of the pin, the other had surface defect (chipped surface).  For almost $40, I demanded better.  If this was $15-20 like the cheaper marble rolling pins, I may have kept it and accepted the imperfections.I ended up with a Nor Pro stainless steel pin and an aluminum pin.  The manufactured quality and tolerances on those were better.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.
We've had this Nuvola for 3 years now.  I suppose we are fairly critical; I grew up and have lived in Italy as an adult, my wife is Swiss and is a demanding espresso drinker.Pro's:We have used probably about 30 different pods then settled on Illy for our tastes.  The espresso's are as good as the few good ones served in US restaurants but don't measure up to the crema or froth from a manual or semi-automatic machine (we've had many and still have one manual).Easy to live with.  In spite of my comment below, the machine is easy to clean and keep clean.  Readjustments (owners manual) should be done yearly -- no big deal.Irritations:Ours came with a really dumb set of water tubes that float in the water even without air in them.  You have to figure out how to keep it on the bottom of the water reservoir.  I used a simple clip attached to a rib in the reservoir.Cons:It has leaked since new.  Under the machine which means the machine has to be moved to clean it up.  The machine has been supposedly rebuilt by the importer to no avail.Pressure varies a lot.  Need to give it time to build up properly, maybe 30 seconds between shots.Though nothing to do with the machine, our observation is pods vary a lot within the same batch.  You seldom know what you get.  Our Illy Scuro's are pretty reliable while the decafs vary all over the place.  If you are picky about espresso or take pleasure in a great pour, I'd consider a pod machine a poor choice.  Its all about convenience.Overall:Ours is about shot.  After 3 years of pouring over a dozen espresso's a day the pressure is getting more and more unreliable.  We think that's to be expected.  We get that life out of semi-automatics as well.  Our manual, which we still have, is about 30 years old and works great.  But, its expensive and a pain to use and to clean.The issue here is will you be satisfied with pods?  If the basic description I provided of the machine itself is a turnoff then look beyond pods as all pod machines appear to have their own unique weaknesses.
The grinding is excellent, but I couldn't help worrying about eating little plastic particles. You see, part of the grinding mechanism is made of plastic.This was a big drawback for me, so when it fell and broke (not the grinders fault: it fell off my window!) I was kind of relieved and bought a regular grinder instead (which doesn't grind as good but keeps me unworried).
The product description does not give the wattage, but it is labeled for 200 watts.  This is ok but higher wattage immersion heaters are available.
I love the colors for these. The colors are great... the taste is very funky. It isn't a big deal unless you need a lot of it to make a pretty bright color. Use in moderation and you will be fine.
I purchased these for Bath bombs the consistency was good but he depth of color that I was expecting wasn't there.
I am an avid macaron baker (the French macarons not the American ones.) I've had some problems with the yellow messing up my shell batter.  I feel like the color is not as intense, therefore I have to use more of it to get the desired color.  I'd been using the limited range of powdered colors that I have, and thought that switching over to the gel stuff would be okay but it has been troublesome for me.  Regardless, the colors (save yellow) are bright and vibrant.
This food coloring kit sounds great except that they do not give the ounce sizes of the bottles.  What's up with that?  It would be nice to know how much product you are getting for your dollar.
I have nothing bad or good to say about this product other than the price, well I wish it were a lot more less than $15
I got these today, and though I cannot comment on their performance, I should note that instead of getting a bottle of black which was supposed to be in the set, I got two bottles of brown. Brown is a color I rarely use so this is quite disappointing.
I used this as part of a fake blood recipe, but I think it would have been better to use liquid food coloring.  It seemed to take forever to dissolve.  However, I am not a baker, so I am sure people who are used to this kind of coloring like it.  Also, it's pretty neat that there were so many colors!  I gave the rest to my mom after I finished and she has no complaints that I know of.
This is a wonderful food coloring kit if you are decorating cakes and cookies.  I however, needed it to create my own face dye.  These contain sugar which I did not want to use on my face.  If I made cakes and cookies, I would recommend this kit.
I just bought this set and I have not had the chance to try it, though I'm looking forward to it.  However, I just wanted to note that to my surprise, one of the dyes actually had the "AmeriColor" label on it, which I thought was a completely different brand of food coloring.  It was leaf green from AmeriColor rather than green from Ateco.  Furthermore, the bottles were all completely identical between the Americolor and other Ateco bottles in the bo.  I don't know if maybe they just remove the labels from AmeriColor bottles and add Ateco labels?  At any rate, you can save a few bucks by buying the cheaper AmeriColor since I think it's pretty clear that they are the same thing...
I really needed quite a few colors for a baking even I was doing and this set has some very nice ones however I would say that you do have to had quite a few drops if you want more vibrancy than pastel-like-looking colors when adding it to foods/icing
I was not completely satisfied with this product and it might be my own fault, but I do not plan on buying this item again. I did not realize that the measurements are different with this kind of food coloring (gel) versus other food colorings like the ones you buy in the store. I used the same amount of the gel as I would have of any other food coloring and let&#8217;s just say the people that ate my cupcakes wondered how long they would be expelling blue.Again, I believe this might be my own fault, but I wish it had included that information in the description. I am afraid to use the rest of the coloring that I purchased.
I bought these to color the coating I use for cake pops. With either melted white chocolate or the Wilton Candy Melts, both seized up when I added the gel coloring. I was able to get pastel colors okay without seizing but when I tried for a more vibrant look, it clumped so badly, I couldn't use it. The product is fine used for frostings or icings though.
I bought this for ceramic work thinking it was a stiff piece of plastic with slits in it at the different divisions so I could mark the place of each division.  I could only tell so much from the photo and written description.  The plastic is soft and it will be difficult to mark each place.  I did like the system for having a variety of different fraction divisions.
I have had this coffee machine for over three years. Mine does not have a timer but otherwise it is like the 452.01.  I do get a very good cup of coffee but it takes alot of adjusting the amount of water, number of cups brewed and grind.  There are only four settings and they do not vary much that I can tell. There is no way to get a very fine grind and often with certain kinds of coffee you have to use twice the coffee to get 75% of the strength of a heavier brew.  Mechanically, I have had no trouble with it.  It works as it should but I think at this level one can expect more ease of brewing.
this machine is a technological marvel--cool grinding w/ automatic replacement above the carafe for fresh, perfectly temperatured coffee fast!this is a machine for those of us who prefer to have our coffee miraculously brewed for us upon morning rising, when our heads are too fogged-up to grind our beans!unfortunately, this is ...well, a coffe maker!  the pre-set cup and grind amounts don't allow for much variation, despite the splendid, &quot;light&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, or &quot;strong&quot; coffee setting preferences.  i love a brew of coffeee from a french press pot,  an expresso in a mug, or a &quot;red-eye&quot;.  i'm particularly fond of dark oily roasts and splurge on Peets french roast or major dickenson blend.  while the machine filters tap water, i've never had a clog,and it works flawlessly, I have tried to make the brew stronger by varying the grind and cup settings. The end result is...alas, an avearage cup of cofee rather than a heavenly, robust, smooth brew w/depth and character :(
I just received this item today.  Sept.28, 2001.  I paid shipping and now your ad says free shipping.  I think you should refund my shipping charges.....Only used this machine once , so can't voice an opinion yet....Douglas kennedyWanted white and they only showed black on sale.  Today they show white also on sale .  What's going on???
i certainly prefer this brush to a pastry or other brush you may have in the kitchen drawer, but the bristles need to be upgraded to something that won't fray after only a few uses.  the grip, size, and ergonomics of the brush are great, i'm simply fearful that if they bristles become too frayed they'll scatter grinds everywhere as i'll lose directional control of where i &quot;sweep&quot; the grinds.  its difficult to pin point the area i'm trying to brush if the bristles become too frayed.
I got this as a gift. It was a nice gift. It was a thoughtful gift. But it was a quite silly gift. It works quite well, and has cleaned out my grinder fairly nicely.  But I think it would have been just as useful for someone to buy a pastry brush for 1/5th the price and then tell me... &quot;Oh, it's a coffee grinder brush.&quot;My recommendation?  Get a pastry brush and use that.  Just make sure you use it only for the coffee grinder. Using my old pastry brush was making my coffee grounds a little buttery... ;P
the Oxo Good Grips salt shaker might be good for a picnic but is not what I want for serious cooking.
This was a stocking-stuffer gift for my daughter who loves to cook but fears cutting herself (with good reason) - she says it does the job...
The slicer doesn't glide easily, so I had to add oil to lube it, which ended up being a little messy. There are probably better products out there.
Cute but, the egg slides underneath the holders.  I think maybe they should be heavier.  Fast shipping and they were cheap so no big deal.
Thermometer work. fine and the meat seems done to the temperature indicated. My wife like steaks med rare. When this thermometer says 130 degrees the steak is medium rare.Don't do what I did.. I tried to fold the thermometer flat - fold the top readout down away from the body - for storage. It broke a tab in the back.  Now I have a little piece of folded paper stuck in the back to hold up the readout. Other than that it was worked flawlessly.
I have had this unit and it's original probe for about 9 months. The probe has been well cared for, but just split at the spot where the cord connects to the plastic doohickey that you plug into the unit (technically speaking). Replacing the probe costs about the same as replacing the whole unit.I'm bummed out b/c this is my 3rd probe thermometer to bite it in 5 years. I just can't find a brand that lasts. Either the unit stops working altogether or the probe splits. Sigh.
I got this as a replacement for a Salton whose probe had died.Pro: Easy-to-read display.Cons: Unit always powers up set to 122 degrees. Unless you are always cooking a very rare steak, you have to set the alert temperature each time. However, if you are constantly watching the probe temp, you can ignore the alert temp.The directions say to not exceed 475 degrees. The probe cord appears to be silicone insulated, but did not survive being routed out from under a barbecue cover. It lasted about 10 minutes before the displayed temp went from 130 to &#34;LO&#34;, meaning the probe was no longer working. In hind sight, I think the barbecue lid was hotter than 475. My old Salton (with a metal braid) held up to this kind of use for several years.Unfortunately, this Taylor seems to be the only affordable remote-reading thermometer available, as I cannot find another Salton.
Love the thermometer, just wish you could get a replacement probe easily.  The probe breaks really easily.  I bought my 2nd one and the probe never even worked.  I give up on this product until replacement probes are readily available.  Until then, I'm sticking w/ an instant read digital thermometer.
The thermometer works great!  It's the probe that is defective.  It has a weak connection where the wires break and cause faulty readings.
The plug in for the probe no longer stays put. I had to tape the plug to the timer. Also, the thermometers range of temperatures were not high enough for what I needed it for. Not the best quality. It was good for about two weeks.
I use this for measuring mash temperatures in my mash tun.  It's kind of cheaply built, but works ok.  I water proofed the probe with a silicone aquarium air hose, a couple of O rings, and some keg lube (thanks Bobby M).It does work, it's just a little on the flimsy side, and I'm worried the one off switch will break at some point.
Much of last Thanksgiving was spent bending the wire at just the perfect certain angle that it required to read the temperature and wondering if indeed that temperature was right. At the price we paid it should have lasted longer methinks. Worked for 1 year, then it was dicey, then the wire where it goes into the probe stopped working completely soon. I'll pay less for a more reliable non-digital! Having a wire on something that has to be washed and manipulated just not a good idea I guess.
After reading other ratings on am wondering if these are not expected to last very long. I have quit putting the probe in for the whole cooking time, but putting it in near the end and see if this one will last longer
I purchased this probe thermometer because I started getting into real barbecuing, I mean meat smoking.  It works pretty good.  The temperatures are not as accurate as most instant read thermometer's, but then again, you can't leave an instant read thermometer in your oven.  However, compared to the rest that I looked at... it is decent in the price isn't too bad comparison to the other units that are like this one. One thing you will want to do, purchased an extra probe cable.  They get kind of dirty and they're a little bit difficult to clean.  They're good for several uses, but after awhile the actual chord gets a bit gunky.  All in all... I would recommend this unit... but I think probe thermometer's are far from perfect.  Nice gadget to have around the house, though.  One more thing, the magnet on the back... very nice feature.  It also has a timer that works independently of the thermometer.
I have used this style of thermometer for years, in fact, they have all been Taylor's. This last one I got off a different site for a good deal. I thought if I have to buy a new one every year, it's a small price to pay for accuracy. BTW, I would give it 5 stars for accuracy.I mainly use it for bread baking and checking safe temps of meat. First it is used to check water temperature around 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Then it is used to check my loaves and they should be 190 degrees. This thermometer has rarely seen over 200 degrees. When it works, it is great at giving accurate readings and fairly quick, too.The probe is the issue. The first one went in under 3 months and I was covered under warranty; they sent me a free one. Now, just a little over 2 months later, it has gone bad again. They can only send one to you under warranty, so my $10 check is on the way to receive 2 probes. I run a little bread business out of my home so I can't afford to be without a thermometer. I am getting two so that I will always have a back up. If the next one doesn't last at least 6 months, then I will use the back up and call it quits on Taylor brand thermometers.Feel free to comment if you have had success with another brand thermometer, specifically one with a corded probe...they are my preference.Here's the "Help" info. You might be covered under warranty, so email Info@taylorusa.com first. If you are not covered, they will likely refer you to this address with a note to include $5 check or money order for each probe you want:Taylor Precision Products2220 Entrada Del Sol, Suite ALas Cruces, NM  88001I'll try to remember to update my post with how well my new probes work.Be blessed in the new year!UPDATE 4/11/2012My probe just went bad again, so just 3 months for this one. I double-checked to make sure it wasn't the batteries and lo and behold it was the probe indeed. I have little money or time to research further but just want a thermometer with a fast, accurate reading. Taylor does deliver on that, but this is my 3rd probe in 8 months. That's just crazy. Feel free to comment if you have found a better thermometer out there for a reasonable price.
It seems to work okay for when you are heating something, but I wanted it to alert me when something which is cooling has reached the desired temperature, and it doesn't do that. I think I may return it.
One thing that I do not like about this thermometer is that it does not turn itself off after a certain period of inactivity like others do.
it worked for about a week then it just dosnt tell the wright temp any more and it hasnt worked sents
Seems to work okay. Easy to use. Only problem is according to temperature reading my roast should have been done and it was raw inside...maybe the thermometer is off? If so, there's no way to recalibrate it.
I guess mostly my fault.  Coming off a high end remote cooking thermometer, I was tired of the probe burning out, so I ordered this unit.  Just know you have to know the temperature you are looking for.  For example, there is no &#34;Medium Rare Beef&#34; setting.  Just temps.
I was very excited to get this digital thermometer and was looking forward to baking my first pork roast.I preheated the oven and stuck the probe into the center part of my 5lb roast.I set the alarm to go off when the internal temperature reached 165When the alarm went off I took out the roast and let it rest 5 minutes before cutting it in half.The roast was NOT done in any way, shape or form.So I put it back in the oven and hoped for the best.I am not sure what I did wrong and could use some advice.Thank youRespond here or at dennis@cartcorp.com
The timer seems to work fine but after just a few months of use the magnets on the back lost there hold on the thermometer and stuck to the refrigerator. The result is that we now have a kitchen thermometer that will not stick to a metal surface as advertised. Bummer for people who like to keep their thermometer on the refrigerator or other metal surface.
The true way to get perfectly cooked meats is to use a cooking thermometer. This one is adequate but I have learned the hard way that you do not want the probe's wire to touch the oven racks, you do not want to get the wire too wet, you do not want to have the probe in the meat and the oven when you are roasting at very high heats (like anything over 400 degrees) and it's probably advisable to always order a back-up probe when ordering this unit.
I bought this probe about 3 years ago, and with regular use (daily as timer, weekly as thermometer) pieces of its functionality failed over time.  At about 2 years, it refused to accept any key inputs when sitting upright (as pictured).  Next, the hour button failed, so all timing was relegated to 59 minutes or less.  Recently, the timer started to reset to 0:00 in the middle of timing.  And lastly, the thermometer probe just started to register very inaccurate temperatures.  I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, given that it worked quite well while it lasted.  I just would have expected at least a 5 year life on all functions!
this is not a very long lasting unit.  i can count on about a year of light use and then they die.  i have gone to using a stick unit for all items i don't need the probe for.  Excels as a timer - again when it works.if competitor had a better option i would jump at it.
I bought this so I could smoke on my Weber One Touch Gold and not have to take the lid off to check the internal temperature of the meat.  And for that, it worked fine a few times.  Very satisfied.The trouble came when I tried to use this for a roast in the oven.  I inserted the probe into the meat and closed the oven door.  Then I attempted to use the magnets on the back to mount the display on the oven..... That did not work at all.  The display fell on the ground and the probe wire sheared, which rendered my probe useless.  This really made me angry.  I'll probably buy another probe and I'd recommend everyone else do the same.The actual device worked fine until I broke the probe.
had a hardtime getting it to work.  This is my third unit I have purchased over the years and I see NO  improvements
The original probe worked one time, it was a great piece of meat,  the "replacement probe" I purchased along with it didn't even work when taken out of the package. Both probes now state the room temperature is about 105f in a room at 60f, and a glass of ice-water they report to be about 70 to 80f.  You would think the manufacturer would provide adequate information for replacement probes, being they seem to be so fragile. You might even think they may come up with a way of manufacturing more sturdy probes. But I forgot, these were manufactured outside america, why expect it to work, otherwise if it were made in america it would come with the 6 pages of legalease that basically states you got what you paid and once you use it, any defects are your problem. Would be an nice gadget, if it actually worked and worked more than once. Otherwise, plan on spending $16 (adding in the probes) per pound to get a decently cooked piece of meat. It does make a handy kitchen timer.
I agree 100% with Jeremy M (below).  Two problems:1)  Probes are the weak point.  Expose to slight overheating, and the whole unit is trash.  WHY NOT SELL PACKAGES OF PROBES?2)  The second (serious)problem:  they go out of calibration, and offer no way to recalibrate.  Over and over, when a unit says 185 F, it is really 160 (etc).  WHY NOT MAKE THE UNITS CALIBRATIBLE?I have a box of at least 5 or 6 units of various units, none of which work as intended.  ~$20/unit is NOT, in my mind, a disposable unit...PLEASE, should manufacturers care, provide packages of probes, and make it possible to calibrate units.
As noted by many other reviewers here, the weak link in the chain is the temperature probe, which cannot withstand continuous oven temperature exposures over 350 degrees F.Lots of oven cooking occurs at higher temps, so this is a genuine limitation (not mentioned anywhere in the instruction manual).Another piece of junk added to the post-consumer waste pile.
I just put my fourth one on my wishlist bc it is wonderful but it breaks soon.  It's less than a year since I bought my last one.
I bought this for myself, but have yet to use it, so I can't really rate it.  It looks like it will work just fine and I know someone who has one and recommended it to ME&#62;
I have owned 4 of these in the last 5-6 years. Thermometer works great, but probes are undependable. With the first one probe lasted 6 months. There was an 800 number on the instructions and I called and the probe was replaced for free. It lasted a year or so and probe died. Bought a replacement at target and probe lasted a few weeks. I took it back to target and they replaced for free. Probe lasted a year or so and died. There was no contact number on instructions. I bought a new on at Kohl's that had the Foodtv brand. It is exactly like this one. Probe lasted only 2 years and no phone info on literature that came with product. I am cooking a ham for Christmas and am using a 25-30 year old glass thermometer that the only problem it has is a hard to read scale from use.
It was the darndest thing. I opened up the thermometer and it seemed dead on arrival. Nothing I did seemed to want to get it to work. I came upstairs to my office prepared to research how to do a return, "placed" it down on my desk a "little aggressively" and boom, it came on and has worked just fine ever since. Go figure. It seems to be a fine thermometer, but I can't give it a completely glowing review because of that experience.
Temperature read seems accurate.  Decent read speed.While this device works alright, but I find the assembly quality a little bit lacking.  It feels fragile to me, and not quite as solid of fit and finish as previous similar devices I have owned from other brands.Probe cable appears to be rubber on the outside, which is a little off-putting for oven use (versus braided metal from other manufacturers that clearly won't deform/wear/melt when trapped in a metal oven door).  It is "safer" I suppose as it won't transfer heat directly... but the metal probe still will so you still need to be careful with it.
I use this for monitoring my mash temps inside a cooler. The first brew, it was about 2 degrees F hot. the Second brew it was all over the place. I've read some reviews and thoughts that the probe can get wet... that seems like a bad design. I'll try again to clea up/dry out the probe, but I may have to switch to another solution. The timer function is dead on though!
Everything about this thermometer works fine. It gives a good, fast reading of the temperature, has a timer feature, and can sound an alarm based on time and/or temperature. All great features.However, one major feature of this thermometer is that you can place the probe in the food that is cooking, while it is cooking, and monitor the temperature with the main unit out of the oven. The problem however is the cord for the probe ... While the cord does not melt all over, it does have problems at the point where it is squished by the oven door. I've only used it three times so far, but the cord shows significant damage at the point it comes in contact with the oven at the door. The highest temperature I have used it at is 350 degrees, which is within the limits on the products description.I think they should have used a more durable material for the cord that can better withstand the heat, or even provided a sleeve you can place on the cord at the point it will come in contact with the door. Mine is still working, for now, but I do not expect many uses before the probe fails judging by the amount of damage it's already received after only three uses.
It works. Not the best thermometer we have used. It's alilttle fragile and the temp guide for the meat seems off.. But, it does seem to be accurate so that's ok
When not being used to cook meat, I like to use my cooking thermometer as my outdoor kitchen thermometer when not in use and enjoy reading the temperature from within the warm confines of my house during winter, but this thermometer's temperature reading is quite small and it doesn't read below 32 degrees.  Oh well.  It works.  I should have noted the small temp section of the readout.  Jury is still out on accuracy and longevity.
So far I haven't had any real problems with this thermometer but have only used it a few times so far.  However, the temperature probe only goes up to 392 degrees so if you want to also use it to check the accuracy of your oven thermostat you will have to test it at no higher than 350 degrees.  But it works great for the foods I have used it for so far and hopefully the probe will work for quite awhile and will not need to be replaced too soon and as per other reviews the probe should last as long as you don't expose it to temperatures above 350 degrees .  This also has a timer option which is also very handy!
Even when directions are followed rigorously, the probes on these guys are prone to melting down.  I've purchased one from all the major distributors, and they all work the same.  Taylor or somebody needs to sell a 10-pak of probes, instead of me buying a whole new unit every 4 months... They do work great though.  I use an older gas oven that has trouble maintaining proper cooking temperature.  The secondary dial that I've installed inside can read as much as 50 degrees different from the digital dial on the oven.  Because of this, I prefer to probe and track the cooking temp of the food instead so that I can provide a perfectly cooked product.  I also use this for making tea, as 212 is too hot for good tea, and 185 to 195 is a better temperature.Still, the probe does melt down as other have said.  I typically get about 30 to 50 uses before I need to purchase another.  The problem occurs mostly when the oven temp exceeds 350, as I lose most probes when baking breads.  Still, I can't live without it, I just wish Taylor would start selling a package of probes for my dozen `timers' that I have sitting around the kitchen.  It would be 5 stars if the probes didn't die.
I used this product less than ten times in the year I had it. It worked pretty well. It had a timer and temperature function so it was pretty spiffy. The cord and temperature taker cleaned up pretty well.However, the thing stopped working about a year after purchasing it. When I set it on temperature mode, the thing's beeping alarm wouldn't turn off, even if the meat was still cold. I'm disappointed.
Works good the first 2 times. I use it in my smoker (200 F MAX) only. I run into intermittent issues now with the Temp showing &#34;LO&#34; instead of the actual number.
Like others, I was thrilled with this product - in one weekend, I made candy with my children at about six different temperatures and everything came out perfect.  We had fun doing science experiments with everything from the freezer to coffee - guess what the temperature is?Then I used it on pork chops on the grill, and once the chops reached 120 degrees, the thermometer beeped (it wasn't supposed to until 160 degrees), and registered "HI" as the current temperature.I emailed Taylor to ask them about the problem, and they are shipping me a new probe (FOR FREE) and will replace future ones for Now, I'm relatively satisfied.  I have talked to others that use another brand of digital thermometer, and they haven't had the "probe problem" that this make seems to have.  Seems to be a defect that the Taylor is trying to remedy, though!
I love this thermometer for the ease of programing and the rich features.  I have bought several.  I use them for baking bread and especially making sure that my turkey has not overcooked.  However, the probe has a short life.  A replacement unit states in the manual that it has a temperature limit of 395F which explains why they have been failing.  I will try keeping the oven temperature down and won't use the grill, maybe it will last longer.I have found that wrapping the wire with a couple of layers of foil makes them last longer.  Also, replacement probes are available from Taylor for a reasonable $5 each.  Contact customer service through [...] for details.Note that my Weber Grill probe did not last as long as these Taylor probes in the grill.
after the second use the probe failed,I have returned it to the mfg and am hopeful of a replacement under the warrenty.john stanley
Bought two of these through the years ~~ When it works it is great however, it is not long lasting........
As every reviewer notes. the temperature probe just quits working at some point in time. But Amazon, December 2006, had the entire package on sale for $7.99. I bought two just to replace a single probe that had failed. In other words, it is cheaper to purchase the entire package than purchase a single replacement probe.
I loved this thermometer when I first got it, but after six months of occasional use, it will only show celsius temperatures unless I jiggle it and then it briefly shows farenheit and then back to celsius.  I've been too long away from school to do the conversion in my head so I'm shopping for another brand.
this thing works.if you need lab precision there are other place s to go to.if you need something to tell youif you are looking at 80F or 120 Fthis is the cheap way to go.tea does taste better at about 200F and not 212Fpls note..ok its not a brickits not made in 1960its made in china as we consumers have deemed it to be.hence the affordability.butcheck out the manual and the design of this thingits made by a bunch of people who are peoplewho care, and is wisely designed.alarms for either TIMEor reach upto a certain pre set TEMPare availablegoes from 0 C to 200 Cgood enuff for most thingsif you need for experiments like meto go from -100 C to 2000 Cyou must look at lab grade stuff in hundreds of dollars friend.but if you can get it landedcost into your home for less than usd 33its a useful thing to have aroundfor food or other measurementsin that rangeohyesi like that instant conversion with flick ofswitch too.. between C  and  Fon back of machine tho, not front.itsplasitcso DONT put IN or outside hot stuffwill melt.keep it some place a bit awayworks.good logical designtake care use wisely and gentlywill serve you welltksk
I have three of these all of the probes have gone bad.. If you change the probe between the thermometer the bad  temp readings follow the probes .... like the product  but need to improve probe and supply replacements///
I don't have this particular thermometer, so I can't comment on its quality, this comment is in response to the reviewer who said his thermometer was inaccurate because it measured boiling water at 208 degrees.The temperature at which water boils is affected by altitude; water only boils at 212 degrees at sea level.  For every 500 feet above that, the temperature drops by one degree, so at 2000 ft above sea level water would boil at 208 degrees.Without knowing where the reviewer lives, it's certainly possible that the thermometer was accurate and the water was simply boiling at the lower temperature due to location.
It's all true.  A digital thermometer is an indespensible tool for the kitchen.  This one works great for a while, and then starts giving erroneous results, so beware.The digital timer feature is handy, although not very well done.  It makes a raucous noise when you turn it on.  And setting the time is a bit inconvenient as you can't reduce the amount of time.Although the metal wire and probe and temperature alarm feature might make you think you can leave the probe in your food while it's cooking, DON'T.  The probe will conduct heat into the middle of your food much faster than the meat will, and so the meat around the probe will get cooked and the probe will tell you (totally accurately) that the meat is done, it's only referring to the meat right next to the very hot probe.  The rest of your meat is not yet cooked.
I love this little guy, very accurate, always works...except when the probe wire breaks.  I have owned four in four years.  Would give it 5 stars if that darn wire was a bit sturdier!
I rated it OK but that is only when it works. When the screen reads &#8220;lo&#8221;, the probe is probably toast. This is the second one of these I bought and they both failed in less than 3 months. Taylor agreed to replace the probe three weeks ago, but I haven&#8217;t seen it yet. A new probe is about $15 with shipping from Amazon. Yes I used it correctly and did not abuse the probe!
OK but more complicated than what I wanted.  I was looking for a plain thermometer to check when meat was done when grilling
I was looking for a thermometer to measure the temperature in our Smoker -- which has temps similar to an oven.  This probe is really a MEAT thermometer -- measuring the temperature in the product, not the ambient temperature in the oven.
I'm on my second unit, third prob.Both units have been 20 degrees off.In my opinion, the prob is too long. Therefore, it goes through the meat and hits the metal surface of the pan; causing the prob to short out.On the bright side, it has enabled me to roast whole chickens to perfection. As long as I remember it's 20 degrees off.
Works great in every respect and seems pretty accurate.  However, it won't stay toggled on Fahrenheit.  If switched to Celsius it's fine, but I don't do Celsius.  When switched to Fahrenheit, the display flashes back and forth between the two incessantly and won't stay on F.  Naturally, this makes it really hard to read.  For me at least.
I use the Taylor for both bread and meat temperature gauging.  However, the wire tends to pull apart from the probe ever-so-lightly and the probe will read LOW and never register.  if I giggle the cord enough i can get it to read room temperature but only when held certain ways.I continue to use this model as its cheap and works great when it does work, but, buyer beware regarding the probe cable.Update:  My second one has died, the screen stopped working well... I emailed customer support and they wanted me to mail the faulty unit back for a replacement.  I told them I didn't want to spend the $$$ in shipping ($5.95/flat rate) on a $13 item.  After some begging, they shipped me a new one.I continue to like this product but wish manufactering was better.  I'm not sure there's anything better for the cost.
Well sometimes you just get what you pay for.This little unit is ver inexpensive yet so far very accurate.It has a low upper limit of heat that it can be used in (392 Degrees is listed as do not use above).I have not had the chance to say about its duribility, but if your going to use it EVERY DAY like saome have said thay do, well this probably is not the unit for you. For that frequent of use I would look to a commercial model.
And I'm not talking about the probes.  The unit itself goes blitzoid after about a year.  Despite new batteries.  Although I'm a heavy user of probe type thermometers, I'd expect the actual unit to last longer than a year.  I bought extra probes, but beware:  the "plastic" coated probes are at least 10 to 20 degrees off (F).  The plastic coated probes register about 10-20 degrees F HIGHER than the actual temperature which causes underdone food.  Since nothing is made in the U.S anymore (and will get progressively worse over the next four years) I would recommend getting the METAL probes and not the plastic coated ones.
After three years of use, I finally had to buy another one.  Everything works until the probe connection started to come loose exposing wires and the temperate no longer register.  This is on the probe side not the plug side.  I think they do just sell just the probe itself but for the price, you'll just want to get another.Oh yes, it comes in the impossibly to open clear plastic clam shell container.
After a short time, the probe wire broke away from the probe. The digital reading is hard to read if the sun is on the screen.
My temps are off by 7-8 F.  No calibration feature, just knew by placing the probe in ice water and compared to another mercury based thermometer... Oh well.
It works great with ovens and has great functionality. However, every time I have used it with a smoker, the readings are off and now the probe doesnt accurately register with the  device.I just dont think it has a long user life and is limited to ovens. My opinionWould I buy it again - Im looking for another product for my smoker.
She says it works fine; I didn't get feedback from her yet - I believe she hasn't cooked with it so we'll soon find out.
This therometer replaced one that had a feature where you could pick the type of meat and then set the temp for rare through well done on beef and lamb.  It also set minimum temps for pork and poultry.  This one does not have this feature which is a disappointment.  My main concern, based on filed comments, is the durability of the probe which I will monitor.
The best way to cook. I have been using them for years. Notice I said &quot;them&quot;. I have tried Taylor, Polder &amp; Accurite. ALL are made in China. All fail in 6-9 months. After 6 hours of my valuable time one day, I got a hold of Tech Support at an importer.The problem is the probe. You can not wash it, kink it or expose it to temperatures greater than 390 F. (My Webber says to pre-heat grill to 550!) Plan on buying many replacements and a life of 6 months each. Not many Web merchants have the probe in their shopping cart.Too bad no American company can do the technology right.
This is the second Taylor meat thermometer we have purchased. After about 1 year our first Taylor thermometer started reading HI all the time and would not display a temperature. So, we purchased a second Taylor meat thermometer because we really like the way it works and the size of the digital display. The second one failed as well, but much quicker. We only had it for a few months. I have an electronics background so this time I checked the unit out. The issue seems to be with the manufacturing process of the sensor cable. There are two solder joints to connect the temperature element to the sensor cable wires. These connections were done correctly. There are two more solder locations which connect the sensor cable wires to the long wires that eventually plug into the unit. One of these connections was not soldered at all. This is the second unit we have had fail and it sounds like the same issue that other consumers are having as well. If this is intentional from the manufacturer, it is a wonderfully devious plan. The sensor cables will work for a while, probably long enough to make it pass the warranty. I cannot believe that Taylor's Quality Control Department is unaware of this obvious manufacturer defect. If you have electronics skills and know how to use a soldering iron, the issue I found is in the connections securely sealed in the metal sensor probe just inside where the cable goes into the probe. I used a sharp pair of scissors to gently work a line into the metal. I simply pressed the metal case into the scissors while turning the metal case around and around. This made a deep enough notch to carefully snap about one inch of the metal, not at the tip, but one inch from where the cable goes into the metal of the probe. This allowed all of the wiring inside the sensor probe to slide out. I had to very carefully strip the insulation off to find the cause of the problem. I was really surprised to find no breakage in the wire. It appears to have been built with less than a one-quarter inch over-lap of the wires. This is why it works until you wiggle the wires enough during use, causing the wires to eventually separate. After making the repair, our unit is working great again. Great device, but they need to provide better quality manufacturing.Taylor 1470 Digital Cooking Thermometer/Timer
The wire attachment lasted for a year or two then stopped reading anything but the word "Low." Changing the battery twice didn't help. Upon inspection the inner wire was exposed at the spike, half of it possibly severed (hard to tell). They should have a heavy duty protective connection there. Instead, it's just crimped. The stuck reading started when I started using it to check the temperature of hot fry oil with it, but a few months before that I think is when it started to read low, because meat seemed overcooked. Other than all that I absolutely loved this little digital meat thermometer. Wish it was higher quality. I really do.
We received as a gift. Worked fine at first, but then I started to have real problems with it registering high temps on meats and I'd cut them open to find them still virtually raw.  The digital display would flicker, it just seemed to be giving out.  I'd say we owned it for 7 or 8 years, but probably used only 12-14 times.  Now that I'm searching for a replacement and I see how much this model costs, I guess I'm not surprised to see it wasn't a long time solution.  If you need something really basic, probably good enough; if you want something reliable that would be trusted for years to come, I'd recommend trying a different product.
I used it one time and it worked great.  I turned it off and didn't work again.  I don't know how to fix it.  I took out batteries and reinstalled and that didn't help.  Don't know what to do about this product?
works fine, its like all the other ones, the probes are junk. you just have to buy more probes or get then to warranty them. The problem with buying extra probes they some times cost more than buying a whole new unit.  To bad they cant make a probe that is worth a darn.
This thermometer is accurate enough I've never over cooked anything based on the temperature it's displayed(Though I have cooked things too long because I've lost track of time).  I've tried to use it for smoking and the problem I've found is that the lack of second probe for monitoring the temperature of the smoker is a real problem.It does work very well as a probe when cooking in the over though.  I would not purchase this again.  The Maverick ET732 seems a much better value for the money.B007UFOUB8
I've had this for about 2 years; yesterday it died on me, sending me to surf amazon for its replacement.  The &#34;Minute&#34; button is broken, so I can only pick hours, and I can't even reset it as that requires pressing both the hour and minute button together for a reset.  The probe itself is not too bad; there is a generous amount of cable, and in so far as I know, the temp has been fairly accurate.  The buttons though is where most of the problems are.  They &#34;rock&#34; back and forth, so you aren't confident that you've pressed the button, or that even though you've pressed the button, that time actually advanced.  The alarm itself is quite loud and annoying, which in the case of a timer is a good thing.  All in all, I bought it because I saw Alton Brown had one, it has been decent, but the longevity of it, and the reliability of buttons makes me not want to buy it again as a replacement.  Looking at it's more expensive counterpart, Thermoworks.
Be careful when using the probe while barbecuing.  This was great for the first use - Thanksgiving turkey in the smoker.  Didn't make it through the second use - the barbecue.  Had to order another probe.
I bought this product to use when I 'm smoking meats and it works great!!  As a matter of fact, I bought a couple of them.  The accuracy seems to be within 1-3
Really liked the product.  Contained both a temperature alert and timer alarm.  Unfortunately it stopped working (would give the wrong temperature reading) within a year.  I didn't use it too often, so I would have to give this product a low rating to make up for the short lifespan.
The plastic case warps easily, which sucks because its a THERMOMETER.  By the time mine died (five month lifespan tops), the case was warped substantially.  No wonder water got inside when I was cleaning all the grease off it.  And it will, because the probe's cord is way too short.  It needs to be at least another two feet longer.  And don't put the probe in the washing machine.  For some reason, it can stand being in a friggin oven but not the washer.  After the dish washer the temp reading was off by a good ten degrees.I gave it 3 stars because 1) its cheap 2) its just as bad as the majority of these type thermometers adn 3) for all its crappiness it did work while it wasn't being abused.
Had the same problems as many other reviewers, worked great for awhile then starting giving a Hi indication.  This appears to be a problem with the probe and new probes which appear to fix it can be obtained at [...]  The instructions for the device states:-dont expose the thermometer to water, dirct heat, a hot surface or direct sunlight (they do reccommend sterilizing the probe in boiling water prior to each, so presumably their advice to avoid exposing the thermometer to water-perhaps this means the electronics portion and not the probe?)-avoid getting the sensor plug wet-dont use in an oven with a temp higher than 200C/392F-dont allow the probe to directly contact bone in the food to be cooked-dont use in a microwavePerhaps the difference in the working life of the thermometer is related to how closely these admonitions are followedhope this helps
The vacuum is created by using a separate pump, and it is difficult to know if one has pumped sufficiently.  Then there is the question of where to keep the pump device.  I found the container a bit smaller than I needed to store my coffee beans, and space consuming, considering the need to keep the pump device handy.
I almost bought one of these and then I asked the author of a number of books on coffee what he thought.  He said he and his colleagues don't use them because 1) the vacuum action sucks oils and flavors out of the beans during each pump but 2) if you don't pump a lot, you're removing so little oxygen it doesn't make any difference.  He noted that Illy and other non-Folgers type coffee bean dealers don't vacuum pack, they pack the beans in CO2 or Nitrogen (I think) gas, so that there's no oxygen, but the beans aren't being sucked dry of their oils and flavors.  I think these canisters would be useful for creating a seal, but I wouldn't use them for really creating vacuum.
Nice color and sturdy handle.... mine came with the bristles permanently bent over and so I never liked it.  My son used it on a griddle that was too warm and the bristles melted and it was ruined.
This cuts the pizza great.  One pass and the pizza is cut.  It is sharp and the roller blade moves easily.  The cover is great and the color is pretty.My only complaint is the same that I have with all of my Kitchenaid utensils:  The handle is too big and the cutter is a little heavy.  It fits in the hand and gives you something solid to hold on to while cutting but it is sometimes awkward to use quickly with all of the weight being in the handle.Also, it is difficult to fit into my tool turn around with all of the other utensils and they all take up too much room in the drawer together.  I also have a pampered chef pizza cutter that is lighter with a much smaller handle that is easier to use.  It is not necessary for this utensil to be so big.But like I said this cuts the pizza cleanly so if you do not care about the size of the handle or the heaviness of the utensil, this does the job.
Ordered this as a housewarming gift.  I received a phone call from my brother and his new girlfriend perplexedly thanking me for the dessert fondue set I sent them.  Which I didn't, I had ordered them the electric wok they'd been ogling at Target but couldn't afford.  ANTOnline was helpful in getting the fondue set returned but they don't even carry the wok anymore.  So I still ended up spending quite a bit of money at Target and got them their house warming gift a month late.
it wasn't worth the price that was asked , the temperature control is  weak and cheap as is the whole wok  flimsy is the word for this wok ,  wont recomend.
The wok heats up very quickly. However, the location of the plug-in control is a little inconvenient and the dial is a little difficult to use because it is located just below and a little to the left of a handle. It would be better if the control plug were 90 deg between the two handles.
Style, size and features are fine.  But this toaster simply does not provide a nice even toasted surface on the bread.
This product I am rating as just "ok".  The package says there is a 100 tags yet actually the seller sends you (2)two packs of 50, no big deal in my opinion just be aware that will be what you get.  What I don't really care for is the pen that comes with it really smears easily until it dries on the mylar tags so you have to be precise with what you write and not put too much pressure on the pen.  I would buy more of these but I think I am going to find a better pen for them next time.
With a little practice and a routine, this machine is pretty easy to use.  Others have complained about milk clogging the steamer.  I found running some steam into a cup of water will adequately clean it out.  For the money, I think this is a great machine.Cons: Steam wand is too close to the body and it is stationary.  It is difficult to fit a container for steamed milk.  The unit does not come with a metal cup for steamed milk, so this required an additional outlay of about $10.  I can make about 20 oz. of cappuccino/mocha in one execution.  This ends up being a single serving for myself.  You are limited in the amount of espresso and steamed milk (because of wand configuration) you can make in one batch.  Therefore, when making drinks for a larger group, you need to run through the routine multiple times.  Quite a hassle.  If you plan to use while entertaining, look for a different machine.
This machine is easily operated and makes espresso that tastes as good as any, crema &amp; all. If, however, you plan on making more than one beverage, that is, a beverage that requires the use of the steamer, you will need some time, as you will have to cycle through at least 2 cycles for a single beverage to get it to temp out. But who can complain at this price? Not I, although I am returning mine for replacement/repair due to the fact that it now requires two cycles to steam 8oz of milk, unacceptable at any price. Don't get it if you're playing Barista for more than one.
I agree with a previous reviewer, it is difficult to handle and its worst drawback is it is an exact replica of something made in the 50's, so the handle I guess is made for a woman's hand because I cannot grip it entirely without hitting my knuckles on the base.  This does not make any sense because this is really the only way to crush the ice.  Other than that it works pretty well.
We purchased this ice crusher on Amazon because we couldn't get it in the Target store. If I had seen it in the store and had a chance to see it operate, I wouldn't have purchased it. The crusher is heavy cast iron and steel and has sharp blades, it's just not heavy enough to keep it from sliding across the counter when trying to operating it. If you put a lot of weigh on the top to keep it from sliding, it'll flip over. By the time you've fought it all over the bar and kitchen, all the ice has melted in the catch cup.If you're looking for fast, easy crushed ice for bar drinks, invest the cash on a good commercial type electric unit and use the Metrokane for an art-deco piece in the bar corner.
I was looking for an ice crusher for my bar.  Some drinks just need crushed iced--not blended like a Slurpy, but crushed.  So, I looked around and there aren't a whole lot of choices and Metrokane seems to have the obvious two.  After reading a couple of reviews, I chose the Ice-o-mat for two reasons.  One, it was all metal, and two, it was stylish.  Having used it a number of times now, I can definitely say that it's a sturdy and attractive device (in an art deco sort of way).  However, I have noticed a couple of things.  First off, it says it makes two sizes of ice depending on the direction you turn the crank.  Well, I cant tell the difference, but that probably isn't too big of a deal.  Since you are crushing ice (and usually pretty big cubes) it's kind of jerky and takes some force to get this done and keep the thing on the counter, so it may not be the best choice if you are a little on the weak side.  The most serious problem and why I rated it so low is that there is a problem with the crank and stand.  The stand is about  1 1/2 inches too short so that if you grip the crank you wind up hitting your knuckles on the base of the stand.  Since it takes a lot of force to turn the crank and hold the crusher steady it is difficult to hold onto the crank with just your finger tips.  Unfortunately, I don't know of a better device to recommend.
Nearly impossible to clean even when pre-treating it with no-stick spray.  Food gets into the holes and gets baked into it.  As for cooking, it does well but it won't really brown the crust which I like, but others might not.
I've found that the pizza tends to stick to it pretty badly when cooked. It also got sort of discolored after the first use when I pre-washed it then ran it through the dishwasher. Not the best pan ever but it gets the job done.
Wedding gift requests.
Nice large size. Only used it a couple of times.Has not seemed to make a big difference in browning bottom of pizza. I will try prebake nekt time. All in all nice pan.
Good size pan, but be careful with the coating as it scratches very easily. Needs something below pizza when it's done cooking in order to cut it.
I was hoping to find a pan that would bake the bottom of the pizza so it was crunchy, but this does not. It tends to leave the bottom kind of soft even after the top of the pizza cheese is already browning.What finally worked for me was a stone; expensive, but as you heat the stone in the oven for 30 minutes before you place the pizza on it, it does crisp up the bottom of the pizza as I wanted.
good product and easy to clean i not sure if i used correct but the pizza go in more minutes than the other
I haven't actually used these pans, but they are sturdily made, and are just what I was expecting. I have used a friend's pans that were similar to these and was very pleased. I will,probably be purchasing several more in the future.
Good but they don't filter as well after a short period of time.
The first filter we used was defective and the water wouldn't filter through after a couple of weeks.  The second one we've used has been fine for the full two months.  we'll see how the third one does...
Apparently it does not ship well, I have ordered a few times some replacement filters and I always have an issue either one arrived opened or it gets cloaked after 2 days of use.
I lack the equipment for running a thorough test. Based on a simple smell and taste comparison, it does the job. It is easy to use. The filters also still fit an older pitcher. However, the new filters do not have the usage indicator anymore that on the older filters told one when it was time to replace it.
Like a couple of the other reviews here, the last batch of 3 I got from here become clogged up after about 10-14 days of use (1 - 1.5 gallons a day). The slowdown of water as the filter gets old is normal for Pur. By the end of the filter's life, water will literally take hours to get through. (I've used Pur filters off and on for probably 10 years.) This filter type I've been using for about 2 years in the 1 gallon dispenser. My first 9 or so filters lasted quite a long time -- about 2 months each. They recently changed the box design and my last batch of 3 was absolutely terrible. I just put the last one in 11 days ago and it's already so slow water takes a full day to get through. Nowhere near the 40 gallons the box claims. Either they had a bad run recently or the new box change also brings with it a new, vastly crummier filter. Pur tastes pretty much like bottled water, but if it only lasts 10 days I'm not really saving any money over bottled anyway.An update: Nov 27, 2012 (1 yr later) - These things are still EXTREMELY inconsistent. I'll get one filter that lasts a month and a half and then the next filter in the box lasts only 5 days before it starts clogging up. I even tore a filter apart trying to find where the clog might be. It seems to be in the 2nd stage of the filter which is a thick, many-layered paper material. There was no issue at all getting water through the first stage. It makes me wonder what's in there that's clogging it. It could be my water, but I think it could also be bits of the charcoal grit being used in the 1st stage. Either way, it's ridiculous that you can get a filter that clogs in 5 days. At that rate, bottled water is cheaper. I might have to look into switching brands. I know Brita never clogs because it doesn't have that 2nd stage. The water doesn't taste as good, but at least you can use it for a month or two before you toss it.
First batch worked fine: water tasted good and it filtered quickly. On our second batch of filters the water tasted fine but water would stop flowing halfway. Very annoying.After tooling with it for a few weeks with little success, I just shook the thing. Presto! Bamo! It works like it should.-2 stars for the pain in the butt and spotty quality.
I bought the 3 filters to go with my 18 cup dispenser. One of the filter refused to work no matter what I did--following directions provided. Now I need filters again...little bummed.
The bags around the filter MAY have had slight openings. When I squeezed the bags, air released slowly - implying a small leak. I don't know if this is the case on the normal, new product.
This was my initial review when I first bought the filter:"I'm with the other reviewers who complained about how the flow slows to a drip after a couple of weeks.  Very disappointed with this, considering that our Brita pitcher filters never have this problem."But, I think I figured out the problem.  I, like I'm sure many people, tended to keep the top chamber full even when the bottom chamber was full of filtered water.  This was so that I wouldn't have to reactively refill it when only a little filtered water was left.  Well, I think it's when the top of the filter is sitting in water in the top chamber for an extended period of time that something happens to it (maybe the "cotton" fabric swells up), that ends up clogging the filter.  When I stopped doing that and only filled it so that the top chamber would completely empty out into the bottom chamber that the filter would work fine.  I've done it with two filters now, and so far so good.  In fact, I kept the first filter in for about 6 months with no problems.Still, I'm going to up my rating only to 3 stars because it's ridiculous that I had to figure this out myself.
I have been using the PUR system since 2010 and I strongly recommend it. However, I purchased these replacement filters in late 2013 when I still had 2 other filters in hand so I just opened the box (my bad). The box was not sealed and it contained 3 filters rather than 4. It's only a loss of $5.50, but these boxes should be sealed by PUR so that items cannot be removed while they are sitting in an Amazon warehouse.
I like this filter. I hope it's doing the job !_!  Who really knows. It gets a lot of press but may not be any better than the rest.
I got this for the price.  It was cheaper than buying a 2-pack.  But there were no instructions with them.  I had to look online.
I purchased 2 of the tank filter systems along with the package of 4 filters.  Before ordering I read that several of the reviews mentioned problems with the water filtering very slowly.  I did not experience this problem with my filters.  I have just changed the filter on both tanks and am beginning to experience problems.  One of my systems works well.  The second tank and filter is taking about 2 hours to filter the water.  The other tank only takes about 20 minutes.  Hopefully this lengthy filtering will improve.  May be it is a faulty filter.....the jury is still out.  One thing for sure, it really makes the water taste wonderful.
I have been using Pur water filter for about an year now...  I so love this water filter and the water tastes absolutely wonderful...clean and crystal like. However off late i am very disappointed with the replacement filter shelf life. Though Pur product description says the filter is good for 2 months...From the beginning what i noticed is its only good for a month. The rate of water filtration goes down by the time its actually 3 weeks old and you need to replace it by the end of 4th week. However, recently in the past few months i noticed that the filter half life has gone down to 10 days!!!!!!!! Yes...within 10 days filtration rates slowed down to the extent that it took overnight to filter the water that i put in the top chamber.... later it was worse...only half water would seep down and rest of it remained on top forever. removing the filter, shaking it up a bit ,putting it under running water and replacing it made it work well for 2 days and it was back to normal! The filtration process sucked!!!I dont know if something's wrong with the previous 2 batches of filters that i purchased (manufacture lot problem!!!) or the quality of PR water filters had gone down!!! Whatever it is.... the frequency of replacing filters makes it hard a cost hazardous maintenance of clean drinking water!!!!!! By The way..Decrease in half-life of filter could not be something due to consumption of water...I am a single person using it and i work...so it's not that its a huge family using it who stay home and drink wanter all day long!!! Extremely disappointed by this quality!!
ive used this system for years and while most replacement filters work fine nearly a quarter become clogged within the first or second day. you can blame it on the water if you want but trust me its not that.....
The folters I received don't exactly look like the ones I was just using.  The new ones don't have the red knob (indicator) on top of the unit to show that the filter is being used up.  These specific filters are so hard to find since they don't sell them in retail stores anymore.  Actually, I can't really tell if they work or not!!??
I selected the double container Pur dispenser. In the box was a message from PUR Company to contact PUR first if there was a problem. Well, I did and THAT was a mistake. As soon as I put water into the container the spigot leaked. Upon examination I saw that the gasket failed to be in place. Nothing I could do about that. When I called PUR, the rep said that they would decide whether or not to send me a coupon for a replacement. She changed her mind when I insisted on contacting Amazon instead of waiting for a possible coupon.About 3 weeks later a coupon arrived. Of course I had to shop and find a store that had a double container/dispenser type, pay city and state taxes and pay for my gas to find a double container. The container at the store works find. However, the newer filters fail to deliver the cleaner taste of the older type. I have used Pur for over 6 years, but I am reconsidering because of the taste.I wish I had just returned the Pur water dispenser to Amazon. The UPS is 5 miles closer to me and costs less in gas.
I was eagerly awaiting this to arrive, It was easy to put together and it does not take that long for the water to filter. I eagerly filled up my first glass and I can not taste a difference, It tastes like my faucet, The only difference is that the water tastes softer to me but it still tastes like the toilet! Am I doing something wrong?
I won't stop using my Pur dispenser because it spares me from having ten empty plastic jugs in my recycling bin but the short life of these filters is very annoying and costly.
Have always purchased my Pure replacement filters through Amazon.com, the price is unbeatable to the big box stores.  The maker has changed their filters to sending you a sticker to place on the side of your water container monitor when to change the filter...somewhat skimpy since I have a model which has indicator light.  I wont be placing a sticker on my container, but will just take into consideration the time I changed the filter and how many refills I have used. Still a quality product, just not too keen on the shabby change Pur has made.
These filters are great...when they work.  Half of the time, my filters work the first few days, then it starts filtering so slow that it's barely usable.  When it works, it's wonderful.
I have been using this filter for a few years. Just like the other reviewers said, the filters these days lasted much shorter than before. In my case, it's like 2 months vs 6 months. Also, the red indicator is gone, which I don't understand why they took away such a nice feature. Makes me think twice about buying another PUR product.
Allow me to echo what others have said:  NO MONITOR!  INFERIOR!  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED TO GET.Have a nice day.
Quick delivery - gift mailed directly to recipient did not see item - recipient happy. Would recommend this seller to others.
I own the Pur DS-1800Z Water Dispenser. Previously I purchased the Pur Premium 2 Stage Filters (Model CRF-950Z) as replacement filters. Now, confusingly, this filter model comes in a box labelled "Pur Pitcher Refill". But it says on the box that "All Pur pitcher filters fit in all Pur pitchers, including Flavor Options and Dispenser." So, it appears that my dispenser is a pitcher and uses the pitcher filter.Also, Pur has discontinued it's Premium 2 Stage Filters according to info on the new filter package. However, Amazon still labels the product online as 2 stage filters. What a mess!PUR CRF-950Z 2-Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filter, 3-Pack
I got fed up with the pitcher and switched to a faucet mount type. I store water in glass Perrier bottles that are easier to use and glass is better than plastic. Plastic pitchers get dirty and bacteria builds up, glass is much better. I like the indicator light on the faucet mount one too. I do not keep the faucet mount one on the faucet, as it gets in the way. Mount it just for water bottle filling. It is easy to mount and remove.
I'm using these in the PUR 18-cup pitcher.  Our city water is considered good (by the Water Department, probably), but I don't want the fluoride nor the chlorine smell, etc. The filter makes the water taste very good.  By the second week, the taste has changed, and by the third week, I feel I must change the filter.  Here's the deal: changing the filter every 2 or 3 weeks is actually (slightly) more economical than buying those 2 1/2 gallon jugs of "spring water" like Ice Mountain or Spring Valley.
I've owned my dispenser for a few years and even though I know I am being ripped off with the filters, I still wouldn't go back to the gallon water because I hate knowing the empty plastic jugs are going to waste. I hate hauling the jugs home from the market and I hate how much space they take up in the recycling bags.  I live in a neglected part of NYC and occasionally, the tap water will be brown or yellow.  I filtered yellow tap water today and it turned into clear water that I used to make my beverage.
What is the deal here? It does filter nice tasting water. But, when I expose large amounts of water to the filter, the water just stays put in the top chamber of my pitcher. When it does actually filter, it is rather slow. I followed the preparation instructions to a T. Anyway, it seems to get better the more I use it. Sometimes I can tap on the side of the pitcher, or remove it from my fridge for a few mins and the filter begins to filter.
You will get the filter WITHOUT the red dot on the top.
Recent feedback from some users echoed my experience. The filters tend to clog up early, in my case within 3 to 4 weeks of filtering Chicago water. I got tired of this expense, began searching the competition. Went to Amazon pages for Britta system. There I discovered a most helpful review about this problem, by Jonathan Smith: Don't drink the kool-aid., February 25, 2010This review is from: Brita 35530 Ultramax Dispenser (Kitchen)I read it, muttered Well Duh, and proceeded to removed my clogged Pur cartridge, gave it a good shake, reinstalled it, and life is good again. See his review and the comments it got to learn the physics and sanitary issues of doing this.
The filter that came with the original Pur container worked perfectly, but these always seemed to start clogging up halfway through the month! And I don't mean filtering slowly, since I'm expecting these through gravity based carbon filters, but I mean straight clogged up after filling the lower tank halfway! So since they half worked, they get a half good rating. I'm also giving the benefit of the doubt that they normally work, since my first filter did. Semi approve.
Same filters some clogging problem. I made the error of ordering these when I bought my pitcher if I had known that they clog just like the one it came with I might not have bought either.Now when it works it works fantastic but after a week it does clog to the point that it filters so slow its useless. The soaking, shaking trick works but a week later its clogged again and this procedure makes it just about as inconvenient as buying bottled water!.Again works great up until the point where it clogs than its your decision whether or not its worth it to keep taking it out every few days the shake it and soak it.
Pur's new blinking light indicator seems unreliable to me. I'll still use the filter, but I keep track of it on my calendar because last time it indicated that I needed a new one after just 4 weeks. I drink normal amounts of water, don't use it for the coffee maker or make soup with it, so replacement after 4 weeks was ludicrous. I kept using it another month and will keep an eye on the next one. If it konks out after just a few weeks as well, I may complain to Pur or scrap this product all together. too expensive to replace once a month!  I suspect it's a trick by them to make you purchase more often.
Abit expensive for the filters, hope they come up with a cheaper ones and those that can make water alkaline.
First bought these filters (along with the dispenser) a year ago because we live in Mexico City and, uhm, the tap water is...yeah, dicey.  Also because I've camped with a PUR filter for years, and trust their products.  If you do some comparing and see what these filters and Britas filter out, you'll see that these really are a lot better, plus the PUR water tastes better!  HOWEVER, unlike PUR's camping filters (which I've dipped in some pretty nasty water sources and never once had bad results), these seem to be picky about the water you put in them.  And it's not like our tap water is even that bad...actually, it looks clean (no minerals, no cloudiness, no sediment...ie: all the bad stuff is microscopic), but a lot of our filters seem to clog up after 2 weeks of use, rather than the 2 months they're supposed to last (and no, I'm not drinking 2.5 gallons of water every day).  They still filter, but really slowly, and then gradually get slower and slower.  About the time they're filtering 1 liter of water every 12 hours, which might be after 3 weeks of use or we MIGHT make it to the two month mark (at which point we're buying bottled water to compensate for what the PUR is not filtering, blowing the whole cost-effectiveness of having the thing in the first place), we get fed up and swap out the filter.  And, as another reviewer noted, shaking the filter doesn't do a darn thing; neither does re-soaking the filter or even back-flushing it (which I have tried).  Some of them...a lot of them just crap out early!
This is the first set of replacement filters that I've purchased for my PUR Dispenser (DS-1800Z). The original filter performed flawlessly for 2 months, filtering about 1 gallon of water a day. The first thing I noticed about these replacement filters is that there's a small hole in the top. A note in the box reads, "... a design change has been made to this filter.  You'll note a small hole in the top of the filter.  This is to help water flow through the filter and does not affect contaminant reduction of your PuR filter."  Well, after 1 month of usage (about 1 gal. of water/day) it now takes about 8 hours to filter a gallon of water. Not sure if I received a bad filter or this is the result of their "improved design". I called their 800 line, explained the issue, and was offered a voucher for a replacement filter.*********After using these PUR replacement filters regularly for nearly 5 years, I've still found that I get an occasional filter that doesn't quite work as well. Each time I open a new filter I follow the instructions for preparing the filter. And most times the filter will work well for 75-90 days. But occasionally a filter seems to "clog" after less than a month of use. Removing the filter from the dispenser and rinsing again under running water for 10 seconds seems to help me get the suggested filter life expectancy when this occurs.
I am on my second filter and they both zipped the water through for the first two weeks then slowed down noticeably and finally clogged before but near the end of the first month.I have used the Pur water dispensers for years because it is easy to use, the water does taste better than tap but it can smell like an Aquarium if you don't clean it on a regular basis.  The filters are now much weaker than they used to be but there are no other options where the container is totally covered.  The pitcher styles are none of them closed against the air.The best price (once in a while) is five dollar per filter here on Amazon so that IS about five dollars a month.
