They look nice but there are too small for my projects.I am using them any way, but there are difficult to handle.  You can use them to make any type of jewelry.
These have a great color but the hole is to small to use on a slider chain but would work on a cord.
A few beads were loose, but overall the spacers were intact. This product exceeded my quality expectations, is a high value for the price, and was delivered in a timely manner.  I strongly recommend it to everyone.
I love these. So sparkly, but not all there. The pack was short 3. I always count my beads and I'm always disappointed when some are missing. For that I dock a star. They are otherwise beautiful and nicely made. They look way better in person then the picture shows. So you will not be disappointed with looks. Can't say the same for getting all you paid for tho:/ Shipping took longer then other orders placed at the same time, but it still came a good week before estimated delivery.
They look nice but there are too small for my projects. I should have read the description more carefullyI am using them any way, but there are difficult to handle.  You can use them to make any type of jewelry.
They are good but I expected them to be bigger but they fit nicely. I would recommend them to others.
Very good item for the price.  The customer should be allowed to write as many or few words as they please.  You shouldn't be force to write more than you want.
These spacer beads are beautiful, the luster is amazing and makes every necklace look super rich.  I don't normally use more than 4 to 6 at a time to keep the look classy.
and they look awesome with the metallic design beads i bought off this site as well. Will purchase again when i run out.
Very nice color to these beads only the hole is to small to use on a slider chain but works great on cord.
This have a great color just smaller hole than I thought buy very pretty can use on string but not slide chain.
If you're looking for an easel that is easy to carry around, quick to set up, and easy to adjust for appropriate height, this is a fantastic easel!The three legs assemble in a manner similar to tent poles. Each leg separates into five 14 1/2 inch segments connected by an elastic cord. The entire assembly can be folded down quickly and easily for great portability. It is then reassembled in a matter of minutes.Two brackets rest on the front legs and are simply flipped up to adjust or flipped down to lock. They are sturdy and strong, and can easily be adjusted by one person with a display already in place.The issue comes when using this easel to hold something like a white board. While the tent-pole construction is sturdy for holding weights up to five pounds, it has no center stabilizer to keep it still for active use. This makes it almost impossible to use while writing on a whiteboard.If you're looking for something that transports easily for static displays, this easel is worth every penny!
If you are looking for an easel that will hold something over a couple of pounds, look for the heavier duty easel as this easel is made for very lightweight poster or foam board. It does not do well with anything heavy or bulky.  I like it because it is lightweight and only use it for light weight poster board or foam poster board anything heavier and it will tip.It is perfect for what I use it for and breaks down into a small 15 inch base.  It packs great as it is light.  I have bought a heavier duty wood easel and I found it to be too bulky and heavy and bought a metal easel that was heavier.  Neither one worked for me but this one works for what I use it for.I don't have any problems setting it up or taking it down but I only use it maybe 3 or 4 times a month and gets light use, but it does suit my purpose.
PROS:This is more sturdy than I expected it to be. The poles are made of aluminum, painted black.The elastic cord system is like what is used in some camping tents.If the elastic cord inside the poles ever breaks, you can still fit the pole pieces inside each other and still use it in a pinch.Easy put-together: it took less than a minute to unfold it and set it up.Display Holders adjust up and down the length of the poles. Make it any height you need!Collapses and folds away into a nice compact box approximately 2&#34; x 2&#34; x 15&#34;.CONS:Display holders are made of plastic. If one ever breaks off, you are pretty much out of luck!You are going to want to carry a level though to make sure the holders are even once your poster is set up.No locking mechanism to keep the poles in place once set up. Makes it easy to knock over if it gets bumped.
Works flawlessly and quietly. One hand operation. Has not jammed on me yet. The only downside is the short cord. I would have liked a longer cord for easier placement in my office.
Pros:* Goes through paper like butter* Neat, clean holes (no hanging chads)* Handled 20 sheets like a champ* Simple to useCons:* It can overheat during long punching sessions* It's heavy and has a large footprint* Can't adjust hole positionsThe only way this hole punch could be better was if one was able to change the position of the punches, but otherwise, this is a great device. I'll update this review if anything changes for better or worse.
First things first- this &#34;LightTouch&#34; puncher IS easy to use. Take it out of the box, slide the plastic lock (right under the bottom of the handle) to &#34;unlock&#34; and you are ready to go. It easily handled twenty sheets of paper with just one push of the lever. The paper didn't get stuck, the holes were clean, and there's a &#34;confetti catcher&#34; on the unit which slides right off and is easily emptied.The issue for me is that the holes are not FULLY adjustable. Some hole punches have a little track that the screws holding the individual punches slide along so you can position every single punch exactly where you need them. This punch does not- there are numerous pre-drilled holes for each of the three individual punches, and so you have to use the punch in the configurations that come with the unit. I have several 8x10 binders I use as well as different size planner-style notebooks and sketchbooks and was hoping that this punch would be adjustable so I could use them with all of them. The problem is that  So if you are planning on purchasing this for use with a NON traditional format (a planner, a small binder, a ring bound sketchbook or scrapbook), it most likely will not adjust to suit your needs.It's a shame, because this is a NICE hole punch. I highly, highly recommend this if you just need it for a typical three hole 8.5x11 binder. But for custom sizes, it most likely will not be flexible enough to suit your needs.
Overview: A full sized adjustable 3 hole punch that doesn't take up a lot of space.Pros:-Sliding paper chip holder for easy disposal.-Adjustable punch pin positions.-Leverage action means less effort.Cons:-Instructions on box could be a lot better.-Lever handle wiggles, a lot.-Not all metal.-Size of paper limited to 11 3/4" due to stops.Summary: The thing I like about it most is the lever which decreases the effort needed. The thing I dislike about it most is that the lever wobbles. But overall, a nice desktop punch. You don't need a whole lot of effort to punch holes and it doesn't take up a lot of desk space. Even better, the lever locks down if you want to store it in a drawer.
I do art journaling and make some of them using thin cardboard and watercolor paper. This worked on the paper, because it is thick paper 140 lb, I could only do a few sheets at a time. The cardboard I use is like cereal box thickness, and it did a good job with it. I think this would work well for most home use, but if you want heavy duty strength, you would probably want a heavier punch. This was easy to push with the lever, easy to adjust. Swingline makes quality products and are a well known brand in office supplies.
Swingline has released a product here that, right out of the box, lives up to the promises made. Punching through the promised 20 sheets at a time using this hole punch is fast & easy. There are no directions included in or, really, even on the packaging, that explains how to unlock the hole puncher that will arrive to you locked, which isn't the smartest thing ever, but figuring out how to open it isn't really that difficult. As long as you're pushing down on the handle as you slide the locking mechanism to the left, it'll unlock, and you'll be able to get to whatever big enough job is at hand to have you punching through 20 pages at a time. And, thanks to the cushioned handle, it'll be easy enough to get your big jobs done in a flash.Swingline's LightTouch desktop punch also makes it easy enough to punch multiple holes, if you order the right additional punch heads, listed as item # 74865 on the bottom of the plastic tray attached to catch the paper circles that get punched out. Speaking of that tray, it's very cleverly designed, where you don't even have to detach it. It's labeled so that you know where to push (or pull) in order to open the side edge of it, allowing you to neatly dump out those collected little paper circles.I'm not sure how long the somewhat lighter weight plastic handle will last on this hole punch, but the mechanism & base themselves are made of solid metal, so I at least know that those will stand the test of time. I guess it just remains to be seen how long I'll be able to enjoy effective and easy punching through heavy duty jobs...
This is one of the easier (possibly easiest) manual three hold punches out there. I received this as a gift nearly eight years ago, and it has been going strong ever since. The handle is such that it makes punching through several sheets at once much easier on the hand and wrist, with cleaner resulting punches, than the types of hole punches that don't utilize a handle/lever. Like most Swingline office supplies, this hole punch is quality that you can count on.
This is a nice enough hole puncher, but it didn't come with instructions. Apparently, it's shipped in the &#34;locked&#34; position, which means the posts that punch the holes are engaged, so you can't slip any papers beneath them. I tried sliding the lock, but it didn't do anything. My husband finally figured out that you have to push down on the lever as you slide the lock and that will release the puncher so it works. Not rocket science, but it did take both of us several minutes to solve the problem.Once we got it unlocked, I tested it with six sheets of paper, which it punched through easily. I barely had to exert any pressure on the lever, either. Works like a dream! It catches the confetti in a tray beneath the puncher and it's easy to unsnap the tray to empty it. However, I did notice some fresh oil stains around the holes I'd just punched. My husband said the puncher is probably lubricated to keep it punching smoothly, but I don't believe it should stain the papers it's punching! That's just wrong.I'll deduct a star for the lack of clear instructions and the oil problem. Otherwise, it's a pretty nifty desktop hole puncher.
This is not my first Swingline LightTouch hole punch. I'd purchased one a few years ago and it lasted barely a year before the plastic top half (that surrounds the lever and hole punches) cracked and fell off. It didn't utterly impair it, but it did make using the hole punch rather annoying and cumbersome. That said, there are a few things I like in this model over that one.Pros:* This hole punch feels substantial and sturdy* The punch pins are relatively easy to adjust (just need a penny or other small coin to loosen the bolts underneath)* It slices through paper like a hot knife through syrup (tested fifteen sheets at a time)* Holes are neat and even (no hanging chads so far)* Includes a catch for the chads* Handle folds down and locks to save spaceCons:* Has the same plastic cover and worried this will break over time/with continued use* Emptying the chad catch is tricky and can result in a mess if one isn't careful* Getting the chad catch back onto the hole punch is also a slight pain* Although additional punch pins can be added, locating them has been a challengeOverall I prefer using this overmy other heavy duty punchbecause punching is easier/more comfortable.That said, this punch isn't nearly as heavy-duty nor could it handle as much paper in a single pass as that punch. It comes down to preference: comfort and utility. Sometimes utility wins, but for general day-to-day light punching, this definitely does the trick.I'll update this review if anything changes (for better or worse) and I hope it was helpful to you, however, if I've missed something or you have a question about my experiences with this product, please leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer.
At first try these scissors are great.  They are super sharp and cut through 8 standard sheets of paper with ease.  What I found after using them for a while is that the hand grips are slightly small.  I don't have large hands but my 3 fingers in the one grip are mashed together.  I can't imagine a man trying to use them.  So the blades are sharp, they cut very smoothly, but the grips on the handles need enlarging.  Recommended for very small hands.
These scissors have a lovely positive action and extremely comfortably grips. The edges seem a bit rough and they were not great for collage on paper-Matisse would probably disapprove. A bit of hand-sharpening improved things, but it doesn't seem like you should have to sharpen brand new scissors.
These scissors have a nice sturdy feel to them. They are now a pair of my "good" scissors, the kind I don't let the kids use!Packaging says guaranteed for a lifetime- not sure what the specifics of that are though.My only complaint was that the hand grip seemed a tad small. I could put only three fingers in the larger oval shaped opening on the hand grip. I feel more stable if I can put all fingers through that area.
I used these to print out images onto fabric for some Christmas gifts I'm making.  The product allows you to sew the images on your item, or to iron them on.  I personally used the sew on method, which worked very well and I got nice results.  I haven't used the iron on method, so I can't really say how well that works.  It's fun to be able to print any image you want and to sew onto pillows, bags, shirts, etc.  You can get very creative with this stuff.  I would buy again.
I finally got a chance to try this out today. I transferred a picture of one of my cats to the printable fabric and then ironed it on a shirt. The sheets are easy to use and the picture quality is not too bad considering the medium. The colors were pretty good. I think the quality of your printing is going to depend on the type of printer you have and the quality of the photo you are using. I can see this having some nice crafty uses.
Like other reviewers mentioned, the Avery Printable Fabric would be best for certain applications. I would personally use it for aprons, tote bags, or a fabric wall hanging due to the thickness & firmness of the fabric. I used my Canon MG5220 to print on the fabric, the images came out crisp and clean looking.
I was pleasantly surprised by the vivid printing I get on this Avery fabric.  I've been a user of many different iron-on transfers, so I expected fabric to print somewhat similarly, which is usually less vibrant than on paper.  This fabric holds ink just like paper.  It's very nice.Ironing on is simple, I just press and hold for five seconds.  That's so quick.  I was able to print a bunch of labels on the fabric, cut them out and iron them onto my children's clothing in minutes.  Voila, the clothes are labeled.  Hopefully, it will cut back on lost jackets and sweatshirts.The fabric texture is my only disappointment.  It's rather stiff -- not soft at all.  That would make it a poor choice for something like a baby blanket.
This works best for things like tote bags, which is probably why they show on the front of the package.  The fabric is not something you would want to wear or put on anything that touches your skin or that needs washing. It feels kind of like thick, rough cotton paper. The package says it can be used for things like pillow cases and aprons, but that it needs to be hand washed. Definitely use it for a tote bag instead.It has printed without major problems and looks good.
There was a time when I wanted to do special photo prints on fabric, but couldn't find an easy way to do it. Then Avery came up with these printable fabric that's ready for printing right out of the package. So easy and so cool. Further, the fabric can be used on different porous surfaces and is washable.Thanks Avery, for another cool tool to expand our creativity with.
I need another Serger so I could keep dark color thread on one and light thread on the other.  I have never owned a Brother machine and thought I would give it a try.  Part of it is a little too cheaply done.  The holder that the thread goes through in the back is plastic and looks like it could break fairly easy.Love the free-arm option.Would like to have a larger fabric catcher, and one not so cheap.
I grew up using my grandmother's serger so as soon as I moved out on my own I knew I wanted one as well.  I picked this serger based on the brand's strong reputation and good reviews and am glad I did.  The biggest considerations for me were whether I could use it for a range of applications and whether it would be easy to thread.  It met my expectations in both areas.  The second is especially important to me because I remember that my grandmother's serger was QUITE hard to thread which became a pain if a thread broke.  This serger is very easy and results in me using it more often.The bottom line is this is a great machine and as long as you are a beginner or occasional seamstress you will find it meets your needs.  I also appreciate that it is durable and stores easily in my closet.  I have had it for over a year now and it still works very well.
OVERALL COMMENTS:1. The machine runs smoothly, without too much noise.2. The guts of the machine all appear sturdy/solid;  some of the superficial plastic parts scare me a little because they look like they could break easily.  In particular, the extendable thread guide (thread tree) on top of the machine.3. The machine arrived, ready to use.  This was a nice benefit because it allows you to try it out instantly.  Everything was well packed.4. The fact that it uses regular sewing machine needles and thread is a plus in my mind;  save money in not having to stock up on multiple sets of accessories.  Note, however, that due to the differences between a serger and a regular sewing machine, there will probably be instances where you want to buy different threads for each machines, depending on the specifics of your project.5. The machine comes with a number of nice accessories, manuals, and instructional videos.  I found the manuals and videos are OK, but not great.  More about that below.  NOTE:  The videos DO NOT work on my MacBook Pro, but I was able to view them on someone else's PC.The rest of this review is for those, like me, who have never used a serger before.Like many other reviewers, I've thought about getting one for years, but was intimidated by them (they looked so complicated).  Also, they were quite expensive.  I would classify my sewing skill level as just beyond beginner.  On top of that, I've only recently taken it up again after not doing any sewing in maybe 10 years.  The biggest frustrations I've had with my 10-15 year old Singer clunker are a) finishing hems easily and with a professional look  b)  sewing knits.  So, I decided to check out the serger market, and was surprised to find one in this price point, and with encouraging reviews from other novices.  So I decided to give it a try.  I've had mine for about a month now, and other than experimenting with it, I've completed one garment.  I love the ease of use as well as the results.  This did not happen without some pain, however.  But I believe you learn more from your mistakes than from anything else, so I feel better for having gone through that.The first thing I did when I received the machine was untangle the threads (I left the machine threaded, I just worked the thread from the spool side of things).  I looked through the videos and the manuals I did a couple of practice runs (without changing any of the settings) on a piece of basic cotton fabric;  everything was great!Then I made what might be considered a mistake to some:  I went from there to trying to do a rolled hem on a very thin, gauzy fabric.  I created quite a mess, the threads got tangled, the results weren't right, and of course, the thread kept breaking and I had to rethread many many times.  I got quite frustrated as I kept referring to the manuals and the videos, but just couldn't figure it out.  Then I went to the internet for help.  What a life saver!  In particular, a video on You Tube called"Threading a Brother 1034D Serger" by "ArtistkaeSewing" who made this video specifically because the Brother instructions were so difficult to follow.  This saved my day!  I actually had to re-thread many times until I got all the adjustments right for the rolled hem, so while that was frustrating, I am now a pro at threading the machine from all the experience I gained.  In hindsight, it was probably not a good idea to work with a fine fabric and a special stitch for my very first project.  : )I also recommend a book called "The Complete Serger Handbook" by Chris James.  I find it fills in many many gaps in my knowedge (since I am a beginner to serging) and it does so in a very easy to follow format with lots of great illustrations.Here are a couple of other tips from someone who learned the hard way:1. I didn't pick up on any instructions anywhere on where to line up your fabric while sewing.  It may be there, but I just never noticed.  Unlike my regular sewing machine which has a guide line labeled "5/8" - the serger just has some subtle slightly raised lines in the plastic area in front of the needle ... with one of these lines thicker than the others.  That's what you want to use.2. I didn't realize that my thread tree was not fully extended which I unpacked it.  For sewing on regular fabric, it didn't seem to make a difference.  But when working on the rolled hem on the gauzy material, I believe this was one of the main reasons why my thread kept breaking.Maybe these tips will save someone out there some frustration.Overall, I'm very happy with it.  I know enough to use it for basic functionality;  I will just have to learn the other features as I go.  I'm glad to have one successful project under my belt to boost my confidence.  I am glad I bought it!  I feel I can now bring my sewing skills (and results) to the next level.
Last night at 8pm, right at the start of Glee, I opened the huge square box that my Brother serger machine came in. It was nicely packed and the machine was much bigger than I had imagined. It came prethreaded with corresponding threads to the 4 color coded thread passages. It came with a CD to view on my PC. I paged thru the book for 10 minutes to familiarize myself with things and then popped the CD in my computer. I only watched the first 5 lessons as I didn't want to go into overload trying to process things I didn't need to get started. I will go back to watch those videos when I need those features. I watched the threading lesson 3 times. Then I set the machine up on my kitchen table. It was 9pm. It took me 15 minutes to thread the machine with my own new white large spools. I purchased 4 white and 4 black. Even though it takes regular spools of thread, I figured I would stock up on the 2 colors that I would use the most. And @ $2.99 each, they were a bargain and ensured I would not run out of thread for a while. I used the tie on method that is explained in part on the enclosed video. Finally satisfied and confident that I was ready to start, I gently pushed the accelerator to stitch on some scrap fabric. I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the machine ran and the speed and ease of mobility. The default tensions settings worked for me so I didn't touch them, but I did experiment a bit with the stitch length and width settings. So here's the good news. By 9:25, (one hour and 25 minutes total) I had begun to sew the bodice and belt ties of DGD's christening gown. I really like the machine and encourage those of you who have one, but like me were overwhelmed to get started, to do just that. Open it up and see what it can do. To those who have always thought of buying a serger, I say do it.There are a couple things that I feel need improvement though.1. The video and the manual contradict each other regarding the How To Thread process. This is the most important thing on a serger - getting it threaded correctly - and it's not 100% clear. The manual says to ALWAYS thread the Upper Looper, Lower Looper, Right Needle and Left Needle IN THAT ORDER. In the video, the instructor starts with the left needle. I think it would be helpful to remember the following sequence (using the color code) that occurred to me last night. GBPY - GaBippy! Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow is the threading order.2. The seam allowance guide is not explained anywhere that I could see. Being an experienced sewer, I kinda figured it out, but I could see how it could be a problem for beginners. The raised bolded line to the right of the needle is the standard 5/8" seam allowance. The line to the left is either 3/8" or 1/2" and then the one closest to the needle is either 3/8" or 1/4". I will have to measure the stitching with the knife blade recessed in order to get a more accurate definition of the seam allowance guide.3. The manual says to oil your machine, but then does not include the oil.4. The machine gets filled with lint from the fabric very quickly. I recommend getting a can of compressed air (available @ office supply stores) and give it a good blow out after you're done sewing.
This is my first serger. I've taken classes at the local sewing shop and seen and tried the higher end brands and models. For entry-level, occasionally home serging, this Brother 1034D is perfectly fine. It's loud, but most sergers are. There's no fancy air threading system, but after threading it a couple times, it's easy. With just a few hours practice, I can make a stretch knit dress with serger construction that looks super professional (note: I've been traditional sewing for years, just new to serging).This serger also uses regular needles, though my local shop pushes me to use special serger ones. Not having to use serger needles is a nice feature.The downside to buying this, and probably most, sergers online is that they sit for a very long time. I've had mine for 7 months and it was basically dried up in the areas I can't access to oil myself. This meant I had this loud freaky squeal going on. My machine is currently at the shop getting warranty serviced because of the noise. The shop tech said this is really common for online-purchased machines but the machine itself is not bad.You'll want to have your machine tuned up every 12-18 months and oil what you can access frequently, especially if you serge fleece.I was afraid to serge at first but I'm totally hooked now. I love how strong and professional my seams and edges look and there are cool things you can do with ease like rolled hems and serger crocheting. It's just loads of awesome!
This machine is just the right size for what I was looking for.  It's easy to use, and it's easy to load new cartridges.
I'm a beginner sewer and was told I would need this for all the mistakes I'd make.  Yes, yes indeed, I did.  At first it seemed cumbersome, but once I practiced and got the hang of it I was ripping seams left and right in no time flat.  It doesn't clearly explain this to dummies like me that you use the sharp end to cut individual threads if need be, but you actually put the blunt end on the bottom and the U-shaped part does all the seam cutting.  The sharp end on the bottom will rip your fabric!  The red nubby thing protects the pieces of fabric from tearing.
What's so good about this?  O.k. it works, I don't know how long it is going to cut the thread smoothly, I hope it would last sharp for long time. The little red ball of my ripper seems it is going to fall one of these days it is not well made, the cap does not make click and it is always falling. But in general the ripper feels nice in my hands.
Just the right sizes for my daughter's sewing needs. Easy to store in her small apartment. The cutting and measuring lines are easy to read.
I love this ruler for cutting strips.  I have only used it to cut strips to make nine patches, but I hope one day to use it to cut diamonds.I have made errors by counting wrong (on the half inch increments)---making the strips too narrow.This is an awesome timesaver.
I love the non-slip for cutting my fabrics.  My only complaint with this is the yellow markings, which can sometimes make it difficult to line up the fabric.
These suprised me, they actually work.  The sharpness doesn't last long but these are good in a pinch.  A handy, convenient, cheap gadget to keep in the junk drawer!
Will fit almost any portable sewing machine,  I can store other things inside with the machine I bought, which is nice.
I was looking for a case big enough to fit my Brother PE 500 embroidery machine WITHOUT the embroidery arm attached and this case fit the bill.  The length is the perfect size, it is a little big width wise but it allows me to fit the hoops, chords, and arm inside the case.  If you're looking for a case to take this machine places with you I wouldn't recommend this case bc of how big it is width wise.  I bought a rolling cart with a 50% off coupon at Michael's that works great for this purpose.
This case is tough and yet light weight. I have used it to take my machine and allmy &#34;stuff &#34; to my monthly quilt guild meeting. I've been able to carry the machine, theslide on table, the extra tools I need and still have room for the cord and foot pedal.Fast -forward to taking the machine to be serviced : without the extra stuff in there with the machine,the case was a bit too cavernous. The machine wanted to tip over (and did) inside the case duringtransporting it. Will have to use bath towel to wrap it up in next time it's serviced.
I just started paper piecing and took a class to do so where they required this ruler.  I didn't think it would be helpful but I was wrong!  So handy!  You use it to trim the fabric on the pattern quickly and leaving the proper seam allowance.  My only complaint is that the ruler isn't every wide so you have to be quite alert to make sure you don't put your fingers in the way of your rotary cutter.  I've used it many, many times at home now and I'd highly recommend it!
I love Ranger products. They are the best! Distress ink is so limitless with how you can use it. Vintage photo is a lovely light brown which works beautifully alone or blended with other colors. My only qualm is the price here, you can find for way cheaper on Joann's website and they sporadically have free shipping deals! That's the time to stock up!
These run out kind of quickly but they are easier than regular, loose glitter.  I like the variety of colors.
The colors in this set are gorgeous! The heirloom gold is one of my faves. I primarily use this with stamping but sometimes experiment with other techniques such as adding this to Ranger distress paints/ stains. This comes with Ranger's Perfect Medium, when stamping I find I get better results with versamark. I love that this set comes with two pretty nice brushes, they are necessary when applying pigments. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it is nearly impossible to contain pigments around work surface, they get all over the place! Swifter dusting clothes help minimize the pigment spread. Price wise, Amazon sells this product at a good price compared with most craft stores.
I started using these about 6 weeks ago, and love them for the sheen they give the paper. I've brushed them over the front of a card, spritzed them with water to activate the sticking powder, and then enjoyed the glow they give to the project once they are dry. Haven't yet mastered stamping with the Perfect Medium and then brushing the Pearls over the stamped image--the Pearls always seem to stick not only to the stamped image but also on the paper itself, so the image isn't as crisp and clear as I'd like.
First off, these powders are awesome, however, I do have one problem with them. If you want to use these powders mixed with water in the Ranger Mini Misters, the color saturation is very low and the amount of opalescent shimmer is also very low.  The nozzle on the mini mister doesn't provide as fine a mist as the Glimmer Mist bottles from Tattered Angels so the amount of liquid that sprays out puddles very quickly on your paper.  After experimenting with these, I did have the kind of results I was looking for when for example,I added the "gold" colored perfect pearls with Tattered Angels' glimmer mist, wow - a winning combination; I was able to get the level of color saturation I was looking for with more glimmer than the Tattered Angels glimmer mist provided.  With the perfect pearls, I could never get enough color saturation that I was looking for, no matter how much powder I mixed with water into the mister bottles. I found I had much better results with this product when I mixed it with water and applied the solution to paper with a paint brush, however, you don't get the effect that a fine mist would provide. So, overall, if I had to choose between the Tattered Angel's Glimmer Mist and the Ranger Perfect Pearls, I'd go with the Tattered Angels if I wanted to have a misty effect.  Also, I did get very good results with the method Ranger recommends for using this product with stamps (stamp image on paper with an embossing pad like Versamark or Ranger Perfect Medium), then lightly brush on the perfect pearls over the stamped image, then dust away excess powder.  The two colors in this set that I liked the most were the gold and the hot pink (the hot pink looks like purple in the image here but its actually hot pink).  These two were very opalescent. For anyone who has never tried this product, I highly recommend buying just one color to use as a test, and test on a piece of waste paper first.  Also, you can purchase brushes anywhere separately to save on costs.  The brushes that came in the set are nice though.
The Herma Transfer Glue Dispenser is a good glue that allows repositionable gluing.  I was able to move the glued item around a bit until I was happy with the position.  It isn't permanent, so you can take the glued item up in the future and remove the glue (by carefully rubbing it off.)  It is a pricey glue so unless you are looking specifically for these features, you might want to try something a little less expensive.  Given the price, I would have liked to have seen a refill available for it at a reduced price.
I've used other glue dot dispensers before and most have worked well (except one glue dots one that kept "skipping"-- I couldn't reliably get the dots to stick as I rolled the dispenser). This one rolls easily and works well to glue different kinds of paper, photos, etc. It's ideal for kids' crafts because it's non-permanent and "rubbable." I thought that was some kind of weird translation error for "removable" until I saw what they meant-- if you get any glue outside the intended area, you just rub it off with your finger. It comes off cleanly and easily and doesn't stick to your finger.Because it's non-permanent, you can reposition what you've glued. However, that also means it's not ideal for long-term use-- like Post-It notes that eventually lose their stick.I'm deducting one star for the lack of refills available. It seems wasteful to have to throw away or recycle the dispenser after one use. Other than that, it's a handy product to have around. I really like the tiny dots as opposed to the one-at-a-time dots... you can get edges to stick down better when you can get lots of little glue dots around the border.
I have always wanted to try one of these glue dot dispensers.  Wow.  The dots are very tiny and spaced closely, so it looks more like a strip of glue.  The dispenser reminds me of those correction tapes.  Very easy to control where the glue goes.  It sticks right away, but it's not a strong hold, maybe because it's meant to be temporary.  I glued two sheets together one day and pulled them apart the next.  It rubs off, but leaves a bit of a smudge.  Great product.  Too bad the hold isn't stronger.
I got another glue dispenser tape similar to this, the Scotch Dot Roller.  These are the type of glue that adhere to surface like mini polka dots.  They are great for acrapbooking, kids' school projects and very handy as a double sided tape.  At the same time they are easily removable just buy rubbing the adhesive with your finger.Herman Glue Dispenser is double the size of the Scotch, making the latter more convenient to hold.  In terms of capacity, both are 50 ft in length.When it is time for refill, Herman opens up completely, the lid from the body.  At the time of this review, I cannot find a refill available on Amazon while you can find Scotch refills easily (albeit expensive - around 6$ a pop).  Scotch also is different as the lid stays with the body opening up with a hinge.Both adhesives can easily be removed except Scotch is a bit more sticky.  Scotch is labeled permanent but just rub it with the tip of your finger and it comes off.I prefer the Scotch because it is smaller but still gives you the same 50 ft of glue.  Also the refill availability is a factor.
I like this foot for the fact that I can use it to instruct my children how to sew.  I started using it, and it kinda annoyed me but it made teaching my children a lot easier.
I use this foot most of the time.  It is very easy to read while sewing.  It serves the purpose of most the other feet I have.  Buy it, you'll like it.
This Speedball 4-Inch Pop-In Brayer, Soft Rubber does its job well, and is the perfect size for using with my mixed media paintings. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the smell! I've had it for two days now and ... I don't think I could describe the smell if I tried. Very strange, and yuck! It has lessened a bit, and I expect it to go away eventually. It is a good product outside of the stank. I'll try to remember to update this review in a few weeks or so.
This is a good brayer for the cost.is sturdy and withstands daily abuse.  Good for applying ink to various surfaces
I haven't actually officially used the foot, but I did test it on a strip of fabric and if it works like that one the project...I say I found a winner! No more hand basting to make gathers! No more long stitch.loose tension to make machine gathers! This just does it just right and all with the change of a foot..nothing else.
I've always loved drawing with technical pens, and even have a set of 7 Rapidograph pens by Koh-i-noor.  However, they require regular maintenance to keep them clean and working properly.  Therefore, I've been thoroughly enjoying my new set of Micron pens.  I get the same variation in line thicknesses and the archival quality, without the fussiness of the Rapidograph.  In addition, they are much less expensive and practical for traveling.  Yes, I know I'll have to dispose of them when they dry up, but I've had to do the same with a couple of my Rapidograph pens when I don't get to clean them on time.
love them for art, would have given it a 5 star but 2 of the  pens ran out of ink with their 1st use so I was a bit disappointed in that...other wise they are great for many different surfaces
I tryed this for the first time and It was great. They are wonderful I will use this all the time.
A good supply of quality pins that slide effortlessly into the fabric and pin cushion. I like the different colors.
I like that the glass on these do not melt or get really hot when I'm pressing.  Plastic heads can do that.  The package arrived with only one pin missing its glass head.  Not too sharp, but I'm grateful for that since I clumsily stick myself frequently.
These were a good buy. They are a good size, they're easy to grab and see, and I'm really pleased that you can iron over them without them melting or cracking. They feel good quality too. I was hoping to spend a little less for pins in general, but these actually work much better for me instead of the generic cheap metals ones without the ball on the end.
These things are long and flexible with a flat head on them.  Very useful to hold the lighter materials together and the flat head makes them easy to manipulate.  I have not tried ironing over them or anything.  I took a star off because they are just a smidgen too flexible for heavy handed cottons while draping garments.  A good tool to have in the arsenal at any rate.
This pins are easy to use and easy to see to pull the out as you sew. They do not fit well on the kidney shaped magnetic cushion (you can't get many on it). The pins are great and I highly recommend them.
Really nice pins.  Work well placed horizontally on my serger projects.  Easy to manipulate and pull out. Had a few mutants (twisted plastic heads on 2, and a broken end on 2)...  still overall very good.
For the price this is a great pair of pinking shears.  It has good teethes that really grip into the material, even with silk chameuse. Although with light and slippery materrial it is not easy to navigate the cut and will require some patience!  Otherwise, super happy working with this pair of scissors.  In hind sight I am glad I bought this lighter pair as a heavier pair would really make it hard to use on slippery and light fabrics.
I started sewing in 2005 and was directed to look for Fiskars scissors by the ladies at my local fabric shop. Until recently, I mostly used the 8-inch fabric scissor, plus a smaller scissor for detail work and both have lasted for years with only one sharpening. I have been tired of doing nicer seams for some outfits that won't be worn much (toddler dress clothes, for example) and really wanted pinking shears. Naturally with my past experience with Fiskars being pretty darn good, I chose them again.I hadn't even seen pinking shears in person before, nevermind held them so was surprised at the weight (a bit on the heavy side). They definitely feel durable! They do the job great as well. I've used them with a variety of fabrics of different weights and am not disappointed. They cut well, cleanly and easily, so it was well worth the investment.If a friend were to ask which pinking shears to buy, I'd likely suggest getting these rather than trying another brand. The only reason I didn't give the full five stars is I wish they weren't quite so heavy and bulky.
its what I expected and has help a great deal.  More detail instructions on how to use the product effectively would help.
I don't really know why I got these as I hate dealing with bias which is what you get when cutting on a diagonal which is what you do to get these triangles. But I thought I'd give it a try. They cut fine the markings are good, but when sewing together, the tris didn't match up like I thought they would. Yes, I could have probably worked a little harder and fixed it, but I didn't like it. Nothing wrong with the template tho.  I use many others and swear by them!
While a 3" X 18" ruler is not an earth shaking concept, it is a handy size for sewing or other crafts. This one appears well made and accurate to an eighth of an inch. I've found it is far handier than a tape measure when checking the measurements on a pattern. That is important to me given the alterations I need to make a garment that fits.
I have enjoyed this ruler and I am still learning how to use it properly.  I like that what you are measuring is visible thru the ruler and that when you become familiar with all the markings it is helpful in measuring straight and level.  My only problem is that I seem to have the wrong end on the left hand side everytime if start to use the ruler, but I think it must be me.  I do recommend this ruler and I think the length is nice.  The thickness is just right to keep its flatness.  The width of the ruler comes in handy for quick measuring also.  I am just starting to really know how to use all of its features.
I like this product. It was a good buy too for the price when i got this. I use it all the time for my projects.
One hand operation makes these a handy addition to the scissors in my sewing tool box and will let me cut fabrics which I've been afraid to try before. Stretchy knits can be laid flat and the pattern cut without lifting and possibly distorting them. I anticipate great success even with a stretch satin bought for an evening dress.
I bought a rotary cutter on the advice that it would change my disdain for cutting fabric. That advice was RIGHT. As the old saying goes, &#34;once you go rotary cutter, you'll never go back.&#34;The blade has stayed sharp in my use of it, and so you don't damage it, it retracts quickly and completely with a button on the side. They're way easier to use than scissors. These also have a nicely contoured handle so they feel comfortable and secure while you're cutting.However, since I'm left-handed this button is easy to hit if my finger slips, which means that the blade retracts and discontinues my cut. While this isn't a deal-breaker, it's slightly inconvenient, and that's why they make some things specifically for lefties... because we are slightly inconvenient.
This cutter makes a nice, clean cut, but the mechanism holding the blade on came unscrewed within a week.  I was able to easily screw it back on (like you would when replacing the blade), but I'm at a loss as to why it came loose.  The blade comes slightly oiled, FYI.  Works great on scrapbook paper and ribbon, although it couldn't cut through velvet ribbon.
Since this is my first maybe I don't have much to compare to but uugghhh... sometimes have to go across twice, I already messed up my first cut with this, the blade is sharp but didn't go through the two layers of thick fabric I'm using, maybe it'll work best with one layer.
I find these cutters to be very easy to use, I find them safe to use and an overall good buy.  I used them for the first time to cut out a pattern for a skirt.It glided over the pattern and material so smoothly I was hooked.  No more bending over for what seemed like forever to cut with a pair of dull scissors. I have been using them for a good amount of time and have not had to change the blade yet is is very sharp.
I bought these to replace my old favorite sewing scissors. I had an injury that makes using traditional scissors with the thumb holes painful so these are perfect for what I need. I do not like them as much as my old pair but I have no real complaints. They have about a 3.25" span between the outer edges of the handle when they are open which is a little more than is totally comfortable for me. My old pair was about 3". These are sharp and do cut easily  and fairly accurately through several layers of fabric at once. I've used them already to make several fussy cut quilts and they are still nice and sharp.
The worse case scenario for a crafter is a dull cutting blade when you are knee-deep in a project.  Buying the 5-pack rotary blades was the best thing I did both economically and for sanity as I could continue my project and keep on task.
Does what it supposed to do.  Wish they weren't so expensive.  If you are cutting fleece it doesn't last very long.  Wish there was a way to sharpen them.  Not much to say other than when they are sharp it makes a nice cut.  Buy them when they are on sale!
This triangular shape makes it easy to hold when marking the item being sewn. The chalk washes off nicely.  It is somewhat fragile and can break easily.
I aboslutely love these.  But wish they had more colors.  These are exactly what was described.  I have ordered tbem two times and will order them again.
This is a neat design.  While the body of the punch didn't seem as sturdy as previous border punches I have used, it works!  Not much force is needed to punch out this design.  It cuts crisp and clean.  I used it on stationery and making cards.
This is just right for a singer sewing machine starter kit.  The bobbins that come with the set do not fit a brother sewing machine.
You get quite abit for your money.  They aren't all HIGH quality, but very useful.  It does come with just about everything you need to get started sewing.
I recently got this for the children's class projects, guess I should have waited a while since I paid $58.14 and shortly after it was reduced to $46.68, I guess the plus is this one can laminate (cartridge to be purchased separately), it can also create magnet projects (cartridge to be purchase separately). Nevertheless the children love it and that's purpose fulfilled.
I did buy both this weight template plastic as well a thick plastic.  It is my preference to stick with the heavier plastic as this is not as easy to work with.
Although I purchased this item. I don't think it is necessary.  I do believe the templates with the grids on them are the most helpful
The only problem I have with this little iron is that the power cord will not stay plugged in, other than that I like it.
At first glance this little crafting iron is comical in appearance and seems to be the tool of someone with elfen hands.Mrs. Spudman is a quilter and bought this to press down seams on piecework before assembling her quilts.What's nice is that she is using a device powered with 15 watts and not the 1800 watts of her large iron.So far this miniscule quilting aid is performing as expected and is perfect for the small pieces of fabric used by quilters. The cord sometimes gets in the way, but that's not surprising considering the slightness of the iron itself. For stubborn wrinkles, use a spray bottle to wet the fabric first.Crafters may find this little iron to be just what the doctor ordered. It might even come in handy for small touchups of a collar or cuff.  Before purchasing this MINI iron, be aware of its limitations of size and power.
My daughter loves this as does her children.  They use it for school projects and also for making cards.  The down side is that it is hard to find the paper that goes through the machine.  I did find it on line but we can't find it at our craft stores.
Very small hole. Must be used with wire. I would not suggest stretch nylon because these beads are semi precious from Austria and nylon tends to break easily. These will be an absolute gorgeous piece of jewelry even if you think you have goofed. I would say,  no, you didnt! :)
I bought this machine about 5 years ago when I wanted to learn how to sew and quilt.  As a beginner, the bobbin can be tricky--but be patient!  I haven't had any problems with the machine--keep it oiled and clean (I use an air canister to spray the fuzz that collects).This model has very minimal bells and whistles which is perfect for a beginner.  I plan on upgrading soon, but I will still keep this machine for quilting.
My first scalloped quilt looks nice. Directions were good and easy to follow. Haven'e tried all of the shapes, but I will.
This makes easy work of your scalloped edges. Ha a guide to help you with the placement depending on how long the edge is to be scalloped.
I bought this machine for a niece and had to borrow it recently to finish a small quilt while my machine was being repaired. This is a great machine for a beginner. It has plenty of stitches to play around with, and is pretty easy to change the settings. I was able to use my Brother walking foot on it just fine, although it is a basic machine and has limited throat space. The bobbin winder works well and is fast. The top loading bobbin is super easy to load and I love that it is easily visible so you don't run out of bobbin thread.I gave this 4 stars because if you do not hold the top thread when beginning to so, it will unthread the needle. Pulling the top thread a little long seems to help as well. I am not sure how the needle up verses down works, but it seems to be random.  The very easy needle threader makes all of that tolerable because it works well and saves time.
I LOVE the designs on this corner puncher. They're very cute and make my cards look extra special. The punches are relatively small (about half an inch on each side from the corner), so they're more for personal cards and notes. The biggest issue is getting the corners aligned. As someone else suggested, practice with excess pieces of paper and wiggle the corner into the slot to get accustomed to it. Sometimes, the corners do not properly align and it's difficult to tell from the outside. Otherwise, great product.
I did not buy this item from this seller. I have to press down really hard on cardstock. When it works, it works great. It does take a few used to get the hang of it, so I recommend scrap paper until you're confident with it. It's disheartening to get 3 corners perfect and mess up the 4th corner. I really love the designs though! Fiskars makes really good products.
this punch makes a beautiful border for card or scrapbook embellishment.  It is easy to use and line up on the page.
I used this tool with the Fiskars texture templates to give my cards that something extra they needed. This makes it simple to texture a larger area perfect for making a background for my birthday cards. I did notice it is easiest if you rub the texture plate diagonally versus straight up and down.
This isn't the easiest tool in the world to use, but once you get the hang of it, it does make using the texture plates a little easier.
This is a great tool that helps get the embossing done in a quick manner.  It works great with the textured plates from Fiskars.  Together they make a good set to have to get the job done for the embossing projects.
It's okay for a starter kit.  I it has just enough stuff to start with.  We need just a little more thread.
Got in in time. Already transferred something to it and transferred it to my Brother machine but I have NOT actually used it yet.If it doesn't work good I will update this post. Otherwise, you have to buy this on line because local sewing shops will not carry it, not worth the space in their store.You can also get lots of FREE embroidery templates on line....I LOVE FREE.
This is not the end all to getting embroidery designs to your machine, but it really helps.  My 5x7 unit uses a card, or you have to plug in your laptop and pull them from there.  I can't deal with having a laptop sitting in my computer room connected to it so I can get a design.  I don't have that kind of counter space.Although the card is the larger 4 GB, it  actually doesn't hold a a huge amount of designs.  My first complaint is additional cards are very expensive. Second,  I find it irritating that the program wipes off everything you have loaded on the card in order to add something else.  If there's memory left on the card, I'd like to just be able to throw on another design and go from there.  How about a -- do you want to keep these designs on the card feature?I can't knock what it does, because it works.  Just wish Brother would change their program a bit and bring down the cost of additional cards.  It could be easier, but you are stuck by what is out there.  For what it does, I need it.  Eventually, I'll change over to a new machine that has a usb (flash drive) plug and the problem should be solved.  Right now my budget can't afford it.
It does what it's supposed to do quite well, That makes it a quite good value for the money, I rated as a like rather than a love because I haven't used it that much. I'm sure I like it, not sure whether I love it.
I am just starting out with sewing clothes, have already made shirts and dresses using this, I wish the base was a little stronger or metal, but for the price you cannot beat it! I have priced these very same ones outside of Amazon, and well, you can buy 2-3 of these! So far no issues with mine.
I bought this dress form to replace one I had purchased many years ago.  As with most products, they have improved them greatly.  The numerous larger dials was the selling point for me.  My former dress form had adjustment wheels that were difficult and awkward to use.  This dress form is extremely easy to assemble and use.  The ONLY negative I have found thus far is that the body of the form does wobble on the stand.  It does not seem to have a feature allowing the body of the form to solidly sit on the stand.  It must be picked up by the stand when moving it around.  The base/feet are excellent and secure, but the wobble factor is a concern which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  However, it is still far superior to other types of dress forms available in the same price bracket.  It also has a much better and more defined bust AND the body allows for adjusting for longer torso people.  I highly recommend this affordable dress form for those interested in a basic, adjustable dress form.
As a hole puncher, this is a stable hole punch. It is weighty and has some heft to it. It has a measure that can be inserted for measurement as well as perfect alignment and will punch perfect holes through 20-25  pieces of scrapbook paper. It was easy to use.
Swingline's 2-Hole Punch is ergonomically designed to require less effort to punch holes. The handle is padded for extra comfort. This punch will punch 1/4 inch holes through up to 28 pages. An adjustable paper guide comes with the punch. A rubberized non-slip chip tray holds the punch in place while also collecting the chips. The handle locks down for storage. It's well built and sturdy and comes with a lifetime guarantee. The all metal construction is hard to beat.
I've only had the opportunity to use it a couple of times so far.  It works fine for its purpose.  I will buy it again if I need to.
At a loss as to how to mark my quilts, I finally bought a blue chalk pounce pad for my lighter colored quilt sections. I hate using markers, even the water soluble ones, because I usually make t-shirt quilts. The plastic designs on some of them don't like to release even the water soluble pen marks, leaving me with few options but chalk. I had purchased the Ultimate Pounce Pad with white chalk previously and wasn't thrilled. It was supposed to come off with ironing, but usually brushed away before I could finish the quilting. This one seems to do the trick, though. You do need to get a fairly good chalk build up on the pad itself to get a good mark on the fabric, but it always brushes away. I've recently switched to using Chaco pens, but in a pinch the pounces are good marking tools to have.
Brother has captured the sewing market with a huge fleet of machines from low end to high end. The reputation is fairly good for these machines IF you understand their limits and your own needs. So let's explore if the CS6000i is right for you?1. This is a great beginner machine for fun sewing. You get 60 utility and decorative stitches and 7 automatic buttonholes. Right from the start, this does the same job as my "do-all" machine (a Janome DC2160) that cost three times as much. It is NOT as rugged as the Janome, which has a deserved reputation for building sturdy, longer-lasting machines. But it does all the same things.If you are a hobby sewist and you don't intend to run this 24/7 on projects day and night, in other words, you are going to sew occasionally or find out if you enjoy sewing as a hobby, this is fantastic. You'll enjoy the choice of stitches, which really bring creativity to any project. You'll be able to take it to a class (it doesn't weigh a ton) and you won't break the bank.2. It comes with a quilting table. This is a flat surface that fits around the free arm and makes sewing on larger pieces of fabric a lot easier. I had to pay extra (fifty more) to get mine for my Janome and it's really essential for quilting or decorative sewing on larger items. Thumbs up for that.3. The LED and controls are easy to use; the stitch selection is right on the front of the machine.4. This package includes a walking foot, a quilting free-motion foot and a hard cover. Big value. That's over a hundred right there.5. Decorative stitches can be used on infant and children's clothing (ready made or home sewn) to customize. You can make pillows, quilts, fabric items and the decorative stitching can be combined with ribbon or trim (sequin strands, beads) to do costumes and more.Downsides:1. It's not really as smooth a sewer compared to my higher end machines. It also has a flimsier needle threader. I broke a similar one on another Brother machine (the SE-400) so it's definitely not rugged. These machines have a "gritty" feel when sewing. Hard to describe, but not as smooth or quiet.2. The bobbin tends to tangle for me more often than on my better machine.3. The throat or "harp" space (under the top) is not large enough for quilts of any size past a baby crib quilt. If you get serious about quilting, you'll want a better machine with more space but there are plenty in that category. If you are on a budget, you can find the older, discontinued models at less than half of retail and there are too many to name. You'll have to do research. Or you can buy a straight stitching machine (Brother makes one) with huge space that does quilting only (no decor or zigzag.) It's up to you. But...if you discover you love quilting, you can start to shop for what makes sense for you, and this machine will hardly go to waste.4. These don't last forever. There is a 25 year sort of warranty (but it's on defects of manufacture) and you may have to send in your machine at your own cost. A limited warranty runs down over time so really, view this machine as a consumable, like many other electronics. WARNING: NEVER LEAVE ANY COMPUTERIZED SEWING MACHINE plugged in during a thunderstorm. In fact, unplug when not in use. One surge of power and the computer boards or LED screen fry. FIZZZT! You're toast. Really.5. There are no fonts of alphabet monogram letters. This is a feature that is a lot of fun for quilting and other uses (children's clothing.) If you spend a bit more, you can get a machines with letters. If you spend a hundred or so more theBrother HC1850 Computerized Sewing and Quilting Machine with 130 Built-in Stitches, 9 Presser Feet, Sewing Font, Wide Table, and Instructional DVDis a great choice and still a budget machine.Bottom line: for the money, this is exceptional value, but it's not going to be a durable or perfect machine. It's a great machine to get started and it's particularly good for the occasional sewist who wants lots of capability with little initial investment. If you don't abuse the machine and push it when it's struggling (say, you have a thread nest under the bobbin or you are trying to sew on too many layers) you will find this is excellent for what you paid. If you are on a budget and not looking for rugged, this is a fun little machine.
I bought this machine as a starter.  I had never sewn before and needed a machine that was easy to use, durable and not too complex.  This machine is just that.  I read the book and learned how to use the stitches.  I have made my first quilt using this machine. If you are a serious seamstress you may want something with more depth and capability.  If you are like me this is a great machine for the price and will serve me well as I learn.  My mother, who is an accomplished seamstress replaced her old Singer with this Brother because it is so easy to use.
Nice and quiet sewing.  I wanted this machine because Brother included a lot of presser feet I want to use, especially the free hand motion presser foot and the blind stitch presser foot (I just found out there is no straight stitch presser foot (SA167)!  WTH Brother?).  I also wanted the one step button hole, automatic needle threader, and top bobbin case.  I love the fact that I don't have to turn knobs to get to stitches, but the LCD needs a light of its own (first reason for 4 stars) (in the description it states there is a back-lit LCD screen?  Mine don't work then).Although I am happy there is a needle threader, I have to practice with it more because it's like hit and miss right now.I also wish I could use the button on the machine to sew while the foot pedal was plugged in (second reason for 4 stars).One other thing: This machine comes with a hard cover case, but there is no bottom to the case (third reason for 4 stars).  It is more like a hard plastic dust cover.  I truly was thinking it was a real case I could carry my machine in.I appreciate the extended table.Like that the machine tells you which feet to use for which stitches.  That will come in handy for sure.The book is great, but a DVD would have been awesome.  There are Youtube videos, but I want to see really useful videos for this machine.  Brother does not have a really good video for this machine.I will update my review once I start to sew on this machine.
This is an easily portable sewing machine in that it is light in weight. The biggest drawback is thatin order to use the hard case cover when traveling you need to remove the thread. The casewill not fit over the thread on the top.  Other than that it is a wonderful little machine.  Easy dropin bobbin.  The feet do not snap on but with a little practice are easy to change.
Wow, these new machines are super light and that was one great thing I noticed about this sewing machine.  My old one was so heavy that it doubled up as a weight machine!What I love about this machine:1) fantastic price for all the functionalities and great tools that came with it.2) the tools include 3 bobbins, various foot peddles, tools to clean the sewing area, thread shredder, and many many more!  Believe me, I was shocked how many extra tools that came with the machine.3) a hard cover is included and an extended arm table for many projects that uses a lot of material.4) three speed control .. Great if you are a beginner and especially for when you need to go slow5) a clear panel where you can see your bobbin, believe me, it is an enormous help to see when the bobbin needs refilling!6) Great light to work with.There is a little to fault this machine right now,it is very easy to use,  great instructions.  My only slight concern is the lightness of the whole machine, which could mean the components may not last as long...and I hate to create another land fill item too soon.
Somehow when asked to leave a review, Amazon considers this a "toy" - NO, it's a great TOOL!  I love it for attaching my photos to mat frames - keeps them there for good and non-slip.  Makes it easy to get the matted picture framed up fast.Put it down, leaves the sticky dot, place the photo, presto, done!  Easy to use, fits my hand pretty comfortably, and convenient to just leave it in my desk for those spur-of-the-moment projects.
This dispenser works well for light paper projects such as homework projects that need picture taped to paper and things like that. It's a very handy gadget which uses small squares of adhesive that come on where ever you need them and guide them with the dispenser.For large craft projects with heavy cardstock and embellishments you'll need to look further for a stronger adhesive product. I have a framer's tape gun that I use for projects that really need some staying power. This works more like a scotch tape so if the paper is heavy, it may not stay put. This would also work good for wrapping presents and things like that.This Herma Vario Tab Disenser is very easy to use and has no mess! It's much more for kid's homework or art projects than things like card making or projects that really need a sticky adhesive.
I had to drop the star level down, not for semantics sake (we have all figured out this is NOT a toy, but rather that it is for use in crafts, such as scrapbooking). Ultimately I gave it four stars because the crafter in our house, my husband, who REALLY liked it, dropped it immediately.It fell apart and was quite difficult to reassemble. And my husband is very intelligent.So I would have to say that with a bit of assistance from my husband (via his surprise hands-on demo), this Herma Vario Tab Dspenser got a 3 star rating for durable.I would assume that once one uses up all one thousand glue spots, the complications of reloading the dispenser would be quite like what happened when we dropped it.This could lead a person who is not patient simply to buy a new one.Maybe that is why they are made a bit cheaply. Maybe the company expects that.This item certainly does not resemble the 70 lb. scotch tape dispenser which my father had in his office back in the old days. You could do some bench pressing with that thing while waiting for Dad to get off the phone. Those were the days. Things were made to last, not to break!And that is my my point, here.YES! This does do the job it claims it will do. Namely, it will stick paper to paper.And nope! It will not stick a lightweight rubber bee on a poster. We know because we tried as an experiment. So don't hope, if you have a rubber bee you want glued on something.If I were a scrapper and were holding a class on scrapping and providing all the materials for my students, I might consider using a bunch of these for my Students, while teaching a lesson.However, I don't think this item is worth the money when there are SO many great glueing products out there. Products which you can use in a multitude of ways. Not just one way!The Herma Vario Tab Dispenser is neat and meticulous.Sure there is an element of fun, as I said.However, in the long run, it is so very, very limited in concept.I am almost nonplussed as I write this review for this ... TOY! That category name renders me inarticulate.Thank you,  Jean
The Herma Vario Tab dispenser is a great crafting glue tab dispenser for arts and crafting. The dispenser is slightly larger than I expected, but fits into your hand. Simply roll the dispenser across your craft or art project and it deposits a double-sided tab of permanent glue. The product works especially great for card-making, scrap-booking, or photos. The glue is acid- and solvent-free, so it's safe for photo use. Each dispenser comes with 1,000 glue spots. It works best with paper, cardboard, or other flat surfaces.This is a much cleaner way to glue than Elmer's or rubber cement, and much safer than a hot glue gun.
I use these for embossing images and they work well.  I also like origami but have used it mostly for my paper crafts
This is an older cartridge and so therefore it in some ways is a lot more basic. But don't let this stop you from buying it. There are lots of flowers and little critters. It is a nice cart to go back to again and again. The cuts don't have many layers and cut well. It is a great first cartridge to start with as you get used to using the machine.
This has been a cartridge that I have wanted for a long time and I am not disappointed with it.  Spring is coming and I will use it a lot..  Some of my favorite shapes are on this cartridge.
I imagined that these would have been somewhat larger even though they were borders. They do produce a great quality finished product but not as large as I expected.
i love a product that can be refilled so that i am not always buying something that is a throw away after use. i know, the refill gets disposed of after it is all used up but ..........
Put in my Dremel Kit as a accessory.
I feel the Pro-Quality 20-Piece Diamond-Point Bit Set may not meet a jewelers highest demand for Pro quality, but it will suffice for the price to allow you to have a diamond point to use when you need it at the workbench.  Good enough for the price paid.
this is a Must have tool when you are working with thin papers or papers that have lots of cuts on them. I have never had a paper rip when using this tool, if I'm careful while using it. It does pick up some of the sticky off of the mat and that is not a great thing. I don't always use this tool if I'm cutting thicker papers so that cuts down on this tool mucking up my mat. I think the real thing it does is make you more aware of what you are doing, it makes you slow down and think about how you are taking the paper off of the mat. I think it's a must have but I rated this four stars because it may not be what you want/need and because it does sometimes pick up the stickyness off of the mat.Enjoy.
Serves it's purpose and happy to have found it so cheap on Amazon. Not my favorite brand by any means for scrapbook/craft supplies but this works.
A nice punch. Easy on the hands. Sharp and fast cutter. EK Success  sells really good products. I have never been disappointed with a purchase. This punch did exactly what I needed it to do.
You need to practice a little to see what suits your style best.  I like it because my stamping turns out clear not with extra ink where I do not want it.  Note:  To make sure I do not smear the ink I take a baby wipe and after loading ink to the stamp I wipe around the edges of the stamp and clean up any spots of ink I inadvertently got on the stamp press.  I ruined some partially finished cards and was frustrated until I started cleaning before stamping.
Just one more punch in my craft bag.  I have a bunch and wanted a circle.  From a circle you can make other lay over punches such as mini holes, etc.  It is great.
This circle punch punches really well. It's also very easy to punch circles using this puncher. Mine didn't come in white, it came in navy blue. It works so well that I'm going to purchase a larger one soon.
Great size. 1&#34; square.For some reason the description only gave the dimensions of the size of the device not the measurement of the shape that was punched out.....completely un-helpful. No matter how many times the question was asked no one that had purchased the punch before answered so I bought one and answered it.Easy to use. Some people had posted that it didn't feel durable in their hands but I didnt experience that at all. I recently used my punch to cut &#34;v&#34; shaped notches in the end of 1&#34; strips of cardstock. 100 times. Not a single mis-fire or slip. It worked perfectly. Punch is still going strong.
This punch is good quality and a nice size (about 2 inches horizontal).  It cuts sharply and with a gentle squeeze! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the shape of the punch takes up a lot of room when you go to put it away.
Good quality product. Works well for jewelry making.  Would order this product again. Good product for the price. Item as described and delivered on time.
I just received the lobster clasps findings after waiting over a month for them to be mailed to me. They are the right size and the silver plate is not too shiny. I really need them for an upcoming jewelry show. I am glad them finally arrived and I can get to work on my jewelry.
I love these claps.  Not too big or small.  I plan on using them on my bracelets that I make.
nice clasps  I have used several of the silver plated lobster clasps and they are working just fine and I am very pleased with my order.  Thanks
Some pieces stick a little bit in the hinge of the clasp, but a little test before hand may help to work it out of some and give knowledge to inability of use ahead of time.
Fits great very strong,like the price,the amount in one order,it very easy to open for all ages ,I highly recommend this to others
Well made product, very sturdy and secure, won't have to worry about your piece coming a loose while wearing it.
I liked them alot and and now have several projscts to use them iwth then time 2 ready GREAT JOB
These are just as expected. The clasps appear to all be in working order and are consistent in size and shape.
This item is good. I did find 2 out of the 100 so far, that were not completely plated.  Still good buy for the price.
These scissors are sharp and sturdy enough for standard cutting of paper and fabric. I cut through thick plastic and cardboard quite easily with no problems so far.However, what is bothersome is the handles. I have fairly small hands but these handles seem extremely small, almost for kids instead of adults. The rubberized grips are nice, but the size should be a bit larger as my hand feels rather cramped inside.For the price (under 10 bucks at the time of this writing), you get two pairs and that's a pretty good deal when compared to other manufacturers for only one pair.
The price for these scissors is the same as what it costs for 1 pair of my favorite scissorsWestcott Titanium Bonded Non Stick Scissors, 8" Straight.  I've had the others for about a year and I panic when I think my children have absconded with them.  They have been awesome.  Because I have liked them so well, I was very curious about how these would handle.  These scissors are great for paper, but they don't do as well on cardboard as my other pair.  The handle feels slightly cheaper (I like the ridges on the other pair).  I can cut thin fabric with them and tape as well.  These scissors just feel differently than the other pair.  They're lighter duty scissors, clearly.  For that purpose, they're great.  They do cut evenly, easily, and are comfortable to hold.  For the price, they're a good value, I think.  If you need heavier duty scissors, I'd recommend looking at one pair of the others.I'm thankful to have two more pairs to spread out around our house.  Hopefully now my really good pair won't go missing!
Whether sewing pillowcases or making aprons, it is easy to cut my material on this mat.  I have used Fiskars products for years and thought it was time to try this size for my smaller crafts.  I don't have to worry about cutting any surface since this mat is durable and protects my new kitchen counter!  The size is right for the smaller area I have to work on.  I am very pleased!
Just the right size cutting board for my daughter's small kitchen table where she sews. Easy to store in her small apartment.
This stuff is really fun--it just gives a hard, clear coat to whatever it's applied to. You can also use it as an adhesive, but I don't if I can help it because I have cheaper liquid adhesives. However, it is helpful as an adhesive if what you're gluing together isn't cooperating, such as when making rosettes. It takes a little while to dry when you use a lot to make accents, which isn't a big deal unless you forget where you applied it and run your hand through it... It takes a lot less time to dry when you spread it thin to use as an adhesive. 4 stars instead of 5 because the tip isn't very precise (especially for something called a &#34;precision tip&#34;), and it doesn't apply very evenly.
This is good to add a little dimension to your projects. I use it mostly for my stamping projects but it can be used for many other areas
My only wish is that this stayed where you put it.  It is a great size and quality but will move around on you while you are working.
Everything I've spilled on it wipes off easily, including glue and gesso. Even if I let them dry, it cleans off fairly easily. Which is awesome for 10 bucks! I just wish it were more durable and heavier weight. The sheet is light weight and if it's getting a lot of use it'll need to be replaced maybe every 4-6 months. Even less if you're super rough on it. 4/5 stars, works wonderfully but could be more durable.
I use this constantly.  It is sooo easy to wipe clean of anything sticky or any kind of ink or paint.  It protects my cutting board surface when I get messy--which is often.  It even takes the heat of my embossing tool.  Very useful tool in my scrapbooking and card making.
I purchased this item for a heat resistant surface to use with heat embossing. This craft sheet is very light weight, easy to clean and can be used to make gelato art designs, cards with glitter and other types of paper crafting. I would recommend this item to other paper crafters and individuals who work with mixed media.
I know, I know it gave the dimensions, but I wanted this to fill a bigger surface (I'm a messy girl) but the quality is very high and I recommend purchasing this, but realize better than I did what the size is.
to save some money, like two halves. You really can splat anything onto these and it's easy to get it off without using chemicals. I would not place any hot objects or heat sources on it (heat tool) because I don't know how it would affect it. I do just as well spraying paint with a box as a catch all, and mixing paints and color sticks on glass stamping blocks instead of this product, but hey, I wanted to try it. You could definitely save your money by using scrap paper or towel as a background and a glass block to mix your paints.
I received my order of the  surgical steel ball and coil earring hooks today and they look pretty good.  Thanks a lot.
These completely suit my purposes.  I first ordered 22K Gold Plated Surgical Steel Hypo-Allergenic Earring Hooks (100) and I was happy with those, so I decided to get the (silver) surgical steel ones as well.  These are not perfect, but at the price, and given some of the other reviews, I wasn't expecting perfection.  Where do they fall short?  Well, they aren't all exactly the same; some are shorter than others, a few ball & coils are missing, the way the hooks are bent varies somewhat from one to the next.  The coils on a portion of my hooks aren't tight, but I am able to mash them together with pliers without much trouble.  These are small criticisms.  There is no question in my mind that the hooks are in fact surgical steel as I've purchased other surgical steel hooks and the distinction (from say, silver-plated brass hooks) is in how hard they are, which is a quality I like.  Bend this into the shape you prefer (I habitually bend the ear wire closer in to lessen the likelihood that it'll fall out when in someone's ear) and it'll stay that way.  The order took awhile to come but I knew that going in.  And not only did I get the 100 I ordered, but found a bit more than that in the tiny ziplocked bag.  (Oh yeah, I count 'em!) Quite satisfied.
This offering of 4mm 21 Gauge Open Jump Rings 22K Gold Plated (100) by UnCommon Artistry are nicely formed with tightly sealed splits in the ring.  The color is pure gold and looks good.
my mistake in ordering these rings.  I was making up a quick order and didn't notice the size.  They are hard for me to work with due to having arthritic fingers.  I usually buy 8 mm rings.
I have to admit....it is very nice having pre-made jump rings!  The ones you make at home never seem to harden up enough.  This is SO convenient!  The silver plating keeps the price down (instead of sterling silver), but the color is beautiful and they look expensive.  I open and close these jump rings very gently and have never had a problem with them.  I recommend these!
I guess , since this was my first time buying beads over the net like this, I took the pictures at face value. I was expecting several ropes of beads. If I thought about it at all, I just thought we were talking about several strands, not 1 15 inch strand. The price was still good, and the beads were beautiful, but a single strand doesn't give me a lot to be able to do with them. I am going to have to find a new way to buy many more strands before I can begin using them.
Love their look.
It really is not for the  type of work I do so gave it to a beader and she loves them.
I think they make beading a lot easier, but the only think I didn't pay attention to is the size of the eye of the needle. It is so small that I have to use a magnifier to when getting ready to use the needle for beading..
A beginner set, obviously. But everything works. Was perfect for me to start working with beads and soft wires. The cutters were a little big considering how small the pliers were. I would basically make small chains and then have to cut them with the bulky cutters.It might be just me being a newbie, but it didn't feel right.
This set of Mini-Tool Pliers Kit is a good starter set for jewelry makers since it is fairly inclusive and is reasonably priced. We are just getting into jewelry making so wanted a set of smaller tools and these work very well for our immediate needs. Here are my observations:What's included: 4 pairs of pliers, 2 pairs of tweezers, and a carrying casePros -+ Good Quality; these are well made and should last a very long time+ Specialized; "the right tool for the job" can be found for many jewelry making tasks+ Nice Case; convenient to protect and hold all of the tools securely with elastic strapsCons -- Grips are just a little too small for comfortable use with my large hands, but are perfect for my wifeThis set has made a positive improvement in our jewelry making and I find the "Nylon Jaw Pliers" to be particularly useful.Recommended!CFH
I have small hands so I don't usually have a problem using these tools for the reason I bought them.  I can imagine they would be difficult to use for a man with &#34;man hands&#34; (or even women with &#34;man hands&#34; lol).  Let me say they're worth the price.  If I was willing to pay triple or more than I would have bought standard size but I just couldn't pass up the price on these.  I figured I'd try them and if I didn't like them then no big deal... I didn't pay much.  But, I've been using them for quite a while now and haven't seen the need to purchase more in a larger size so take it for what it's worth.  If I had to do it over, I'd purchase them again instead of paying a lot more money.  Sometimes I think I'd even prefer the smaller size.  If I bought standard size pliers, I still use these too.
This is a great set of jewelry pliers. However, it's small. Very small. When I first opened the box and pulled out the zipper case, I wondered how on earth they could fit so many pliers in it. I opened it up and wow! These pliers are micro-sized. I measured the wire-cutters at just under 2.75&#34; long, which is just barely big enough to hold.- PROS -* Includes five different pliers, plus two kinds of tweezers, so you have everything you need for jewelry-making.* Perfect mini-size for creating jewelry.* Includes zippered case to keep everything secure. Pliers are held in place with elastic straps.* Compact case, great for traveling, or going to classes or shows.* Rubber-coated handles, so you get a good grip on the pliers. Plus, they're purple and lavender!- CONS -* The pliers don't come with a guide, so it's hard to tell which ones are which, unless you're already familiar with jewelry tools.* If you have large hands, they will be extremely awkward and hard to use.* Because they're so small, the wire-cutters will only cut the finest wire. When I tried them on 0.012&#34; beading wire, I had to squeeze very hard and it took several attempts to cut through it. And that's one of the thinnest beading wires you can buy.The cons are relatively minor. Overall, I'm pleased with these jewelry pliers. I just can't get over how small they are! But I'm already using them to work on a set of beaded bracelets, and so far, so good. I'll give them four stars and recommend them to anyone who creates jewelery.
Not quite the quality that I thought that they would be but I think that they will be fine for the jewelry show that I am getting ready to have.
for what they are worth, there's nothing special to say and nothing negative either. neutral rating for this as well.
This wire is silver for ever, easy to work with and bends very nicely.  I recommend it highly for anyone who makes wire wrapped stones.
New to the jewelry making craft.  This wire is perfect for child jewelry.  I also ordered 20 and 18 gauge more for adult jewelry.  I would recommend it and this company.
This a very strong wire and this works very well in my jewelry.  Thanks a lot for a good product.
These are very nice gold plated lever backs.  It is SO handy to have pre-made ear wires.  The gold plating keeps the problem of ear irritation or allergic reactions at bay.  However, these are very small (13mm).  I like them because they keep my earrings looking delicate.  I recommend them.
Nothing wrong with these.  I use then all of the time.  They are really pretty.  I don't work with gold much but when I do, I use these.
Great item A+
I really like this style of ear rings, this gives me a nice different way of doing my ear rings.  Thanks!
This is a really good bargain!  These are not high-quality sterling silver leverbacks, but that is why they are a great price.  They are wonderful when you are under a time crunch and can't make your own ear wires.  You do have to use needle-nose pliers to open the little hole to connect the earring, but as long as you are slow and gentle there is no problem.
This is a good product for the money invested. Not all the earrings were completely whole. some had no ball and others had no coil . I had some with rough areas that I could not use.
They are being used on my repairable earrings and they are being used to start some new earrings that I am making.
Product was worth the price.  Haven't used the product because it is for a project that will take place in a couple of months.
There are 50 pairs of silver plated hypo-allergenic ear wires in this package at a really good price.  It is wonderful to have a handful of ready-made ear wires around when I have a lot of earrings to do without having to stop and make my own.  These have the pretty, rich, deep silver color because of the silver plating which makes my jewelry look expensive!  Love it!  I always open and close the loop slowly and gently and rarely get breakage.
These are very nice.
These are correctly priced for the quality and functionality.  They are not the most quality that can be had for a higher price, but they get the job done and it you ever wear these pliers out with use, you have probably acquired the skills and talents to go ahead and buy a pair of the very expensive kind. Good for the price, though!
These pliers are great for tight places as well as for bending in those little ends of wire after wire wrapping so they don't leave a sharp edge. My only  caveat is that they twist away when using heavy gauge wire ( 18-16 gauge).
I've really grown to prefer beading with fireline. My only issue is that it's a tad expensive and not as 'clear' as I had somehow imagined.
There are lots of odds and ends in this bunch. Some cheap plastic, others actual stone. It's a gamble with what you get but I think that is half the fun.
These are classic fabric scissors.  They are sharp, cut accurately, and do well on most light and medium weight fabrics.  My grandmother got me a pair since these have been her preferred brand for years and they perform as expected.  My only slight nit is I do think they could be more ergonomically designed so as to improve comfort.  I find them comfortable enough for light projects but if I am doing a significant amount of cutting over a concentrated period of time I find that my hand starts to feel sore.  Other than that, these are great and a pair I would definitely recommend to someone who is learning to sew.
I do a lot of dressmaking and crafts and this pair of scissors does the trick every time, It is a solid pair of weighted scissors.I am amazed how sharp they are and how well they hold that edge.
My family and I just recently completed putting together about 20 photo albums (200 pages each) containing years of family photos.  We went through about a dozen refills of these dispensers.  The dispenser is ergonomically designed and is so easy to use.  The adhesive is a good firm permanent stick.One refill was defective with only half of it with adhesive on the applicator strip, the rest of the strip was blank.  Good idea to teach a young child only a little is needed, otherwise they could roll out too much of it.  I will rebuy.  A great product that makes projects go smoothly and fast.
This can be tricky to work with, and you do need to use beads with bigger holes with this because it works best with big eye needles or twisted wire needles.That said, I usually run it twice through any projects that I'm doing and it has held up well for me. Stretch bracelets are prone to breakage with any stretch type cording. This seems a lot less strong and solid that other products but it does work better than a lot of them because of the amount of stretch it has. As long as you use smooth/not sharp beads, it's hard to just snap this cord by stretching it too far. It has great memory, so a bracelet you've stretched over your hand often will still snap back to it's original size around your wrist.Using a surgeon's knot, I haven't had to seal my knots to keep it knotted.
