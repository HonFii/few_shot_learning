The vivid blue color of the image got my attention and what I received is exactly like the image. I am excited to make the jewelry pieces I designed. Thanks.
I have bought many of these in different colors. They add a lot to the jewelry I make and the price is great.
Great quality and color!!  I would reorder them again.  I used them to make magnetic bracelets and rings.  Great price for the product that is received.
I've been making a lot of red and black jewelry for football season and these look great!  It really makes my jewelry pieces look very high class.  Best price I've found for them!
These crystals are a solid black, yet bright with a nice amount of sparkle!  The 8mm size works with a variety of pearl sizes. Shipment arrived as scheduled. Thanks!
These beads are top quality. If you use them in making jewelry or ANY project, they just gleem. I cannot find but clear crystals in a supermarket which has crafts, at all. These black beads are crystals. They are not colored medal, as I thought they might be when I ordered them. I know I use them on not just jewelry. If I need more, (if?) I know, now where to purchase them.
the bling of these rondelle spacers are excellent for the projects I complete.
I think I just miscalculate how small they were going to be, next time I'll order a 8mm size. Great quality.
I FIND THIS CRYSTAL RONDELLE BEAUTY AND I AM VERY PLEASE.  FILL ALL MY EXPECTATIONS AND I SHARE IT WITH OTHER
These spacer beads elevate my hand-made jewelry to a whole new level.  They provide sparkle, shine, and brilliance to my creations.  I need more!
very nice spacers for 4-6 mm Swarovski crystal beads! I wish these came in multiple colours, because the crystal is just stunning, and I'd love to have more of them!
These were even more pretty than in the picture online. Just pefect for making earrings!! The price was beautiful too! LOL
I bought these Swarovski Crystal Rondelle Spacer Beads Silver Plated 8mm Crystal White - 100 pieces to combine with Gemstone Beads of like sizes in jewelery designs.  These are really nice and worthe the price.  Bright and shiney and a nice combination of quality build and design to go with many bracellettes and Necklaces.  Nice!
Brighten up my polymer clay creations beautifully.  Love the shine and ease of use.  Good deal and bright and fairly cleat.
I love them. they are really pretty and they will make the jewelry look very rich. and very expensive looking
When I want to add a touch of glitz without adding blobs of shimmer I just slip one of these tiny little rondelles in and wha-la instant class act.  The prices isn't bad either.
Haven't done anything with the bling yet but I'm sure I will soon.  They are so pretty!  Yay for me!
Liked these very much but were a little smaller than I thought but that was my fault be very nice color.
This spacer added &#34;BLING&#34; to my jewelry making!  Turn plain into ritzy in seconds!  Loved working with this spacer!  The cost was low and delivery was quick too.  Will order more!  Also very light weight and fits well with 6-8 mm beads.  Very pretty!
Very nice for the price.  I've paid the same price for similar product of equal quality but have only gotten 20 pieces.  This is 100 pieces so, doing the math, this was a fifth of the price I usually pay.  I don't know about anyone else, but I LOVE saving money.
It is as beautiful as the swarovsky spacer, and the price makes it so much better.You got me.Keep this price, and I'll keep on shopping.
These are very pretty at a reasonable price. Exactly as pictured, they add beauty and interest to any of your jewelry products.It took about two and a half weeks for them to arrive but it was worth the wait.I noticed that some purchasers say these are not swarovski, and honestly I don't know if they are or not, but they are very pretty.
These spacers add just the right amount of &#34;bling&#34; to your jewelry for such a great price.  Very easy to use and fit perfectly between your beads.  I haven't seem them in local stores, but most beads at local stores are more expensive than what I find on Amazon.  Very highly recommend.
These are very nice Swarovski Crystal Rondelle Spacer Beads. These are 8mm a good size to use. These will be very pretty for spacers for beads to make necklaces, bracelets  or earrings. These will help protect the beads from banging together. These will make a nice addition  for jewelry.
Buy them!  They are such a great deal that these spacers will not last very long.  I am so happy that I ordered these spacers.  They are so beautiful in the necklaces that I have made for family and friends.
I used them to make bracelets and even made some necklaces. Everyone loved them, asked where I got them and I told them what web site to go on.  Thank you so much I will be doing more shopping again soon.
These crystals are clear and bright with a nice amount of sparkle!  The 8mm size works with a variety of pearl sizes. Shipment arrived as scheduled. Thanks!
I bought this package of 100 bead spacers to give my jewelry making some pazazz! And it certainly does!  The price is cheaper than anything I've seen in the bead vendors. This was an excellent purchase!
I absolutely love the Swarovski crystals. They are wonderful and such a good deal for the product and the quantity. Definitely a good  buy.
This is a great deal and they are beautiful what a great touch to every  bracelet and earring set I craft
No, these are not Swarovski Crystals, but they are still a very nice finding.  Several months ago I purchased a similar product for more money and these are so much nicer.
I bought these and the blue one for the first time.  These are very light and shiny.  The hole is too large for string beading so I put one one each side of a round bead.  This adds more bling to bracelets.
I loved the beads, they were very sparkly, and actually better then pictured. I will be able to use in bracelets or necklaces. Considering I ordered them during the holiday rush, I got them in record time.
Again more sparkley stuff.  Looks great where ever you use it.
I am certainly delighted with this purchase.  There are even enough pieces to do more than one project too. These are expensive to buy at super stores, where craft supplies are sold. I would have only been able to buy six at the price that I bought these for. I am very happy with my purchase on this.
Very pretty, makes for wonderful bling in making jewelry.  Seems like others like them too when they see the finished products.
These spacer beads are beautiful. They sparkle and enhance the jewelry I am making.  I will buy them again when needed.
Very affordable for the bling. I make jewelry for friends and loved ones and everyone loves the pieces I've made with these.
these are wonderful and love that they came in there on container. The colors are very vibrant and can be used for many different styles of beading.
Wonderful with big chunky beads!! They look even more beautiful in person. Idk what some reviews are taking about with the crystals falling out,  but they don't seen to have that problem on my end. Will def order more soon.
I completely fell &#34;in love&#34; with these spacer bead's.  The color is brilliant and they add a real pop of color.
They look great on my Christmas Jewelry.  I was extremely happy with them.  Sparkle very pretty and will definitely order them again.
The vivid and festive green color of the image got my attention and what I received is exactly like the image. I am excited to make the jewelry pieces I designed. Thanks.
I am using these to add luster and sparkle to my pearl and Aventurine necklaces for Christmas gifts.  Some of my relatives are very Irish and these will be perfect addition.  The price and quality can't be beat.
These beads are beautiful, and they blend well with other round or biconette beads.  They make lovely, very expensive-looking earrings.
They are beautiful!  I am very happy with them! Would definitely order again!  They look great with black beads and even better with my crystal snowmen earrings!
I love these.  Can't wait to use them in my creations.Right size this time.Good quality product.Thank you!
Just want I needed. Thanks
I love these rondelles.  They make excellent earrings, wonderful bracelets/anklets, and the most beautiful necklaces ever.  Don't be afraid to try them out.
I made an elephant necklace and you can see the red sparkle. Very beautiful spacers.  I will purchase more in the future.
Super portable, the Quartet Instant Easel, 63&#34;, Tripod Base sets up almost completely by itself! It folds small enough to fit into your book or tote bag. It has two supports to hold your posters or white board. Very useful for any portable presentation!
This is a really nice design.The legs snap together quickly, and then you pull the legs from the center.  The top cap restricts how far they can go out, its a good design.  I like to bend out the legs a little extra so that they kind of grip the floor, it makes it a little more stable.The easel holders are great, they fold down and snap into place.  A great design.  There is no way to really see if they are level, it would have been nice to have some tic marks on the legs so you could measure it out easier.  But thats fine.I would also have liked to have seen a case/bag.Its big enough to hold a sign welcoming people to an event, or, a tradeshow.  Its nice and light.  You wouldn't want to use it for displaying art, or for an art easel.  Its not strong enough for that.Bottom line: Its great for what it is.  But its not good for everything.
I just received the Swingline Commercial Electric Hole Punch and I am impressed with what it can do. It is  larger and heavier than a regular 3-hole punch.  It is portable, meaning you can use an AC adapter or 6 AA batteries. My son had 300 pages for a paper he was writing and I was able to punch holes in all 300pages in a few minutes. I like the paper guide which allows you to put your maximum number of  pages in the hole punch and press the start button.  It is quiet, no  louder than the sound a stapler make. It does a great job on 11 and 12 page choir anthems. I will  be using this electric hole punch for choir music at church and in my home office was well. I use to buy pre-punched computer paper for office work, but not anymore. I highly recommend this hole punch for any office, home or business.
I have had this model of the Swingline electric punch for 18 years at work!  I run a library and we do a ton of filing after printing and hole punching.  I mean a TON and this model has been faithful and worry free for almost two decades.  When I saw I could get this one for home I jumped at the chance!  This is the third hole punch I have purchased in 12 months for home.  The first one was a giant, heavy mechanical thing that I could not for the life of me figure out how to make the holes where they need to go - seriously - I am that lame.  The next one was a manual light weight - maybe do three pages - lol - like the three bears - it's too light!  And then THIS model came into my life - JUST like the one at work, but not as yellowed from age under fluorescent lighting.  The first thing I did was count out 28 sheets of copy paper and then punched and punched and punched and punched - lol - YAY - this model is perfect!!  Cut through the sheets time after time in a second, no problems, no jams AND PERFECT SPACING!The cord is nice and long and heavy duty.  There is a slide out receptacle under the machine for all the dots.  I empty mine at work every six months.This is the PERFECT machine for home businesses, the classroom and homeschoolers.  And office product freaks like myself.  Mine sits atop a filing cabinet - you will need a bit of room - especially if you want to attach the sheet-guide.  The sheet guide is wonderful - you will want to attach it - so give yourself plenty of space.If you need a hole punch consider this one - once you go electric, you NEVER want to go back!
Our choir uses an electric hole punch to put holes in the music. The old one we had finally gave out. This Paper Punch does an excellent job. It has a strong motor, it's heavy enough to stay in place, and it punches holes so fast, it's hard to believe. I'm expecting this commercial strength hole punch to last a very long time.
I gave this product five stars because it has saved me time when it comes to managing paperwork (punching holes in papers).  The item, when plugged in and waiting to be used, is as quiet as a mouse.  You can't even tell that it's on.  I simply put the paper in the slot and press the button with ease...simple as that.  It is a little noisy when you are punching holes in the paper but it's well worth it.  As it says, you can punch up to 28 sheets of paper.  The holes are centered perfectly for binders so there's no guessing like there is with some manual hole punchers.  Yes, it does take up more space than a manual one but you'll save time and energy.  Well worth the purchase!
Thus far, I have concluded that this electric hole puncher has two outstanding qualities. First, it could almost be called an "iPuncher" because of its high quality of design and ease of operation. So far, the second characteristic is durability. How long that is true remains to be seen. I lent it to a friend who teaches in a local elementary school who is in urgent need of such a product. She will return it after a two-week trial, not knowing that if she thinks as highly of the Swingline Commercial Electric 3-Hole Puncher, I'll let her keep it and buy another for myself. My use-level is rather low (perhaps 100 pages a week) but as with countless other products such as an ice scraper for a car's windows and a gauge to test air pressure in its tires, when you need what this product can do, you really do need it. Bravo to Swingline!
I absolutely love the Swingline Commercial Electric Punch!  I have downloaded so many craft projects and recipes and I'm going to put them all in a binder.  I have too many to punch one at a time.  Using this punch is making it so easy to get all the holes punched as I can punch up to 28 pages at a time which I am in the process of doing. It has a reverse on it so if you get a paper jam which I haven't had to use.  I am very, very  happy with the punch.
The Swingline Light Touch Desktop Punch is just as advertised. It has a great handle with a soft grip for punching up to 20 sheets of paper. It has a lock-down lever that will let you put the handle down and store it safely. The listing of 2-7 holes made me think that it could punch 7 holes at one time. This is not the case. You can adjust the hole cutters to the different hole placements. To move the cutters to a different hole, you have to unscrew it from the bottom and move it to another hole. I am happy with the normal three hole punch for notebooks, so I will not be moving the cutters, but it is good to know the capability is there if you need it. I highly recommend this desktop hole punch for all offices.
The Swingline LightTouch High Capacity Desktop Punch is winner! First, it does what it says. It punches 20 sheets of regular paper with one easy punch. You can get a bit more than 20 sheets in the punch, but it doesn't punch as well.Second, it's easy on the hands. There is no pounding or leaning on it to get it to punch through the 20 sheets of paper unlike most other paper punches. Just a simple press and the light touch system takes most of the work out of it for you.If you punch a lot of paper like I do, this is a must-have office supply!
In 30 years of working in offices, this is the very best hole punch I've ever used.  Easy to push down, sharp, stays lined up and has very easy to adjust hole punches.
This hole punch is a workhorse.  We actually have two, one that we purchased at least 5 years ago and this new one.  The first is still going strong and has not worn out. We got the second punch because there are times when we have a lot of paper to process. The only hole punch I have used that was more heavy duty was an old industrial drill press that could punch 4 inches of paper at one time.  If you need a good hole punch and you need to use it often, this is the hole punch for you.
My son had to show me the secret of getting the handle up.  lol - duhhhh.  Okay, got past that.  It punched through a 13 page stapled document no problem.  Easy dots collection tray.  Kind of nice looking for a whole punch.  This is the fourth one I have - and my manual favorite.  It is WAY better than the one piece cheapy one or two page punch - and I have the really heavy gigantic cumbersome monster manual puncher - I like this Swingline much better.  The holes are easier to align than on the monster and it is way easier to use.  I have an electric one at work - pretty heavy duty and nothing beats that thing - but this is good for around home and the kids work.  And endlessly punching out printed pages that need to go into binders.  GREAT for schoolwork.
This is smooth working and cuts through a decent number of pages (I punched a bunch of holes in my Farmers insurance booklet, which looked to be at least 30 pages).We are using this to punch holes in card stock for a stamp collecting catalog (yes, we are dorks) and it works great. It's hard to believe, but we've gone through 2 hole punches before this one. Putting them side by side with the last one we broke it is easy to see that this unit is much more substantial. I don't know what the price difference is, as I've had the other for a  million years and probably &#34;inherited&#34; it to begin with.Anyhow, if you have lots of stuff to punch holes in, this one will do the job and seems to be less stress on your hands in the process. Also handy little, easy to remove, confetti tray.
I got these through the Amazon Vine program.I had been looking for a new pair of scissors (did Amazon know that, somehow?).So, I was quite surprised when they showed up as an option. I grabbed them as fast as I could, and am not a bit disappointed.They are light in weight, outstanding in performance. But it was the whole Amazon experience that continues to delight me. I think I received the scissors within 3 days of putting the order in, maybe 2 days.I am very, very impressed, and love Amazon.
I use the Westcott Titanium Bonded Scissor in my kitchen for many different household uses.  It has a rounded, soft grip that nicely cushions my hand when I cut harder items, but also has a fine enough blade that I can cut smaller items.  I've used the scissors to cut everything from lettuce to flowers to construction paper to plastic product wrapping to string and performs all rolls perfectly.  And when it's gotten sticky, I throw it into the dishwasher and it comes out ready for more.All around it is a great, GREAT scissor and well worth the money!
These scissors are very nice, I'd highly recommend.  I do a lot of sewing and crafts, so I am picky about scissors.  These are cushioned and comfortable to hold, extremely sharp and lightweight.  I'll definitely be using them a lot and will probably buy more.
These scissors work great. They feel great in your hand and they cut perfectly. I have used them to cut cardboard and many other things with no problem. I even like the yellow highlights. Very nice pair of scissors.
I first used these for material, then forgot one day and am now using in the kitchen, threw away a worn out pair. They are tough, I use them everyday.
More than ten years ago, we purchased a pair of Wilkinson scissors and until now were convinced they are the best.Thanks to the Vine program, we had a chance to check out (i.e. put to the test) the Westcott Titanium Bonded Scissors.We have a new #1.The scissors is dead! Long live the scissors!
This is so easy to use.  It printed up perfectly on my Epson Stylus Photo printer - very detailed and good quality print.  Then ironing it on was a snap!  I made some personalized pillows and purses to give as gifts and I know the recipients are gonna LOVE them for Christmas!  It will be fun to see their faces when they recognize pictures of their pets and kids on their items.  Can't wait!
This is perfect for heavy weight material projects.  It is simple to just print on it and use.  Love this for all kinds of crafts.
I don't think this has been mentioned yet, but this can be cut with punches.For me, the iron-on backing was a little off-putting until I realized that. Since I can use my circle hand punches with it, I'm using it for ornaments as well as little circle patches to mend some of my dad's jackets with and patches my teens can add to their backpacks. If you're reasonably good in your graphics program, you can make all sorts of nifty designs to fit into your favorite punches. I don't have a digital cutter, but if it works with punches, it would probably work well with die cutters and personal cutters as well.Color prints out well and brightly on it, and the package does suggest hand washing to keep the color well.As far as cost goes, 3 dollars a sheet is pricey, but for my uses, it's really inexpensive. Buying patches to fix my dad's jackets with can cost 2-3 dollars each for the small patches, and he's very picky about what his jackets are patched with as far as design goes. With this I can make 10 2 inch patches and a whole bunch of 1 inch circle patches on one sheet. My 62 year old dad can have either the cool designs he likes for some jackets or I can do a close color match on others. So it's pretty thrifty for that use.My teens like the idea of fandom or idea based patches for their bags and backpacks to personalize them.I'm very happy with this product. Look at product images to see a patch I made using the punch method. The punch I use most often isUchida LV-SJCP40 Clever Lever Super Jumbo Craft Punch, 2-Inch Circle, it also works with my EK Success punches and my die cutting machine.
Printable fabric sheets have been around for years, but improvements are being made every year.  (There are STILL some really bad ones out there ...) Given the brand name recognition (Avery) and having had less than great results from similar products (I name only one below), I HAD to check out Avery Personal Creations Printable Fabric.First Impressions:1) The Product Itself: It is the stiffest fabric paper I have ever used.  Instantly, I realized this could be both a huge plus and a big negative; this product is best suited for certain crafts (totes, framed pieces, scrapbooking, anything else where rigid is a good thing) and not for others (wearables, quilts, pillows)2) The Image: For me, the single most important quality about printable fabric is the image reproduction.  (Everything else I can work around, like fraying or thinness.)  Granted, results can vary hugely, depending on your printer and the specific printer settings.  When I used the "automatic" option for paper type and used the "best" quality option for printing, the end result using this Avery Printable Fabric was hands-down the very best I have ever seen.Good Things To Know About This Product:1) It is for Inkjet printers ONLY2) There is no backing to peel off from the fabric sheet3) It is Sew-in or Iron-on (unlike interfacings, this can be either/or); "Iron On" means ironing activates the glue, and NOT that this is an image transfer product that uses an iron to put the image on another surface4) It's available (currently) in only one color - a pleasing white (some other brands offer off-white)5) This is not an image transfer product6) When Avery claims "washable", their instructions really state "for best results, hand wash"7) As with similar products, you need to let the printed image dry for at least 24 hours; even then, some image smearing can occur from simple handlingPersonal Tips from Prior Experience With Printable Fabrics:1) Read/follow all manufacturer's instructions; check website for more info/FAQs or reviews from other customers2) Place only one sheet at a time in your printer3) If not using the glue aspect, ie, you are sewing it in, keep in mind future ironing of the finished item - the glue may adhere to parts of the project you never intended - not good!!4) If using color, try to use new/fresh color ink cartridge5) ALWAYS do a test using plain printer paper first, to check for correct image placement, to test paper feed, and to test printer settings; know which is the image-side of the product (usually the matte side)6) If applicable, keep seam allowances in mind7) If using as an iron-on, make sure to PRESS and not really iron; both the fabric and thus the image itself can distort if you do too much side-to-side ironing.  Just press the image with an up and down motion8) Plan ahead for multiple projects; fit as many images as possible onto one sheet to make the best cost advantageThe Ultimate Test:Unfortunately, the full test of this product will require months of time * and usage to determine:1) how the image is retained and whether the fabric yellows over time.  (I had to throw out several projects where I used Milliken's Printable Treasures because the images yellowed horribly.)2) how the finished product withstands several washings and ironings (read my notes about HAND washing and ironing above!)* Update 10/1/2012:  I am still thrilled with the color quality on my simple little project.  (I will post a photo soon.)  The colors are still rich and deep, just like the very first day of printing.  Of course, my project is not washable - that will be my next experiment, and I will post an update as to how that goes.The Downside:At the time of this writing, Avery has not answered user questions on their website that are over 6 months old.  I mention this not as an indication of the product quality, per se, but in case you need more information.  You might do better going elsewhere, such as guilds, discussion groups, online user reviews, etc. for answers to any questions.The Bottom Line:For some crafts where rigidity can be an asset, and for near-perfect image reproduction, these Avery Printable Fabric cotton sheets are ideal.
I have seen printable fabric for inkjet printers for several years now but didn't think it would print a good picture or would ruin my printer, but decided to print a picture of my granddaughter playing soccer.  It turned out beautiful and not only that but it fills the whole 8.5 x 11 sheet to the edges!  My printer prints vibrant colors and it would depend on your printer if you want to do it in color.  I haven't tried it yet but a black and white picture would look awesome also!  After printing the picture onto the printable fabric the possibilities would be endless of how you use it!  It can be put on a white or co-ordinating colored pillow case, which is what I'm going to do. Mod poding a picture onto something would also be fun to do.  I love the Avery Printable Fabric and highly reccommend buying this product!
I enjoy serging with this little guy, it is the least complicated one that I own, I have 2 Baby Locks, and 2 Singers besides, but this is my favorite right now because of the simplicity of threading the other ones are bears to do. They can make you crazy. I gave a Singer 14j334 serger to my friend and that one completely opened in the front, and was very easy to thread but the stitching was kind of touchy. The Brother is not touchy at all. Give it a try, I am sure that you will like it and if not try the new Singer 14J250, I haven't tried one of those yet but it opens in the front for threading. Amazon is terrific for customer service.
I got this serger for mother's day last year and just ordered another for my friend yesterday. I am fairly new to sewing and am in no way an expert. I saw all of the great reviews on this and immediately told my hubby about it. He then purchased it for me for mother's day. I was so intimidated by it, that I left it sealed in the box until a month ago. It was just the thought of using a serger with all those threads. I thought that if I had it, I might as well use it....and I'm so glad I did! The informative dvd was a life saver because I've never even seen how a serger is threaded let alone done it myself. The best advice I can give you is to use the technique where you keep the machine threaded and tie the new thread to the old ones and pull them through. I am so happy with this machine that I've been recommending it to everyone I know that sews. You can't beat it for the money. The other nice ones are so expensive in comparison and I can't see where they would be any better than this one. I hope this helps=)
This is a great serger machine. It is very easy to thread, I got it right my first time. It has colored instructions right on the machine. It serges great. I love it. It is making sewing so fast and easy. It does come with colored practice thread and already threaded for you. this is a great machine and a great buy!
My wife is a professional seamstress, and wanted to have her own serger at home. Based on the excellent reviews, I ordered her this machine for Christmas. After one month, she loves it so far, no problems at all.----------I just wanted to edit this review to note that we are now going on 2 years with this serger. My wife has used it regularly, if not daily, and it is still holding up fine. For the price we paid here, I think it is a great unit.
Love it!  New to using a serger, but am learning.  Have surged seams, but want to use it for more.  Nice buy!  Nice machine by Brother.  Good price, too.
I highly recommend you to buy this if you are looking for a very reasonable priced serger. It sews beautifully, threading is very simple, No other serger can be compared with this one in the relation price-performance. You actually receive more than what you pay.
I always recommend the Brother 1034D because of some very important reasons:1. Sergers are only really  made by three or four manufacturers who hold the patents. So the branding on them is not as important as knowing WHO really made it. You might be buying your favorite brand (Singer, Pfaff, Janome, Brother, Bernina) but in actuality, the serger is made by someone else. In this case, Brother makes the Brother 1034D.2. Sergers go obsolete quickly. Their parts (unlike sewing machines) become scarce. And because they sew faster, and are made to tighter tolerances, the parts do wear out and mis-use and mistakes can require a new part. This is why I don't recommend buying a used machine or an obsolete machine. The repair may be expensive--or impossible. Obsolete can be in as little as three years. but this machine has been almost unchanged in design for 20 years.3. The parts for this machine are widely available as are the feet and accessories. And they don't cost a whole lot compared to other brands.4. You really only need 3 and 4 thread to start out (2-thread flat lock is nice, but not something used every day.) 5-Thread machines look cool, but they can be more complicated to set up and change around.5. This design is simple to thread by hand.  I need a magnifier and extra light due to my eyesight but you always need a forceps or tweezers. If you can't do it, you can buy a much more expensive type of machine with air threading but most people can do the Brother 1034D after being shown a few times (there is a DVD. And you can find this model in sewing stores all over.) I am able to thread it in minutes.6. Changing to the narrow hem "rolled" hem is easy; you remove a stitch finger underneath. OTHER MODELS REQUIRE unscrewing plates and it's a pain. Changing to the rolled hem is VERY important, because you use it for placemats, tablecloths, skirt hems and costume hems a great deal.7. Price: you can pay twice or three times this much and not get any better machine. Some more expensive models sport LCD screens but actually, they just show settings are are nothing more than an electronic manual. Save money and a part that can go bad and skip that. They mostly don't control the settings, are informational. For what you pay extra, hardly worth it, though pretty to look at, I will admit.Unless you are quite sophisticated at serging, I suggest starting with this machine. If you take to serging well (and I did) you can always sell it and find your dream machine but I still have mine. By the way, this design is SO tested and well-made that the old Huskylocks (Viking) are the same inside as this machine and I have one, going strong after 20 years.If you goof up your machine by abuse (sewing over a pin, pushing it when it balks or tangles) you will likely damage ANY serger. There are several parts--the knife that trims the seam, and the lower looper and the thread finger (on the plate) that are prone to damage by misuse. These parts can be replaced but to avoid frustration, take a lesson. I did that.

Put this on an 8x11" page, and slip it into a three ring binder. When you go to serge, you have a reference of what the various stitches look like, how to get them set up and this saves enormous amounts of time to remember what you did before.If you love serging, you can add a coverstitch machine (dedicated, no need to do lengthy setup) and this makes the hem you see on commercial clothing; double row of stitches on the front, the covered edge on the reverse side. It's used in costuming and clothing. If you make childrens' clothing, your own, or you hem up things, or if you do costuming for sports or theater, you can add this machine for the price of ONE serger of a more expensive brand that doesn't do it half as well.Brother 2340CV Cover Stitch
I've been sewing for over 50 years, on traditional sewing machines.. I was nervous about using a serger, thinking i'd have to learn to sew in a new way, and not sure I wanted to bother doing that at this point.. My daughter had bought a serger years ago from Walmart and between the two of us, we could not figure out how to thread that thing to save our lives! But I now have arthritis in my right hand and it's become really hard to clip seams, especially on small items like doll clothes (which I sew and sell for a living)... My husband asked if I'd like a serger for Christmas, hoping that would help eliminate the need to clip seams.. Based on the reviews, I decided to give it a try.. I'm so glad I did! It's so cool to be able to finish off edges while clipping the seams all at once.. My hand says thank you, thank  you, thank you...It comes pre threaded with four colors of thread, the same colors as the diagrams on the machine showing you how to tread each station (very smart of brother!)...When it came time to re-thread it, I was a little nervous... You look at all these lines drawn on the machine and it looks a little overwhelming.. But I watched the CD that comes with the machine showing it being threaded, got the book out for reference, then followed the lines for each station.. It was a little hard for my arthritic hands to thread the bottom loopers, but it was doable, and I did it right! Yahoo...The CD's show you all kinds of things you can do with this machine, but for me, I'm just happy to use it to finish off and clip seams.. It's also smaller than a traditional sewing machine so takes up less space.. It has a little clip on container you attach to the front to collect all the seam clippings.. Brother seems to have put a lot of thought into this machine, and really, for the price, you get a lot!
My old serger bit the dust after over 20 years of service, so it was time for a replacement. I decided to get a Brother this time, because the favorite of my four sewing machines is a Brother. It's easy to use and very dependable, which is what I wanted in a new serger. I read reviews on multiple websites, and they were consistently good ones. The price was affordable as well. I ordered the machine on Saturday night, and it arrived the following Wednesday morning. I took it right out of the box and set it up. Much to my surprise, I had it threaded and was sewing within a couple of minutes! I could not believe how easy it was to thread! I definitely couldn't say that about my old one! One of the most daunting things about using a serger is threading it and adjusting the tension. Neither is a problem with this machine. It's wonderfully easy to use and produces quality work.Whether you are considering the purchase of your first serger or have been sewing for many years, you can't go wrong with this one. I mostly sew purses, curtains and clothes, and there's just no way I could produce quality items for myself or others without a serger. If you've never had one, don't be afraid of this one! You won't believe what-all you can do with it to make your sewing projects more fun and professional-looking. Whether you sell your work, give it away, or keep it for yourself, you want it to look good and hold up for use. This serger will be a joy for you to use, so go ahead and treat yourself!
LOVE this machine. I also have a Singer that's been serviced 3 times already ( I think it's a lemon) and I should have gone with this one in the first place. Easy to thread and sings like a bird. Great choice!! Great value, good options...can't beat it!
I LOVE this thing. it's loud but it works! I got it just in time before October and made my Halloween costume with it! I did two costumes in two weeks and this machine is a nice little workhorse. It spend up the process and saved me so much time. I also use this with knits. This thing is a gem for those who work with knit fabrics a lot. Just remember, it's a 4 spool serger and is NOT an overstitch machine. I might have to invest in one of those later. but for now, this is great! For the price, it is even better!
What an exceptional machine! I reviewed several models of sergers before I decided to purchase this Brother 1034D.  Several things played into my decision to buy this one. I am a relatively new sewer taking a sewing class at the local Hancock's Fabrics. There is an old serger in our class that I learned on. Great machine but very complicated. The Brother 1034D is incredibly simple to use and to thread with its color coded guides.  It has a free arm which really helps when serging on a curve (a particular problem for me.) The price from Amazon was extremely competitive and the service exceptional.  The only negative things that I can say is the soft cover that comes with it is useless and ill-fitted. It should not really be called a cover. Also, my new serger was missing several spool caps. Amazon offered to swap out my machine for a new one, but I thought that was unnecessary for spool caps.Overall, I am very pleased with my new serger!
This is the first serger I have owned and am enjoying making baby blankets with it (so easy to hem).  Looking forward to using it on even more projects.
This machine is quiet, performs great and I am so impressed and happy that I purchased this, if you are on the fence, don't hesitate this is a great machine at this price point
After reading many reviews and trying one out at my local Brother Dealer, I purchased this one at Amazon.  The price was great and it did everything that was advertised.  I Recommend this product and ALL Brother sewing/embroydery machines.  Like they say, "Brother, always at your side"
I love my new serger! Getting to create and repair all of our things is awesome! Very easy to use!
I bought this brother serger because I wanted nice clean edges on my sewed items.  This machine came ready to sew. Just lift the thread bar and start sewing. I needed to change a thread color and followed several videos on youtube.  It's a little confusing in the beginning but not impossible.  It's a small machine but not cheap looking. This machine has differential feed but no coverstitch but I can do a coverstitch on my regular sewing machine. This machine uses regular sewing threads as well as the cones.  I love it!
I have stayed away from a serger for years out of them appearing so complicated.  Not this little jewwl.  Threading has been easy and work great.  The first one I received did not funcion properly but Amazon immediately sent me another one with a return shipping tag for the one that wasn't working properly.
I bought my brother 1034D after reading and researching lots and lots of reviews.  I had to decided between this and a singer 2-3-4 thread serger.  Im really glad that I made this choice.  Everything came as described.  It came with the two extra feet, it was pre-threaded etc.  I decided, after trying it out (straight out of the box) to re-thread it myself (seeing that there were lots of reviews on the threading process) I have to admit I was a bit intimidated at first, but once to follow the instructions (manual) and the directions on the serger itself...you would be fine...I did it on my first try.  Its not that hard....believe me.  Im soooo excited about this purchase that Im even considering getting additional feet attachments for the serger.  If you want a great serger for a great price this is it!
Even though I have been sewing for over 20 years, this is the first serger I have ever owned.  Could not have picked a better serger to start out with.  Easy to learn and use.  Threading is supposed to be a nightmare with a serger but after a couple of times, this one can be done in a few minutes.  Have used serger thread, wooly nylon, polyester thread and polyester embroidery decorative thread and all worked well.  A friend's daughter is getting married next spring so we started to make the tablecloths and napkins for the reception.  What a dream doing rolled hems -- everything comes out beautiful.  The 2 CDs and the instruction book are helpful but I also purchased &#34;The Complete Serger's Handbook&#34; here on Amazon and it was the most help for me.  Recommend you buy it if you are thinking of purchasing a serger.  The only thing not really extensively covered anywhere is how to turn corners with rolled hems but a litting searching on the internet and U-tube, I was able to find several ways to finish perfect corners.  We are now in full swing making napkins and tablecloths.  I found the &#34;Serger Techniques&#34; book that came with the 1034D very helpful, especially with setting the tensions, loopers, etc.  For the price, you cannot beat this little gem of a serger.  I would recommend it highly.
I've sewn for years and this is my 4th serger. (I tend to wear them out)  So far it works great and i am extremely pleased with it. If one follows the directions, it's easy to thread, adjust to what fabric you're using, and is just in general a nice little machine.I do recommend it, and not just because of the price.
I sew a lot. I have several sewing machines and three sergers. I use each of them for pretty specific types of cloth or uses. This serger is kept with white thread and gets heavy usage on light and mid-weight fabrics.Easy to thread, easy to use, light and easy to move around. I keep this one for lighter weight fabrics, so I'm not sure how it does on the heavier ones like canvas.Good steady machine which is not too expensive for what you get.
Although I have been sewing since I was a young child, I had never owned or used a serger before. I finally decided to add one to my craft/sewing room, and chose this Brother model because I love my Brother sewing machine, and the Amazon reviews looked good.Oh my goodness, I pulled this out of the box and it looked quite daunting. I set up the machine, and read the book to the point of a practice run.  Lo and behold, the machine was jammed. The wheel wouldn't turn.  I called Brother so that if the machine broke while I was trying to fix it, I hadn't done anything that they did not specifically tell me to do.  Brother told me to turn the wheel counter clockwise to try and break it free.  Fifteen seconds later, the machine was working, and I had my test run.  Awesome!I finished the book and watched the CD.  The CD contains great instruction for all the different stitches, and is very easy to understand. I will give you this recommendation up front as it comes in the middle or toward the end of the CD somewhere.  Watch the CD by your serger.  Have practice material handy. Have some 4x6 cards or sometthing and take notes of the settings and instructions that are given on the CD, pause the CD and practice the stitch and then file the practice stitch with the notes that you took.  I wish I had this reference, but I am going to have to watch the CD again to create this.  Otherwise, you will have to watch a portion of one of the CDs again to get the instructions.  It's a little disruptive if you are in the middle of sewing.I had read reviews of other brands of sergers and the nightmare of threading them.  People spending four hours to try and figure out how to thread them. I was a little fearful of this machine. After watching the CD, I was relieved that I really would never have to thread it again since you can just tie new thread to the already threaded looper.  Well, I wasn't paying attention and the upper looper (#3) ran out of thread. I easily rethreaded this in a matter of moments, but in doing so, the lower looper (#4) came unthreaded. Uh oh. I read the book and easily got it threaded up to where it goes into the looper. The book seemed to show a bunch of dashes, which made no sense. I turned the page and the book clearly explained the last steps. Awesome. Had the lower looper threaded in less that 60 seconds.  Bwahaha. I am now fearless with this machine. It is easy to use and the CDs are great references.  I have only had my machine for about 3 weeks, but I have used it every day and just love it. It's a great price too! I recommend this for anyone looking for a 3/4 serger. Don't get tricked into buying a more expensive machine by people calling it a 'beginner' serger. Silliness. I sew daily, and have for 30 years. This is a 3-4 serger. A 3-4 serger will do almost anything you need it to do unless there is something special that you sew regularly that requires a chain stitch or a coverstitch, although I can't for the life of me figure out what that might be. If you add the 2 thread and the 5 thread option, you will spend a whole lot of money for a coverstitch, jet stream threading and and a chain stitch. After alot of research, my assessment was that I might make up a few projects to use the extra stitches if I had them, but that it was a whole lotta money for something I didn't need in order to make clothes or dolls or doll clothes or quilts. A bunch of money for novelty. This is a great machine with alot of functionality. It is a real time saver for finishing seams, raw edges, rolled hems, pin tucks, blind hems, etc. Awesome!
It took me two months before I got the courage to open the box and use the machine. But after viewing some videos I find that this serger works great! When a needle  broke I was able to follow the color guides and retread the machine with no problem. I'm really enjoying what I can do with a serger.
Great machine.. No problems at all. Learning how to thread it is very easy once getting the hang of it.
This I perfect for all my needs!  It was very easy to learn how to use and does the job without a fuss.
My knit garments are now totally stable, washable, and beautiful.  My brocades no longer separate at the seams. My denims no longer fray...  Such nice professional looking seams for such a low price.  So easy to use. it took me 3 months to break it out of the box - I was pretty intimidated, but I should have started right away.Attention to novice sergers (like me)....  it doesn't do curved seams...  you'll need to manipulate your fabric curves into a straight line before letting those feed dogs and the cutting blade chomp at it.  I learned this the hard way and ruined my first project.Also, The DVD included would not play in my Blu-Ray, but the whole instruction series is published on YouTube so not an issue.I am very happy with this purchase and the low price. If I'd known what I was missing, I would have purchased this many years ago. Buy it and enjoy.
As soon as I got the product I put it on all my rulers, I believe it has helped.  The ruler doesn't seem to move as much.  I  am glad I got it.  My friends bought it too. They all agree it helps.
This was a great discovery and every ruler I own now has this backing. It is amazing stuff. Cannot figure out how it works but so much better than the small adhesive dots.
I've been struggling with sliding rulers for a while until Omnigrid Invisible Grip Roll saved the day. I make many t-shirt quilts and the rulers slip quite often. After applying the product, no more slippage and more accurate cutting! Thanks.
I don't want to give you a bad rating but I don't think this product works as well as the True Cut product.  My long 6 1/2 cutting rule still slides.
When I first unrolled this product I had my doubts but it really is amazing how is keeps the ruler from slipping on fabric, wish I had know about it sooner.  I will be spreading the word that is for sure. Nothing worse than wasting material when cutting quilts.
These strips are invaluable in the quilting world...and they work perfectly to help cut good lines and keep the rulers from slipping.  I could not quilt without them.
Unfortunately I ahd to return it , I just couldn't figure out how to use it, which was a hame, But I doo think it is essential and necessary for artists
This is a great product. The cartridge is easy to change. It works so much better than I thought it would. The stickers come out clean and ready to use. I don't regret purchasing it.
I love this machine. I have all the Xyron makers for doing card making. My only gripe is that there is a waste factor of several inches on each run through the machine. If they could resolve that I wouldn't have an unkind thing to say.
A must have for any paper crafter, scrapbooker, art journaler, or crafter in general. I wish I had purchased this sooner. It's very easy to use, doesn't require batteries or electricity, so ya can pop it in your car and take it with you to a friends, or if you're traveling and like to take supplies along.
And I use it for most of my quilts, whether they be baby size, twin, or queen. There is little &#34;bearding&#34; and it drapes and sews well.
I use Warm and Natural for most of my projects. it is lightweight and easy to sew. I machine quilt most projects and this batting and two fabric layers are no problem to sew through.
I was looking for extra wide batting 108&#34; when I found this at this site I saw where I could buy my regular width for a single quilt also and it was cheaper than I could at our local JoAnne with a coupon.  I will definitely do this again.
This is simply the best quality product to use with your quilt. It is generous in size and made with quality. I will never go back to polyester batting again!
I have made 4 twin quilts this long winter and this is the perfect batting. They are for donation to the cancer society so I like the ALL COTTON of the batting also. Not too bulky to quilt under my small machine. Nice to see on the internet and not deal with the yardage from a shop.
This is the best batting you can get for quilting, you can quilt as far as 10&#34; apart. Great product...buy buy buy
If you use a coupon or get to the store during batting sales, you can probably do better on the pricing, but if you live far out or want to save a trip, the pricing here is great for the same high quality batting.
This is my favorite batting and I rarely use anything else.  I dislike the synthetic batting and since I quilt quite a bit, this is a great option.  It's easy to work with and I've never had a bad product yet.
I use this batting exclusively on all my quilts.  It is extremely easy to work with and wonderfully natural.  Not too heavy and not too light, just perfect.
Love this seam ripper. Best one I've had! Nice and sharp and cuts well. Very happy with this purchase! Excellent transaction!
A good basic to keep in every sewing basket!  Just like the one I have had for years.  I have lost some in between, but this one is the perfect size to use.  Bought it for my daughter's sewing basket.
My husband and I buy Dritz Deluxe Seam Rippers a dozen at a time.  I actually do use them for ripping out seams, but their main purpose in our household, is to remove hair clumps from our long-haired Maine Coon cats.We've tried other brands, including the longer 'red' seam ripper and were amazed at the difference between the products.  The 'red' model was too dull right out of the wrapper to cut cat hair!The normal clump-removal tools that can be found in pet catalogues are too big and clumsy to use on a cat, especially for the matted hair that accumulates between the upper leg and the body (armpit?  Do cats have armpits?).  This seam ripper works perfectly to separate the mat from the skin.There are two things you need to be careful of when using this product to de-mat your cat:(1) Don't poke kitty with the sharp end of the tool.  You have one seam ripper, but your cat has eighteen!(2) Don't pull on the hair clump while you are cutting it away from the skin.  If you tug at the mat, you might accidentally pull kitty's hide up into the razor-sharp crescent blade, and cut it.We originally learned about this novel use for a seam ripper from a man who shows Maine Coons, and have been using it successfully for many years.
It's a seam ripper.  It's sharp and I'm always misplacing mine, so I bought this extra one.  I've had fancy ones that cost more, but this is the seam ripper of choice.  Thanks Amazon.  Product came very quickly.
These little gadgets come in &#34;sew&#34; handy - I am actually a little lost without one when it comes to working with threads and fabric.  This is a good one for the price, Dritz reliable quality
I have been using my cropadile to punch holes but I was finding the holes a little too big for card making so this is perfect. I was lucky in the sense that I got to try out my friends for awhile and decide to finally get my own.
This is an awesome hole punch!  I've been using it to punch holes in 5 mil laminated sheets and it's been punching with ease.  Not only do I get nice clean holes, which to me is an indication that it is nice and sharp, it also doesn't require a lot of pressure to work and the cushion grip handle keeps my and from feeling sore.So far, mine also seems to be holding up well.  I haven't had the issues with the cushions splitting that other reviewers have mentioned.  My packaging also mentioned a lifetime warranty so I would hope if for whatever reason this didn't hold up that fiskars would work with me to replace it.Overall I've been pretty happy!  This is the perfect hand punch for making small holes, even in laminate sheets.
i have bought another one before and didn't work as well!!! fiskars are guaranty!!! and better than the other brands.
This punch is very easy to use and gives a clean cut hole. This punch is a rarely used size, but for some of the die cuts, it is perfect for punching out and cleaning up small holes.
Love my Fiskars Hand Punch, it's cute, easy to use and works on all my arts and crafts projects. I would highly recommend, especially like that it has a hole catcher.
I was having a hard time finding one of this size.  It is great for my hexagon grandmas garden templates.  I punch 2 holes in the template and can reuse template many times, and pin my fabric to the hexagon.
Was very happy with the deal I received on the rulers andI use them at least one of them on every project I havedone. I find them very useful and was glad I got the4 rulers at the same time, so that I didn't have to go shopping forall of those sizes. I am a beginner quilter and I can use allthe help I can get.ThanksHope
Omnigrid rulers are terrific for cutting fabric accurately with a rotary blade and great for using a scissors, too. When using scissors I use my Omnigrid ruler to determine where to cut, then make a straight line mark with a pencil.If it is a slippery fabric I use flat head pins to hold the fabric together and the Omnigrid ruler will lay flat on top of the fabric with no problems.The yellow markings are very easy to see and are very useful for finding the measurement wanted. For example, on the 1" ruler there are yellow markings at 1/4" spaces in the middle of the ruler, and black dashes down the middle section that are labeled with 3/16" and 3/8" from both edges; these  make it easy to line the ruler up just at the measurement wanted. On the edges the yellow marks indicate 1/8" increments.This set is great for quilting because of the assortment of ruler sizes. The 1" ruler is perfect for adding 1/4" seam allowances and making straight edges on small fabric pieces. The two larger rulers make cutting bigger pieces easy. They are small enough to keep on my sewing table without getting in the way when I am sewing.Because the plastic is a little slippery I like to buy the "TrueCut Non Slip Ruler Grips" to place on the back of the rulers. It really helps keeping them in place while cutting.
I use these for quilts and to measure lines ect..great compact - sterdy..works great..i have no more to say. Please
Wow, this rotary ruler set is a great help with rotary cutting. I am new to quilting and have never used a rotary cutter before so having these heavy duty rulers to help guide my cutter has been wonderful. I would highly recommend these rulers to all quilters.
Love this stuff. I have tried sandwiching quilts so many ways and this is the only way I like it. I won't bother using anything else.
In the past I have always pinned my quilt layers together and would just tie my layers together using embossing thread.  Recently I have invested in a more expensive machine and have started to straight line quilt with my walking foot and have begun trying to free motion quilt.I realized that I needed to come up with a better solution to hold my quilt layers together rather than pinning.  I did some research and many quilters recommended spray basting.  I did further research and found that 505 seemed to be the most recommended brand.I have gone through a couple cans of this now on a few different quilts.  I think the glue basting is much easier to apply and saves lots of time.  I feel that it makes my layers smoother and I have less issues with pinched fabric as I am sewing the layers together.  I have also found that it does not gum up my needles.I placed my first order for this with Amazon, but I will be buying the 505 from my local big chain craft store. It is several dollars cheaper when you buy it with a coupon.
I use this when putting the quilt layers together.  It does not gunk up your machine  Also you can still move the layers of your quilt if you want to and it will stick together again.
This adhesive was just what I wanted,the right size and doesn't gum up on my embroidery machine. the right amount of hold for this we don't hoop, just lay flat on top of the stabilizer. no smell and easy wash out
I went back and forth trying to decide if I wanted to buy this because it is so expensive.  I finally bought it and it works well, especially for Free motion quilting, (No more pins to get poked by).  I bought the small can and made 20 or so quilt sandwiches to practice on.  They were 20" x 20".  The can ran out.  Argh!!  You don't get much in the small can.  I don't know if its enough for a large quilt or how long it stays sticky.  It is a better product and doesn't smell, but spray it outside anyway and cover your table completely.  Goo gone gets it off if you overspray.
I at first thought this was a difficult tool to use, but found that it is great for cutting lots of strips at one time. Love the 1/4 inch measurements too.
Works very well with strips, squares haven't tried triangles yetBut I'm sure it will work great. A time saver for smaller squaresWorks just like the demo on you-tube
I heard a lot of old quilters say they don't like this, sure glad I'm new at quilting, I love it.  Injuries to my back make it very painful to stand and cut the material for a quilt. because I'm new it seems to take me forever to make sure I have everything perfect.  With this it's trim the end and the next thing I know it's done.  I know it would have taken me so much longer because of my back.  You can watch videos on how to use this on you tube, very helpful, I watched them before I decided to buy this.  I am super happy  did.
As always, Omnigrid makes excellent products that will last for years. This is no different. It is, however, very small at 3 1/2 inches.. but that's exactly what I was looking for!A+
The Omnigrip 6x12 ruler is one tool in my sewing room that I use all the time. It is a great size to have if your only going to have one ruler.
I'm a new sewer and this was perfect with a small cutting mat I bought.  The squares perfectly match up to the lines on the mat.  It was surprisingly solid, not flexible at all, and overall better quality than what I was expecting to get.  Other reviewers said it slipped around, but as long as you put light pressure with one hand it stays in place very well.
This is a great ruler and I love the non-slip which makes the cutting so much easier.  The product was shipped & received very quickly.  Thanks for a great product.
Throughout my house, I have a pair of scissors in various storage spots.  I am either cutting out coupons, articles, opening items for dinner, etc.  With many uses for a scissors, it is nice to have a sharpener.  This little tool solves the dull scissor.
This is such a handy little thing!  I've got 3 now.  One in my sewing room, one in my office and one in my kitchen.  I use scissors a lot, so keeping them sharp has always been a challenge - not anymore!  Small, compact, good price.
I tried this sharpener on an old pair of cheap scissors that I was going to throw away because they wouldn't cut through anything and now they work again!  I've also used it on my good sewing scissors to keep them razor sharp.  It definitely works and for the price you can't beat it.
I purchased this because it was a couple of dollars. I didn't think it was going to be great but it is!  I use it all the time. I use it on small and large scissors and it keeps them so nice and sharp.  I love this product!
I have never had a scissors sharpener before but the price of scissors you should really invest in this amazing product.  I had an old, I mean old pair of scissors in the kitchen for cutting open those packages with the sealed edges that are terrible to open. I have used these scissors for at least 3 years for every don't use scissors to cut open. This amazing little tool made them like new, I just can't believe it.
This is one of my favorite tools I have one in my sewing room,one in my kitchen, garage tool box, bathroom cabinets & downs stairs. They were so cheap I bough one for every place I use scissorsIt is easy to keep my scissors sharp. I now sharpen my scissors the minute I finish using them just likely knivesI wash dry & sharpen. That way they are ready to go they next time I use them
I got these for getting my very old scissors sharp and they did a nice job of getting them like new again I also purchased some very cheap and not so sharp scissors and the three of them were not worth a nickel until I used this on them. I found that these made those cheap scissors cut very good. I am so glad that they worked so good. I wish that I could have found this sooner. I would say if you got an old pair of scissors that seem dull then these could be what can bring them back to life. Great purchase and plan on purchasing these again if for some reason they could break of get lost.
this is a great case, it fits perfectly for the machine i bought it for and also i can tell that if i get a different machine it would probabaly fit that too. i got this so i would be able to take my machine while we travel and i feel very confident that i can do that witout having any damage occus to my machine. it was also a really good price/value
This case came in on time. Well packaged and just as described. And I was surprised what good shape it was in considering it was &#34;USED&#34;. I saw no evidence of it being used.
Just what I needed for my machine.
I loved it! its the perfect size and fit for my Brothers Runaway Sewing Machine. Keeps it secure and  lock and place.
Held machine and accessories, plenty of room. Can store it all together
I can fit my sewing machine & its gear along with some of my tools I use when sewing in this handy carrying case.  The handle is comfortable.
I ordered this case for my Brother SE-400. It's plenty big enough for my machine, the embroidery attachment, extra hoops, instruction books, etc. I put some of that drawer liner in the bottom that keeps things in place. Plus, I always have bubble wrap for extra protection to keep my things from bumping around in transport. So far, the hinges have held up just fine to hold the top and bottom portions of the case together, but I always carry mine with a hand underneath instead of by the handle. I love my sewing machines and serger like they are people, so I don't take chances with them! :) When my SE-400 is in sewing mode, I store the embroidery attachment in the case to keep it safe. The case is large, but it fits nicely under one of my sewing tables. I don't usually need to travel with more than one machine, and I have a sewing room where my machines are all out and used daily, but I will definitely order another case exactly like this if I need one in the future.
Great purchase  I am glad I bought at same time as the serger / will be great to keep the dust off the machine
This was my second case ordered as I seem to be collecting more and more machines!  I keep my Brother Designio embroidery machine (minus the arm) in one, and my Brother serger in the other.  There's room left over to put a foot, cords, sewing utensils, etc.  May be ordering another one for my Brother sewing machine as it fits inside the case, even with the cover that came with the machine!!!
I purchased this for my brother se 400 sewing and embroidery machine. I was not sure if this would work. I got this and then tried to put the machine in and it fit very nice. I had to leave the machine in this with the embroidery plate off and place that on the side. I have all the stuff in the box that came with the machine. I am very happy this worked for me to keep the machine clean and dust free. I will purchase again as I have two of the machines and need to keep them both protected. If you are looing for a nice way to keep the machine all together then this is for you.
AWESOME!!!!  This is a must have for paper piecing.  It saved me time and mistakes with my quilts tops.  Once several friends saw how well it worked they ordered one too.
Love it for paper piecing!  Use this to guarantee that quarter inch allowance.  Better than the six inche if doing large pieces.
I love this product. I bought the 6&#34; and 12&#34; version and now I wonder how I ever did without it. If you make quilts, this is what you need.
I don't know how I managed without this ruler. It is perfect for adding that annoying seam allowance. I use it just about every time I sew. It is made to set on top of your regular ruler but I usually just line up the groove of this ruler with my line or stitch. It creates a perfectly measured seam allowance everytime and saves so much time.
I love to paper piece and have a little 6 inch ruler, so when I saw the 12 inch add a quarter, I knew I would need it. I might get the 18 incher later, but for now I'm happy.
This is the same as the 12 inch ruler does the exact same thing keeps that quarter inch  looking good and makes using a rotary cuter so easy.  Super idea makes paper piecing a breeze.
High quality, durable rule with a 1/4&#34; lip on the edge that is a standard accessory for any sewing enthusiast. I would highly recommend this for anyone who sews.
Love the soft 'sandy' color that I can use with Beach and Farm projects.  I use it so much I got a second ink pad since I have almost worn out the one I got because I find I can use it so much.  Great color!
It is as described.  I like this ink color, the package was mailed timely, all good things, I have no complaints.
The wife uses this for art journaling and it works great. I would definetely order this again from this company
Wanted a deep red for Christmas home made cards. I was very pleased with the product and would recommend to anyone who is crafty to purchase.
I love this and I use it a lot. It can be used in many ways. I will purchase again when it runs out.
You can rely on a product with this manufacturer.  It is well thought out and delivers.  This color has been very useful.
Tim Holtz has the best quality inks I have found. I have several colors and I love them all. Nice price too.
Fabulous color, perfect for edging and for making something look grungy.
Very Pretty Color!  Love all the Tim Holtz  Inks!
Tim has the best stuff! I used this ink pad last night to stamp "Thank You" on some brown paper sacks that I made to give out at my next craft show and every image was crisp and clean with just enough vintage look to it that a person might think these bags had been around for a long time.
I have most of the Distress Ink pads, and I love them and use them almost every day.This review is about the CLEAR EMBOSSING INK. I never gave it a thought because I thought that it would give a "Distressed" result or something. I went to online forums and brick-and-mortar stores and told them of my embossing woes. No matter what powder I used, what embossing ink, no matter the paper or heat gun, I *always* got bumps, pits, and general uneven embossing. I've always loved the embossing part and how it COULD look. I wanted as close to a glass-like finish as possible and I always got told that it's supposed to be  bumpy and uneven. I refused to accept this, I knew it would be possible, and I would find out how. That's where the scrapbook store came in. I shared with them my plight and that the only way I get what I wanted was using Colorbox pigment ink. My local scrapbook store suggested I try this Distress Clear Embossing Ink, and I did, and I wish I had found out about it earlier. By earlier I mean a year ago. My embossed images no longer have pits and bumps in them. When I use them side by side with the Ranger Inkessentials clear/black embossing pens and I amRanger Inkssentials Embossing Pens, 2-Pack, Black And Clearin embossing heaven.It was SO relieving to know that it was INK that was my problem, not me!
I just love Tim Holtz distress inks. This one is the color of age paper, so if you have anything that you want like it has been here for hundreds of years this is thinking to use.
more gllitter pens.  The more the merrier.
Great art and craft product for young children.  Yes the colors do wash out of clothing,  cleaning table surface was a bigger challenge, best to cover the area with disposable cover.
I've bought these before a few times and the kids I buy them for have been very satisfied. Kid's know what works!
An absolute must for granddaughters and other little people who seek to express themselves creatively. These are washable to correct any errors.
I'd been researching which type of cutting mat I should get.  I decided for a self-healing mat.  I wanted a large one.  I found this one to be a third of the price of what some of these mats goes for at larger retailer.  I didn't notice any foul smells of weird plastic-y chemicals.  It perfect, and now I don't have to worry about ruining my antique dining room table.  I had been using a vinyl table cloth as my cutting surface, but it had some funky lumps in it.  Maybe in the future, I'd invest in another one, just to cover the entire length of my table so I can cut larger lengths without having to move the fabric.
I purchased the Olfa Cutting Mat through my local quilting shop - at the recommendation of the owner, who has pieced countless quilts and advised even more quilters. In her opinion, this was the best mat for the price. And, since we are friends and fellow-business owners, she is someone I trust.The size works well for me (24" x 36"), and I have cut strips / squares for two quilts now using my mat. In spite of the fact that many of the cuts are in the same location, there is no indication of even a scratch on my mat. The size is also great since I have been able to use it in several different locations to cut my fabric - including a store counter.While I know many mats will do the same thing, I have only used this one. And, having both the grids and the inches marked on the one side has made it possible for me to accurately measure my fabric. The other side is unmarked for general cutting.Because of how it has worked for me, I give it five stars.
Just writing a review to get it off my list.  It is what it is and in good quality and heels well
This mat is a great size. I love it. I didn't know cutting fabric could be so much easier with better quality tools like this. I thought my rotary cutting skills were just bad, but it was the tools I was using. Now that I bought this higher quality mat, and a better quality rotary cutter, I am cutting more accurately and with less strain. My previous mat wasn't that old and even though it's another big brand name and claimed to be self healing, it has caused me much frustration. I am so glad I finally bought this. Other buyers mentioned a strong odor and it did have a smell to it for the first few days but it wasn't that terrible and it quickly went away and now I can't smell it at all, even holding my nose to it. I definitely recommend this product over others.
Every quilter should own this cutting mat. I have always trusted the olfa products for quality. This self healing mat will be a part of my sewing supplies for years to come.
I had an old Fiscars mat and rotary cutter, it was so hard to use I actually pulled a muscle in my side. So I ordered a new set, OMG it works like a dream. I highly recommend this mat and Olfa 45mm rotary cutter together
Super size to use for travel, although I haven't used it to travel far away from home. Just across the street to the neighbors house, does that even qualify as traveling?  Ha-HaUsed it for the past 4months and it doesn't even show any wear or tear.Every quilter needs one.Good quality materials used.
This is so wonderful and practical to use.....I simply love it. I do all of My art work on it....I make books by hand for donations!
I had to store this in the garage for about a week to get rid of the smell.  Now that the smell is gone I can say that it works great.  Nice large size and perfect for all my fabric cutting needs.  The company was great about the return policy and explaining the smell.  I didn't have to return it, I just had to be patient (which isn't really in my charater when quilting is concerned.  LOL)  I recommend this product highly.
This is a wonderful product at a great price. This is a must for any quilter! It is a good size for most of your cutting jobs.
perfect
bought one from the local store, thisis a much better price. I now love cutting fabric, its fast and easy with the measured clear ruler and the fiskars cutter, quilting is fun again.***a year later , cannot think about cutting without this mat, just buy it and a roller cutter.
