These &#34;crystals&#34; do not have the beautifully cut facets that cause the gorgeous Swarovski sparkle.  These &#34;crystals&#34; barely sparkle at all.  The metal they are enclosed in is cheap, lightweight metal.  I can't use them in my jewelry.  They really bring down the quality.
This is a cheap product.  The gems on mine were already missing in about 1/8th of the product, and upon use, more fall out.I would not buy again, and would be wary to order from this company.
I wasn't pleased when I received my order. The description on the spacers read 8mm and so I thought that the opening was going to be more open. Once I received my order, I realized that there is only a very tiny hole and only the spacer is 8mm so I was stuck with an item that I did not need :(
Received promptly,The tension was way off- I finally got it reset correctly but it didn't hold.  The housing appears like a used serger not new.  Has black marker on the front.
I didn't find this worked well at all.  Don't waste your money here.  Rulers did not hold place any better with this on it at all.
Alot of waste.  I purchased to make stickers out of cut outs of card stock.  Whenever I use it, there is a lot of waste.  The price of the replacement cartridges are more than I want to spend due to all the waste.
This damn thing arrived broke. The spinning handle was loose. I could have returned it. But due to a recent lose in the family, and funeral, and holidays I couldn't. And now it's too late. I did get some supper glue and screw driver and foot it to work-kinda. Over all. I really wish it had worked we I first got it, and after my touch, it sorta works and it would have been such an awesome thing to have if it fully worked.
I don't think the tool is meant to be like this, I think I just got one that was mangled the tiniest bit. It was unnoticeable in the packaging, and I didn't open the package or use it until the 30 days were past. However, this tools jaws are out of alignment! Very frustrating, as I needed this tiny 1/16&#34; circle punch for very precisely positioned holes at seam-line junctions on quilt piece templates I am making. By the time I get the top of the jaw to align with the bottom of the jaw so it will actually punch a hole, the tool has usually moved a hair away from the &#34;x&#34; where the hole needed to be. This makes the template unusable, as the seam lines I mark on the fabric through these holes, ends up being 1/32&#34; times 100 pieces across a row of the quilt, off! That means over 3 inches out of square, once the row of fabric pieces is sewn. Not going to win any quilting awards with this!
I'm not even sure if I use it right, but it didn't seem to sharpen my scissors, once it even made dull spot on. Either way, it could be a little bit more user friendly.
This case is enormous for an XL2600i.  It is the right length but is so wide that I know it is going to be awkward to transport up and down from the basement which means I now have to find space in our everyday living space to store it.  I had read the reviews before purchasing it, but no one mentioned that there was TOO much space for this sewing machine.  Ugh :(
I attached it to my 45mm rotary cutter and not only did it stick all the time, it did not cut very well; and with type of cut, you want it to cut right the first time, every time. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed.
I am very unhappy with this product, I finally got the material and started to cut the squares for a quilt and the advertisement and packaging stated it can cut through &#34;multiple layers of fabric, paper, felt and vinyl&#34;. Well I tried 3 pieces of thin cotton and it would not cut period, checked blade it is in correct, went to one layer and still have to run blade over the cut several times and it still would not cut through the material, had to finish some cuts with scissors. Not impressed with this expensive piece of junk
It retracts itself sometimes while in use and it likes to let the blade come loose....defeats the purpose of trying to keep crisp clean edges on fabric. Will keep searching for a better version.
I bought this mini iron to use on ribbons for greeting card crafting.  These are the problems I have with it:-The cord is only 56" long and the enclosed directions forbid the use of an extension cord.-The directions also state that this product should be used with an ironing board.  One of the reasons I bought this mini iron was to avoid having to set up the ironing board.  I ignored this particular instruction, and used a cloth napkin on a wooden table as my 'ironing board'--a low wooden table, since the iron's cord is so short.-Even though I let the mini iron heat up for several minutes, it didn't perform efficiently.  My ribbon still had wrinkles after I finished ironing it.  There is no light that goes on when the iron is hot enough, and nothing in the enclosed directions states how long it takes for the iron to heat up to its working temperature.  I would have thought that five minutes should have been more than enough time for this mini iron to reach maximum temperature.My advice to potential buyers:  don't waste your money on this mini crafting iron.
Was very loyal to Fiskars for years.  But recently everything I have bought from them just doesn't work.  It will punch,  but the cuts are not clean.
The items in this kit are very cheap and you won't want to use them.  You're better off buying each needed piece.  The thread and scissors are useless and is the pin cushion.  Don't bother....
The PED card reader is just a card reader that was created by Brother to read/write their own proprietary cards for their sewing machines. The software included is simply a software that you use to transfer pes files onto the cards.Brother is way behind on updating the software for the PED card writer. Not only do they not include Vista with the card writer, the current version and drivers for Vista - available on their Web site - runs on Vista 64, but all instructions and help are designed for Vista 32 and will not work on 64.At the same time, unless your brother has a USB port, this is the only solution to adding new designs to your Brother Machine. Just be sure to download the correct software off of the brother help site at welcome.solutions.brother dot com so that you can use this driver with your computer.So - you have only two choices - buy the brother proprietary card writer or don't write cards to transfer new embroidery files to your sewing machine. [If you haven't purchased one of their sewing machines, you may want to compare prices to see if one with a USB port will serve you better]
I saw a video of how to use this product on Nancy's Notions website. She made it look so easy--just tamp the applicator in the tray that comes with it, rub it over the stencil and there is your sewing line all ready to be quilted. Unfortunately it didn't work that way for me. You have to tamp the pad a lot to get the powder to work its way though the pad and it did not come through evenly even though I tried to shake the powder around to make sure it covered the whole pad. Then after I swiped it over the stencil the line was not very distinct--it had a halo around the lines. The part that really bothered me though was that the line rubbed off before I had it quilted. Just with the movement necessary to move the piece around while stitching caused enough movement to rub the chalk marks off. I don't know if there is a way to make the powder stick to the fabric better. I would not buy this product again.
Be careful, while the machine is quite useful and easy to use, look in your manual and you will see that there is no mention as to the oiling of this particular model. I just thought that somehow it was omitted and emailed them at customer service. They responded 2 weeks later, telling me that you have to take it in to a professional to have it lubricated. That should have been disclosed before I bought it, I would definately not have purchased it. I don't know what the basic charge is for service in your area but mine is $80, this machine is definately a throwaway. I will buy a Singer after this one goes, and it will. My advice-----STAY AWAY, UNLESS YOU DO NOT MIND PAYING FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.
I bought this machine for 144.96 and it arrived next day with my prime shipping. I was super excited. Got it out and yes it is incredibly light, so light I think it would move around the table. way too light! like 9.9lbs to be exact! and its very small. much smaller then any machine I have ever owned! It is computerized it the fact you press a button to lower/raise needle, reverse, and to pick your stitch. that's it. It DOES NOT automatically cut the thread or anything else. the bobbin compartment is very small. Im a small women and have small hands and it was hard to get bobbin out.It comes with default settings for needle to the left, you must change it to the middle by settings 01the tension comes very way off. good tension on it for me was 02It does have a nice variety of stitches thoughFor me, I am an avid sewer and I sew a lot of my childrens clothes, dresses, ruffle pants, shirts, curtains, table cloths, pillows and so on....This machine could not handle all that.Not at all, it to me is definitely not worth $144, maybe $70, it says regular price is $500. NO WAY!!!!!!if you are going to sew more then a curtain or pillow once a year, buy something else.I sent this one back and bought a janome, yes I paid $300 for a janome, but it has tons more features, is heavier, and more well built!
I was overjoyed when I first got the machine Brother CS6 000i). But when I actually started using it, I became disappointed. However, amazon promptly provided free UPS for a return.Although not all of the many different stitches were tried, many of the ones I tried did not hold their consistancy of form. Also, on every stitch I tried after about 3 inches, the thread got messed up.  I tried the trouble shooting solutions given in the book, but became discouraged when that did not work. I have sewn for years and just can't stand a machine that does not work.  Technology is just too good to put out a product that is not pretty close to perfect.Another problem I had was the buttonhole.  I read the directions very carefully and thought I was following them, but the machine refused to feed the fabric. For me, a reliable, easy buttonhole maker is essential. Admittedly, I did not call Brother.  It was just too annoying. Perhaps others have had more success than I.To do the different stitches different feet and codes are required.  To my thinking, there should only be one foot so all you have to do is punch the stitch you want.  Quilting and some other sewing may require special feet, but not changing feet all the time to change the stitch. Brother needs to work on this.Having said all this, I am still looking for a Brother sewing machine, just not one so fancy. And I will buy locally so return (hopefully not) is easier. Amazon is a good place to buy however. I use it all the time.
Received in good time and very easy to set up.  Since I have several years of sewing under my belt, I only wanted something to carry to various places where I cannot carry my larger, computerized machines.  This was a disappointment right out of the box.  Did not sew smoothly - skipped stitches, the needle threader was broken (literally -- piece broken off) and sounded like a tank.  Returned immediately.  Thanks to Amazon for their understanding and great return policy.  I will still keep looking Amazon.
I was largely unimpressed by the Herma Vario Tab Dispenser.Although I think that it would be ok for scrapbooking of for small class projects, the tap is not sticky enough to hold anything that has much weight to it, pictures/paper comes dislodged from the tape somewhat easy, and if you accidentally touch the tape before affixing the item, it's basically useless.  And then if you do use the whole roll its next to impossible to refill.So it largely fails at it's primary job and its tough to reuse - what's to like?
Where do I begin??1. The ad says that this dispenses "double sided spots" of glue. In actuality they are 3/8 squared sections of paper sticky stuff. Not dots, not spots.2. See number one. This makes it very hard to apply and control. I've used a lot of adhesive runners in my time and this one is not great at all.3. Very difficult to get open to refill.4. Best of all IT DOESN'T STICK WORTH A HOOT! I got this to help stick backs to the ATC's I trade. I stuck some yesterday afternoon and this morning they had all separated.5. See number 3. No instructions on how to get it open.
This is a handy way to assemble collages without a gluepot, gluestick or spray. For a recent project, I assembled six fairly intricate pieces using the dispenser. I don't think it's much of a toy (as the questions above suggest). I assume that it's a one-use, non-refillable item which is fine given the low price.
Does not cut a clean heart - ragged/attached paper at the bottom of the heart...The point of the heart IS NOT pointy...May be this particular one, but returned for a refund, not an exchange...
I was flabbergasted at how thin this sheet is. It's basically a plastic sheet of paper. Sure the price is good. Maybe good enough but not for me. I'm not a heavy user and I've been silly careful with anything sharp around it. It's already torn and shows sign of dents and lines. I'm just not big on disposable items. I've also got issues with how easily it slips and slides around. I have to tape it down to make sure it doesn't migrate while I'm using a Gelli plate or anything that involves multiple layers. I just bought a silicone backing sheet which is soooo different. It's thick and doesn't slip. We'll see if it does the Gelli plate, etc. But no more kid gloves to rinse off paint and ink.No more weirding out when I have to cut something nearby.Sure this product does all those wonderful things everyone is talking bout but at what price? It's designed to be disposable.
I had hoped for a lighter color. This is nothing like the color gold I use. Gave it away.Sorry, but would not recommend.
These jump rings turn black from one day to another. they loose the gold plated and turn black very quickly.
I was very disappointed with the contents of this kit. The wire and string included were cheaply made and barely enough to do much.  I wouldn't suggest investing in this product.
I really had high hopes when I ordered Mr Kitty's assortment, but I must say I'm very disappointed in the mix I received.  There were several broken beads and very few matches to be found in the entire bag.  I think I salavaged about 20 items (including earring hooks!) and the rest of the mix is just sitting in a refuse pile waiting for a suitable project.  Considering the cost and what I managed to use, this mix was not a good bargain.  It deserves the same fate as what you'd scoop out of your cat litter box!
I think I see the cause of the problem with this rack. I just noticed when I put this 66 Large Cone/ Spool Thread Rack into my Shopping Cart, what ends up in my cart is NOT this item, but a 60 Cone/ Spool Thread Rack that holds smaller cones (like the 1,000m to 2,000m cones).I have tried to put BOTH of these thread racks into my Cart during the same shopping session, but the only one that shows up is the "60 cone" one.See below for the 60 Cone Rack that goes into the Cart when you WANT to buy the 66 Large Cone Rack:http://www.amazon.com/60-Cone-Spool-Thread-Rack/dp/B000W6YMEW/ref=rsl_mainw_dpl?ie=UTF8&m;=AL9OWV9BXEZKZ
I ordered this because it seemed like it would be helpful and allow me to organize thread. It does do that, BUT, it falls over very easily scattering spools of thread all over. There should be some way to keep it from doing this. I have tried string on both sides hoping this would help solve the problem but it isn't helping.
I thought there would be more to this.  It is just a piece of very light plastic that holds the strings down.  The rest is up to you.  It does come with some cheap string, a fair amount of plastic pony beads, and some plastic toggle ends.  The directions were not that easy to understand.  I had to do some trial and error to figure it out.  I thought this might be fun for my kids, ages 6 and 7, but they'd be reduced to screaming fits of frustration in no time.  I quietly got rid of it without them knowing I ever had it.There's nothing here you couldn't buy more cheaply at the craft/fabric store, and with better quality.  I'm sure there are better instructions to be found online as well.
One of the reasons I'm only giving this set two stars is that you can buy a whole lot of pony beads, needles & floss at the craft store for the same price.  Another reason is that you can find phenomenally better instructions online in 10 minutes or less.  The instructions in this set are pretty incomplete and leave a lot to be desired.  They seem to assume some basic bead weaving skills and knowledge of bead weaving terminology. In my online search for better instructions, I found a plethora of written instructions and videos that got me started.  I also learned that you can make your own bead weaving loom out of a cardboard box, so I would suggest you go to the craft store and skip this set. Finally, I also agree that a set like this seems more appealing to kids age 8 & up.  I don't know what happened here.  I've seen quality products from Ravensburger in the past, but this set let me down.
It did not fit my 4x 4 hoop. Thats my fault. I needed to go to larger 8 x 8. Not sure what I cam do with this one. Maybe save it when I buy the cap hoop??
UPDATE: I originally gave this machine 5 stars, but I no longer can recommend the Cricut Expression. They sued the Sure Cuts A Lot company (Craft Edge)and won, so now you can no longer get the program for your Cricut unless you already had it before the settlement. You are now forced to buy the expensive cartridges and their software which is in no way comparable to the Sure Cuts A Lot program. If you aren't computer savvy and prefer the cartridges, this is the machine for you, but if you are comfortable with computers, this is NOT the machine for you. I just ordered the Silhouette Cameo, which offers their own software for $50 that is very comparable to the Sure Cuts A Lot software AND it can cut 12" x 10ft! I will definitely do an extensive review on that machine once I receive it and play with it a little.Original Review:This is a very nice machine and can cut 12x12(the mat it comes with)or 12x24, which is large enough for anything I need to make. I love that it has the flip feature on the machine. The personal electronic cutter does not. This is useful if you need to flip your words, when making stencils, etc. This one comes with the 2 basic cartridges. So, I think that this is the best deal on the Expression that you can find anywhere, so get it before it's gone. I also wanted to mention that I purchased the Sure Cuts Alot program to use with this machine. It allows you to use ANY image that you can find on the internet. The program costs just a little more than one cartridge and the possibilities are limitless. I hope this helps=)
E1 v E2 v Silhouette Cameo (CCR vs Silhouette Design Studio)I've had my E1 for almost 5 years. I wanted a new machine, my E1 is still functioning well but I wanted a new gadget. The E2 had mixed reviews, smooth cuts, glitchy, problematic and the best machine ever. I'll take my chances.DISCLAIMER: I haven't used my E1 with cartridges in quite some time. I used to load from my gypsy and then when CCR came out, this is all I've done - connected it to my computer and cut away.DISCLAIMER #2: I apologize in advance if this review is too long (skim to the bottom for summary)Initial findings: E2 feels a little heavier/sturdier. I like the little plastic casings that cover the cartridge sockets and the screen. The light is kinda snazzy on the cutter but I don't see that being important for me. The touchscreen is really nice (comes with a stylus that's housed in the door of the machine). I love love love the colored screen.The mat guiding brackets are genius. I'm digging the perfect alignment of feeding my mat into the machine. I used to be a few mm off on E1 - usually not a big deal b/c I gave myself some wiggle room in the layouts. This would have been a useful feature on the Silhouette - thing is a nightmare for mat alignment.CRICUTSYNC - make sure to connect your machine to a computer before using if you are going to connect with CCR - I only found this out after wasting over 20 minutes trying to work in CCR (which was on and logged into before I connected the E2) and kept getting the service error (which results to uninstall/reinstall of the software a zillion times) then I get frustrated and hit up the forums - where one useful writer gave the CricutSync hint. (The "Getting Started" instructions that came with the machine doesn't list this step.) This resulted in over 30 minutes getting the machine recognized with CS and then waiting for the date to upload onto the machine (this took 2 runs as CS died midway through the update and it had to reboot itself to keep at it until it was done). Once the update was done, CCR opened like a dream.How do I get the preinstalled cartridges (Cricut Alphabet and Cricut Essentials) into my CCR acct? One forum responder wrote "They automatically link up, you must first register your machine and after the Thursday update it should show up. If after two weeks have past- after you have registered your E-- then give PC a call... then they can add it in manually!!!" I about lost it on here. Ok, I'm not DYING to use those cartridges since I have some other cuts I can do (but know that if I HAD only those 2 cartridges, I'd send this machine back.TRIAL #1: Let me see if I can go into CCR and see "All Cartridges", not just the ones that I owned and see if it will cut off the preloaded ones...guess what happened? Machine not detected error. Ok - no biggie. I just turned off the machine, plugged it into a different USB port on my computer, turn it back on and see. This worked, and I picked the first object and cut. Great - got it to work, right?Trial run #2: I created a project with 6 - 2" strips. The machine would only cut one strip and stop. What about the other 5 strips you ask? WHAT ABOUT THEM?!?!!? I would hit cut again - nada. The machine apparently could not read the mat. Ok - I unload the mat and reload - still can't read the mat...ok, unload mat, restart machine, still nada, unload mat, restart machine, restart CCR, unplug and replug the machine - I can go on and on about my troubleshooting process - but after an hour+ I about tossed the machine across the room. I have since created each strip onto a separate layer in CCR - and sadly, I can't even cut each layer w/o restarting the machine and the software. It just idles on the "checking mat status screen". 6 strips - seriously, 6 strips, with scallop edges - nothing fancy. The machine can't do it.E1 v E2:I sadly miss the simplicity of my E1. It was user friendly right out of the box. I had a few kinks in working through the "real dial size" but with CCR, that's been no problem. And always, I would just plug in my computer and cut. E2 is just a nightmare to use, and tech support has regular office hours - well, I do my cricut work on none-office hours since I work regular office hours. Sigh.E1/E2 vs Silhouette:I bought the Cameo on a whim last x-mas. I had heard all the buzz about it, and wanted to try it out. Was it any better than my Cricut. At first, NO! You have to buy each cut off their website (if you bought the subscription it's actually not that bad, each design is $1 and if you max out your credit allotment, you get designs at a discounted price). There are some freebies too. I was a little intimidated by the unlimited options. Where do I go, what do I start making....?!?!?! Once I got the hang out of it and had a project lined up, it made it super easy to use and learn.Major differences of the two:Cricut mats are THE BEST! I use these mats in my silhouette - the firmness of the mats prevent it from slipping and sliding (which in the silhouette is THE. MOST. ANNOYING. THING. EVER.) Especially when you're down to 1 sheet of the paper you need to complete a project. Cricut mats are also less expensive than Silhouettes. Both mats are insanely sticky (too sticky) so I rub the mat on my shirt to get some lint - this makes it less sticky, and when it's NOT sticky at all, I'll use a baby wipe to clean it up a little, or use soap/water. When the mat is completely "dead" and I'm too lazy to spritz with some adhesive spray, I use it as a working mat to build my pieces on, and I don't care if I damage the mat. Paint on it, spray glue, hot glue gun, etc.Cricut blades win - the blades are way less expensive - and you get 2 for the price of 1 silhouette blades. Both blades last about the same amount of cuts.Tool kits for both machines blow. "Making Memorie's Kit" is the best! I actually use all of the tools and they're my go to kit for all crafting activities.Cricut's pens are more like markers where Silhouette pens are more like ball point pens. Silhouette has a casing which allows you to use ANY pen you like - which makes this more cost effective if you plan on doing sketch work. Both brands of pens are about the same price - sadly, the pens are not interchangeable between E1 or Silhouette.Silhouettes does NOT require cartridges - which saves a lot of space - which wins - I know Cricut offers digital purchases but I have cartridges prior to that and I can't get rid of them =( Side note: Cricut cartridges have been less expensive to purchase than their digital version. I also like that i can select which cuts I need, the monthly subscription plan is really useful with silhouette - but I would take the time to build a wish list (credits do carry over if unused).Lastly - the most important part for me - their software:CCR vs Silhouette Design StudioSDS wins - hands down - it is by far the EASIEST to use. You don't have to be computer savvy to get the program running - it also does NOT require internet, so design away while on a plane! It allows the user more control over each line/cut. This actually kicks your OCD in overdrive sometimes. If I hadn't already dumped all that money into my Cricut, I'd probably be Silhouette only. The only thing Silhouette is missing - the ability to do layers - in CCR you can create multiple layers for 1 design - which is great so I can sort out which color paper is for what layer, where as silhouette - it's 1 mat and you have to maneuver the designs and just fill in the colors the best you can. My work around is that I put several different "layers" onto the side (off the mat) and just try to piece it together this way. For now, that's the best option until the software gets a major overhaul or update.CCR is so insanely frustrating - at least in the last 2 weeks I've been having "service error" issues and can't log in. I also run on MAC but that shouldn't matter.Pros of Cricut - their cartridges are INSANELY cute. The designs are more flowy and caricature-style and there are more licensed images. This is great if you have kids or work at a school. Trust me, my son's school is insanely stoked of all the little things I've been making for their class.Pros of Silhouette - this machine just feels more "sophisticated" to me. Even when it's cutting, it sounds like a symphony of mini robots making things come to life. There are some whimsical images but they're just NOT as cute as Cricut. This has more intricate cuts as well.Summarize Long Winded Review:Get a Silhouette CameoIf you already have an E1 - keep it - DO NOT GET AN E2 - this is an OBVIOUS DOWNGRADE.
Not sure if is just me or I just don't know for sure how to use this product but I find the adhesive remover to leave more of a mess than I started with.  Didn't care for it at all, however, like I said it probably is the user because the reviews say otherwise.I use glue and tape that I can better take off buy rubbing with my finger or a baby wipe with more luck.  Just my experience.
Maybe this is meant to be used immediately after adhesive is applied to the wrong area but I've not found it to be particularly effective.  I use it to remove chalk instead.
Bobbins difficult to pickup.  Box is too tall. Does not seem to be meant for bobbins. I should have done my homework.  Much better 'Singer' bobbin box  in Walmart for $2.97, with each bobbin in it's own cradle, so it is very easy to pick up the bobbins. It also has a  hinged lid. I paid $3.84.Recommend that you buy the Walmart Singer bobbin box.
I bought this to mark my rulers with as I cut pieces for quilting. The tape popped off several times, and I did not use it after.
I'm pretty disappointed with this ruler. I had the worst time keeping it from sliding during cutting, even with the lip edge. I even added non slip stickers to the back and it still slipped. Maybe I just need to practice with it more, but as expensive as fabric is I've just gone back to using my 24&#34; ruler.Also it is exactly 36&#34; long including the lip edge, which is 1/2&#34; so you can only make a 35 1/2&#34; cut.
Read a review that stated this could be used with a computerized sewing machine. Thought it would be small then.  It is not. Brother did not seem to think it safe either. There are a hundred and one ways to mark a seam line and most all would be safer than this. No need to take a chance with the cost of machines.
When I ordered these mats, I specifically ordered them because they had the green edge, and were not the white edged mats that I have seen lately in some stores.  When I opened the package, I was disappointed to see that the mats were the same white edged ones I had been trying to avoid.  Since I was in a bind, I had to use them anyway, and I am very unhappy with these mats.  There was very little "tackiness" on the mats from the moment I took them out of the package, I could not even get a lightweight piece of scrapbook paper to stick to the mat without shifting around.  My old mat (with the green edge) had been so tacky in the beginning I was able to cut fabric with my cricut without any problem, and this mat will not even hold a piece of paper still.  If provocraft is changing the design of the mats to this, I hope they reconsider.  Like many others, I too have been checking out ways to "re-sticky" the mats, hopefully this will make the mats usable, because as they are right now, they are not.
I've had this for a year. I did realize that all cartridges would need to be purchased in order to cut images. So, I'm not jaded about the value in that respect. But, I did wrongly assume that this software would have basic editing that has been available for the past 20 years! It will not "group" objects which is downright needed when designing your own phases or images. Also, you cannot edit the images much beyond simply resizing them and welding. Oh, and it's really buggy too. You can't edit a copied and pasted image, it freezes at least once every 3 uses, and takes over 5 minutes to load up each time. It is nice for the paper-saving abilities (you can move images around on the virtual mat really close to save paper which I like.) But it is simply not good for anyone wanting to be creative and design things. Sooooo not worth the price... really it should be free with the Cricut machine puchase. If I'd known how primitive it was, I'd only have bought it for about five bucks.
I ordered these in April,2014.  I got a really great group of beads so I ordered 4 more sets.  The second batch were awful.  The colors were pastel and not at all like those pictured or what I had received before.  I'm really disappointed.
I wanted the basic shapes and font on this cart, so paid a lot more than I normally would for one (I usually wait until I can find carts for 20-30 bucks or just go without). This was a huge disappointment. The end caps feature, even after viewing several tutorials online, just does not work right. I know how to do it, but it doesn't cut right. The ends don't line up with the rest of the tag--so dumb! Do they not even test these things?! I also wanted the squares and circles on this cart. There's not point--neither cut well. The squares' corners aren't square at all, and the circles and ovals are always wonky. I talked to Cricut customer service about it and they said the Expression 2 just doesn't cut those very well. What?! That is NOT okay! Now I'm considering getting the Explore just because it's supposed to cut well. I shouldn't have to spend more money on another machine to do what the machine I have and carts are supposed to do in the first place! SO irritating! This is an older cartridge, so hopefully they're improving them as they go, but seriously, I'm very irritated that I splurged on this cartridge that's not much more than basics, and it doesn't even work right. I'm also really irritated that I splurged on the E2 when it clearly wasn't built to do what it's designed for! Grrr.
This mat is 23x35 It also has has the markings in the wrong place.I will be returning and ordering a different one
Revised Review: Don't buy it unless you plan on using the entire bottle in one craft project in one go. I tried this glue and it seemed to hold well and dry clear.  So, based on other reviews, I gave it 5 stars.  After opening the product, using same and genuine experience - I am very disappointed.  I opened the bottle, kept it capped  and now have a solid dried wad of hard glue in the bottle rendering this product unusable.  I am very disappointed.Original Review: Honestly I am basing this review on but one experience to date and mainly on the great reviews of others. My single use was entirely satisfactory.  I became a paper crafter just over a year ago. Since then I have suffered bouts of "underwhelm" and "down right disappointment" with several types of adhesives. I began an odyssey of adhesive discovery several months ago.  It will be in progress for some time.  As a crafter I want my art to last.  The thought of giving someone a home made card that falls apart does not appeal.  Nor do I want to create home decor or a scrapbook layout which separates within a year or so.I bought Beacon 3-in-1 Advanced Craft Glue based on its good reviews.  I am entirely happy with its clear dry and fast tack abilities.  It claims to be acid-free so it is safe with my papers and photographs.  Many reviewers with more adhesive experience give this Beacon product high compliments. I can't but do likewise for lack of contradictory evidence.
I returned this item. I was unable to get the pegs to stay in. The wire was difficult to move around the pegs. It was not as easy and enjoyable as reviews made it seem.
The jaws are not nylon they are plastic and slip a lot. I wouldn't recommend it because it is not the right thing.
This would probably be okay for someone who doesn't plan to use it often, but for everyone else, skip it.  Mine literally fell apart.  I used it a lot and it didn't hold up to my rough handling.  The nylon heads came off.  The handle covers also slid off.
The software I received will not allow more than 5 SAVES unless you are hooked up to the Pazzles and the machine is turned ON.I bought this because it would allow me to create my own projects for cut outs. I create projects that require lots of steps and so I need to save what I have done as I go step by step as many at 25-100 steps. I must turn the Pazzles on to save my work after 5 SAVES.  If  I'm going to work in the dinning room I have to drag the Pazzles into the dinning room from my craft room plug it into the power outlet and into my laptop to save the 25-100 steps in just one project, I may do 1-3 projects a sitting.We travel a lot. On flights lasting 6-12 hours it would be nice to work on creating Pazzle projects on my laptop. NO CAN DO takes more than 5 SAVES. If I wanted to work on projects once I arrived at destination I would have had to pack up the Pazzles in it's shipping box, paid the airline $60.00 round trip to check it in as baggage (it's too big for under the seat in front of me, too big for the baggage area over head). Who want's to drag this machine all over the world just to SAVE invested time and created projects using their (paid for) Pazzles software on the computer?This is bizarre, what are these people thinking?  What are they afraid of? I pay a big price for the machine it comes with software. I'd like to be able to use that software without the Pazzles machine in my hip pocket.Now, I'm told Pazzles has developed new software that for another $100.00 will allow me to make numerous saves without the machine hooked up to my computer and turned on. Of course that's on top of the $400.00+ I already paid for the Pazzles, software in the box, manual, mat, (1) cutter blade and blade holder.I ordered a perfectly NEW machine. However, bits of red vinyl on the dull blade, holder and machine indicated to me that the machine had been USED before.  I couldn't return it at the time I found this red vinyl on the bottom of the blade holder and on the cutter because, when it was finally delivered to my home I had departed on a lengthy trip. Once I returned and had time to open the box and set up the Pazzles the allowed time had passed for returning the machine.I gave them benefit of the doubt....maybe they test these machine before boxing them.  On their Pazzles site I asked this question, "Do you test the machines?" and explained what I had found. .  . .  NEVER RECEIVED AN ANSWER!I've had occasion to talk with customer service at Pazzles. I received unwarranted abrupt, curt answers. Not a pleasant experience.If you plan to do your own designs and you wish to save your work as you go without the Pazzles in your hip pocket you will have to pay another $100.00 for that expected and necessary capability.  If you intend to make your own designs and they are intricate I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND that you buy this machine. It's good at cutting big round curves (it gets 2 stars for that) and .........forget about clean angles.If you go with the machine I suggest you order two extra blades and a extra mat when you place the order for the Pazzles! You're going to need them after running through  the projects in their manual and trying different media to get an understanding of how the Pazzles works with the media you intend to use.Sedonartist
This is a better than nothing product, but a really cheap product, as in cheap quality. The entire thing is plastic and very light weight. The tall thread stand is also plastic and can bend with the thread, which isn't a good thing.There's a tiny screw in the base that you have to unscrew before sticking in the plastic pole, then you have to tighten the screw to keep the pole in place. The screw has a square head rather than a normal screw head, and it's so tiny, none of our screwdriver tips would fit it.. When that failed, I tried an allen wrench, also would not work. My husband kept trying different screwdrivers, nothing would work. We finally found a very tiny flat head screwdriver that was able to turn the screw.. 45 minutes later, I finally had the thing assembled. If it weren't for that screw, it would have gone together in a few minutes.I bought this for my spare sewing machine. My other machine has a cone thread holder with a metal pole, which is MUCH better... If I had to do it again, I would spend the extra for a good cone thread holder... As I said, this is a better than nothing product, but honestly, I think Dritz probably spent more on the packaging of this product than the product itself...
This seemed like a good idea when I purchased it BUT it is very light and moves around when sewing. I'm not able to use it. Usually items from Dritz are very good, but this isn't one of  them.
This is basically plastic and though it works for minor use I would not recommend it for heavy use. Dritz makes a heavy duty one, go the extra mile and get it.
I am not thrilled with this sharpener. Now, I do not expect any sharpener to put a brand new edge on a pair of old scissors but  I had hoped to put a decent enough edge back on my favorite scissors that I use for sewing as I cannot find the scissors to buy a new pair anymore. :( That being said this did an OK job on part of my scissors. This put a usable edge on the scissors from about the middle to the end...however...the closer you get to the handle the less of a decent job it does. Unfortunately, the most common spot for beginning a cut is closer to the handle end of the blades...not the tips. It made that part of the scissors worse and it just wadded and frayed the fabric when I tried to cut. I tried several pair of scissors all with similar results. Paper scissors performed better than fabric scissors...but paper is easier to cut. In addition to the lack of sharpening performance, it is also quite flimsy. There are little metal rods that run vertically on the side of the sharpening rods...I am not clear on their purpose (my guess is for the scissor blades to hit rather than the plastic)...but after my second pair of scissors those two rods came loose and now flop into the openings where you put the blades to be sharpened. You can pop off the orange part (made so you can replace the guts I assume), open it up, and re position all the little parts...but I'm sorry...what a pain! And just not worth it to me...I'd rather buy a new pair of scissors since they are relatively inexpensive!
For the price, this Bead Design Beading Board - Gray Flock with Lid 9x12 Inches is really a disappointment.  I just expected a more solid product than a cheap piece of plastic, with a cheap piece of plastic for the lid. Meh!
I had worked with the tool once;  These  tools are so cheap; bent first time use.  I do not recommend for the hobbyist daily's.
Unfortunately I didn't use this for about a month so when I realized it doesn't rotate well (the top & bottom do t stay connected so every time you turn it, you have to re-match them up), it was too late to send it back. Waste of money, IMHO.
I purchased this so that I didn't have to change up my sewing machine to run a bobbin while sewing.This thing is cheap and the winding is not strong enough.  I have had to re-wind several of the bobbins on my sewing machine.It is not worth the time and hit and miss.  This is taking up a lot more time than it was worth.Not worth the purchase.  Just take you time and wind bobbins on your sewing machine.
I was excited to try these out after watching a few tutorials with persons using them and obtaining great results.However, these are way too &#34;watery&#34; and they ink quite unevenly, leaving &#34;bubble like&#34; effects and spaces, some colours when placed on the paper looks like a child's first piece of art work.Maybe just my experience but unfortunately I can't rate this a 5 star.
I am not sure why I bought this. You can achieve corners with another pointy object. My money would have been better spent on another seam ripper.
Maybe I am missing something, but I have not managed to use this &#34;thang&#34; successfully.  I keep it by my machine because its name makes me smile.
I bought this item direct from the seller and received it quickly. I understand that it has many uses and is a great little invention but several dollars for a thin rod of flimsy plastic? A bit too much for what it is, I think. I'll continue to use it but am a little peeved about the cost for what you get.
I would not purchase this item.  Save your money for a new set of clear plates as they will wear out.  I prefer to use a thin sheet of chipboard to my 'sandwich' to add the texture of the die to my paper.
Careful using this. I ruined a whole quilt because the seam allowance is a 1/4&#34; rather than a scant 1/4&#34;. If you're hoping you can just zone out and sew, think again. The fabric can easily slip under the edge guide making an even larger seam. I now use mole skin cut and positioned at a scant 1/4&#34; as a guide. I've also seen people use rubber bands. Then I don't even have to worry about lining the fabric up with the presser foot. I just butt it up against the edge of the mole skin and, yes, I can zone out and sew and have a perfect seam every time.
I bought this foot from my Brother dealer because I thought the "guide" part would be helpful. It is not helpful and gets in the way. If you are piecing thicker fabrics or need to sew a quarter-inch on something other than a seam, such as sewing a ribbon on a garment, the guide gets caught. I prefer this same foot WITHOUT the guide. Or better yet, just use your standard  foot (mine is J) and move your needle position over so you have your quarter-inch line up with the side of the foot. That way no more breaking needles as apparently we all have done. If I leave my quarter-inch foot on my machine, I have stuck a post-it note on my machine that reads "MOVE NEEDLE POSITION". I mostly use the J foot without worries of breaking needles.
I should have spent the little bit of extra money and bought the metal foot the first time around.  This plastic foot makes it very hard to see where your quilting is going when doing FMQ.
Edges are sharp so be careful. Not a great purchase for me. A larger tool may have worked better for me.
I was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I received this bone folder and it DID NOT COME with the case!  In my opinion, this is FALSE ADVERTISING!  If I thought I was only going to receive the &#34;bone folder&#34; I would have spent less money and purchased the Martha Stewart Bone Folder under a different listing, for less money, that ONLY SHOWED THE BONE FOLDER.Amazon....you should NOT let Martha Stewart get away with this!  Everyone who purchased under this listing should be sent the cover to the bone folder!!!!  Or...you should change the picture immediately and you should change the listing to read, &#34;DOES NOT COME WITH BONE COVER&#34;...PLEASE...DO NOT CONTINUE TO MISLEAD ANY MORE CUSTOMERS!  IT IS NOT NICE!
The thread stitches out fine. It breaks no more or less than most other threads I have purchased on Amazon. The spools on the other hand are poorly wound and there were tails everywhere in the box when I opened it. A few of the spools were cardboard which I haven't found to be a problem. A number of the spools actually have three or more ends sticking out and it's just a mess. The price was not so good that I would order them again and the colors were marginal. Not a repeat purchase item.
The price seemed right but the quality is very poor.  Easily breaks and threads separate.  Hard to find beginning of thread also.  I had trouble with the tension on my machine until I switched to a better quality thread.
Do not purchase if you have a LB6800-PRW ... the description of the article says it will fit but it des not, the correct hoop for the LB6800-PRW is SA432
This net is a good idea, but it does not work. The problem is that the net is not tight enough, especially towards the end of the spool. So this did not work as well as I hoped.However, I found a solution that does work that I would like to share with you in case you will find it as effective as I do. I found a better solution by using small piece of scotch tape to keep the tail of the thread attached to the spool. Scotch tape leaves no residue and I use the same piece of tape over and over again on each spool. In fact it gets better the more you use as it becomes less tacky. It is much neater, faster, not to mention cheaper way of keeping threads in check. It works equally well on full and almost empty spools, regardless of size. I am attaching an image of one of the spools with the scotch tape holder.Ali Julia review
I ordered two of these because the image showed cup handle slots on both sides but when I got them there is only one slot on one side.  Which means if you put the scrap-Ma-Bob on your right side (if you are right handed) the cup handle slot is on the opposite side of the holder.  So, to have the cup handle accessible you have to put the scrap-ma-bob on your left thereby making you have to grab your drink with your left hand or reach over yourself to get your drink.  I wish I would have gotten the item that was pictured.  Kindof dishonest in their marketing of this item.
Based on the photo, I was hoping that these ear nuts would be identical to a pair that I already have that came with the purchase of a favorite pair of earrings.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  These are considerably smaller and not as easy to grasp.  The rubber also seems to be of a lesser quality and frays/tears quite easily.  I do like the shape, which is just like my favorites...only smaller.  For me, the shape makes it easier to tell where the hole is when you're having to go only "by feel" (one of the many times that it would be convenient to have eyes in the back of your head).I would have given a lower rating; but the price is so low for the large quantity that I really can't complain a great deal.  I'll continue looking for the "right" ones and will probably give these away to a jewelry-maker friend.
Not exactly as pictured. A lot of the safety backs were deformed and not well cut out. Not that much easier to use than other styles. I would not recommend this product but would recommend trying the cylinder shaped safety backs.
much smaller than the picture and doesn't really eliminate the static for embossing
I heard and saw a lot of good things about this tool, so I decided to pick one up. The one I got does not cut perfect corners, and I have to &#34;chomp&#34; it 5 or 6 times for it to go all the way though a normal piece of chipboard; and even more surprisingly it does this on a single piece of cardstock as well. Only 1 time out of 10 does it chomp on the first try. It's the same for both sides. I bought this tool because I've started a new venture of hand making the best journals possible. I wanted to be able to get round corners quickly with chipboard and maybe 3 pieces of paper at one time. I thought it was user error at first, but it's not. I really wish it was user error.You know what I'm using now? A Martha Stewart corner rounder punch. I've had it for about a year and a half and it still rounds corners as well as it did when I first got it; I've punched (approximately) 1,300 corners since July (same number of pages throughout the notebooks/journals I've been making). I still have to wrestle with this Crop-A-Dile to cut chipboard.
I am not happy with this crimp bead covers at all. The covers are wedged together in the bag they were shipped in, which is aggravating when you are working, to stop and pry them apart. The worst part is they do not close together smoothly, which has to do withe the finishing on the edges of the covers. The edges aren't smooth, so the 'bead' the cover becomes isn't smooth.
No matter how carefully I try to use them the silver chips off almost immediately...I haven't had any luck with any of the covers I've tried to use. They are made well shape and size wise, but I couldn't use any of them. I wouldn't get these again.
I like the concept, but the scissor tip (what you need for embroidery) was dull within 4 weeks, and I had to end up buying a dofferent pair of scissors.
Never could get the "hang" on how to really how to pick up the fabric for this foot.  I will work on it later since I have had the SE400 repaired and it works better.  Just wouldn't buy the machine.
The Ecrafty set of bead caps is a wonderful product, but this set was just the smallest of spacers with no variety or style to them.  Sure, I got a ton but nothing special in the set.  I'd recommend their bead cap collection over this anyday.  These, for the price, could be attained at Michaels for maybe two 2.99 packages.  Not cool.
One word, SMALL.  I don't know why they always measure in MMs.  I think it is so they can show a picture that makes them look large and then send out tiny beads.You wanted 30 words you got them.
I own punches by three different manufacturers: Martha Stewart, EK, and Fiskars. I thought they would be pretty much the same, I was picking based on the design or sale price. Well, turns out who makes the punch does make a difference.Fiskars is a very heavy duty punch, it handles different thickness of paper flawlessly, I don't think I ever had it jam.EK is a little lighter than Fiskars, it works on with no problems on light paper, but occasionally jams on heavier paper.Martha Stewart punch is very light, feels very flimsy, and jams pretty often.I think there are two flaws in the design of this punch: (1) It is very light, I found heavier punches work better especially on the heavy paper. (2) This punch has a handle on which you press in order to cut. The long handle might look attractive, but the punch works better if you press right on top of where the blade is located as in CK an Fiskars designs.Martha Stewart punch like most punches has a guidelines which help you make continuous design cut. The cutting blade is 2 1/8 inches long. The guide is 5 2/8 inches long.I am attaching a collage of two photos under customer photos for reference. Photo #1 shows the well cut edge on top, and the one where the cutting guide is not used correctly. Photo #2 shows how the guide works.In order to get a continuous cut you need to align the top of the paper with the top of the punch, and then align the edge of the cut with the drawing on the guide. It is also important to know where the blade ends within the punch itself. Notice that on my punch I marked the start and the end of the blade on the side of the punch by drawing two lines in pencil (best seen in photo #1) . This helps me to know how much to the left I need to move the paper if I want to avoid uncut areas in the middle of my design.I bought several Martha Steward punches at a local Michael's craft store when they on sale under $10, but I will not be buying this brand again even if I see another sale. I can't recommend it.Ali Julia review
I like to hit the floor running with new items.  I should not have to be stumped regarding ---how the heck am I supposed to use this.....?  I have yet to take the time to figure it out.
These bobbins do not appear to be high quality.  Also, they are too small to fit the bobbin winder on my Janome Horizon, nor do they fit on the bobbin winder of the Brother Innovis 1500D, despite the fact that both of these machines use this kind of bobbin.  However, I was able to fit one of the bobbins onto the bobbin winder of my old Bernina 1090, despite the fact that this machine uses metal bobbins.  Once I wound the bobbin on the Bernina, I was able to use it in the Horizon with no difficulty. So, if you happen to have a machine with a bobbin-winding spindle that will fit these bobbins, you should be all right.  If not, you will be unable to use them.  Buyer beware!
it is very hard to squeeze the pen. and when you manage to do it, it is to much glue.
I am afraid the beads are not as bright,colorful as pictured and just dull colors like browns.I'm afraid i could of bought beads like this at walmart. I thought they would look like their pictured.
I had to use my wire to push and twist inside the holes to finish them.  One of the beads broke when I was doing this.  The shapes are varying as expected but some look like they didn't form right.  You will have to use a very thin wire --- 22 gauge at minimum to get through the holes.  I would not recommend this product.
I have another pair of titanium scissors (different brand) that I really like so I thought I'd love another pair. Well, not this pair.They're alright, they cut and that's the purpose.  They don't glide through paper, they are a bit difficult to open and close, they kind of "stick" like the inside of the blade is rough.  I used my sharpener on them, I don't know if you're supposed to do that or not but I figured it really wouldn't make them worse.  Well, it did not make them worse but it did not make them better, either.I'm right handed and the scissors also hurt my hand.  I don't have arthritis or anything but it just feels uncomfortable to use for a second and if you use them to cut anything for more than a minute or two it just plain hurts! If you're looking for this kind of scissor try theScotch Precision Ultra Edge Non-Stick Scissor, 8-Inch, Brown with Assorted Accent Colors (Dot Color Will Vary) (1468TUNS-MIX)
Can only cut at one facing.  If I cut on the other facing, it is completely blunt.  Would not recommend to anyone.  Quality is bad.
Well, as other reviewers have stated, the instructions are completely wrong. It's like they aren't even written for this product. I suggest that you go to the Avery site and download the correct instructions for this product. I'm giving this 2 start because most people would not think to look at the reviews to get the correct instructions, they would simply do as I did and attempt the instructions that came with the product. That won't work at all. If you follow the correct instructions from the Avery site, you'll have a nice outcome with a pretty nice transfer. It comes out pretty soft and bright, not sticky like some transfers I've used in the past. I've washed the shirt I made a few times inside out, and it still looks almost like it did right after I made it.
I always have a few packets of t-shirt transfers and some new t-shirts for impromptu projects.  I mainly use these to entertain kids (making team 1 & team 2 items), to add to a theme event (bridal shower toss pillow covers) or other random temporary projects.As with most print-yourself iron-on transfers, the background is slightly shiny and non-stretchable and fades after several vigorous washings.  The item must be removed and lightly rinsed again by hand to avoid colour/print transfer to another part of the t-shirt.  In other words, don't leave the printed shirt sitting wet too long in the machine after washing.  As with items in this genre, this is purely a temporary, "in the moment," item.  For something that lasts, I would recommend using the many professional printing services both online and brick & mortar.My one major complaint is that the instructions are incorrect.  (Avery put the instructions for a different product in the packing).  Do not peel the transfer off the backing before printing.
Chances are that if you could read the directions before buying this product, you wouldn't buy it.  It is typical of most home-made iron on transfer sheets, only smaller.The first thing that struck me about the instructions is where they say DO NOT USE AN IRONING BOARD to transfer the image. They suggest putting a pillow case on a hard flat surface such as a table, instead of an ironing board. But don't use a glass surface, granite, concrete, or heat sensitive surfaces either.The next bummer is having to forever wash the garment in cold after the transfer is ironed on, because the colors may run. Most ink jet printers don't use permanent ink in their cartridges. The inks are typically water-based, so whatever you print onto the transfer is likely to run when wet. The garment must also be dried on the "low" setting, presumably to prevent the adhesive from heating up and coming undone completely.It concerns me that they recommend ironing the transfer on in a "well ventilated" room. Are there toxic fumes coming off this thing when it gets hot? They don't say.They recommend your design have rounded edges, or no sharp corners, since those parts are likely to lose their adhesion and start peeling.I have found that most iron-on transfer sheets have the same problems as mentioned above, which renders them pretty much useless.
I bought this set as part of the gifts we are giving to a family we adopted this Christmas. The little girl had asked for art supplies and I thought this looked wonderful. I would have loved having all my crayons and paints in a little wooden case, when I was a girl.In reality this is cheap Chinese junk and I won't be giving it to her. The water color paints were cracked and broken in their wells, the markers are half dried out, the crayons are fragile and waxy, and the wood on the box is rough and splintery. The pastels seemed to be of decent quality, but I didn't try drawing with one. I didn't expect professional quality for $24.99, but I did expect it to be decent.If you're looking for an art set for your child, skip this one and either spend a little more or go find one in a hobby shop so you can see it in person. Very disappointed!
This arrived today, have not tried the hoops yet but tried the thread. Number 206 jammed up my embroidery machine: then the stitch was't tight and messed up my design. I hope the hoops are descent . The thread is poly star  , never heard of it
Sending it back to Amazon! It took be twenty minutes to be able to feed my bias tape through the cone thing and out the other end. By the time I got it through, the edges were all frayed.  Once it is in the cone, it was really difficult the get it correctly placed on the fabric to sew.  I got so frustrated with it that I took it off and sewed my bias tape on with a regular presser foot.  I have ordered a different one and it has a plastic guide, not a metal cone for feeding the bias. Much easier to use. Very dissappointed in this foot.
I make a lot of thank you cards for gifts that I receive and I was excited to buy this punch. I have quite a few of the Martha Stewart punches and I like them just fine. This one does not punch like the others. I don't know if I can explain this properly, but the other punches have the shape of the punch that it punches thru. For example, the flower punch, it has the metal piece that punches the paper and a flower shaped hole for the metal flower to go all the way thru. The "thank you" punch does not have the hole in the bottom, it is just a flat piece of metal. So it would be like you have a metal shape and you press it on the table.The "thank you" punch does punch out the words and the flower, but it isn't clean, I used cardstock. You also have to use a lot of force to punch the words, and once you punch the words, the punch messes up the outer paper, so you can't use the negative part for anything. If you don't punch it enough, which you won't know unless you take the paper out and by then you have ruined the whole area where it was punching because it will punch the outer part of the "thank you".This punch will do the job, but there has to be a better punch out there. I was going to buy the "happy birthday" punch, but I won't now. I think for now, I will just stick to my cricut.
I wasn't impressed with this product. It kept tangling while I was winding it. It didnt do well on my projects. It may be ok if it would work but im not impressed with it.
This is an edit of my 1st review. Though the foot fit my machine perfectly & worked very well, the plastic part on the side where you screw it onto the machine broke off AFTER 37 DAYS & LITTLE USE! I was thankfully able to return it for a partial refund & ordered a Brother foot that is ALL metal. I will never buy a foot with plastic again!
I love variegated threads, so I couldn't resist getting these to go with my new PE500.  I had done two projects with the included brother thread with no breakages and no problems. So I know the machine,  the fabric, and my threading techniques were not an issue. Then I started a project with this thread, and in sewing two butterflies, the thread must have broken 20 times or more.  Ruining the project, wasting the stabilizer, fabric, etc, and my time.  So I am pretty unhappy with this purchase.
Wow!  Talk about a product that could have been awesome.We got this expecting it to replace, or at least compliment, an existing Cricut machine.  We spent literally hours trying to make it work how it was supposed to - with mixed results.For example, it generally works fine if we feed each sheet of card stock directly from the front; but not always.  I'm not sure why, but it is much more prone to jam up in this mode when printing from the computer software.  (It's probably just because the fonts have more detail.)When feeding from the paper tray, we found it almost impossible to make it work.  We tried everything and could only get it to catch onto the paper every once in a while - and only with extreme interference.  The funny thing is, even when it did grab a sheet of card stock out of the paper tray, it would just feed it out the front and then say "Paper Jam"...I'm not kidding when I say we spent hours working with this thing.  The problem is that it just seemed so cool that we didn't want to give up.We tried contacting support, but got no response - so we finally just gave up...Honestly, the only reason I'm even giving this little machine 2 stars is because of the potential.  I just really wish it had worked for us!
As other reviewers have stated, this is a good idea that falls short.Imagine how easy it is to just stamp over addresses or account numbers while sorting through your mail. The stamp area is a little small but I believe there are two different sizes. This size covers a basic address label with a set of unreadable symbols and letters. The idea is that it covers your valuable information and makes it unreadable.The problem is that the ink is not indelible. It CAN be erased with an alcohol wipe or a lens cleaner OR with a simple pencil eraser. And it comes off easily! Not with a lot of hard work, not with a a big loss to the information underneath but fairly quickly and without a struggle.Because of this, I think this stamp offers very little security. It is probably better than just putting your mail in the garbage since it requires someone to take an additional step but for important documents with personal ID information, shredding or burning is the only fail safe way to go. Perhaps having the stamp on a paper might give that document even more importance and would cause someone to pick it out of a pile.Potentially a good idea, but not good enough.
I'll admit when I first tried this machine I hadn't used one since junior high, but unless you're a pro at figuring out the correct tension, you'll hate this machine. Even once I got the tension adjusted and sewed a nice seam, the very next seam would be all loopy on the back side....this is on the same fabric with no settings changed. Explain that lol. Anyways, I found that I was ripping out seams nearly every other seam so I returned it. I ended up purchasing a very nice Janome and now I've finished 3 quilts already with no problem. You really do get what you pay for. I'm giving it two stars because for an inexpensive machine, this has a pretty decent embroidery unit.
I was somewhat disappointed with this machine.  I have had it in the machine for 3 months.  The repairman had to order parts from Japan, but it works well now; thankfully, it was under warranty when all this was done to it.  Warrranty is out now, but it still works pretty well.  Would NOT recommend this machine to anyone.
I am not sure if this pen was old stock or if it just is not very good quality. Whatever the reason, even though I carefully closed the top after each use, it dried up within just a few uses. I would not buy it again.
These are very prone to falling apart and drying out. If you are the type to sit things on a desk and have any bits of clutter that may knock it over then you may not want this. They do not connect securely and tend to snap apart easily. I had them in a drawer for a day and the next it was in half exposing one of the pads. Now I keep it on a shelf as a display more than a serious craft supply.
Right out of the package I noticed that the edge guide was bent.  After straightening the edge guide, I tested the accuracy and seam allowance, I saw that the edge guide spring action was too loose. That was adjusted by slightly pinching edge guide. I rechecked the seam allowance on several pieces of material and it now works fine.  Distinctive needs to Q/A this product. Sorry I can not recommend this one yet until they fine tune it a bit. I am in the middle between &#34;don't like it&#34; and &#34;its okay&#34;.
well is not working very well,like i was expecting...i am dissapointed about the product. I will not recomended to any one, sorry , but this how i think.
I bought these immediately when I bought my embroidery machine.  I expected a lot from a Ginghers product and it just did not deliver.  I could not get a close cut when trimming the lead end of the thread or jump stitches.  I ended up returning them and getting a pair of Hemingworth Flexi Snips Rainbow instead.  The Rainbows do exactly what I need for about half the price.
I first wrote a glowing 5 star feedback for this machine, but within 3 months, I was fit to be tied with this machine. I sew for a living and have been sewing for over 40 years, so I know sewing machines and can normally figure out a problem and resolve the issue. However, with this machine, I started experiencing so many problems, there was no solution.. I've listed some of the problems below.. However, I want to give a thumbs up to Amazon, because when I contacted them to tell them of all the problems I've experienced, they told me they would make an exception to the 30 day return policy and will accept this return. Thank you Amazon!3 MONTHS LATER: I am so dissapointed in this machine. After a month of use, it started having little problems here and there. Nothing I couldn't live with, but within a few more weeks, it just started having major problems. I have continual bobbin tangling, even though I use good quality thread, needles and the correct bobbins. I have a mess of thread at pretty much every new seam..looks horrible and there doesn't seem to be any reason for it. The thread somehow slips out of thread station #5 often, which then creates a mass of tangled, messy stitches on whatever I'm sewing. The thread station located just before the needle also comes unthreaded all the time for no apparent reason. The self threading needle worked until the first time I changed the needle, and now the self threader will no longer line up with the eye of the needle. I've tried readjusting the needle, changing to other brands, tried the replacement needles that came with the machine, nothing will now line up with the threader.. The pressure foot peddle pops off at any given time, usually while I'm sewing. I've NEVER had a machine do that before. The zig zag stitches and decorative stitches are never consistant. I started writing down the perfect settings for each stitch so I would always know exactly where to set the machine for each stitch. It doesn't matter because the stitches are never the same! Sometimes they're loose and large, sometimes tight, sometimes just a mangle messed that destroys whatever I'm sewing on... The machine "eats" my fabric every now and again, which means I have to ease the fabric out of the feeder plate carefully in order to save the fabric. The stitching occassionally just starts puckering or is so loose it starts gathering. The thread cutter is already very dull and it's like sawing the thread to get it to cut.This machine may have metal guts, but the mechanics of it do not work correctly. I was looking for a machine to last years and years, and this is not that machine. When are these sewing machine company's going to get a clue and stop producing these machines made from the cheapest parts available and start building quality machines that are built to last?? I'm about ready to get out my 1954 Brother Sewing Machine and say good riddence to these newer machines once and for all!
It arrived on time and is stable. The problem is that it has a tough time with thicker fabrics. The feeds have a tendency to pull faster than the needle comes up and down on jean or canvas material. This causes the needle to break. (first singer machine-not impressed)
I purchased these pins (2 boxes of the 300 count). I started pin basting my queen size quilt in preparation for quilting and found many pin heads in the box with no body attached to it. The body of the pin was not in the box either so they didn't come loose. Poor quality control in making sure what is being put in the box is a whole pin and not just a pin head.Next I found that many of the pins were dull and would not penetrate the quilt &#34;sandwich&#34;. It wasn't a fabric issue since when I switched out the pin for another one it worked fine.Since I had 2 boxes I was able to find enough pins between the two boxes to complete the basting of the quilt. However, I cannot recommend this product. I actually expected a better quality product since Dritz is well known.
I bought this a few months ago, read the directions, put it together and used it. My bags turned out great, I was very impressed with how smooth and even it stamped. I did think the look was kind of plain having so much detail in the stamp but the way the system works you can only ink one color at a time. I used all black, which was what came with the stamper. I thought that could be fixed easy enough by buying more colors and perhaps figure out a way to put some different colors into it.I proceeded to throw the directions away, I thought it was basic enough that I wouldn't need to keep them. I bought a pink inker, and thought I could make some crafts. I got the stamper out again, and started to take it apart to put the stamp around the wheel, it was so hard to use, I ended up hurting both of my thumbs, jamming one so hard that it broke a nail. I am 40 years old, I don't have arthritis and I have used this stamper before, so I knew how it worked, so I am not real sure why it was so hard to get apart the second time. Anyway, I proceeded to stamp. I don't know what I did wrong, but my stamp was lumpy and not even at all. I like the look of the stamp but I decided it would be better used on a block and I can color the different images with ink to make it more than one color.I'm giving it 2 stars, it was ok when I used it the first time. I wish I would have saved the directions, but it really shouldn't be that hard. You pop the stamping roll out of the holder, which is where I hurt my thumbs, then you pull the orange pins out, that opens the stamping roll so that you can place the stamp around the base. Somehow I did not put the stamp on smooth, so where the stamping roll opens, it stretches the stamp so it isn't round like the rest of the stamp, which then leaves a void.Anyway, if you want a continuous stamp that can stamp the same color over and over, keep the directions and have a great time. If you are looking for something that will give color and dimension, grab a block, a flat stamp and some ink pens.
So, this is huge, very cumbersome to use when trying to get down smaller more detailed things. I'm not talking tiny, I'm talking ends of a standard card, etc. The other problem I have is that the roll tends to slip and be right on the edge of the glider which is a pain since I have re thread the tape somewhat frequently. I did not give one star simply because this stuff is sticky! Yay for being sticky, just wish it was a little easier to use.
I don't know why these mats are not as sticky as the other mats.  These mats are not even as sticky as the glue on the back of a memo sticky note.
Broke shortly after use.  One of the gears broke - not my fault.  Not covered by warranty. I now have to take it apart, put the gear back on and reassemble in order to use it.
i have a couple of martha's punches, but these large ones are so difficult to use!  this one is very intricate, but impossible to get a clean punch - you have to exert so much pressure!  not useful.
These bead are the color of turquoise, but they do not look like the picture.  I was not happy with these beads.
These are nice beads, but they are a very light pink.  Rose Quartz should be a darker color.  I would not recommend them.
I had to return this kit as it appeared to have been sent before and things were missing.  I am confident it would have given good results otherwise.
I ordered these pens thinking they were glazed pens as it states, but when I received my order, they were the 10 pack 3d colors basic set (as it states in the description).  The Micron pack, as I notice now, only have 8.  The seller told me that micron pens only come in black.  So, I wasted some time here due to the fact the picture is not correct for these pens.  Notice on the photo it states, Pigma Micron.  This particular photo is for black pens only.  NOT GLAZED PENS!!UPDATE:  This is now the correct photo.
I wished someone would make one that really works. I keep wasting more trying to save on blades. It sounds like a chain saw when running it is so loud.
These are very small and barely held a string of beads.  I accidently tipped a couple over on the desktop and the lids were immediately stripped and all the beads fell out; not enough threading or cap depth to keep this from happening.
This has a LOT of tiny, hard to handle, hard to glue pieces.  I'm selling it on Ebay, its just too tedious to use.  If they would make it fuller and the pieces fatter, it would be just as cute.  The swirls and greenery tear easy, so heavy cards stock is  a must.
It's not a bargain if it is THIS FRUSTRATING to work with!  These head pins are NOT pliable and are almost impossible to use to make a wrapped loop in any kind of professional manner.  I have paid for the better head pins at hobby shops (not precious metal, just better metal), and they are completely worth it.These head pins aren't even good for people who are just beginning to learn jewelry making because no one would make jewelry if it were this difficult, yet still impossible, to make it look good.  I do not recommend these.
The flat part or the 'head' of the headpin is not centered on the the pin and is not of a consistent shape - sometimes round, sometimes oblong. For this reason, I don't recommend.
It is hard to work with small wires.  I prefer to work with longer ones and cut them back.  This takes too much sorting for my liking.  I like my findings fairly standard and I modify them.
It is not what I expected.It came in a plastic bag. However, the beads were the correct size and all mixed together.
These are definitely too small.  Don't believe they are 4mm.Also, the Antique gold is very darkNot pleased with these'Thank you!
I make my jewelry and test-run it before I sell it.  These gold plated clasps have so little gold on them that they turn copper-colored, then black.  Poor quality plating.
I use everyday.  Initially, the mat is too sticky and destroys the material when I try to remove it.  Over a SHORT period of time, the stickiness wears off completely.  Not happy.
These bead caps are entirely too flimsy. They will not withstand normal wear and tear if used on a bracelet.
These Silver-Plated Filigree Flower Cup Shape Bead Caps (7mm) are cheaply-made and pliable.  The pliability is a good feature in that you can use them with many different size beads and mold them to the size.  They look cheap and are made of the extremely light-weight metal, but there is a place for them in lesser priced jewelry.
These little bead caps are too flimsy to use in a quality end product. They lose their shape just by pulling them apart.
Maybe I don't get this product. My opinion - meh.  It leaves the slightest hint of shimmer on things. You have to look for it. I wanted a bit more bling so I will stick to Stickles. One good thing about this pen, it's easy to control. Maybe I have a faulty pen? It doesn't leave much of a shiny finish.
When you look at this, it looks really appealing - the seller says they are 6mm, but they are not.  They are more like 4-5 mm which, even though sounds close, they are smaller than the 6mm beads I have that I would like them to match.It was NOT a Prime Shipping product, so, even though I ordered these and two other bead packages during the same purchase order, it took a lot longer for these to come.The picture here has the beads positioned so all the flower beads show.  Not that many have flowers.I am disappointed.  I guess they could get three stars if you only wanted 4 mm size beads...
Plastic, not useable.
As beads, these are fine I guess, I just thought most of them were kind of ugly.  One side is shiny, rather metallic, and opaque, while the other side is crackle translucent glass.  It's like someone took two completely different and not matching beads and mashed them together.  A few were broken inside the package.
I wasn't happy with these beads at all.  I almost sent them back.  The coloring was terrible.  Looked like someone was careless with a paint brush.  They mixed colors that were not compatible.  I would not recommend these beads.
These beads are suppose to be crystal. When you open the package they look like plastic. Four of the beads look as though one side of them was shaved off. Two of the beads had pieces that needed some gentle filing off since it made them look even more like plastic. The colors were fantastic and as pictured.
Spellbinders' 2012 releases started this annoying feature of no longer releasing the paper from the die unless you first placed a piece of wax or freezer paper on top of the die and then the card stock.  Also, the color of the dies changed from a dull bronze to a bright copper.  And the dies are now made in China.Yes, the die cut is pretty, but getting the card stock out of the die is a whole other story.  I work with intricate dies all the time, most of them much, much more intricate than the rather bold designs of Spellbinders, and I have yet to encounter such a nuisance issue with dies that are manufactured in America.If you're only running the die once you may not mind so much having to sit there and poking every hole out to insure a clean cut next time you use the die again.  But if you want to run it several times for more than just one card, this sitting over a trash can and poking out the holes even after using wax paper will make you swear under your breath.  Made in China and quality going downhill seem synonymous.As for me, until Spellbinders solves this issue, I think I'll stick with companies well known for their intricate and high quality dies such as Cheery Lynn, Memory Box and Poppy Stamps, Marianne, and even Die-Versions.  For the price Spellbinders wants I expect more than what I am getting.
These are NOT Swarovski crystals, nor are they even close to Swarovski quality.  The rhinestones have none of the sharply cut facets that create a lot of the shine of Swarovski crystals...these are dull.  Also, some of these rhinestones are glued in crookedly.  They are enclosed in cheap, light-weight metal.
These are NOT Swarovski crystals and do not have the sharp cut facets that give Swarovski crystals some of their beautiful shine.  These are dull.  Some of the rhinestones are glued in crookedly.  They are encased in a cheap, light weight metal.  I can't use in my jewelry.
THESE ARE NOT SWAROVSKI CRYSTALS!  They are NOT even close to the quality of Swarovski, BUT for this price, with the multi-colored rhinestones, they are fun to use in inexpensive jewelry.  They do make your inexpensive jewelry look more expensive.
When I saw that the item stated the lot was 100 Swarovski Crystal Rondelle Spacer Beads, I clicked on it and that was the last I saw of Swarovski Crystals. When you go to order them they no longer state what brand they are. People please beware of little things like this.I can not think of anything bought from Swarovski that you can by a hundred of dirt cheap.
These bead caps are very flimsy. Just pulling them apart can cause damage to the cup. I would not recommend.
This large spacer plate broke one of the first times I used it.  Thought I was using the right &#34;sandwich&#34; but the plate broke right in half.
I bought the Spellbinders embossing and die cut machine.  The use of the raspberry plate was to be able to use non-Spellbinder templates with the machine.  The embossing was either partial or the template cut the through the paper in spots.  Even when I was using the regular embossing plate and Spellbinders templates the result was the same.  I would not recommend this product.
I'm not sure who thought up this invention, maybe they were having an off day.  They're usually quite bright, if they're the same inventors who came up with the Color Wonder paper which is really cool.  In case you don't know, it doesn't make messes and with the use of the same paints, it will not get on your couch, curtains, or cat.  That is way cool.This is NOT.First off, it's basically the same as buying the paper and the paints, except you have the additional expense of this palette and 3 AA batteries (not included).  But does it add more to the experience?Not at all.  The paint is clear, when it is touched with the brush it is clear, then when the brush touches the paper, it can be seen and the palette lights up.  That's it.  It lights up.  Essentially, an electronic way to say "Great, you are using RED" except that if you are old enough to paint you probably know your primary colors.The thing is, if your kid is painting, they're likely more focused on what they are drawing rather than the palette.  And for the price, it just doesn't measure up.  Only 20 pieces of the special paper are included, and the paints are small.  And the brush is fairly big, so you'll use that paint up quickly.Also, they suggest you don't mix the paints up (good luck with that!!!) But how can a kid tell if the paints are clear?  There's a tiny sponge they can dip into to clean it but the instructions "suggest" you as a parent do a real rinse between colors.  Seriously?  So they have to keep track of what colors they use to know that the clear paint is still on the brush?  Does not compute.I think this had a "wow" factor of five minutes for my five-year-old, definitely not a $25 value.  I can see this product being on the product clearance end at Target by the holidays.  It just doesn't do enough to merit the price.  It is sturdy, but for a paint palette it's typical.  Buy the regular Color Wonder products and make your own "set" for less.
I had great hopes for this sewing machine, and a pile of clothing that needed repairs.  I've used sewing machines in the past, so I'm not a neophyte when it comes to them.Boy, was I disappointed with this machine.  First of all, the bobbin threader didn't load the thread evenly, so that whenever I tried to sew, the thread would jam and break.  I also had problems setting up the correct stitch tension; I could not get tight seams no matter what adjustments I made.  Forget about the so-called automatic threader; it didn't work for me.  The machine itself seems to be assembled nicely (no rough bits), threads easily, and is easy to operate (it uses a foot pedal).  It contains a storage compartment for extra bobbins and such.Other reviewers have good words to say about this sewing machine, so take my review with a grain of salt and realize that my experience might just be an anomaly.
No sewing machine at any price should be as difficult to use right out of the box as this Singer Tradition 2277.  Some users report no problems at all, while others cannot get the thing to do a simple straight stitch without snarling on the underside of the fabric.  This inconsistency is the primary reason I cannot recommend the Singer 2277 (but read on for many, many other reasons).  Either the machine can do what it claims or it can't.  It should not be the luck of the draw or based on the user's experience level.  (** FYI: If you are seeing a tangle of thread on the underside of your fabric, it is a symptom of UPPER threading problems.)Singer is - or should be - better than this.The Singer 2277 is an "old school" machine in that there is no needle up/down operation and the user MUST manually operate the hand wheel.  Ok, I can do that, since that's how a lot of us first learned to sew on a Singer.  But it introduces a whole realm of problems, and the user must be vigilant as to the height of the needle at all times.  For instance, if the needle (via the hand wheel) is not in its highest position when you thread the machine, you risk miss-threading and can get a nasty mess of thread where your bobbin thread should be and/or a mess underneath the needle plate.  Seriously, even a silly little millimeter matters here.  Please read on for more on this issue and a few other negatives.- Too easy to miss-thread upper thread: It took me 2 hours to get this correct.  The only thing I had to do that I was not doing before was to use my right hand to hold taut the thread as it comes off the spool.  It should not take 2 hours for this.  And that was only MY problem; others have reported upper-thread problems caused by numerous other conditions.  It should not be so capricious.- Poor access to bobbin case:  Every time you have to change or untangle the bobbin case, the slide-off extension table must be removed.  This makes it difficult to leave your work stably under the presser foot while you deal with bobbin issues.- Screwed-on Needle Plate:  Every time you need to de-lint or undo a thread snag (i.e., frequently), you have to unscrew 2 screws.  It is not a pop-off and requires a super-stubby screwdriver or the flimsy L-screwdriver provided.- No " seam capability as is needed for quilters: The foot that comes with the 2277 is too wide to the right of the needle to even use a magnetic seam guide in order to get less than a 3/8 inch seam allowance.  Of COURSE you have to pay extra to get a patchwork/quilter's foot, and it does not appear to have a ridge guide for ensuring  inch seams.- Poor bobbin winding:  I had to use a different machine (Bernina) to wind all my bobbins for the 2277 because the Singer Tradition would not load the thread evenly.  Speed of the foot pedal may play a part in smoother loading. (But please see the negative associated with THAT.)  Also, the machine I tested did NOT auto-stop when the bobbin was full, making for a most unusual and unusable filled bobbin.- No "Highest Needle Position" indicator on hand wheel:  As I mentioned earlier, it is critical to know where the highest needle position is.  The DVD clearly shows a machine with a marker on the hand wheel so that it should be an indisputable no-brainer.  The machine I tested has no such indicator.- Laughable DVD :  The DVD is silly because of what it shows and what it does NOT show.  It DOES show you information that should be in the "instruction" booklet.  It tells you NOTHING about special stitches, accessories, or problems.  It also uses a different model than the 2277 I received.- Cheapo Foot Pedal:  It's too lightweight (the cord is heavier than the pedal itself), won't stay put, feels like it would turn to dust if I dropped anything on it, has very little speed control, and the instructions are riddled with typos and grammatical errors.  To Singer's credit, it is not made by Singer.  To Singer's debit, if Singer is going to outsource some of its key parts (and the foot pedal is pretty critical), they should do better selection and quality control.- Completely Inferior Lighting:  It is also too yellow.  The machine's design puts the light bulb in a location that causes dark shadows to the right of the needle, which is where you need the MOST light.  For me, additional lighting will be a must.- Decorative stitches not so special:  If you were looking for stitches for crazy quilting, the stitches provided are not that interesting, unless you switch to the S1 mode for stretch stitches.  Even then, there are only 2 I would use.  The instructions are not useful regarding using special stitches.  You will need to experiment on your own with stitch width and length; I swear, several of them look identical when I stitched all samples next to each other.- No "needle right" capability:  I use this to get the truly "scant" 1/4 inch seam for quilt piecing on my other machines.  While the needle can indeed be moved to the LEFT, it cannot be moved right of center.The few positives I can report for this machine are that it feels heavier than I expected (hopefully indicating more metal parts where I can't see them), the needle plate is in inches (with 1/8 inch markings up to 1 full inch), and the bobbin case does have a tension screw on it.  (But yet another negative is that while the bobbin case does have an extension finger, you cannot actually use the finger for threading because it does not have a hook or hole.)Not recommended even at a great price.  Sorry.
I found the really cool ones didn't have a partner.  I ended up using most of the larger ones for bells.  I still haven't used the very small ones.  I don't think this thing is worth it.
i first had the Brothers PE77) embrodery machine, after about three uses it started having problems, returned it and got this machine in it;s place, just another mistake for me. it worked very good for about 4 hours , seemed after the first project was completed it went down hill. The machine started eating the thread in the bobbin area, I took it apart as directed and cleaned out the thread , did this several time to the point I gave up. Packed it up and sent it back, only to buy another PE770 embrodery machine, Oh brother : third times a charm, not true. I had this machine for three weeks , did one small project the first week , left it sit for three weeks and when I went back to start a new project , that is when it started all over again. The machine broke 4 needle in a row, the thread kept balling up in the bobbin area, the embrodery arm started making a grinding sound and it ruined my curtains. Needless to say I called Amazon customer service and by now it was 6 days past the return date, so they said to call the Brothers helpline and see if they could help me. I did just that and more painful issues were to follow. Customer service can only do so much , they asked six questions and then said well that is all the support tier one can provide, you will need to take it to a dealer for repair, they gave me a number of a dealer repair that was about 70 miles from my home so I called them. Well he could look at it on Friday and I said Ok, but not this Friday because he would be out of town. I told him I would get back to him later. I went to the Amazon website and found the CHAT service, I told the person on the chat what trouble I was having and she said I will take care of this. She sent me a return label and a new machine the very next day, I paid the $34.00 return shipping without issue because the $700.00 machine was a loser that i did not want ot be stuck with. Needless to say I have a new Brothers PE770 sitting in the livingroom, I have not opened it yet, not sure i want to , i might just save myself the future aggravation and send it back. Also do not by any of these machine refurb or used, if I had trouble right out of the box on a new , imagine what right out of the box used will be like..
I'm disappointed with this template. It is oversized and I tried many creative ways to make this work in my Big Kick but couldn't make it work.
To activate the marker you have to shake them and press in on the tip. I did that to get them started and all was well, but within a day or two the green and blue were not writing much and even though I shook and pressed in on the tip multiple times I couldn't get a steady stream of ink. I thought the green was completely dead so I threw it out. Then I tried again with the blue, this time pressing down and holding for about five seconds and it was back again. So the good is the colors are bright and vivid, they write neatly, erase cleanly. The bad is that they tend the run dry quickly and then you have to reactivate them. Be sure to hold it as upright as possible while pressing on the board (another tricky part since dry erase boards tend to be on a wall) and let gravity help get the ink flowing.--------------------Update and downgrade from three stars to two: I am downgrading because they loudly squeak constantly! Annoying and distracting!
Nice eye-popping neon colors.  We had some dry erase markers that has damaged tips because of inferior quality.  These markers are sturdy even if you press it hard on the board.Cons:- It dries like paint chips and they fall on the floor making a big mess.- The ink doesn't flow right away.  To use it for the first time, they need to be shaken (there is a heavy ball inside - similar to paint spray cans) and press the tip on the board before the ink flows out.
I returned this because it tore through my cardstock/paper, anything I ran through it when I tried to letterpress or emboss. The border dies were the worst about this. If I were in the market for my first die cut machine, I would probably have exchanged it to see if it was just a defective machine. As it is, I have a Big Shot already, and will probably never spend $100/die for the big dies that make this machine necessary. I was really excited when this machine came out (and retailed for about $300). I'm glad I waited for the price to come down, but it was still a big disappointment. Try it and see. Maybe I got a dud. It's really a great idea, if it worked properly without tearing your paper. If you don't already have another machine, it probably wouldn't be a huge deal to buy the extender set so you can use any brand--I ended up buying several extra cutting plates for various things for my Big Shot. Also, this machine is enormous and very heavy. Not easy to bring to crops, or move from my floor to my desk, even though it folds up. If you are older and have problems with strength, I would not try to move it if I were you. I kept most of the Fuse dies I bought (though I returned the border dies--they were hopeless), and I use them with the Fuse plate and plate pad with my Big Shot and get better results than I did with the Fuse machine. Go figure.
does not cut precise circles - inspected tool and the cutting blade design is the reason...circles look like a steady handed decent cut job...
Some of my orders for these contained good quality lobster claps that looked good and opened and closed smoothly and dependably.  Other orders did not look silver-plated (they looked silver toned) and had issues with the clasps opening easily or with them not snapping shut.  I really like the good silver-plated ones that work well...they are a great bargain, but if you can't depend on getting what you order, it is time to look elsewhere for silver-plated lobster clasps.
I have not as yet received these ear wires and I am waiting on them I am becoming impatient, I ordered these things a long time ago.
These are not heavy enough for even the lightest application. Lots of them are not round. Finish is second rate. So are the end cuts.
When i opened the package these pins were in a small, tiny plastic bag and all of them were bent. Two were welded together. It looked like they were bent when being placed in the bag. They are also much shorter than normal length head pins.
Please replace the two packages of balloons. Mine are highly defective. They are unusable because MOST of them are TOO bent.
So I get the feeling that if this had ever gone home with one of the Play-Doh design engineers for a week it would have gotten a major rework prior to release.  The idea is great and it works so-so for the kids but most everything the parents care about could use some work!Kids love the idea of this set!The play-doh is hard to use with the set though... it's hard to get even close the results on the box.  The extruder is difficult for me to use effectively and my kids just get frustrated really easily with it not working for them.This play-doh seems to mix more easily than most sets, which works great for the first pressing and the second when the kids think rainbow colors are cool, but after that it's just a mess.Speaking of mess it's almost impossible to clean until after the play-doh has dried in the cracks and can be shaken out.and finally... IT WON'T GO BACK IN THE BOX?!?!?  I have this large play-doh toy that doesn't go back in the box and doesn't compact or fold up any or hold all of it's own parts to sit in the closet?  Huh?!?!  Who thought about that one?All in all this is great the first time you set it up and then it goes down hill in a hurry.  I don't recommend it.
There are enough stamps here to make a good picture.  The sizes are a bit weird though, kids complained that the barn isn't any bigger than some of the animals.  The colored pencils seem like an afterthought with only five colors and the dual ink in one pad is too easy for little ones to mix.  The set is designed more for store display than home storage.  A box might have been better than a tray.
I have several die-cutting machines, none of which can do what the Fiskars AdvantEdge Border Punch says it can do. In addition to the fact that you have to be pretty strong to use it (not quite Wonder Woman, but stronger than I), the instructions really stink. There is no instruction pamphlet, instead what little direction there is is placed on the outside of the box.  The first step should be &#34;If you are going to usethe enclosed die, you must remove the orange plastic piece&#34; which is an adapter that isn't mentioned in the gee-whiz-this-is-so-easy instructions. Instead I attempted to place the die on top of the adapter and couldn't figure out how to make it stationery (sort of). My first experiment in cutting came out pretty hilarious--more a mess than a flower garden. Once I figured out what I was doing wrong, I again attempted a cut, using regular weight paper (my first attempt was card stock). Well, this went better, and I got something much closer to the example of the &#34;flower garden&#34; on the box, but there were still flaws, and the magnetic strip meant to secure the paper didn't work all that well.I have five or six different die-cutting systems that range from the most basic to the fairly advanced, and I didn't expect that a manual cutter would be so difficult to use. I was hoping to add on to this system with additional dies, but it's not so convenient to use that I would want to expand on it.By the way, if you buy one, make sure you do your cutting over some newspaper or similar scrap because it generates an awful lot of garbage.
I bought these thinking they would be great to make jewelry with but they look super cheap and like they either will flake apart or break.
I have probably 100 Spellbinder die sets and this was so beautiful in the pictures, I just had to have it for my handmade greeting cards.....sorry to say I couldn't get any type of paper to cut...foil, metallic, pearl, etc. .... thick cardstock, thin cardstock, nothing worked and I even used wax paper to help the die release from the paper...it totally broke the wax paper down and still wouldn't release the paper.Wish I had read other reviews before I purchased this set.... please don't buy this one.
I'm like some of the others and got lots of duplicates of the Eiffel Tower, the birdcage with no birds on them like the photo.  Seems like some people get lucky with their mix and others don't.  So, I would say ordering this product is like playing the lottery - maybe you'll get lucky, but I didn't.
I saw it and thought that it was something bigger and better it was so small that I didn't even notice it in the envelope at first I almost threw it out.
Way smaller than thought they were listed.Wrong size for my needs. Not what I expected at all. Sorry about the size.Thanks anyway
This experience was not destined to work well with my four year-olds.  I installed the software on the iPad and there was the pouch with digital pen, stamper and digital morphing tool (more things that will have to be tracked).Quickly, my experience was that this toy required too much of me for this age and they wanted to listen to music instead rather than be patient enough to learn.  Further, if a photo app is going to require so much teaching time, then I'd rather it be a single app that I can also use for all purposes.  Or one can choose the free Fotor Photo Editor app. In summary, the experience didn't get going and landed with a dull thud.
I am skeptical that this is marketed as a toy for children. There is nothing about this that is something I would want a child to play with.I bought it because I do hot wax art and I have lots of bits of leftover wax that I thought might be fun to mold into a useable block. Dumb idea. This product is somewhat complicated to get together. No child I know could use it without complete parental supervision and help.I followed the directions and used a couple of the crayons that were included and a scrap of another Crayola crayon on my work table. I ran 3 heating cycles and the wax still wasn't completely melted. The crayon that I added melted at a different rate than the ones included. After about an hour I was left with a semi melted, muddy mess that when poured into the mold didn't even fill it up. At this point I decided to just forget it because I didn't have more time to mess with it.Poorly conceived idea.
Although it has clear directions and seems easy to use, neither I nor my children were able to reliably make stickers.  I'm not sure if it's just us, but the product doesn't seem like its built very well - probably because of the disposable nature.  Problems ranged from jams while feeding products to the sticker material not cutting correctly.  Beyond that, I'm not really sure why something this small NEEDS TO BE recyclable when it undermines the product function - seems like a silly waste of energy and time trying to reduce trash in the world by an almost imperceptable amount.  Bottomline is it didn't work all the time so I "recycled it".
Not a big fan, I am sorry to say.  I tried several doily style corners and other lacy cutouts that are tedious to adhere with glue, but the Xyron material does not pull off cleanly.  I am left with large areas where the sticky substance shows through and attracts paper bits which makes it look unsightly.  Trying to rub it off results in slight smear marks.  This product might begood with more solid cutouts and I am sure people will love it then, but for my purposes it falls way short.  I am back to my needlepoint glue bottle, much neater result.Recommended for solid items, NOT recommended for airy, lacy cutouts.
This is cheaply-made, lightweight metal that looks and feels like gold colored (not gold-plated) chain (I've designed jewelry for years).  The picture in the Product Description may be confusing...it only comes in 5m lengths and not in spools.  I'm using this chain for a few children's pieces only.  Not good enough quality for my jewelry.
These 8mm Rondelles do nothing to make my jewelry look higher quality or more expensive.  The &#34;acrylic crystals&#34; do not shine, and the cheap, ultra lightweight &#34;metal&#34; they are set in is a disappointment.  I have found much higher quality rondelles with glass crystals for just slightly higher prices from the United States instead of these that come from China.  I do not recommend these.
Purchased one machine.  Arrived in nice time - set up and it sewed but skipped every other stitch and sounds so tiny.  If you sew at a high speed, whole machine vibrates.  Returned to Amazon.  Thinking I may have just received a lemon, I asked for a replacement of the same machine.  Well, same thing and in addition, several feet were missing.  Returned to Amazon for a full refund.  Purchased a higher priced machine hoping it will be better made.  I sew a lot and have sewn for over 40 years and this is one of the worst machines I ever used.  Very disappointed in Brother with this one.
Two very generous stars simply because it's a great idea, and the paint is better than I'd expect compared to almost everything else about this. I consider myself very crafty, and I have two daughters who are following in my footsteps, I thought this would be most enjoyed by my 10yr old budding artist. After opening it I've decided that instead of risking ruining her love of art by gifting her with this, that I'll just pull it apart and utilize the non-horrible parts.First is the case, others have said it's horribly flimsy and falls apart immediately. Maybe they changed it, or I lucked out. Mine is quite sturdy for what it is, and what it is... isn't wood. I'm not even sure the exterior qualifies as a very thin veneer over some sort of heavy duty cardboard composite. That said while definitely not a quality wooden box it's not a horrible box and could probably be used for something or other... though storing the components of this set isn't an option unless you tear out the plastic packaging. When I opened the package everything was everywhere inside (see uploaded photo), after organizing the paints I quickly saw that I didn't have the color options I'd expected from the description or photo, and had duplicates of most colors and all in all it was a very disappointing collection of colors, heavy on browns. The brushes are total garbage, just throw them out... even touching them the bristles fell out and left dusty crumbles everywhere. The pot smells so heavily of chemicals I'd toss that too. The pallet knife isn't bad, though I suspect I'm more likely to use it with removing cuts from the sticky mat of my digital cutter then for painting. I've never used this sort of pallet before so I'm not sure if this is normal but it's unfinished wood, which I would think would absorb the paint and stain heavily... I'll stick with my easily washable plastic ones. There is a pencil (no eraser), and some painting medium which I didn't try yet.I'm actually probably going to end up using the paints with our Gel Arts gelli printing plate, which I highly recommend and can also be found here on Amazon.All in all I'd simply pass on this kit. I love the idea of it but the quality just isn't there and I'd fear that it would frustrate budding artists or offended experienced ones if given as a gift. You would do far better to purchase the components separately and making up your own gift basket/box. Darice has lots of quality items, their bead storage items are my absolute favorite, their embossing folders are great... but this set is a pass.
This product fits well under the maxim: &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  I think it is priced around $20, and it really struggles to be worth that. The case, faux wood, was peeling off when I took it out of the package. The contents of the box had mostly come loose and were rattling around inside the case.The tubes of paint are fine, and useful for small painting projects. The paintbrushes are probably the worst I've seen. They really look like they were chewed by rodents and then used to scrub something, the bristles are all splayed out and they are pretty much trash. Everything else in the box-- the palette and small trowel-- are useable, but really made of the lowest quality material you can find.I would say that this might be good for a kid, but my guess is they would manage to break everything (not a difficult task) pretty quickly, so I wouldn't waste the money. Older kids might be put off art projects by the flimsy nature of this package. I'd recommend just going to an art supply store and picking out your own acrylic paints, some good brushes, and a plastic caddy from the hardware store to store it all.This product has the feeling of a &#34;made in China&#34; product from a dollar store.
I received this set for review a little over a month after ordering it.Simply put, this is a cheap oil set. I  wouldn't recommend it for someone wanting to start with oils because it could discourage the budding artist from continuing, at least with oils.Here's a rundown on what's included and my comments...18 tubes of paint include 2 medium sized tubes(40 ml), one Titanium White and the other Lamp Black and 16 12 ml, definitely small tubes, as follows:2 Lemon Yellow2 Yellow Ochre2 Crimson Red2 Vermillion1 Ultramine Blue1 Cerulean Blue1 Sap Green1 Viridian1 Burnt Sienna1 Burnt Umber1 Titanium White1 Lamp Black(The small tubes of white and black directly above are additional tubes, repeats of the medium-sized tubes of the same colors.) So there are 12 different pigments (colols) in this set, with some repeated hues.The colors are fairly bright when applied and vary a bit in consistency, most like a cross between thick tooth paste and putty.3 brushes: small (at the ferrule 1/8"), a small medium (5/16"), and anothber medium small (9/16"). The small one is frayed with hairs sticking out to the sides. The other two are a bit better. All are poor quality.The pallete is nice, looks like plywood with a birch covering, is 3/16" thick and is about 11 1/4" wide (its widest measurement). It's cute but has a quite small mixing area, making it impractical.The palette knife has a wooden handle and the blade is made of steel, probably stainless.The palette cup is also made of steel, and the lid screws on after a few tires.Theh little bottle of Oil Medium is some sort of oil with a turpentine type solvent I think (the label doesn't specify). It works as a solvent.And a HB pencil without an eraser.The wooden box is fairly nice.This is not a set for anyone wanting to start in oils--I mean, say, a serious amateur. A child might enjoy dabbling with it to try out oils. But a pro or even a motivated beginner or intermediate student of oil painting would likely trash most of the contents. She would maybe keep the palette knive and cup and the cute litle palette--as a wall decoration, perhaps.Not recommended as a gift for a young artist-in-training. My reason is that the materials will provide too many hurdles (especially the brushes and the paint quality) in the way of producing passable work. $29.99 (the current price) could be better spent.A final note. Since this set seems to be aimed at the beginner artist with little knowledge regarding quality materials, the company could have included at least a small pad of canvas sheets, since as is, you would have to locate an artist supply shop for something to paint on besides paper.
All I could think about was how much fun making boxes using my We R Memory Keepers box punch board....this being said I amnot very thrilled with it.  First of all it is NOT all that simple, and secondly when the box is finally completed it is not the most impressive of objects.
I'm not new to craft cutting machines. I've had theCricut Mini Cutting Machine,Cricut Expression Electronic Cutting Machine, andSilhouette Cameo Starter Kit Bundle Cutter. I thought that since this machine is Brother brand and advertises it's ability to cut appliques, that it would work with my Brother embroidery machine, but it won't. I had even seen a machine in my local sewing shop and they said that it could  cut appliques with the PES software, but after contacting Brother, they said that is false. The embroidery machine and the Scan N Cut use completely different files and there was no way to use them together. So, that was a big let down. I have software for craft cutting machines that works on my Silhouette Cameo and my original Cricut Expression, but won't work on the Scan N Cut because all the other machines take SVG files, but this one takes FMC files. I read on the website that Brother is working on cloud based software that will allow me to convert all of my SVG files into FMC files, but I wonder how much that will set me back? I like the scanning feature, but don't like that 99% of the things I want to cut I can't find a clear image for. Even when I do find a clear enough image, I have to waste ink printing it out on my printer, then scan it in and try to edit, size, and move the image on the tiny screen. I much prefer using a computer screen with the virtual mat, then just positioning the paper to be cut on the mat and pushing cut.I did attempt to cut Oracle 651 vinyl on the machine following the settings recommended in the little start up guide. It recommended cutting on a blade setting of 4 on the turquoise blade. That cut way too deep. When you cut vinyl, you only want the machine to cut through the top vinyl part, not all the way through the backing, so I tried it on 3 and it was still too deep, so eventually I set it on 1 and that was perfect. It cut through only the top layer leaving the sticker backing so I could peel away the negative space and use transfer tape to apply my vinyl to my project. I cut card stock successfully using their recommended blade setting of 4, but it left deep cut marks in my mat, so I reduced it to 3 and that worked fine without such a deep cut on the mat. I would definitely recommend playing with it to see what your preferences are. Cutting that deep all the time will wear your mat out in a hurry and they are pretty costly. Which leads to my next issue with this machine. The replacement mats and blades are more expensive than the replacement items for the Cameo. The tools that this machine comes with look like toys in comparison to the Cricut and Silhouette brand tools. The edges aren't sharp enough to really get under things and there's no hook tool at all for weeding vinyl.My overall thoughts on this machine are that they should have waited until they had the SVG software to release it. They really jumped the gun. As is, it doesn't even compare to the Silhouette Cameo's design capabilities. They should also be very clear in their advertising that this machine doesn't work along side the embroidery machine to applique designs. I'm learning that many other people thought they'd work hand in hand as well. If they release some amazing software that makes this thing great, I'll update my review, but as of right now, I say go for the Cameo instead. The scanner is very nice on this and it would be a great machine if it had the design capabilities that other machines have, but it just doesn't. My fingers are crossed that they get it figured out and release something. It has so much potential.*Update*Since writing this review, Brother Released the Canvas program on 11/08/13 that allows you to design projects on your computer to cut on the Scan N Cut in an online program. It works ok, but doesn't allow you to download svg's as of yet. The Brother website say's it's coming, but it the ability to cut or convert your SVG files is not available yet, and my biggest gripe about the software is that I still have to put my design on a flash drive and plug it into the machine. I wish it was like other cutter programs that allow you to use a printer cord to plug your computer directly into your machine, then do everything on your computer, but feed the mat and change the blade depth. This still has a long way to go to compare to those programs. I would still recommend the Silhouette Cameo and software over this.
There are some beautiful acrylic beads out there, but these aren't some of them.  These look extremely cheap and low-quality.  Some of the plastic is sticking out from the holes...and some of those are irregular.  There are just so many well-made acrylic beads on the market.  Save your money.
