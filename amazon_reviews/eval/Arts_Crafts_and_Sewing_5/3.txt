I had these on my wish list, and someone sent them to me.They are nice enough for making some cute jewelry.  Some of the pieces are warped, missing crystals, or altogether broken, so you really end up with about 75 usable spacers.The broken spacers (and the coated &#34;jewels&#34; that have fallen out), make it obvious that the crystals are definitely not Swarovski - not sure how Amazon allows the seller to advertise them as such, but in any case, they are so inexpensive, I'd guess that most buyers know better than to believe it.
These are nice enough and fine for the price, but they are not as sparkly as depicted. They will work fine with many of my projects.
the hole is very small, thought I could use it with some murano bead I just got but thats not gonna happen....probably ok to use as accent on a knotted project...its not bad, not just what I expected
got a good quantity and received a terrible quality. definitely not crystal, some even looked plastic, and definately some were loose and broken, no big deal was not an expensive mistake. do not recommend, give to kids to throw around to pretend they are fancy, yaknow to keep them out of your good stuff
This is a cool enough product - all in one legs look like dangly giant spider legs but shoot down and snap together magnetically very easily.  That's about all the great I have to report.The product is WAY too flimsy to work with a white board (I was hoping to use it with white board for math examples).  However, it will support the weight of a 4 pound white board if you just leave it up there and are not going to use it to write on it.If you travel and need to put up a poster or something this product would shine.  But it is very flimsy.  Oh well.  Great for displaying a poster - NOT good for interactive usage.
This is just okay. If you need something to prop in a corner as a permanent display and don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s pretty cheaply made, and if your artwork or whatever is pretty lightweight, this will be fine. Otherwise, go a few dollars more and get a real easel.
Truly this takes a very light touch to punch up to 15-20 pages with ease. But as I am used to 3 hole punches that make larger holes, this is not something I can use for my heavier duty jobs (i.e., many pages that will fit into a large binder). And if I DO need to use it for a multi- page project, I would have to punch the paper twice -- moving the paper the 2nd time a few fractions of an inch to the right or left so I can get wider (not larger) holes for an easier fit in a large binder.So, the lighter touch is a boon, The lightweight factor and the ease of locking this punch so it can fit into a desk drawer when not in use is also a nice touch, It is a sleek, handsome tool, but it is only good for small jobs.
The Swingline LightTouch Punch's lever is much easier to use than the HeavyDuty Punch's handle. (Swingline LightTouch Heavy Duty Paper Punch (A7074357B)often requires using two hands: one for the lever and the other to hold the punch in place.)But there were no instructions save for the cryptic information on the back of the box.  The locking mechanism for the lever is unnecessarily difficult to figure out right away.  The plastic thing with the arrows on it slides to lock/unlock as the handle is held down.  This makes for a "duh" moment once it's figured out, but better instructions would make this simpler.  This lock seems to be only to make storage easier by lowering the profile on the lever.  The lever needs to be in the unlocked position to punch holes.The tray that holds the punched paper is also awkward.  The idea is that the tray slides away from the main body, but it opens only about an inch.  Tipping the punch into a waste basket still makes the punched holes go where they should not, and it's difficult to get every last one out.  Prior to sliding the tray, make sure you bang and tilt the punch in the direction of the arrows to improve your chances of getting those paper bits as close to that one inch opening as possible.  THEN slide the tray open.DON"T try to remove the plastic tray from the punch itself.  It's so easy to do accidentally, but very hard to put back.
I've used these only for paper and they are definitely sharp enough to tackle that simple job.  But there's something not quite right about the shape of the handle.  It's possible it's just me, but the grip doesn't feel comfortable.  I always feel like my hands are a bit too small.
Although these are great scissors and they cut easily, I have to say that they aren't the best I've used.  I much prefer the Scotch "Precision" scissors; THOSE are some seriously amazing scissors that will cut through ANYTHING and still stay sharp.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BKHHGS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThat being said, if you are set on these I must say that they have some advantages.  First off, the blade is shorter, so if you are looking for more of a snips type of scissors, this works great. Personally, I like a longer blade that you can use as a snips or that works great for cutting a sheet of wrapping paper. The handle is very ergonomic and comfortable, but again, doesn't compare to the Scotch one (which is more cozy!). They cut well but they have their limits; they won't cut through everything easily; but they do the job for a typical job.If it wasn't for the fact that I was offered the Scotch scissors first and had fallen in love with them, I would probably be ranting about these. But they really can't compare.
The instructional DVD with this machine is not only poor quality but not really for this  model. They refer to model 960d. Threading the lower bloopers is a huge challenge. My friend who is a sewing machine expert came over to help me get started. Even she had troubles. It took us over an hour to get the serger threaded. I finally went on YouTube and found an excellent video on how to thread this machine. I just typed in the model number and threading and sure enough there it was by another frustrated serger. The great thing is that she gets close up so you can see what she is doing. The machine does run a little rough and the thread tension doesn't release when the pressure foot is up. But like any new equipment there's a learning curve. I look forward to sitting down confidently and start making projects. BTW I got this for Christmas, and gave it a try right away. First thing is I lost 3 needles trying to remove one. Then the lower blooper became un-threaded. That was it. I didn't touch the machine for  5 months. A hint about removing the needles, or more specifically removing one needle as you have to loosen both needles at the same time, which is very frustrating. Place a piece of paper or cloth over the hole so if, or when the needles drop they won't go inside.  If they do a small magnet works to get them out.
This item was very easy to put on the rulers, but the rulers still slip around, its only a slight improvement
(This is cheaper than a ruler from the brand with the dots already attached! Can I say the brand? I'm talking about Creative Grids!) ... ThisOmnigrid Invisible Grip Roll, 12-1/2 by 36- Inchis not quite as good (sticky) as I had hoped ... easy to apply is about as positive as I can get. I thought it would be stickier (to the fabric). >> Would like to see it have just a tiny bit of grit in it &lt;&lt; It did 'save the life' of two of my rulers ~ guess I was just put off by the price - glad I got it half price at my local store.
I think this might be one of those &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; kinda things.  It looks fine, but is a lot bulkier than I'm used to.  Can't comment on the quality as I'm yet to use it but I am concerned it's a little bulky on the business end to get into the smaller areas.
Great, just what I expected. Nothing fancy about this tool. Great for sewing mistakes. Good for thick fabrics too. Good to keep one in the sewing box.
Again, I need this 1/8&#34; punch and there are not too many other options out there...It sticks on release, so there is a little waiting period for the punch to get back to operational position...WOULD NOT purchase again, nor refer it to anyone
The price is the issue. High priced and quantity is lesser compared to other fabric adhesive in the market which makes it really expensive. For me, all fabric adhesive or basting sprays out there serves the same purpose, so I look for the brand with more in the can and lower in price.
I got this spray for use in my quilting.  I really thought it would have a stronger hold, but since I had never used an item like this before, maybe my expectations were too great.
I've sewed for most of my life but started quilting 3 years ago. Over the past year, I started having problems getting straight cuts on some of my strips. They weren't off much, but enough to make the finished quilt top a bit wonky and hard to square up. I saw that this ruler was highly reviewed and recommended, so I bought it with high expectations. So far, I haven't had the positive results everyone else raves about. I still get cuts that are slightly bowed or curved. Actually more of the cuts are off now than when I used the regular ruler & rotary cutter. I pre-wash my fabric, press it and do the hanging and straightening the grain lines thing then fold it so the grain lines are as true as I can get them. And then fold it again so it fits under the ruler. And the cuts are still off. I've watched Youtube videos and followed the directions and still get wonky strips. It's possible that it's user error, but I haven't been able to figure what I'm doing wrong. Would prefer that they make this ruler wider so you don't have to fold the fabric twice. Maybe that would help. I gave this 3 stars because it's a great concept, the ruler is sturdy and heavy enough to hold the fabric down so it doesn't shift, and because it's easy to make that first cut and then just zip, zip, zip, cut a bunch of strips. Bummer that the strips are not straight.
I have three of these cases. While all of my open arm sewing machines fit in these cases, I am not completely thrilled with them because of their construction. They are generic and offer more interior space than if they were designed for a specific case. In certain instances this may be nice if you are cramming additional accessories or supplies into the case. However, if you are transporting just a sewing machine be prepared for shifting and movement in the interior. While the exterior fasteners seem secure and the carrying handle is o.k., the plastic case is pretty thin. Fortunately, I use these cases to keep my machines dust free when stored and only occasionally transport them. For my purposes, this is an adequate case and very much on par with other universal cases currently on the market.My suggestion is to wrap the machine in a foam cushion if transporting since the machine will be more secure. The case isn't great, but a little thought will make the sewing machine safer if you are on the move.
I got this case for my new machine in case i needed to travel with it ,this way it will be protected, its fairly flimsy plastic  nothing like the old hard cases but it should work for now.
This is a workable carrier and seems sturdy.  It's lightweight and durable to use.  Like it to cover machine to keep dust out.
Executive summary: A large plastic bin serves just as well.The good part... This case is bigger than any brother sewing machine I've yet seen.  It simply engulfs mine.  That's a good thing.  All the accessories, the manual, etc. all fit in there.  It seals well - not like a good storage bin but still pretty well.  Some cloth remnants and future projects, all in gallon zip-lock bags, fit in there too.  So, it is all contained and protected from dust and other stuff.However...  This is not one of those cases where the bottom serves as a base while you use the machine.  You do have to pull the machine out to set it up and use it.  For this reason, there isn't much advantage to using this "universal case" instead of a plastic bin costing a quarter of the price.
I own one of these and I must say that my brother xl2600i keeps bumping around in it everytime I'm moving it from one place to the other. The case is very sturdy indeed but if your machine has the same measurements of mine, be aware that this may be too big for it.
The product is great. I think i just wanted a bright color, so I ordered the squeezed lemonade. I am sure this color will work for a different project!
Don't plan on using this ink pad with rubber stamps unless you want a fairly translucent effect.  If you are layering images to create a collage, this can be a good ink to use.  Don't get fooled by the clever marketing names, Mustard Seed is plain old yellow, marmalade is just plain old orange, work lipstick is a cherry red.....the colors are not unique.  I think the stamping foam that is recommended as an applicator for this product is really awful.  If you want to try the foam, you can just as easily use the foam wedges they sell in the drug store to apply foundation make up with.
i liked but its too faded. not so good for stamping, but only for coloring the paper with soft color
It's glitter.  But is it glue?  I assumed that being by Elmer's that these would serve as glue pens too, but they are pretty much just glitter gel for decorating.  They don't seem to adhere two things together.It says that the designs POP up when dry.  They don't, it just depends on your original thickness.  If you use a lot, it's going to stick up.  The colors are great and true when dried.The output on these squeezable pens is a bit much, hard to control, especially for a little kid to use.  Alternatively, I put some on a paint palette and that worked better to use them in gobs with paintbrushes.  BTW, old makeup brushes (especially blush and foundation brushes) work great for toddler/little kid painting, better than cheap kid paintbrushes.(If these had a brush tip they'd be much better!)
this mat is not very durable and it is pretty flimsey.  It moves around when I am cutting and i have to measure more becasue of it.  It is very flimsey and the numbers on it are kind of hard to read when you are trying to cut material.  You figure the material is 22 inches when folded in half and when you place it on the mat it is not always easy to see where the lines are for the full inches let alone the increments of the inch.  It works but will replace it with a Martelli like I originally had once it wears out.  Big difference.
dont use yet but i hope at works for me later, is was different what i expected for my use
Bought this blade specifically for cutting my flannel quilting project pieces.  It does help cut down on fraying and works just fine.
I have bought five different sets of Perfect Pearls Pigment Kit. The colours of this one are a bit dark. But, when added it into the ink for colouring, the shimmering effect is good. The bristles of the brushes are soft but keep falling apart.
I do a lot of scrapbooking and cardmaking so I go through a lot of glue and tape runners. This one has it's positives and negatives. It is a little bit large, I prefer smaller tape runners because they are easier to hold on to and control when using them. You get a good amount of the glue in this one so it will last for a decent length of time. The packaging says that this is non-permanent, but I haven't had any problems with my projects falling apart. It is acid free so you don't have to worry about it ruining your photos. Very easy to use and so much more pleasant than liquid glue.
I agree with others who say the markings are difficult to read.  If the guide area was a little larger and the markings spread out more, it would be more useful.  Have tried to remark foot with colors of permanent markers. Still does not work as I expected.
I have one of these I've used for years and needed a new one finally. The pop out feature is nice for cleaning, but I find that the roller seems to pick up everything you don't want on there and then it is kind of hard to get clean.
This fits and I guess it does an ok job of gathering. It doesn't cost much so I have low expectations for it. Order it, just dont expect much
Was very surprised by the amount of product that I received. It was a lot more than I expected. It dries to a very dull clear. Not a bad item for the price.
This adhesive was recommended to me-so came on Amazon to check it out-bought all 3 sizes-when I received them saw that all 3 were expired but opened them anyway-seems like the adhesive doesn't come out properly at times-have to really work on it. It glues okay once I get it on-but guess I expected it to work better.
This glue pen is not as good as Martha Steward's but it does glue.
These  just are okay. They are very thin quality and hard to use on cotton fabric.  would not necessarily buy again.
This cutter works ok, and I like using it. The only part that I don't like is that it gets super easy dull. Usually on one spot. Even the replacement blades do that. I have talked to 2 other people who used that cutter and they had the same issue.I would suggest to get the other style of Fiskar Cutter instead. As blades are not cheap and it gets frustrating if always one spot is dull!
I previously had an older version of the Fiskars rotary cutter and the blade engage button broke.  Therefore, when I replaced the broken cutter I bought another Fiskars.  However, the blade engage button on this model is different and too easily tripped when cutting, thus, the blade disengages.  That is my only complaint.
Tried this on light-colored fabric and it didn't show at all.  On dark colors it is a good product and easy to use.
I like this - I'm not a big sewer, it's somewhat new to me, but my only negative comment would be it's sometimes not easily seen on the fabric I'm using.  Could be the fabric, but I've used it on a couple now.
It's white, it's delicate, it's cool to use, helpful when sewing.  It's tailor's chalk, at a decent price, I guess...
I'd hoped that the blue would have been a little darker, or that in a combo pack there would be a darker color to provide more contrast on lighter fabrics.I found they work best when used on fabric that is warmed from ironing, but using a little pressure on room temperature fabrics works. While the marks are visible, sometimes they 'disappear' under the presser foot and the light of the sewing machine.Overall, they do what they are intended to do, but it would be nice to have a little tip sharpener in the caps.
I like the way they mark; however, they don't last very long.  The lead breaks easily and I am constantly having to sharpen them.
Fiskars is a great brand. I don't use this punch as much as I thought I would.It did come in handy while making Easter cards.
I wish it or my ruler came with a lip or something to keep them straight.  After watching others effortlessly cut large swaths of fabric with this thing like butter, I was a little disappointed that I sometimes had to go over the fabric 2-3 times to cut it, which caused ragged edges, not straight ones.  It is also easy to stray away from the ruler (or get too close and cut the ruler!).  It just became this big process just to cut my fabric pieces.  I went back to my shears.
These refills like all the stuff for the Xyron machines are expensive. They are well made though and insert without difficulty. My biggest problem is that they need a warning strip to let you know when you are at the end of the roll. I have ruined a lot of projects that way. I wrote to the company to suggest they find a way to do this and never got a response.
It does want it should do, if you have time to mark it here and there, will help. I would save my money
I'm a beginner sewer, when I bought this I wasn't even that.  So I went for something cheap which had decent enough reviews at the time.  Better than some little hand held thing.  Wouldn't make me go broke but would be a real machine.It's done it job.  I've had it about two and half years as I write this.  Being a non sewer / upgrading to beginner, I'm sure I've abused it as I learned how much material it can handle, how long one needle can last, etc.  I can't complain on that level.I can complain in that the tension has been so very picky from day one.  I thought at first that maybe it was me not knowing what I was doing but as I got used to it and read up, I don't think so.  I can have the exact same fabric and types of thread down to the same brand but I go to switch colors, and it gets all moody and seems to realize I switched -- something on it and wants me to play around with it.  It gets a little moody at times when winding bobbins - out of the blue, not every time.Overall, it's an okay machine, and affordable.  Not knowing if I'd want to sew, I choose well.Knowing now I want to keep playing around with it, well if I could go back I'd have chosen something a little higher up on the sewing machine food chain so to speak, even though it would have cost me more.
I'm an intermediate beginner.  I have some experience with industrial machines from a sewing class but haven't made any completely successful garments yet.  A more experienced sewer suggested I buy a cheap Brother machine.  I bought this machine in June largely because of the positive reviews it received on Amazon.  Here are the pros and cons I've encountered to date:PROS--Price--Bobbin winding and threading are straightforward (especially the threading function)--Makes a nice stitch so farCONS--The manual is difficult to understand in parts and the layout and index are poor.  It also confusingly includes a Spanish-language version immediately after the English text instead of following the English version at the end, as is usually the case with dual- or multi-language manuals. (Some users over at the Wal-mart site had the same problem.)--The markings on the soleplate don't run the entire length because the feed dogs and bobbin case (on top of the machine) get in the way.  The start of the gauge is fairly far behind the presser foot.--The thread spindle can only handle small spools.  To accommodate larger spools I've had to tape chopsticks to the spindle.  I also bought a standalone thread hook to create height and tension, but haven't used it yet.--The needle threader gets in the way. It's not that hard to thread a needle, and this is unnecessary.--Has a somewhat toy-like feel.  But for $114, that's not surprising.--Some of the optional feet are not snap on.--Many desirable presser feet will not fit this model.  I think, but am not sure, that this machine is classified as a "5mm presser foot model."  The "7mm" accessories don't fit.  I went into a store after having researched another foot online. The place talked me into a $40 foot that does not fit and then would not take it back.  Make sure any feet you buy will fit on this model, or at least buy from a reputable source like Amazon.--It has a lot of stitches that I don't really have much use for.  All I really want are a reliable and well-formed straight and zigzag stitch.--The numerous dials are confusing and I can't but wonder if so many functions won't make the machine more likely to break down.--An invisible zipper foot is not included.  That would have been much more useful than the accessory feet provided, which I believe are (they aren't labeled, which they should be), a 1/4 quilting foot, a narrow hemmer foot, a quilting foot and a blind stitch foot.--It doesn't come with a carrying case.Frankly, I'm beginning to wonder if I wouldn't have been better off applying the $100 I spent on this machine towards an entry-level Bernina or an industrial Juki.  More often than not you get what you pay for and sometimes cheap tools are more costly in the end.Perhaps I will edit this review after a few more months of experience with this machine.UPDATE, October 2011:  I used this machine a lot this summer.  My impression remains the same.  It's OK, but even for a first machine, I would invest a bit more money for a little more machine.
Overall this is a fairly good machine.PROS:The regular and decorative stitches held their consistancy a lot better than the more expensive Brother model and it was not necessary to change feet for different stitches.Price.CONS:However...that darned 'ol buttonhole thing was doing its aggravation to me and jamming as it did in the more expensive Brother model.This time I called Brother and they tried to help me over the phone.  That did not work. Next I took it to a Brother service center. After working with it and having difficulty as I did with the buttonholer, the service man was finally able to "tweek" it a bit and the buttonholer worked.  Well, somewhat.  One side was beautiful but the other side of the buttonhole used less thread and did not look so good. That effort in itself took going over the buttonhole twice. Also, he told me it was a "cheap" machine and I could expect no better. (Of course, he had some much more expensive Singers and Janomes for sale at his shop!!!Naturally I tried them out and liked the more expensive computerized ones, who wouldn't?)After getting it home, it still gave me problems with the buttonhole thing.  Thinking operator difficulty??? I really hate to admit that!Why all this focus on a buttonholer? I like to make my little "let me do it myself" granddaughter , 4 yrs., clothes with buttons so she can dress herself rather than zippers that require someone else to help.Plus,  it should just work and not be so difficult!!!Well, I am going to look at some Singer models this week and depending on the overall picture, might be sending this one back.
I can't tell if this is polyester or cotton and if will fit my sewing machine,  It's okay for the price.
I wouldn't go as far as to say &#34; I hate it&#34; but it's definitely not what I expected. The spools have very little thread on them and actualy are pretty cheap too. I would not recommend this to anyone. I've kept it only to use as a &#34;color bloc&#34; of sorts.  sorry . . .
I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local library, and I bought this Fiskars corner punch to decorate my card fronts.  It turned out to be difficult to use.  It's hard to line up the corners inside this punch, as contrasted with my Tonic corner punch which has a little apron beneath the punch that makes lining up the card stock quite easy.  This Fiskars punch also works quite stiffly.  I have to stand up and push down hard to get it to punch cardstock.Sometimes the punch sticks in the 'down' position and I have to rap it on the table to get it unstuck.The punched-out patterns are useful and it's nice having three of them in one punch.See customer image for an example of a Christmas card I made with this punch.
the punch make beautiful shape, but you need to punch very strong in order to do it.so kids can't use it
I like this punch.It won't punch heavy cardboard but for thinner paper it works pretty good.It works best on printer weight paper.
Yes, the price is really good... but if you plan on really learning to sew you are going to need to replace most of these items anyhow.  The thread spools are tiny, the pin cushion is really small.  Not bad if you want a kit with tape measure, standard scizzors and some basic items.
card broke after only 9 weeks, will have to replace. but the program itself is also good for helping me keep my files organized. I prefer card, but am currently having to use usb port to transfer designs. It is very very basic, but does what it is supposed to. Just too bad the card isn't very good.
It's high in price for all you get. It works OK, but you only get a one MB card. So it won't store to many designs. For the price, my Wife should have got, the 5 MB card.
I am giving this 3 stars due to my first reaction to the item when it came and some frustrations at setting it up, and so that you might manage any frustrations that you might have and give her a chance before you decide that you don't like her.  She has been here with me for a couple of days, and it's a five star item for its usefulness and price to me today. When I first took her out of the box, I was expecting her to be flimsy as I had read the reviews before purchasing the item.  She wasn't so bad. The instructions are poor so it's a good thing she is easily  put together.  Before you put the 4 stabilizing legs on, pull off the bottom and put on the hem guide or you will have to take her apart and do it later. I put her together and put her in my sewing room.  She looked very tiny and I thought I was unhappy with her. I thought I might return her.I took a breath and went in to adjust her to roughly my size.  At first, I got very frustrated as she didn't seem to really adjust to the sizes stated.  There are no good instructions for adjusting her included.  Mostly, it is easy to figure out, except the neck adjustment. So, here is my experience:  Start at the neck. push down and turn the dial to the right - start with at least a couple of 'notches', then to the bust, adjust all 4 (don't try to get her perfect yet), adjust her to your measurement on all four dials (front, back and two sides). Move to the next four dials and key to your waist size, the next four and key to your hip size.  Go back up and measure her bust, if the bust size is not equal to the measurement on the dials, adjust move the neck dial to the right or left (left smaller/right bigger).  She has body length adjustments, but I didn't need them.  There are a couple of sentences in the instructions on this adjustment.I have no idea what the numbers on the pole for height adjustment are supposed to be, but they do not relate to my height in inches or centimeters.  At least there are demarkations to assist with height adjustment. Take her off the pole to do this or silliness ensues. With her off the pole, you can properly tighten the height into place. I just went shoulder to shoulder with her a few times, and I was done. If you can turn her all the way around on the pole, she isn't on the pole correctly.  Just move her around a bit until she falls onto the little bar inside.My sewing room is carpeted and she stands pretty sturdily in there today.  I am 5'9" and so is she. Awesome!  I put my clothes on her and they fit her the same way they fit me. Awesome!  Did I really just get a fully functional dress form for a little over $100? Oh my goodness, awesome!  Today, she gets FIVE stars.  I threw her box away-she is staying with me.  I love this item now, after what really were some minor frustrations.
The product works the way it is supposed to, I guess. I even had the right kind of stencil. The problem is that the combination doesn't work the way it is supposed to. You can't connect the stencil to itself to make a long border and get it to connect in the right places. The pounce pad is so imprecise you don't know when you've succeeded in marking and when you haven't.Three decades ago, when I made my first quilt, I made my own stencil and my own pounce out of talcum powder. This certainly is better and I expect the marking would last a lot longer than the talcum powder did, but still brush away when you no longer wanted it. So, as you can tell, I understand the system. But it just did not work for me.
Learning curve, I practice quite a bit before I used it and found very messy, hard to keep powder off other parts of my project.  I did find it easy to use, just did not like the results.  I notice on You Tube the person demonstrating the product had powder in areas not intended as well.  I would use again in a pinch though.  Maybe if I used it a lot, I would feel different.
I purchased this strictly for its features of push button sewing, needle up/down, and the accompanying enlarged sewing area using the table that comes with the machine.  The price was excellent.  I did experience a catch 22 with the bobbin thread.  It will repeatedly catch up under the sewn fabric resulting in a ball of thread.  However, I have been able to overcome this by positioning the sewing threads neatly to the side while using just slight pressure over them until a couple of stitches have been sewn.  The grey plastic plate around the bobbin area seams to 'float' and not be firmly attached but it has remained in position and causes no issues.  I was forced to unscrew the plate over the feed dogs to remove the first thread jam caused by bobbin thread but that has not been necessary since then.  The amount of light shown on the sewing area is sufficient and the computerized stitch choices are very easy to adjust.  I also like the ability to adjust needle placement to ensure the 1/4" seam I use for quilting.  I will add that the tension needed to be adjusted to 7 ensure good stitches.  I paid such a fantastic price for this machine that I cannot complain about it's quality.  Value is there.  This is my 2nd Brother as I also own their embroidery/sewing machine.  PLEASED to say I've done a lot of quilting with this machine using the 1/4" needle setting and push button sewing.  It is still working fine.  I've only had to take out the bobbin unit once to clean it with no problems in putting it back together.  Patience is key in getting used to it's profile.  There could be more space for hands/fingers as I have large hands but for the price and features it is a nice little machine.
First off let me say, I love this machine. My old one is a 1970's Viking which I paid a fortune for. It was always fussy and way too much machine for me. it was like driving a Jaguar. When I saw this offered with such good reviews, I jumped on it.This machine is extraordinarily user friendly with set up and beginning use. Bobbin winding and bobbin set are very clearly explained with guides on the machine. The manual is excellent.  I was up and sewing in minutes. For any of you old timers like me, the chance to hit a button and sew, bypassing a foot pedal, is just heaven. I love the speed settings. I my first weeks with this machine I have hemmed, repaired, created, pieced and quilted. The feet included are generous and the quilting extension table is very useful.The hard cover that comes with this machine is a dust cover. It is not an integral carrying case and does not attach in any way to the machine. Mine arrived with what I thought were 2 broken pieces of styrofoam packing inside. Since the cover didn't fit at all, I e-mailed Brother customer service.After 10 emails over several weeks, I learned that the broken styrofoam in the cover was critical to the function, not just packing material. I was accused of buying a used or refurbished machine (I did not). I was accused of breaking the styrofoam. I explained it came that way. I was told that if I mailed the cover back they would examine it and let me know if they would replace it. No guarantees. And I had to do that in 14 days of purchase. I costed out mailing the oversized cover back and the cost of a new one and it just was not worth my time. I bought a universal case for it for less that the price of a new Brother cover with styrofoam intact. I did point out to Customer Service at Brother that no where in the manual or materials with the machine was the cover even mentioned. I probably could have glued the broken foam back together had I known it was part of the cover.Anyway, I love this machine and use it every day. I haven't found a task yet it can't tackle including denim seams. I definitely think that those like me holding on to 1970's technology should give 2103 stuff a try. I love sewing again.I took 2 stars off for my poor customer service experience. The machine itself is 5 stars all the way.
do keep it in its packet and flat though or it will curl a lot and it also creases very easily.
is exactly my choice of words for this review. It's not that I don't like them, but I don't see myself using them a lot.Pro Tip: Don't expect to do any real writing with these like you would with other pens. You can spread your letters apart if you wanted to, but it can be a slow process.Pro Tip #2: If you do use regular paper or regular cardstock, don't expect these pens to give a 3-D effect. It really won't happen unless you layer the color on, even then not so much. They do take a few minutes to dry, but you can see the drying process happen. Using regular porous cardstock, the ink soaks right into the paper. They are nice, matte, soft colors, but in my comparison to the Glaze pens they don't raise hardly at all. I also tested them out onRanger Inks Inkssentials Specialty Stamping Paper ATC'sand got a more 3-D effect from the Sakura Glaze pens.Pro Tip #3: After waiting for the Souffle pens to dry, adding a Sakura Glaze pen (clear)Sakura - Glaze Pens 10/Pkg-Brightsover the top of it gives an interesting result. Matte to Glaze!!
I was so hopin these would give me another great tool, as has Sakura in the past. Yes, they do stay on non-porous surfaces but one coat isn't enough. When you go back to &#34;build&#34; 3-D texture, it rewets the first laer and pulls it up. I was focused on the name, Souffle, implying &#34;risen or puffed up&#34; but they are not. I will continue to use Sakuras Glaze pens (LOVE) for my needs and get rockin' results. This product better for non-paper projects if you really want true 3-D, IMHO.
"You get what you pay for!" and as usual - Dad is right!  :)Yes, there ARE 20 bits.  I believe the "180 grit" refers to the number of diamond particles distributed amongst all 20 pieces!  LOL!  The thinner-tipped ones are not straight.  BUT, I think they'll serve my purpose, which is to smooth off the edges of my glass crafting pieces.  And at this price, I didn't expect something of high quality so I'm not really disappointed.  But "Pro-Quality" is certainly a misnomer.On the GOOD side, they arrived pretty promptly.
The punch works well and leaves a pretty edge, however the embosser portion just takes too much muscle to get even fair results with it. I am not a Fiskers lover anyway, yet I keep going back to them hoping this time will be better. Meh.
I like the design of the corner punch and the 2 in 1 punch and embosser; however, when it comes to using the embosser, it just doesn't cut it for me. No matter how hard I pressed, the embossing part was just too faint for my taste. If you can get it to work, it would look really nice.
Hi there. So i bought the Fiskars squeeze punch ( i have the large circle) it's a decent quality and cuts an acceptable edge, but i would not say its the best for the finish.  Squeezes very easily (which is great if you have problems using regular punches).  works best on light to medium weight card. Although it cuts a perfectly shaped circle it tends to give the card a wavy edge that you need to flatten out afterwards. When buying from Amazon check in the "Product features" section to ensure you have the correct numerical size eg. 1.5" as Fiskars has just labeled this Large.  Once removed from the packaging the tool does not have a label anywhere on it showing you the size of the circle I found this inconvenient when choosing from several circle punches.Have a nice day
Works well - the only issue I have is sometimes it is difficult to get the "punch" but still makes a clean cut.
I wish I would of paid attention to the size.  I have been able to use them, but need bigger ones for my eye glass holder creations.
Had purchased some titanium bonded Wescott scissors about 2 years ago .... they broke within a day. A severe engineering oversight lead to the handles being to flimsy and brittle. This happened more than once so I boycotted Westcott products.Well, here it is 2013 and hopefully Westcott solved the brittle handle problem. These new scissors DO seen sturdier. The pivot point (where the tension screw enters is plastic, I would have preferred a metal lined screw hole or a nut and bolt combo that is featured in very high end "super scissors" like these:Mundial 498-10 Industrial Forged 10-Inch Heavy-Duty Stay-Set Bent Trimmers, however I guess that may be going overboard for the non-scissor fanatic.But back to the Westcott's ... piece of paper (check), thin cardboard (the cardboard from a cocoa box to be exact) .... (check). Not going to tempt fate with trying to cut 2 iter soda bottles or a beer can.It DOES appear these newer Wetcott titanium scissors are much better than their predecessors. Will update this review if any "horrendous tragedy occurs". Try them you may like them; especially for light duty chores.
I found this product rather thin and runny and very hard to use as advertised. Not to mention it curled up my cardstock into an unusable mess.
I first bought one of these Ranger craft sheets at a local hobby store using a 40% discount coupon.  I liked it okay, so ended up ordering a second one from Amazon that I could use to cut into quarters so that I'd have a number of small squares to use for multiple tiny gluing projects.  The sheets are great at keeping most things from sticking to your work surface.  Melted art, resins, paints, clays, and many glues wipe or peel right off.  The only thing I don't care for is how lightweight it is.  Unless weighted down with a project or taped to a table top, a breeze through a window or from a ceiling fan will often send it fluttering to the floor.  This flimsiness also means that it creases easily if it's not stored carefully...and once it creases, it doesn't work as well.I recently remembered that I had a Silpat silicone cookie sheet liner.  I rarely used it for cookies, preferring parchment paper instead.  I've found the silicone liner to work better for my projects now.  As with the Ranger craft sheet, it inhibits other substances from sticking and cleans up well...in fact, it cleans more easily because you don't have to be as careful with it.  The heavier weight also helps it to grip your work surface without shifting or blowing away.Several other reviewers commented that they received fake craft sheets that arrived in a generic tube.  It must have been a difference in sellers at the time they purchased theirs.  Mine arrived in the same Ranger Inkssentials clear rectangular box as the first one I bought in the store had.
It was rolled up and taped. No manufacture name so I have no way of knowing if it's a Ranger product, and was pretty deeply bent in two places. Other than looking abused, it works fine.It was inexpensive so not worth the hassle of sending back.
The jump rings are ok but they are on a flimsy side and darken too fast.  Ok for cheap jewelry but for better stones I prefer to use the gold filled findings.
Not as good as what I get from joann's fabric or ebay. I make necklaces all the time for my girls. So I am always looking for a good deal.
I needed these needles to knit  a design for a pair of earrrings. They worked perfectly, and were delivered on time. I had never used  beading needles before and did not know they were so thin. Thin or not, they worked for me and were easy to manager.
Far too small, the holes aren't big enough to thread and are so fine and fragile, I'm tempted to return but being a craftsperson, I believe all tools have their use and when I find it, I'll be happy to let you know. If anyone out there is able to let me know what uses they have for them, I'd appreciate a clue.
I do like this wire, but I think it costs too much for what little you get. My husband wanted to surprise me and snuck this in the order. I doubt I'll buy it again. Better prices elsewhere.
I have an exacting, yet frugal nature (not an easy combo, ahem). I really wanted the comparable silver hooks but these were priced lower, under a buck-fifty, so I made them my test. I received the proper amount and opened each one. All but one opened okay. The quality though, is middling, and a bunch of them didn't close as they should, but to the side (see my photo in Customer images, currently located to the right top of reviews). It still works that way but this flaw is a nod to quality. The metal is kinda shiny-cheap; if they don't corrode or discolor with time, I can live with it. For now, I'm hesitant to use these hooks on earrings for anybody other than me. They just aren't that nice and I want to see if they discolor over time and better I find that out first. I'll be holding off on purchasing the silver ones unless they get very inexpensive.
Since I'm not making these earrings for myself I have to think of those who have a problem with metals. These are cheap and after reading the reviews I cannot honestly buy these and open heartily give or sell these to people. I've been looking for lever backs that are on the reasonable side but I decided it won't be these. So many ask for them but I can't do this to them. I sure there are better ones out there and Amazon will have them. The three stars are for the honest reviewers.
They're alright, many pieces don't open quite right and then won't align properly when closing. Hopefully for my needs I can get use out of some, the price was fair, but I may be too ashamed to use them in simple gifts.
I had to take everything out of the case because I would make a total mess every time I opened it if I didn't and it took me a good hour to get all the little pieces out and separated.  Some of the findings are pretty cute though.
These findings are of low-to-average quality but are good to practice with for beginners.  The head pins are rather hard and a little brittle as are the jump rings.  The string came in a tangled mess, and the box broke quickly.  If you are serious about jewelry making, you need better quality findings.
I'm a beginning beader, and I purchased this to craft several necklaces.  The thread itself was fairly easy to work with (although it tangled easily), but all the necklaces I made broke in transit to the people I sold them to.  I had to remake them or refund them.  I was told by a local bead seller that using this thread for necklaces was a &#34;beginner's mistake,&#34; but the description for the product promises that the thread is strong and can easily hold up to 4 lbs.I have mixed feelings, therefore, about whether this was my fault for not researching better or the seller's fault for promising a strength that the thread doesn't posses, so I gave it 3 stars.
Being new to  machine embroidery, maybe I'm missing something. Are these scissors just for cutting fabric? Didn't work all that great for applique, which is what I do. So, I have an expensive pair of scissors to cut out fabric.
The Tombow Adhesive Dispenser is easy to use, comfortable in your hand and makes crafting fast. But if you're using a heavier weight cardstock, especially a cardstock with a textured finish or pearlescent coating, you're better off with a quick-drying wet adhesive. The Tombow adhesive just doesn't have enough stick to keep the paper together.
When I can get this dispenser to dispense tape, it works as described.  This is nothing against Tombow, because I've had this same issue with this type of dispenser no matter who makes it, no matter what product.  Correction tape, permanent tape, removable tape, it doesn't seem to matter.  It works, but only if the dispenser works.  The tape is terrific.  The container, not so much.
Sometimes this works great, and sometimes I get a bad batch. The last three which all came in the same plastic package, messed up so I need to send it back to the company for new ones. But when it does work, it works ok. I would like to find a manufacturer that makes one in which all the adhesive tape come off when you roll it, not just half or a thin strip and other times the entire tape. This is inconsistent. But I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for the giant rollers and their refills.
I purchased this Opelon stretch jewelry fiber to make bracelets and necklaces, hoping it would good product to use.  Unfortunately the the fiber is bad about fraying and it takes extra time just to complete a project.  I was very disappointed in this product.
the size is perfect for all my threads. The only &#34;downside&#34; is with alot of my spools of thread the pegs on this rack are too large. My husband tried to sand them down some but didn't really work out.
I like these stamps except I wish you could get the letters closer to each other to stamp. I do like that you can put them in any order, also that these stamps have multiple of the same letter, which is really nice when stamping a word like "little". This takes the guess work out of where you need to add the extra t and l. I do love the clear stamps over the wooden ones, you can see exactly where you are stamping on your projects. They are also easy to clean, and it comes with a handy plastic sheet to keep the stamps nice and orderly.
So far my biggest issue with this toy is that the box was poorly designed.  It's huge compared to the loom and yet the little compartments for the beads are just that... little.  If kids actually sort the beads into the tiny cups, they spill over the sides and fall into all the wasted space that is made up of crevices and it's a pain to fish the beads back out.  The instructions could have been clearer as well.But the actual weaving loom works fairly well and my kids have had some fun creating patterns.  I have to help my six-year-old set it up so that's probably a bit young to work on this independantly.  My three-year-old likes to choose beads and put them on the (blunt) needle.  And she can wear the necklaces, too.
But it's lightweight, and will fit OTHER things in the case, along with my machine.  I've not tried &#34;carrying&#34; it around, so I assume everything is OK in there.
Let me say first that I do love this machine and am so glad I chose it over the smaller ones. It seems to be very versatile and I love how quickly it cuts intricate images.But there's a big downside for at least one out of ten users, and that's the fact that the software is Windows-only. This means that if you use a decent computer (that is to say, a Mac), and you want to update the firmware, you're out of luck. And if you want to use SCAL software to cut fonts from your computer, you're also out of luck, because you have to update your firmware for SCAL to work.At best this is ridiculous and at worst, just plain unacceptable. People have suggested we use Windows virtualization software (Parallells, VMWare, etc.) to run the Cricut software, but that would require a purchase of the Windows OS and that's just not gonna happen. (And those who have tried this report that it usually fails anyway.) I don't understand why Provo can't release a simple little driver-type program for the Mac, just to update the firmware. Or do what the company that makes the Slice does, which is to put the updates on the newer cartridges so a computer isn't even needed to add them.A great machine, but the company has been claiming for at least a year now that they are "looking into the possibility" of a Mac version of their software. Not acceptable. Every printer, scanner, and all-in-one on the market today has an OSX-compatible driver. This should be no different, and since it's hardly a difficult task, I wonder at Provo's real motives for avoiding it for so long.
I bought this using a 40% off coupon at my local craft store when i learned how to knit 5 years ago.  For a beginner, this set will work--a decent price to have all the different size needle tips and cables all at once.I have since switched to a combination of addi turbos and knitpicks options--and what a world of difference!  The cables on the Boye are very stiff--I didn't really knit with ease on the Boye sets.  Changing out the needles was no problem, but despite using the key and grip to 'lock' the needle onto the cable, I found that the needle would still unscrew and become loose as I knit.  This didn't happen with the knitpicks sets (although I will say with the knitpicks needles, the cable did break off while I was almost finished knitting a sweater for my husband--it just couldn't handle the weight of a long sleeve 40" chest size sweater!).I would recommend this for beginners, but once you get past the novice stage, I would upgrade.  The better sets are well worth the extra money.
The package was delivered intact.  The needle case is of poor quality, I purchased this as a gift but would not have if I had seen it in person.  There are good variety of needle sizes.  Durability is questionable.Delivery was slow.  All in all not bad, just so so.
This is alright, kinda sticks every now and then, so it isn't all it is cracked up to be -- I tend to use paper and pencil more
For many years I have had a love hate relationship with Xyron. It's a good product, wildly overpriced and somewhat wasteful. My biggest gripe is that they still, after all these years can't figure out, or more likely won't put a warning strip close the end of the roll. I have ruined countless pieces of artwork by running out halfway through a piece. I've written, but no one cares.
I was excited to add this to my craft stock for cards, stickers, etc.  I bought it on sale, and couldn't resist it.  It works great on paper--I've created little stickers, and even re-stickied a sticker that was put on a little note from when I was in Kindergarten (I'm a memento whore).Even though it says it works on fabric--I had some trouble with that.  I wanted to cover a coffee tin with fabric and keep my son's crayons in there.  The fabric went through the machine just fine, but peeling it off was difficult, and I didn't think it was sticky enough.  It stayed on the tin, but maybe someday there will be some special fabric cartridge for this purpose?I would highly recommend this for paper crafts!
This little goodie does the job for the most part, although it can smear the adhesive around instead of removing it.
Not sure if it's just in my head, but the sharpness of the replacement blade seems duller than the original blade that came with the machine???!?I've debated getting the deep blade to replace the standard (that has more settings - this only goes up to 6). Still debating because I'm not impressed with the replacement blades - i do have the deep cutting blade which is great for thicker items like felt, and foam. For the price, I'd expect more than 2 - I've just replaced my blade after having the machine for 2 months (I'm not a scrap-booker), I can't imagine how often a scrap-booker will go through a blade.Amazon has great prices for them - it's been hard using the store coupons for the Cricut accessories. So far only Hobby Lobby will accept them. Michael's refuses to because it violates their agreement with Cricut.You HAVE to use their blades to make your cricut work - so the real debate would be where to buy them, and how to get them at the best price - keep checking out Amazon, I've noticed the pricing has fluctuated in the last 2 months by a few dollars.Edited:I've since ordered replacement blades over the last few years that I've had the machine - and it really is luck of the draw! The latest set I got are insanely precise and cuts like a dream. Maybe it was just a faulty batch. If they are horrible - Amazon will let you return it - which has helped me take less of a gamble!
Received this in 2 days - thanks Prime!  There are many good things about this product.  The auto threader is great and love the automatic thread cutter.  A decent amount of different stitches although some look better in the guide than they do on material.  After several weeks of using it daily, I began to have trouble with the tension.  I troubleshooted with the guide, but nothing worked.  I also had 2 different occasions of the thread balling up which required me to take the bobbin casing out and clean around it - only to have it happen again.  For a 3 week old machine, I found this unacceptable and phoned Amazon.  This was my first time using their return/refund policy and it was fabulous - no long explanations necessary and refund received promptly.  I am not prepared to spend almost $400 on a product that I have trouble with in the first month.  I have since ordered a Janome - didn't get the thread cutter, which I loved, or the number of stitch options, but it is a very sturdy machine (have used before) and I hope that I don't have any tension problems, as I did with this one.  Will update on that when it gets here.  The Brother is just an average machine - given other reviews with this same problem, I bailed before I had more problems.
The way it was describe was not correct.  It's not as easy as you think,you get what you pay for. It should have been made a bit stronger and it would work better and faster.
I love ArtBin products, so naturally I bought this. It's small, nice quality, and convenient, but I have two complaints: first, if you load up the rows with bobbins, my fingers can't remove one unless I use a pin or something. Second, the box looks like spaghetti thread every time I open it. It's so annoying. To fix the first problem, I only keep each of the rows half full.Check out the Distinctive Bobbin box. It keeps your bobbin thread tight. (for 15J bobbins)
I have arthritis and wanted to try a smaller tool for curves, but this 18mm is too small for me to control comfortably.
I had to return this after reading the instructions because if your sewing machine is computerized, it is not recommended to use it.  Years ago I had one of these before I had a computerized sewing machine and it is an excellent seam guide.
I really wanted this to work but as I'm still new at sewing, the task of sewing a straight line bothers me a bit. This magnet is very strong, it stuck well to my machine but after a while, I kind of felt like it was dragging on my fabric as I went along. This wasn't good as all my stitches got bunched up. I tried moving it around to different positions but it didn't really work for me. There are no instructions on how to place it exactly so I just tried my best to make it work so maybe I got it all wrong. I've since banished it to my sewing box and have drawn a permanent marker line of 1/4 and 1/2 inch measurements to help me practice. This way is much easier to follow for me, I find I have more room and I can always remove it with a little acetone nail polish in the future.
I don't know what was so good about this thimble. It feels so bulky, I guess you have to get use to it but Just imagine trying to sow with that big thing on for finger...and the stitches at the  sides are uncomfortable  Really I don't know why so many positive reviews, let me tell you that I made a thimble with epoxy resin to fit my finger, I made the dents with the top of a needle,  let it harden and it has worked really well!
I have several scissors in both Gingher and Dovo.  Frankly, since Gingher was purchased by the lesser brand Fiskars, I'm finding Gingher's I've purchased since, declining in quality.These particular scissors sounded like a good idea when I purchased . . .I liked the latch feature that keeps them closed.  However, I've been cut a few times just by opening the latch.  As an experienced sewer/quilter, I can honestly say, those are the only times in the nearly thirty years I've been sewing, that I was cut by my own scissors.But the number one reason I dislike these scissors is the spring action that promised to make cutting easier.  The inclination of the scissors is to spring open, not closed.  I don't need the extra help opening, but rather closing, when cutting.  The resistance while cutting, makes cutting HARDER not easier and my hand is fatigued afterward.Sadly, there's not a greater selection of Dovo scissors (German made) on Amazon.  But I did find a wonderful 7" Dovo shear here that cuts like butter.  After using the Dovo on a few projects, I've discovered, while more expensive, they're far more worth the price over these Gingher's.
These racks are very handy but I feel they could be built better. I bought a large and a small from two different sellers, but same company (June Tailor). They both have issues with the bars coming apart. They are stapled together. I had a few bars come out, so I used some wood glue and now they are fine.  I told the seller about it.
What can I say....Cricut  has you over the proverbial barrel here with these mats...along with "most" of the things you "must have" for these cutting machines!!These mats are  big "MUST" or your sunk!  The problems I am having is...at first they are too sticky...it is advised to go over the mats with a cloth before you use them for the first time to get "some" of the tackiness off it...then I have found...the mat even lasts a shorter amount of time.  Also some have been so very sticky that when I take my paper off of it...it curls up and wrinkles and I have even had the paper tear as it comes off!!These mats should also be sold in larger quantity packages....like 10 or 12 in a pack...or even 6 in a pack...but they are expensive enough as it is...I always have to buy extra.  There have been times that I attach a piece of paper to the mat only to have it come off during cutting...while in the machine...even though the paper stuck to it very well before inserting it into the Cricut machine!!  I have had a lot of "mishaps" with this machine and learned the "very hard way" to "always" do a test of everything before you cut on your good paper!!  So I am always sure to save my odds and ends of paper and I also have cheaper packs of plain white paper to use for test purposes!!I have also found that the "Tools" Cricut" has that go with the cutting machine...like a spatula as WAY to expensive and I have found them so much cheaper at flea markets..there are usually tool shops inside flea markets and the ones I deal with have bins and bins of these small tools identical to the Cricut tools  only they are not the cute little green handled types...they have wooden handles and are just as good...if not better and cost $1.00 a piece!!  I have bought several of these tools in different sizes...I have a spatula in 4 sizes and they really come in handy!!  So if you are not looking for "cute looking" tools...you can find all sort of great buys at a local flea market!All in all I am very happy with my 2 Cricut machines...I am just a cautious shopper with the accessories and I do think these mats need to be in some sort of a larger "Value Pack"...they wear out way to fast!!
I have tried Singer Universal Regular Point Machine Needles based on price comparison to other sewing machine needles.However, Singer sewing needles do not give me as good of a result as Schmetz or Bernina needles in my Bernina sewing machineSchmetz Uni-versal Machine Needles 5/Pk- Size 11/75.  The sewing line with Singer needles appears to have more pucks and is not as smooth.  I see this with brand new needles, so they are not dull needles from over-use.  I wanted to use Singer needles because they are more cost-effective, but given the results I now stick to Schmetz when the seam is visible. When I had to do a small project creating microfiber cleaning bonnets for car mop these needles worked must fine.  So, the bottom line is that these are okay needles, not great needles. They can provide cost effective use, one just needs to find the right project to use them.
I have had some trouble with the needles bending and breaking, they were hitting on the metal cover, so I made the hole just a little larger and have had no more problems.
Great selection of colors but I am going to pass these onto my granddaughters for their crafting projects.  They would not hold up to needlepoint or jewelry projects that you might want to last a long time.  The small 'tic-tac' boxes for each color are smaller than a tic-tac box and have a flip top lid that does not always close tightly so these small beads do escape their container.  I was able to repurpose the plastic box that all the smaller boxes came in.  That was a plus.
I read the label and it carried a warning against Phalates (sp) the bad chemicals they use to hold a smell, a perfume... why they put them in these seed beads is beyond me.  I opened all the little boxes and let them air out in the sun for a day or so...  still worries me... would not give these to children for any reason...  China, why? I love the box and the presentation and the beads seem to be a really great product!  We don't need more dangerous chemicals in our lives!
beads are separated in to sections: several different blue colors in one little pack, not like the photo shows where I assumed there would be only one color per pack already separated for me (which is the hardest part) and when I opened, two of the little packs popped open and spent 1 1/2 hours cleaning up the mess
I loved the strand I received. The selection was nice and the colors were clear. I just wish I could have remembered 16&#34; was so short. I will have to mix them with others now to have a good length.
I am searching for larger beads and I am not sure how the sizes run. I wish someone would explain the sizes in mm from smallest to largest; as I can not find the sizes I want in this area as reasonable as online at Amazon. I am never sure what the size of bead I am ordering.
I was expecting much more than what I received. The picture makes it look like you get a variety of different beads but they aren't all that great.
These beads were ok. I expected more beads in the small package. They were delivered on time. I like them for my earring projects but would have like to have gotten more matching beads.
I received a total of 24 beads/1 ounce - they were all the same size, except for2 smaller beads. This is what I got for my money:1 - pink1 - purple1 - magenta4 - black lackluster3 - clear2 - yellow1 - green yellow1 - white green4 - light green4 - darker greenThese 2 beads were smaller than all the rest/by an entire size1 - shiny black and1 - yellowThe green color boards seems to take precedence over all the other colors. I'm a little disappointed. This will be enough to make '1' necklace interspersed with chain, as I was planning on. I was not planning on SO much green. Oh,well, they only cost $5 total w/shipping. Next time I will GO TO Beadaholique. This gives me a good idea of the size of 1 ounce.
The beads themselves were very nice.  I did not receive enuf of one color to use as anything.  Thank you
I'm not sure if I like these Tonic Studios non stick micro serrated strips. They feel strange when using them.
This is a nicely finished zip around case that houses your most used tools. Most of us have a bone folder already and scissors. I prefer a brayer for smoothing the paper to the mat, which is what the bone folder is meant for. The scrapper I haven't used yet. The pick comes in handy to coax tiny cut pieces from the mat.
I am afraid that my review may not be so helpful as I only use the little scrapper out of all the tools in this entire set. But, I am glad that I have that tool and use it every time I take out my Cricut
If you're hardcore - you probably ALREADY have these tools - the only thing that's cool about this kit is that everything fits into a nice cute little case. The one bummer - it doesn't come with a spatula - which is ESSENTIAL to use with your cricut. This is more for aesthetics than it is for usability.If you are getting a kit - I would actually recommend the Slice kit - I use that with my cricut. It has a spatula in the kit! (can you imagine that?) It also has other tools that is more useful.
ordered from beadaholique. the picture makes it look like you'll get a lot, i got about a bracelete sized amount. theyre not as shiny as pictured but they did come in a padded envelope. however i do feel like they were a tad overpriced.
Little hard to punch a full circle, but I need it for 1/2 circles and it punches a little easier punching the halves...Would not purchase again, nor refer
I found that my cling stamps didn't always stick -- so just as I was lowering the stamp & block to the paper, the stamp fell off onto the paper.  This happened even though I held the stamp against the block for a few seconds (which someone told me would help them &#34;adhere&#34; better).  After ruining several card fronts, I bought the complete set of Stampin Up blocks, which were a little pricey -- but definitely worth it!  I haven't had the falling-off problem with them.
I thought this would be a really cool little tool. Well, in a way it is but compared to how I already make bias tape...not so much. I make bias by cutting the length of fabric...fold it in half and iron. Open and fold raw edge to the center fold and press, fold other side raw edge to center and press then fold in half again and press.. and I have bias tape.This tool, kind of does the same thing...but the problem I had was getting it into the cornered U shape opening. You slide it in there, then have to have something (I used my seam ripper) to pull it through the tool to the other side. Once there,  you have to go back and make the fabric slide in the Ushape specifically...once side, bottom and other side. And it has to STAY that way or it won't pull through right. So it took probably 5 min to get it to do and stay  right, and then, once in there, yes, you pull it through and have your iron ready and just iron, pull the tool away from the iron and more "bias" will come out and just follow with the iron. Another minor problem I had was the fabric can slide down on the U shaped side and it won't  be even sides once it gets to the iron side. Kind of have to do it slowly.Does it work as is stays? Yes. Is it easier? Kind of. Is it quicker? I'd say no. I have 35 years of sewing talents and my way is quick and easy. Will I use the tool? Maybe. Could be I just need to use it and get a good handle on it. However....this is not something I do with to many projects...currently I have just made aprons for my grand kids for christmas and pulled the straps with this. Other than that...I don't really have a use for it to often. But...give it a try. For $8 give it a try!
I bought this stabilizer at the same time I bought my embroidery machine. I went with it because I liked the idea of a water soluble stabilizer (I hate it when people don't trim the regular stabilizer back). I got it on the same day that I received my embroidery machine, and was excited to give it a try.It may not have been the best choice for a newbie to embroidery such as myself. I found that I could not get it taut enough in the hoops, no matter what I tried, and it would cause the fabric to slip out as well. The thread knots and breaks, and all of the samples I attempted to embroider ended up skewed because the fabric would slip. I painstakingly checked thread tensions and all of the machine settings, and they were set properly, so I figured it must be a problem with the texture of the stabilizer. I went down the street to Joann and picked up some tearaway stabilizer to use, and haven't had any issues. It's still slow going as I'm learning, but the thicker stuff seems to be more user friendly.I did test the water solubility inadvertently, however, and found that it melts right away. I was having a hissy fit because I couldn't get it to work and tipped my water over onto the project I'd been working on, and it dissolved almost instantly. So, that was neat. It's why it gets 3 stars. I'm sure that someone who knows what they're doing could do much better, but for a noob, it's probably safer to start with the traditional stabilizer.
I use this on the to put on the top of my towels when im doing machine embridery. It works well if you can pull it all off. If you have to get it wet so it can be removed it seems to make the fabric stiff. I don't like that.
Good points - It works if you use the right needles, it is a nice color (well I am struggling here)Bad points - You need a certain type of needle to use this, price too high.A magnifying glass would probably be better. The cost of this plus new needles = not really worth it.
I've gone through several blades on my Pazzles Inspiration Cutter (Pazzles Creative Cutter Inspiration Cc04 12-Inch Computerized Die Cut Machine) and have found them quite easy to take out and replace, although you have to look up the replacement directions in the Pazzles User Manual in two different sections (I would definitely recommend a rewrite of the user's manual).  Basically, the blade is held in place by a magnet, and pops right into the blade holder.The two strikes against the blades are (1) they are rather expensive for what is basically a tiny razor blade; (2) they don't last very long.
It is a very nice product and there are really great plastic sheets available, to hold clear stamps.  I did not personally like it because the binder will not open flat because of the way the zipper is sewn in.
This beading board functions fine, I was hoping that it would be more sturdy and the &#34;cover&#34; is a joke.  I don't believe that the cover would keep the beads in place to transport it as the lid is very thin plastic (like what would be found as packaging).  If you plan to use this board in one place, this will work well.  If you are looking for a piece that can be worked on and transported with the beads in place you may want to look elsewhere.
Sort of flimsy, but serves it's purpose.  The price was right and you get your money's worth out of it.
This glue came highly recommended as a glue for adhering glitter to paper.  I was a little disappointed with the bottle.  The tip did not have a hole on the top, you need to snip the tip off and its difficult to determine how much you need to snip off since there are no guides on the nozzle for where to do this.  I snipped a little off and it wasn't enough to get an opening, snipped a little more, still not enough.  By the time I snipped off on the third try, finally there was an opening, I tipped the bottle over to squeeze some out and tons of glue came gushing out of the cap.  The nozzle was severed from the cap by about 75% of the perimeter.  I tried using hot glue to fix it, didn't work, tried it a second time and finally it seemed to work.  Ok, I am thinking, all problems solved.  So next I try using the glue and too much came out of the tip.  I thought the whole point of having a fine point tip on the bottle was so that you could carefully control the amount of glue that comes out.  I didn't get the control I wanted but the glue does work, they just need to improve the bottle before I buy this again.
I have an older sizzix. This board was a tad bit too big.I had to cut it down to work.
I suppose this is nice for everyday embossing but it just doesn't float my boat like a lot of the others available out there.  I do like the florals but the snowflake-type pattern is too sparse or too big and the little lines (like firecrackers or stacks of bricks) are just sort of useless for my designs, too plain.  I like to use the larger floral as a card front with the small scattered floral as a fun addition.
I have average-sized hands for a woman, and this scissors' handle felt too small to grip comfortably. I could only put three fingers through the oval hold hole, rather than four. I prefer my "good fabric scissors" since the handle is a little larger, allowing all four fingers in the grip.Otherwise, it is a pretty good pair of scissors. They won't replace my "good" scissors for fabric, but these scissors are better than the dollar-a-piece kind.  Not sure why Scotch saw the need to get into the scissors business.  If they could make scissors that won't get sticky when used to cut duct tape, then they'd get my attention.
I do not use this mat very often, and keep it stored upright, so I was disappointed that it curled up a bit. Also, it is thinner and more brittle than I expected. This is a good size for crafting, but is too small for most sewing projects.
I'd ruined my Fiskars self-healing mat and needed a replacement, preferably in a smaller size.  This is a great size, but it's not the same texture as the Fiskars one - this has a slightly harder surface, and doesn't heal.  I was expecting the surface to spring back like my previous mat, but it didn't.  Also, this is only one sided, whereas the Fiskars was double.  I do like the angled lines - very useful for measuring.
Bobbin winder is kind of weak sounding when plugged in.  Not sure it will work good with batteries.  I had to help it a little to make it completely fill the bobbin.  It wanted to quit when bobbin was 2/3 full.  I just held the on button till it was completely full.  It's not perfect but a good price and I'll get a lot of use out of it I'm sure.
This is the first time that I have to give a product from amazon a three star rating.  The product arrived as scheduled.  As soon as I open the box....out came a little screw...seems like it came out from the bottom of the unit.  When I opened up the cover of the unit... the base where the bobbins go seems dirty....like used.... I have not used it as yet....but as soon as I do I will update..... I'm disappointed.Update 6th Jan 2014Ok so I have used the product....it seems to be moving slower when you are winding up a bobbin.....but if you just press the power button without the thread.....its a lot faster....(not sure if that is normal).  It seems to wind the bobbin ok enough....I didn't have any problems whilst sewing with it.  Hope it lasts  :(
I purchased a pair of these 20 years ago and they're still going strong.  However, I always find myself reaching for them behind me while sitting at my serger. So I decided to purchase a new pair to leave at my serger.I'm sorry to say, they aren't the same.  Upon removing them from their packaging, I immediately noticed they're slightly lighter.  Evidently, the metal used is of inferior quality as not only are the new ones 5 grams lighter, they're also about a 1/4&#34; LONGER.Maybe it's the difference between my older, &#34;made in Italy&#34; pair and the new &#34;made in China&#34; ones.  Or maybe it's because Gingher was purchased by the inferior and cheaply made Fiskars.  Either way, I'm disappointed to see Gingher taking this direction.
im not sure you could get LESS paint in these pans... I did read the reviews and was aware that there would be not much paint in the pans so im not totally surprised, its a nice low price and you get what you pay for in this case, that said the colors (though some are duplicated??) ARE pearlescent and they appear to go on well and hold their sheen nicely. I will not be using them for any BIG projects and this type of glaze is usually (for me) just that ... a glaze so im content with the purchase.
I'm relatively new to embossing and stamping, but I knew the qualities that I wanted out of a clear/watermark stamp pad. I saw this ink being used on YouTube a lot because if so many people are using it, and the quality seems good, so I went for this one and glad that I did. The pad is raised and inks up a stamp really well.It's very sticky and holds embossing powder extremely well. The only thing I don't like about it is that even if I clean off my stamp right away, the stamp is still sticky like there's more ink on the stamp (I've tried soap, plain water, stamp cleaner ect) so it takes a bit and a little elbow grease to make sure the ink is off of the stamp.~EDIT: JULY 3RD 2013~I'm changing my review to 3 stars. As it said above, I was new to embossing. I had a problem though, no matter what I did, powder I used, paper, heat gun ect I always ended up with pits, bumps, and general unevenness. I was told that after embossed, the powder will be bumpy sometimes. Sometimes would have been okay. Well, my sometimes was all of the time. It took me almost a year, but I found ink that embosses great, and gives me the smooth, glass-like finish I wanted.

1440, I expected more from that number but it is such a small bag of stones. I am looking for an affordable but large amount of hotfix stones and this just was not it.
These are ok for things like paper crafts, but what I wanted them for, they are not made well enough, nor do they shine enough.  Some of the glue pads come off the bottoms.  You get a lot, but the quality isn't all that good.
It doesn't appear as sturdy as I expected; thus, I haven't really given it a true test.  Thus, my non-commital response.
hardly worth the price I paid of over $3.00  which included shipping.  Price of .88 is ok, but the shipping costs made the product too expensive.  the colors are ok on the beads tho.
I was thinking.... cube.  And yes, some are cube shaped, but then some are not. There are a few that have more of an angle to them than all 90 degree corners.  I counted and you do get 80 pcs on one strand for the price.  All three colors I ordered came in the same plastic bag.
You get two pads in this package.  One of mine actually tore the very first time I used it.  I did put it through the rollers pretty forcefully (very hard cranking), but still, it's supposed to be flexible.  I had to have it to make the sandwich I needed, and it does work, but for it to tear that easily concerns me.
It works, the one I had was so ruined trying to use 3 d embossabilites in my vagabond and big shot that it was bent so badly I could not use it any longer.
I think you could get by without it, almost wish I hadn't bought it.
I used it a couple of times but I prefer to just set my needle for the 1/4&#34; seams.  This would probably work best for me on a machine that doesn't have the needle adjustment feature.
The reason I bought this was to meet my limited needs for edge finish - a cheap version of a serger. This is not a good substitute. I have not yet been able to get the sewing machine settings/fabric thickness/fabric position combination to give a smooth and attractive finished edge. This attachment is wobbly and for the purpose needs more stability. I would spend the money for the more expensive sidecutter which appears to be a wider, possibly more stable version.
I got this on black friday - was going to return it, but I'm glad I didn't. It's pretty spiffy.BEFORE I started on any projects - I made sure to test the cut/size that I wanted is proportionate to what I wanted the layout to look like - and I would test on plain old printer paper. Also the Fit to Page function is helpful in making the envelopes that's the largest possible. I used the fit to page function ONLY for the envelope.ACTUALLY - First step should be to make the envelope, and then make the card and the components for the card. I did it completely backward and got really miffed that my card was too big to fit inside the envelop.
I've had these scissors for several months now and use them regularly for paper crafts.  They are still sharp and cut well, but the mechanism seems to be getting a bit loose in that the tip does not close completely anymore.  That's why I rate it only a 3 star, since to me it's important to be able to get into small corners and snip with the tip.  There is no way to physically tighten the joint due to the plastic covering both sides.I picked up a Cutter Bee today and will find out how those scissors hold up over time.
These are a nice pair of scissors. I bought them to cut details around embroidery stabilizers.  They are disappointing because the blades are too thick to get into small areas.  Not as described.
I should have paid more attention to the dimensions, as this item is too big to fit in my sewing box.  It certainly accomplishes its purpose, but mot right for me.
After reading the reviews I purchased 4 of these for my thread.  They are good quality, they will only hold standard size thread and each spot is large enough to hold the bobbin also.  Latches good.  You will not be able to store any small size cone thread in it, the slots are not wide enough.  However, I would recommend for standard thread spools
Like others I have a lot of trouble fitting the Expression into this bag.  The problem is that even with the end zippers opened that it is a workout to get the machine into the bag.  Once it is in the bag it is nice...the cords fit in the opening and it zips closed no problem, but if you want to get it out, then it is another workout.  I can imagine this would work just fine for the original Cricut, but there are better bags out there for it.If you plan on doing a lot of traveling with your Expression, you would probably appreciate a different bag that is easier to work with.  I use mine mainly for keeping dust off when I have it stored away in my craft room, so it does the job for me most of the time.  I'm still on the lookout for a bag that will work for traveling that will fit my Expression and my cartridges, too.I give the bag 3 stars because it is a sturdy, well-made bag that does fit the Expression and cords, but it needs a larger opening (or the opening at one of the ends) to make it easier to get the Expression in and out of the bag.
There is nothing wrong with it, it looks exactly like photo. I returned it back because i changed my mind.
I've had this product for about 3 years and it is an essential for getting a good fold. It is durable and does a nice job.
This tool certainly does the job it's advertised to do.I've never used a tool like this before, and I just find the gauge a little hard to read.  I have to keep checking it against a ruler to remind myself where on the device you're supposed to measure from.I like that the pieces of the sliding gauge don't move around, but I find it a bit difficult to release the mechanism to set it to the distance I want.  The button is just hard to push.But, still, it has a job to do and it does it adequately.
I don't want to write a negative review about these.  It's a nice product, but -- I don't like how hard it is to push the little center button in to move the spacing bar down.  Maybe with time this will be easier to adjust.  I've had this for a little bit and all I can say is it's okay.  It's something, if I had tried it, I wouldn't buy again.
I bought this gauge a few years ago for about $15. It has a very nice feel in the hand, compared to the cheap metal versions and at times the wider-than-usual guide at the top is helpful. (Sometimes it's easier to have a narrow guide, however, for example, on small curves.)I have a couple of problems:--I believe the lowest measurement is 1/4".  I frequently need to measure 1/8", sometimes less.--I don't use it for anything but measuring seam allowances.  I lost the original information card, and I haven't been able to find any information on the web explaining the other uses.  To use it for other than the main function is not intuitive.  I would probably never use the compass function.  I have a compass and there are many low-tech ways of making a compass involving, a pencil, a string, and a pin.So for me, it's basically a fancy, expensive seam gauge.  I don't mind having it, but a $3 clear plastic ruler with lines can be just as effective, and sometimes more, because the ruler can be laid on fabric that moves.  This product sometimes pushes up the edges of pieces I'm working on.
I was very pleased with vibrant colors of these threads.  I also liked the weight of the thread and its strength.However the spool design is not thought through.  The thread ends have no place to be secured when you are not sewing, so until I came up with a solution I wasted a lot of the thread to tangles.  I also had trouble with it on my Bernina - the thread was catching on the uneven edges of the core.I came up with solutions to both problems. Both of my solutions are described at the end of this review. However, I give this thread 3 stars because because I had to come up with how to compensate for the bad spool design to make the thread usable.Solution #1:To keep the thread from unwinding and tangling, I use a small piece of opaque scotch tape (with one end taped to itself as a tab so it is easy to pull on).  The opaque tape is easy to remove and gets better with more use as it becomes less and less tacky.  Still good enough to keep the thread taped to itself, but easier and easier to remove.I am attaching a photo for reference.Solution #2:Instead of using the thread directly on the sewing machine, I use it on stand alone thread holder. It pulls the thread up clear of the uneven edges, so nothing gets caught on the bad spool.  This is the thread holder I use:Dritz(R) Cone Thread Holder
The colors are gorgeous, each one more alluring than the last. The spools ARE small and SOME, only SOME, are difficult to start. A scant few are missing that very handy thread-holder-cap (sorry, I'm new to embroidery, so I don't know the exact terminology yet, but I do know that deal is neat and VERY clever - ALL thread spools should have that!). As mentioned in the title, I have a Janome 350e; it seems important to mention the machine a person runs their thread thru, so there that info is.I used this thread on a small multi-colored flower arrangement. (if I knew how to attach a photo, I would .. not sure that counted as a "product link" ) Overall it's not too bad. I am still training / learning. If I had been more serious about applying this to something, I'm not sure I'd be very happy with it. This stuff seems thinner than the only other brand I have on hand which is Floriani, which came as a gift with my machine. I don't have anything else to compare it to, is why I say that.Anyway, for $x.00, it's okay to have on hand. It's plenty useable, the colors are beautiful, I have had ZERO hangups in my embroidery machine and that's using 10-plus different colors on that flower arrangement, including that same color in the bobbin .. again, ZERO problems. It just seems 'thin' .. OH, this thread does not seem to like the needle theader! If you don't get it threaded right the first time, as they say, fuhgeddaboutit! Cut it and start over .. at least on my machine.So ultimately, for the cost, I'm glad I got this box. Once I learn more, how to manipulate my machine and the stabilizers and fabrics and such, I'll probably order more.______________________UPDATE : 2 APRIL 2012 : will NOT be ordering more!having TENSION ISSUES on my JANOME 350e, but I think that is going to end up being a result of the thread I bought here on AmazonPolyester Embroidery Thread Set - 40 Spools (500 meter spools/40 wt.) - Set D Brilliant Colors(That link should be the SET A, VIBRANT COLORS, they are still 500 meter spools, 40wt) ... maybe, maybe not.. not sure yet, but several things I've worked on have not come out very well, and I was using that thread. It's too loose on the spool once the machine starts working, either standing up or laying on the Janome 350e's horizontal spindle. I've got brand name thread, just don't want to use it :) but I'm going to have to I guess ... I've got an nice machine to make nice gifts, gonna have to do the right thing and use the right stuff.It doesn't pay to cut corners ... It COSTS. Please learn from my experience. I think the thread may be okay for some applications, but I'm not going to spend/waste a whole lot of time adjusting tensions and fiddling with stabilizers to figure out what goes with what ... I've got good thread, good stabilizer and an average tension I know works, so I'm done with it. I've got it if I need it, but other than that, never mind it for good embroidery.
Nice selection of threads in a convenient re-seal bag.  The thread is good quality, but there are too many white spools.
I just started sewing so I needed a bunch of spools to practice on.  These all seam like basic, cheap 100% polyester thread.  By no means, are these nicer quality threads, but for the price it was nice to have an assortment of colors.  I might add, I got slightly different colors than what is pictured, but they cover all the bases.  They are quite thin and would most likely not do for a heavier/thicker fabric.
A good supply of quality pins that slide effortlessly into the fabric and pin cushion.  I won't be worried about loosing a few.
These pins are nice for quilting because you can iron them if needed. I wish they were longer, but they are satisfactory.
When sewing, bobbins are necessary.  It is always good to have several on hand for all the different colors of thread that I seem to use.
I ordered this for my singer 4423. They fit in my brother sewing machine as well but the only problem was if i was winding it in my brother machine, it was tight in the bobbin winding slot. And when i got them, they were yellowish and looked like they were used.
For some reason I thought this stamp would be much larger.  It's okay for it's size.  It stamps very well.
I have yet to use this thus the htree stars. I love sewing and I am sure this will be handy and loved once I use it.
The description says that the SA-107 Walking Foot fits the SE 400, and yes it screws onto the machine, however it does not sew correctly!!The  knob that you turn to replace the needle (and the walking foot attaches to) keeps opening and the needle falls out or bends as I sew unless I stop and tighten it ever two or three stitches!  The SE-400 takes the SA-188 foot.I am sure this product works great on the machines it was intended for, but not the SE-400......
This is the first walking foot I have ever purchased, so I don't have a lot to compare it with. However, in my understanding of this foot, it is supposed to help walk the fabric through in time with the feed dog to prevent bunching and to keep alignment. So far, it has yet to do that. The little plastic &#34;feet&#34; on it do not ever seem to make contact with the fabric. It has also caused my needle screw to loosen and I have lost a few needles during sewing. Once or twice flying out at my eyes. Once I have experience the use of other feet, I may have something to compare it to. Right now, I'd say try to find another brand or style to fit your machine.
Nice idea but poor use.It does not cut many pages at the same time, it's more like three or four.Kind of disappointing if you are making a whole notebook and have over 40 pages to cut.Also, it does not cut equally and you end up with unevel pages.But it's nice to round paper border of single sheets to be used in scrapbooking projects, not to bookbinding, definetly.
These are definitely a very nice silver color but the quality is a slight bit inconsistent. Overall I am not disappointed.
They arfe useful but  too small for my projects.I am using them any way, but there are difficult to handle.
I bought this box to store sewing supplies.  I usually keep it in a locker in a school where I take classes.  When I bought it, I had considered carrying it to and from home to classes, but quickly realized that would be too risky because the snaps that secure the box don't always close firmly.  They are very little snaps that hook on narrow bars and look warped even when brand new.  A couple of times they have fallen off and only with difficulty was I able to snap them back on. There is often no crisp "snap" sound, so I can't always tell whether it is actually closed, which is unsettling.  As a result, I usually carry the box in my arms, which is awkward and unwieldy.This problem with the closures is a design flaw that I encountered with another style of ArtBin container a few years ago -- I use a box that has only one of the handles because the other fell off and was lost.The box was also a little hard to set up.  There were no instructions and I had to work a little to slide the plastic dividers into place. The parts aren't machined well.I like the ability to easily see a number of supplies, but it's ridiculous to spend this kind (or any amount) of money on a box and to be afraid to carry it by the handle because it might open up and cause a crazy mess.  If you need to carry it, I suggest using a luggage strap to ensure that it stays closed.
LOVE THE SIZE of this box for large spools of thread, but be careful to READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY because despite the picture; the spool holder IS NOT INCLUDED and is quite expensive to order separately, if even possible.  Manufacturer cost is higher and won't compete with their vendors, which is honorable; however, I am disappointed in the picture which SHOULD SHOW the plastic dividers actually in place that are really included with the order. If able to be ordered either way - then two separate pictures of the SAME BOX with different insides should be indicative.
These are made from the velour blankets you could buy anywhere and make 50 at a time.  Two of the sheets are good, the black one is so flimsy, I can't even use it. It wads up and you can't see what you are working on . The two made form velour are very nice to use and I'm glad I have them when I'm beading. I just wish I would have known how easy they are to make on my own.  I gave 3 stars because I can't even use the black one.
New to beading, but I would think there are a lot of fabrics that would prevent beads from rolling around.  I am using them, but not sure if they were really needed.  I would be interested in other opinion.
I bought these beads for their shimmer, but I was a bit confused on the colors of the beads.  I have 2 boxes with 18 square holders formbeads. I separated as many beads based on color as I could.  Some looked bluish purple, some dark purple, but several were difficult to place.  They will be used to make bracelets.
I made a whole bunch of snowflakes out of used security envelopes with the blue print on the inside and they looked very nice decorating my office this past winter. Don't try punching very thick cardstock or you'll end up disappointed because it will get stuck. I like the way it creates a curved snowflake and learned that I had to squeeze the punch twice in order to get that effect and to release the cut paper, otherwise the paper won't come out.
Don't know if I am going to send this back or not.  I have to practice with it a bit.  So far I have trouble when you get to the corners.  It is very hard to line up.
Nice design but it gets stuck in the punch.  I would have to make sure to take out design carefully or it will tear.  I wouldn't recommend mass producing a lot of cards with this punch...you'll just get frustrated.
Hi there. Had this item a good while now and yes the design of the punched cutout is nice and the capability to punch continuously while following the printed design is easy.I do find the product a little lightweight and flimsy though, it does not feel as heavy duty as maybe the EK brands.  I also find that it would be more useful if there was a cover underneath to catch the multitude of small bits after punching."Ok i hear you" it's a paper punch but i expected a more solid item for the price.Works fine for light weight paper to medium card. Personally I wouldn't be eager to buy a Martha stewart punch again unless they upgraded the quality.Was seriously worried i would break this while using it.Have a nice day
