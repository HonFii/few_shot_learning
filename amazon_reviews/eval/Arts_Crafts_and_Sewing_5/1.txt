Advertise as Swarovski crystal, but they are fake dull crystal without any sparkle. Do not buy them at all, because you will be disappointed.
I order this crystals base on the merchant product description. Up on receiving the items, I noticed two things. The crystals lacked sparkle and they were a bit smaller them the ones I have. I immediately start compering them and another thing that I noticed was that, it was not 8mm as advertised by the merchant. They are not real Swarovski crystals base on size, sparkle and price. Will not buy it again.
I bought these thinking they would be great to make jewelry with but they look super cheap and like they either will flake apart or break, and some of them are missing the little gems.
These 8mm Rondelle space beads are in no way close to real Swarovski quality!  The &#34;crystals&#34; do not have the beautifully cut facets and the shine that Swarovski crystals are known world-wide for.  They are encased in a cheap, light-weight metal.  BEWARE:  The Product Description is inaccurate and dishonest.
After spending some time on Amazon.com looking for Swarovski crystals,I decided to buy this crystals base on the product description provided by the merchant. Up on receiving the items, I notice that the crystal were dull without any sparkles at all. I have real Swarovski crystals roundels and I immediately notice two things. Frist the crystals that I have sparkle 10 times better them the ones that I order from this merchant on Amazon.com. Second mines are 1mm bigger them the ones I receive form this merchant. My conclusion base on sparkle and size they are not real Swarovski crystals roundels.

I decided to by this crystals base on merchant product description on the Website, and I was very disappointed. The crystals did not have any sparkle at all and the roundels were a bit small. I compered them with real Swarovski roundels and there is a big deference between them. I have requested an authorization return for the item. Also notice that while reviewing the item, that was no option to check the box that confirms that I did buy this item from a Amazon merchant, which is relevant when reviewing a product. Will not buy from this merchant again.
Piece of crap, dull crystals, they have the nerve to advertise it as Swarovski crystals. Shame on them, they are scamming the consumers.
I was expecting, as it said.. to have some grip to the plastic to hold the template from moving when on the fabric while I am rotary cutting it..... but..it does nothing to keep the template from moving when on the fabric.Template slides like it did without it. I am not happy with this product..it doesn't do what it says. Now, it does keep the templates from sliding around when they are stacked together...template to template. That is a tad of help since when I use several size templates, and they are sliding all over..this product makes them kind of stick together so they don't get pushed around and have to hunt for them. But it is advertised to hold the template to the fabric..and it doesn't
I guess you get what you pay for.. this was definitely a cheapo item, and would have been better paying more for something better.
I've used fiskars products for years and was very happy with them.  When I needed a new pair I bought these.  The safety lock to hold them closed broke within the first 5 minutes of using them and the blades just weren't sharp. I had already started using my old pair of Fiskars spring loaded scissors for paper and they were still sharper than the new pair.
I bought this elsewhere and was so displeased. I spent only $11.00 but even for that I expect a product that actually gets hot. I wanted to buy the mini craft iron but didn't really want to spend $40.00. I travel with sewing projects often and hoped this would work at least marginal. It didn't get hot enough to bond stabilizer to fabric. My granddaughter tried melting crayons to fabric with it and it sort of worked so I left it in her hands feeling it was safe enough because it barely felt hot to the touch. Unless I got a dud and folks who gave rave reviews didn't I wouldn't waste my money. I bought an inexpensive travel iron to tuck in and take along. I wouldn't give this a second try for the price.
I regret purchasing my Xyron 500.  A waste of money and consumables are extremely costly and has a lot of needless waste without you having control  Its the way it's designed.
this is plain out the biggest rip off Brothers has produced, It was like a Matel toy software produce, don't waste your money on this poor quality item
I always buy Singer products, because they are always good.  I don't know who Singer had to make this dress form but it is bad.  Not steady at all hard to adjust the size.  But I needed somethings to put my clothes on  so I kept it.  The price should have been $35 - $50.  All I could get off as a discount was less than $21.  If you are looking at this to buy DON'T. you will be very disappointed.  I am out with SINGER
I bought this machine to replace my 27 year old Kenmore.  I had it 62 days when it locked up and quit working.  I called customer service and had to bring it to the nearest service center - 27 miles away - to have it serviced because it is sealed and can not be fixed.  I had to leave it with them for 10 days during which I had to borrow back my old machine to finish some projects that needed to be done right away.  I got the machine back and I am looking for a better machine.  I bought the machine thinking it was a great buy but it stalls on heavy fabric and shows an error which you can not override.  I can't return it because of the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with it.  I don't have a lot of expendable cash so I will have to use this one.  I'm looking for a better machine now and would not recommend this machine at all.  What a terrible disappointment.
I chose this because I do a lot of crafting and thought this would be a great alternative to glue sticks and double sided tape.  As others have said, the marketing of this product is a little bit misleading.  "Glue spots" made me think of tiny droplets of glue but what this actually dispenses is small squares of double sided tape, similar to what I have also seen called photo mounting squares or simply, mounting squares.  It's worth noting because if you are expecting something similar toElmer's E4000 CraftBond Glue Spots, Thin Small Sticky Dots, 300 Dots per Pack, this product is NOT the same.  Personally this was not immediately a negative for me because I do like using mounting squares.  But I do think the marketing is misleading to someone who might be specifically seeking out a glue dot product.This product, in my experience, didn't live up to the other brands of mounting squares I've tried.  I agree with other reviewers who say this device makes the squares hard to position.  This becomes an issue if you're working with small details and embellishments as you might have to reposition in order to get the tape exactly where you want it and have to be careful not to tear your paper in the process, especially if you're working with something delicate.  But the bigger issue is these just aren't sticky enough to be considered permanent IMO.  The adhesive didn't seem nearly strong enough.Overall, this product just seemed like a giant fail between the hard to use dispenser and the hardly sticky tabs.  I do think there are some great mounting squares on the market that are easy to position and hold items in place well, this device just doesn't qualify.
I have used a lot of different kinds of craft adhesives for my scrapbooking hobby. This product does not meet my requirements.  The instructions are nil.  You get the package, open it and begin using which is fine but a little explanation could be beneficial.  It states these are glue spots. They are not glue spots, they are slightly sticky adhesive squares. I tried them on a number of different paper types and they do not stick. You can separate the pieces "glued" together easily, with good adhesive this should not be possible.  The dispenser fits nicely in your hand and it operates smoothly, but none of that matters if the adhesive doesn't adhere, and it doesn't.  I can't recommend this product unless they rework the adhesive so that is actually sticks.
These punches are poor quality; but you get what you pay for I suppose.The first punch caught/ snagged on itself at the very top of the circle and would lock because the cutting wedges weren't aligned. It made it very difficult to punch holes without a tremendous amount of force (I got blisters on my palms from wrestling with it so much). It eventually, after only about 100 punches, snapped at the hinges below the handle.The second one I ordered had the cutting plates aligned properly, but still snapped at the hinges below the handle just as the first one had; I managed about 200 punches out of this one before it died.I'm sure they'd be perfect for small jobs, one punch here, another there, but if you plan on using it heavily, I advise you look elsewhere.
bought this even after buying a shabby pair of Fiskars scissors in hopes the scissors were a fluke.  Not so.  I couldn't get them to punch anything.  Not cardstock, not regular paper.  This punch couldn't punch it's way out of a wet paper bag.  I contacted Fiskars and they sent me a replacement.  The replacement worked in the same manner as the first punch,  not at all.  Purchased and EK Success punch instead and have not regretted it.  Won't be buying anymore Fiskars products.
How many women crafters do have hands the size of a bear paw?  This thing is hard to grab if you have small to medium hands, and after about 20 punches on 65lb cardstock which, for instance, a MS punch goes through like butter, I am starting a blister in the webbing between thumb and index finger.  I bought the punch at Michael's today while it was 40% off, but even if it was free I'd bring it back or toss it in the trash.  It also punches in two steps, which is very annoying.I have a few of the smaller squeeze punches which are fairly easy to use, but this extra large thing feels like it's going to break while making a mess out of my hand.Absolutely, positively, NOT recommended.  I'm ordering an EK success instead, because I know what I'll be getting then:  quality.
That's right, in the batch I got, 44 out of 100 were defective and had to be thrown away. UNACCEPTABLE .WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PRODUCT AND, WILL NOT REPURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR.
I have no idea why people are so in love with this product.  It is the most flimsy thing I've ever purchased for the price.  Its extremely thin, there is nothing on one side to keep it anchored to your work surface, and its just way too over priced for what you get.  It probably costs them .25 cents per sheet to make in China.
an Amazon purchase is ALWAYS a great idea, but not every item - anywhere - is...my money for this item was pleasantly refunded to me since it did not live up to my expectations. Another excellent reason to choose Amazon and it's sellers.
This came via mail and was flattened when I got it. Since they cannot be folded, but need to be rolled, it cracked the mat every inch or so. Not happy about it and should have returned it, but didn't want to go through the hassle! Otherwise, these sheets are fabulous for using glue that can be wiped off the mat--and many other uses--a necessity for any crafter. Would recommend you take the trip to JoAnne's to purchase. To be fair to the seller, however, I did not try to resolve my dissatisfaction with them.
My bag was full of broken glass beads, a lot of plastic beads, wooden beads that have seen better days, odd ear wires that didn't match, purple cord, cheap-looking metal dog-tag-like beads, mismatched seed beads and other unusable items that the Seller could not sell.  I understand the concept of random, but there should be some system in place to make sure that when you take people's money they get at least some satisfaction from their purchase.  I feel completely ripped off.
I'm probably one of the few people who hate this product.I like the way the tape dispenser feels in my hand, and it IS very sticky, but...The tape kept twisting so the sticky stuff that went on my card was a very skinny strip. After having this happen to me with THREE different runners, I determined what caused the problem: it doesn't work when trying to go around curved shapes. Specifically, I was using the runner around a circle - every single time, the runner messed up. On one of the dispensers, I was able to straighten the tape, but it wouldn't wind properly (I had to use a screw driver to manually wind it - a big waste of my time.) With a new dispenser, I am able to do straight line gluing only; I don't use it for going around curved shapes - problem solved, huh?I will never buy this product again, no matter how sticky it may be! I love the Therm-O-Web product and will go back to using it and save this one for "straight line gluing."
the glue is bad! it doesn't glue cardstock paper, each item i tried to glue fall apart.it was a big disappointment.
I got this as a gift for Christmas.  I bought all the accessories, including the deeper blade.  I found that the machine does not cut chip board as the product claims.  It also does not cut quilting fabric.  Both of which are demonstrated on the DVD provided.  I spent another $40 attending a class at a local scrapbooking store using the Cricut Expressions.  I am glad I did this because it reassured me that I was not a slow learner.  The instructor also had problems trying to get the machine to perform, and the instructions provided were very vague and poorly written. When I have called the customer service at Provo Craft the "tech" did not know how to use the machine, and was not helpful. On the up side, I did buy the software package, on sale.  The software has been essential for me to be able to use the cartridges.  I agree that all the Cricut products are way over priced, especially when there is little or no customer support.  Save your money and buy ready made die cuts.
I ordered this kit in Lime with 400 eyelets. It was out of stock so I waited. Once in stock, a three week wait, shipping took 4 days, not the 2 day prime shipping it was advertised with, & that I pay yearly for. What I got after all that wait for it to come back in stock was a pink one with 100 eyelets in a smaller case. I was still charged for the higher priced Lime in the case with more compartments & 400 eyelet.  I will be sending this back & buying the one I ordered but from another store. Really annoyed since I've waited patiently for over three weeks for this & really needed it, now my project is on hold again while I search elsewhere for the one I wanted.
I still have a shoe box full of tiny rolled strips paper that has not been seal as I have no idea what product to use. I was also teaching my 8 year old granddaughter this craft.
I had seen the item with the "don't lose your cap again" style bottle and I avoided it because I disliked how the band would get in the way and how it did not come with a clearing pin. Once my glue bottle arrived I was disappointed to see that I received the one I had purposely avoided. Picture is now listed as well. Very annoyed. Contacted seller and have not heard back yet. Will update this review if an when they correct their mistake.
Just sharpen the blade that you have... why buy another?
The machine won't work properly after only 8 months and there are no service centers nearby, the one they did send me to doesn't even handle Brother machines and they do not work on them! They have plastic gears and are a piece of high priced junk.They want me to drive an hour away to their service center, they do not offer shipping or anything else for their piece of junk, if it breaks and there is no service center close then forget about getting any warranty work.
I tried this and it does nothing. The fabric just folds up against it. You'd be better off just watching the placement yourself and adjusting as you sew
I downloaded the trial first and highly recommend that you take this software for a test run before you invest in it.  Personally, I found the software to be extremely buggy.  I had heard that many fixes had either been made or in the works but until they do a lot more upgrading to this product I wouldn't get it.
Considering that a greater proportion of people involved in the creative arts prefer Macs, it's ridiculous that there is no Mac version of this software. Worse yet, this software is the only way to update the Cricut firmware.Provo could at least release a small OSX driver-like software to perform such updates, or better yet do what the Slice does and put the updates on newer cartridges.The FAQ on Provo's site claims that "several voices" have been asking about a Mac version and that they are seriously looking into it. But it has said that for months and months, probably even a year or two now.There are 75 million users of OSX worldwide. If only one in three thousand of those users owns a Cricut, that means Provo Craft is ignoring 25,000 existing customers.Not acceptable.
These arrived with many beads missing.  The envelope had no padding and the plastic pouch inside was torn and smaller beads missing.  Very disappointing.Color was NOT at all like photo.  Nothing vibrant about the colors.  Not recommended at all.
I tried these scissors and didn't find anything special about them.  I'm used to the Gingher's brand so in comparison these were disappointing.  I don't understand why people get so excited about these scissors.
The amount of water that sprays out of the valve on these tubes is way too much.  They need to redesign this so that it comes out as a much finer mist, especially if you are using this to spritz a water solution mixed with their perfect pearls powder to give your project a shimmery effect. The "only" purpose for which I feel these misters are useful for is when I squish their distress ink onto a craft sheet and then add water with this spritzer so I can use the Ranger Distress Inks to paint with using a paintbrush.  Also, the location of the nozzle is really hard to see, at least with the clear color misters which are the ones I purchased, because there isn't a different dot of color at the nozzle, so you can easily accidentally spritz water in a direction you don't want it to go (ie. on a nice piece of paper on your work surface).  If you have any empty Tattered Angels "glimmer mist" bottles, keep them!  The nozzle does provides a lighter mist, which is much more effective if you want to spritz the water/perfect pearls solution.
I have always had great luck with Sulky brand products until using this stabilizer. It doesn't adhere to the fabric. I have tried it several times, on different fabrics, both unwashed and pre-washed, even tried it using different irons. It just doesn't stay adhered to the fabrics. I hope to find a stabilizer that will work, as I do a lot of applique..and for machine applique using a stabilizer makes the process much easier, and the finished product turns out great. Just very disappointed in this stabilizer.
UPDATE April 2013:  It appears the blades I am getting from Amazon have a high rate of getting bad blades.  The prices change frequently too.  I guess I better just take my chances and order directly from Pazzles, even though their packages take an entire 7 days to reach me and they cost more. I feel so stuck with this machine because I can't buy supplies locally.Wow!  I just bought these blades at Amazon on Sept 1, 2011 for 11.99 and they are now $15 in Dec 2011?!  WTH!!I have come to the conclusion I bought a bad batch of blades.  They are dull!The blade that was sent to me from Pazzles worked great, but both of the blades in my packaging would not cut properly.  I had to go back to my old blade just so I can get a clean cut (had to do more passes).  I thought just one of the new blades were defective, so I tested it against the old blade, cutting out the same design, but of course a lower blade setting on the new blade.  The old blade cut better.  I tried the second new blade and again the cuts were awful.  I've had to go back to my original blade, but I must get new blades because my old blade has to have a higher setting to cut cleaner.  All in all, I expected new blades, but these were really bad.I compared one of the new blades (the one I didn't throw out) to the old blade and low and behold the new blade is rounded at the tip and the old blade tip is pointed!!!I am really disappointed.  I usually don't get defective products sent from Amazon, but this time I did and I don't think I can return the blades.  Money wasted.
Worst quality ever
It shifted to the left and my needle went through it, from there on it ripped and ripped until it was in shreds.
UPDATE 3:Do not be fooled, this machine does not cut chipboard thicker than .022 chipboard (they advertise cutting up to 2mm thick material).  Anything that requires more than one "pass" will falter/misalign (at least all 3 machines I've had).UPDATE 2:The machine they sent to me in Dec 2011 had a motherboard die.  I am having to send yet another machine back to Pazzles.UPDATE1:Since I made this review, I am on my third machine from Pazzles (3 machines since July 2011).  Yes, customer service is good, but what good is customer service when you have to keep sending the machine back?  I have spent more time without the machine than I've had it.I figured out today why I heard rattling and found that 2 of 3 screws were missing from the blue cover next to the blade holder.  If I had not had 2 extra 3mm metal screws (that I originally bought for my Pen tool), I would have had to wait even longer to find screws to fit to keep the blue cover from rattling.I was led to believe my machine was being "repaired".  They did not send me the original repaired machine back (which means new problems).  They sent a whole different machine back that caused problems with the Pro 2010 software I bought.  Somehow, the 2 registration numbers had been used and I was unable to use my software.  You only get 3 times to register the upgraded software serial number.  I thought I was getting back a repaired machine, but got a whole new one, which is why I could not use the expensive software I purchased.  Each time a different machine is used, a serial number has to be registered.  Imagine my surprise when I got a pop up box stating I had maxed out on serial numbers!  Fortunately, Pazzles gave me another serial number so that I could use the software.Just like another reviewer stated, this machine is not reliable.  My main problem is that Pazzles obviously feels that Quality Control is not important.  Getting a new machine is fine, but I want a new machine that works, not another machine with different problems._________________I purchased my Pazzles directly from Pazzles.  I ordered it on 7/7 and didn't get it until 7/18.  I used it for two days and had to return it on 7/21.  I was really disappointed.  Now I have to wait to get it back on 7/28 and hope it works.  I am really afraid, but I'm trying to be positive.  I can't understand why vendors don't fully test their machines before they send them to customers.  I know they want to make money, but jeez, it would be a lot better to have happy customers who can recommend the product to others.  At this point, I can't recommend the machine, at least not yet.
I bought this thread holder after reading all the reviews associated with Thread Art Embroidery Thread.Polyester Embroidery Thread Set - 40 Spools (500 meter spools/40 wt.) - Set C Vivid Colors. Basically, the bottom line is that if you have this tiny little spool of thread it will be all kinked up & not perform so well unless you use a thread holder and give the thread the space to unravel before you thread your machine. The reviewer was correct. I've found a thread stand actually helps improve tension on most all my projects, as such, I use it all the time.  Note: I have a very expensive top of the line sewing & embroidery machine & a chepo machine.  I have found the thread holder makes a big difference on both machines & all types of thread spools, big & small.THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THIS PARTICULAR THREAD HOLDER. It's made of super lightweight plastic which was not 'cleaned up' so well at the factory - meaning there are many ways to snag your thread. Also, the entire holder sways around & sometimes even tips over.  As another reviewer noted - I was shocked at the poor quality.Don't repeat my mistake. I wish I'd have known before I bought this Stand, but there were no reviews detailing this issue.  Save your money and, for not much more, buy a nice metal thread holder. It's worth it. I've had my holder for 10 month and the problems I've described are escalating.  I assume a metal one will last you a lifetime - certainly longer than 1 year.  Once I find & test one I'll review the same.
I read the reviews on this before I bought it, so shame on me for still buying it anyway. I thought this will do to hold a cone of thread if I put it in a place and don't touch it or move it around. WRONG WRONG. It is so cheap, so cheap, so... cheap!  The dowel that is supposed to fit in the middle will not go in without a pounding... it will never come out to take apart and store flat. JUNK!I finally did make it work by putting a few dots of More-Tight (plumber's putty) on the bottom of the spool to hold it in place, a a few dots on the bottom of the base to hold it onto the table surface next to my machine (ROLLS EYES).Don't buy this. Read the other negative reviews and trust that we have no reason to lie about how horrible this plastic junk is. Shame on Dritz... shame on me for not listening to the other reviewers!
The all plastic post  bends right over.  Cheaply made.  I should have listened to the reviews I read and not bought this. It was a waste of money. Please do not buy this.  Believe me, you will be disappointed and sorry.
This is a piece of junk. I replaced it with something that actually does the job that only cost a couple of dollars more and was already put together. I did have to do that locally, but there might be better thread holders available here as well.What looks like a metal bar in the picture is actually a piece of plastic. It doesn't fit into the area it is supposed to go, so the screw that is supposed to hold it to the base can't do its job. And it is supposed to stand straight. It literally began to bow after one or two uses.Don't buy this.
Really it should be a 0 because it dose not work at all. Because it was FISKARS I just knew it would work. The price should be $0.50. Please DO NOT waste your time buying the sharpener.
...but it looks like I'll have to anyway. I followed the directions exactly, and repeated numerous times. All I can figure out is that maybe mine is a dud, or the scissors I have is slightly off. In any case, this is getting tossed along with some dull scissors.
These was warped . The center did not meet with the top therefore it would not spin around as it is made to turn. It was packed on the bottom of the carton and packed well but it was very distorted when it arrived. Las Vegas from Amazon a cold state.Not worth the money.FlimsyAmazon fulfilled its' promise and as soon as they became aware of the problem they issued a return label and free return. No problems with the return.Do not buy this product  if u expect to use it as one piece unless the wrapping problem is fixed!
When I initially plugged this in and set it up to wind a bobbin, the on button did not turn it on.  After futzing with it, I got it to turn on.  I would a number of bobbins on it, but they seemed to wind unevenly and loosely.  I little more futzing produced a slightly better result if I guided the thread with my fingers to get a more even loading.  However, when I used any of the bobbins in my embroidery machine, the machine ended up with a tangled mess in the hook race and destroyed the piece that i was working on.  I rewound each of the bobbins on my sewing machine and had not problem.  I ended up returning it to Amazon.
This would wind my thread in a conical shape which my brother did not like so back it went, pronto.
It seems to be made well but I just haven't gotten around to using it yet. As soon as I do I'll update my review.
I bought this for seed bead crafting however, when cutting the thread it starts to unravel making it impossible to even thread the needle. Not worth the time or money.
I ordered this because I thought it would be a replacement for a serger. WRONG! Its a cheap piece of junk. Useless. I have doubts that it could properly cut butter, let along fabric.
This set was purchased to go along with a new embroidery machine. New to this craft, so I read all of the reviews. It seemed like only a few people were having trouble with this brand so I decided to try it. Well it seems I will be on the list of those with problems. This thread breaks frequently. More important, it simply comes apart. I tried several colors all with the same results. It even jammed my new machine! Not real happy about that! As the saying goes, you only get what you pay for. Considering the cost of machines, it only pays to buy the best. Spend a few more dollars and save lots of aggravation.
It's my oun fault I suppose! I read the reviews about the spools being terrible. But, to be honest, I just didn't get what the reviews were getting at... how can the spool effect the thread??While the thread is nice (not over the top great quality, but nice,) and the colors are flat out beautiful, the spools render it almost useless! I guess I can keep it around for handwork, but I have reached my limit of 20-30 jams, snags, etc in the machine. I have broken 12 needles too. The spools are rough and catch the thread so it won't unwind and the snaps the needles. One flew at my eye and barely missed, but left a cut on my eyelid! That was the last straw! Some of my spools had the extra end piece while others did not and many of them lost yards and yards of thread that simply fell off the end of the spool as the plastic wrap was removed (carefully!) on the first use.These are a beautiful wast of time, waste of needles, waste of money, and are quite dangerous to boot!
The thread I bought as a birthday gift for my sister and I am so embarrassed of the thread.  She said the thread was good quality but it was unable to be used because of the way it was put on the spools.  These spools were falling apart and looked like they were wrapped by hand instead of by machines.
I bought this specifically for my brother se 400. It wa supposedto be compatible and it wasnt. It was a waste of my money. I would not recommend it.
Do not buy this item!!!! They are a cheap knock-off ! They are much smaller and much cheaper quality than true Singer 15J bobbins. They are made of a thinner plastic and the smaller size does not work in my machine, which requires a true 15J bobbin. The usual Chinese QUALITY. These are not, I repeat not real SINGER bobbins. I have requested a refund, but who knows if I will get one. I can only hope that Amazon will stand by me, and that they will drop this item in the future. The third party supplier I purchased these from was EK Store.
I received this just last night I am so disappointed it is beyond words, I hope I could still use them.
These came and when I opened the package I was so not happy.  They are horribly is dis colored,  yellow and I can not use them.  No one is going to buy a set of earrings with these old yellowed backs.  I would be embarrassed to put them on my jewelry.
I wanted this so bad and its just not worth the cost to buy these, you waste material, don't be lazy and just use your ruler, you still cut upto 6 layers with a good blade, you don't have to worry about fabric fitting, its kinda a pain in the butt. I also find you have to have room for the machine.The other templates are great, strips and squares are a waste of money and i spend over a 1000 on all of this and now wish I hadn't. Just use your rulers for strips and squares. You have to have the fabric cut to lay on it and why not just go ahead and cut with your rotary. I do love accuquilt but think long and hard about the trips, squares, so much faster to cut your self with your long 36 inch ruler, less waste of fabric. Buy the other dies that are harder to cut. Keep in mind anything square, retangle,diamonds, strips you can cut yourself and buy those wonderful flower dies, the alpahabet dies and their complicated one's.
They don't work like I thought they would.  Is there some kind of tool used to clamp them on?  Do I use one or two together?
For those looking for a ribbon punch get the one from Fiskers. It's easy to punch AND it works perfectly with 3/8" ribbon. The slots are also a little closer together than the Martha Stewart one. It's also cheaper at $11 from Staples.
Not a good design. The size of holes it punches only fits VERY thin ribbon, so it won't fit most decorative ribbon. If it actually cut holes big enough for ribbon it would be a great design, but it doesn't.
Do not buy these for a Brother SE 400 or a PE 770.  These bobbins do not fit the bobbin re-winder.Now stuck with 50 bobbins that don't work.  I just bought 10 other bobbins off of  Epic Tech and they are the same to small for the bobbin re-winder.  So know I have 60 useless bobbins
Disappointed. These will not fit on the pin to wind the bobbin on my Brother PE 770 machine.  The diameter is too small.
These look like they were made by grade school children (and I do not mean to insult grade school children).  These are simply very low-quality beads.  Some of them were chipped or broken, but even the beads that weren't were just poorly made.  These were definitely not worth this price, and I hope Amazon.com takes note.  It really is worth saving your money and purchasing  good-quality lampwork glass beads.  There are so many beautiful ones available.  I do not recommend these at all.
These are not genuine Singer bobbins. Made in China from flimsy, thin, cheap plastic. Save your money. Spend a little more and get the real thing. These did not fit my machine, which requires a 15J bobbin
This is one of the biggest disappointment yet, I ordered it mainly for the nylon jaws pliers and the crimping pliers because I have most of the other tools but this did not live up to its explanation. The handle of the nylon jaws pliers will soon break since the metal is far above the end of the rubber and the rubber came with a crack. I am really disappointed because I was looking for to receiving this. I really would not recommend this to anyone.
I misread the description. I thought that this was a container with a cover. I had to return it since I didn't want to leave the thread uncovered
I tried to decorate a baby onesie with the product today & I give up.  Everything started out okay.  I even went to the avery website to use their Design & Print Online program that was advertised for use with this product.  That was easy.  Got my design all printed out & ready to go.  Doing great so far.  Now, I can't get the backing peeled off as the instructions say to do.  Tried twice with two separately printed designs.  It's just not working.  Once, I guess what's supposed to be the part you iron on came off in flakes.  It was like you could just scratch it off.  I'm through wasting time on this product.
I chose the foot priced 1 cent with $4.95 shipping. If this offer had not been on Amazon I never would have even considered this price. I received someone else's order. My address label was on the box but her order and invoice was inside the box. I immediately informed the company of their error. I thought they would have me send the item back to them and they would pay the postage, and then send me my item at the agreed price. The next thing I heard from them was a request to return the item and I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE POSTAGE. What? Why should I pay for their error? I tried to call Amazon customer service but the call went to the Philippines and the girl was obviously reading a script. She said my only option was to call the seller. I knew from previous experience that was not correct. I emailed customer service and was told to go ahead and reorder the item from Amazon and they would refund the postage so essentially I got the $4.95 foot with free postage. I did so. I have not heard from the company who sold the 1 cent item and am very upset that they did not refund the price of the item and the postage.This is the third order I have placed with outside vendors on Amazon in the last 6 weeks that has gotten messed up. One was an electrical part that did not work and we had to send it back twice, we paid the postage on the second return. Next I ordered envelopes to send my hand made Christmas cards, and a book. I got an email saying the envelopes were damaged in shipment and would not be replaced so the whole order was cancelled including the book I had ordered from Amazon. Now this messed up order. What is going on with Amazon???
I bought this from Amazon as a Gold Box sale at about $12.  I  wasn't expecting anything great and I figured for the price, how bad can it be?I purchased this from Amazon as a Gold Box sale item for about $12.  I wasn't expecting anything great and I figured for the price, how bad can it be?  Turns out, it can be real bad.  I'll go into details below.  However, if you want to save time, stop reading after this sentence and if you want to avoid wasting your money then please do not buy this.The scissors are all plastic and snapped in two the first time we tried to cut something.  It was a 1/8&#34; ribbon.  The stapler doesn't work.  The pencil sharpener isn't sharp and won't sharpen pencils.The markers, at least the few that weren't dried out, left dull, uneven lines.  The crayons manage to color, if a bit unevenly, if you press hard enough.  That is, until they break.  The water color paints, leave thin, dull, uneven coats.Every piece must have been selected with the only criteria being lowest cost.  Things get even more interesting after you try to use this thing for a few hours.  Then the various pens and pencils don't stay in their &#34;places&#34;.  The result is a confusing mess when you open the case.Save yourself some disappointment and possible embarrassment and, from what I just saw from the listing, save yourself way more than this &#34;thing&#34; is worth by buying something else.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  Please let me know if you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.
it was in no way what it was to be  ,I had to order it from brother  its not the same thing at all 3rd party copy of the extension table for my brother PE-420 I paid 30.00 more to get the rite thing same number but in no way same extension table . I got my money back and returned it to the sender.  so buyer be ware .
I used this tape runner in the past with good success and decided to use it to make gift tags:  two pieces of die cut card stock glued together.  And after I've made dozens I noticed that they are starting to come undone.  The glue doesn't hold when it comes to anything heavier than regular paper, that is why I give this 1 star only.  Permanent should mean just that:  Permanent, not 30 minutes and then fall apart.I had to re-glue every single tag with Aleene's Acid Free Tacky Glue, and now it holds.  That glue is about 1/5 of the price of the expensive tape runner and a heck of a lot better.  Lesson learned.
These beads are very poor quality.  They are not even close to being the same quality as Murano Glass.  The glass is so misshapen, poorly colored and you can see through the glass to the metal in some places.  Please do not waste your money on these like I did.
My husband and I were trying to use it and we wasted a ton of paper.  It is really hard to use and the impossible to blend the corner punch with the side one.  NOT HAPPY!
My bad: I thought they were bigger. I'll have to work on my metric measurements, but these are smaller than any other beads I own. Smaller than a grain of rice, maybe if you broke the rice in half. They are also extremely cheap, even for their low price. I won't be buying these again.
I bought 2 of these and it is a complete disaster to sew with.  I have 2 embroidery machines, Brother SE 400 and PE 770.  The stitching is loose and the thread cutter on the machine will not even cut it.  It is a weird thread, it is silky and thin.
I brought this and didnt get it to work. Tried everything. Waste of money plan on returning the item. I did everything it said to do and nothing was ever completed.
I have a Kenmore, which was made by Janome. This foot did not fit my machine. Frankly, these feet from Distinctive are fairly expensive, and really are NOT the do all and end all of sewing machine feet. They are not any better than other feet.
I deeply wish this thread wasn't such garbage. I've tried everything to try and get it to stitch without breakage and it's impossible. If you have the patience to deal with the breakage or aren't trying to sell anything with this thread than it has beautiful results. Not worth the aggravation in the least.
1 star because it arrived.Gorgeous colors. Okay, so why such a negative review?- Thread isn't wound on spool correctly, pieces just fall off. Really ??- Spools are hard to get started. Really hard!- Can't use spool holder and my machine won't let me just let it stand up. Why is that a bit deal?--- Because the tension gets all messed up and the thread constantly breaks!*** Then it broke my machine's needle, at which point I sighed and packed it up to go back.Resist the gorgeous colors, unless you love frustration.
I had always wanted to try one of these security stamps for their advertised ease of use and portability.However this product fails miserably at its main task of camouflaging sensitive information.I did the following tests on a stack of junk credit card offers that included both glossy and non-glossy paper:1) Using an indelible ink eraser/ ballpoint pen ink eraser2) Using baby wipes3) Using facial cleaning wipes4) Using waterproof eye makeup remover pads5) Using water-soluble eye makeup remover pads6) Using non-acetone nail polish remover soaked Q-tip7) Using acetone-based nail polish remover soaked Q-tip8) Isopropl alcohol packets9) Purell hand sanitizing wipes.10) Clorox wipes11) Mr. Clean spongeThe above tests where done on freshly stamped ink, ink a day old and ink 2 days old.Test results: across all methods freshly stamped ink was easier to remove than older ink.  Of all  tests above only the first method failed to show sensitive info but that was because the scratchy eraser took off the top bits of paper and the original ink along with it.  The waterproof eye make up remover effectively removed all the security ink but the paper absorbed a lot of oil.  The Mr. Clean sponge was rather wet, but once allowed to dry a bit, gently wiping the ink repeatedly removed enough that by holding the paper up to the light you could make out my name and a bits of my zip code.  Basically all methods above did remove the ink to varying degrees and there was enough show-thru when the paper was held up to the light to render this product ineffective at hiding anything.  This product, as mentioned in the online product description and on the product packing does not work at all on anything vaguely glossy (i.e. coated paper, post-it notes).Other CONS:1) the stamp itself is small and most shipping labels are quite large.  So multiple stamps are needed therefore increasing ink usage.2) The security print is too simple and multiple impressions needed to be made for more security.  Again more ink is consumed.PROS:1)There is a plastic tray for the stamp to sit in so any bits of wet ink left on the shallow rubber feet on the corners of the stamp will not transfer to your other documents or your desk.2) Lightweight and definitely more portable than a shredder.Conclusion:This product is a great idea that unfortunately does not do what the regular person needs it to do: 1) hide sensitive information from ID thieves and dumpster divers 2) help easily hide personal information on credit card offers and the like.I would however still recommend this product as a solution against the casual or opportunistic nosy person, say in the office environment for documents waiting to be securely shredded, for the home office for documents in the shred pile.
My mom bought this and needed me to show her how to use it because it is her first one and I have a couple Fiskars paper trimmers.  The first time I slid the blade across to show her how,,, THE WIRE SNAPPED, HIT ME AND ALMOST CUT ME!!!  None of mine have wires so that took me by surprise.  I'm glad it was me that the wire hit and not my 75 year old mom!!!.  She contacted Fiskars and they sent out a new one but I won't let my mom use it.....I gave her one of mine since I really don't need all that I have.I think the wire is dangerous and unnecessary.  I have read that people cut them off....good idea.  I think Fiskars needs to just stop making it that way.
There was a time when a Singer sewing machine was the top of the line and could be counted on to last for many years; unfortunately, those days seem to be in the past.  The Singer 5532 32-Stitch Heavy Duty Sewing Machine is not very impressive.  First of all, the machine seems to be made primarily of plastic.  The description mentions a metal frame but honestly, if it is there, it is well hidden.  The housing is plastic as are most of the levers.  The presser foot lever is made of an extremely cheap looking white plastic similar to the plastic used on disposable condiments.  The machine comes with a "cover".  The plastic used on the cover is somewhere between a trash bag and a ziplock freezer bag.  I can't imagine that it will last a year let alone multiple years.There are plastic screw adjustments on the machine which have to be made with a coin.  Seriously?  The company couldn't spring for an inch of plastic to allow the user to made adjustments without pulling out a quarter?So, after the initial shock of finding a Heavy Duty machine is made mostly of plastic, I started attempting to sew with it.  I say attempting because in less than an hour, the machine jammed multiple times.  I was only trying to go through its stitch functions and it jammed at the bobbin repeatedly.  I finally gave up after the fourth tangle.  Considering that I was using quilting cotton fabric, it should not have been so difficult.  I had serious problems stitching more than four layers which is not at all unusual when sewing a quilt.  I can't imagine trying four layers of denim or canvas which was what I had planned to use the Heavy Duty machine for.I've used sewing machines for more than thirty years and I've never had such a poor experience with any brand.  I knew that Singer was not as reliable as it once was but I had no idea how far it had fallen.  I have an older Singer Serger that I love.  I also have a couple of Janome machines and a wonderful Brother quilting machine. I can't recommend this Singer for any use whatsoever.  If you are in the market for a good metal Heavy Duty machine, I suggest looking at Janome; if you are wanting a good but inexpensive machine with a variety of stitches, I suggest both Brother and Janome.  It may be that Singer has machines that are of good or at least usable quality but the Singer 5532 is not one of them.
I'm so disappointed, because I can't get this machine to work properly at all. I set it up and wound up a fresh bobbin (one of the stainless steel ones that came with the machine), and attempted to sew 2 pieces of lightweight cotton together. It sounded fine, felt normal, and looked right on the top side of the fabric, but when I flipped it over, there was a huge mess of unraveling bobbin thread on the underside. We've all had this happen before (though I've never seen anything unwind quite this much thread), so I removed the bobbin and rethreaded it. The exact same thing happened. So, I rethreaded the top thread AND the bobbin and tried again - same result. It really seemed like I must be threading the bobbin incorrectly, so I consulted the manual and tried again. It looks right, it feels right. When I thread the bobbin and give it a little tug, the tension feels correct. Yet, when sewing pieces of fabric together, I still get the same huge amount of thread-nesting on the bottom.So, I thought maybe the thread I was using wasn't right for the machine - it was a pretty old spool and thread texture was a bit light & thin. So I tried a fairly new spool of sturdy, smooth Coats & Clark Dual Duty all-purpose thread. Wound a brand new bobbin (again, one of the stainless steel ones that came with the machine) and threaded it all up. Gave both the top and bottom threads a little tug to make sure there was just enough tension, and there was. Ran another section of lightweight cotton through, and got the same thing as before: nesting. The bobbin seems to be unwinding at an alarming rate, nearly emptying itself after just 6 inches of sewing. Unthreaded and rethreaded, same result. Consulted the manual again, and rethreaded the bobbin a few more times: same result. Tried adjusting the tension wheel, changing the needle, changing the needle position, tried some different stitches, tried going faster, going slower, going backwards: no matter what I did, the same giant wad of thread gets all tangled up on the underside of the fabric.I've been doing basic sewing for almost 30 years - I'm not an expert by any means, but I understand how to do the general things like winding a bobbin, threading a machine, and attaching two pieces of fabric together. Different machines have variations on how to do these things, but the underlying method is pretty similar across the board. Even so, I still suspected I was doing something wrong so I called a very experienced seamstress friend and described what was happening. She talked me through the threading process and looked at photos of what I was doing (via the phone - I love technology!), and she couldn't see anything wrong either. I brought the machine to visit another experienced seamstress, one who has taught sewing classes for 14 years, and she couldn't see where I was going wrong either. Everything looks correct, sounds right, feels right, but it just doesn't work.After trying all these different ways to get it to sew without all that thread-nesting, we've decided that something crucial has to be misaligned. Probably the bobbin casing, but I can't be sure until I take it to a sewing machine repair-person to take it apart. I read some of the other Amazon reviews, and it sounds like almost everyone else was able to pop the thread in and get going immediately with no problems. I'm no expert, but definitely not a novice, and no machine should be this hard to get running. I think it's probably a good product in general, and I just managed to receive a broken one. Things happen.My current go-to machine is aBrother HC1850 Computerized Sewing and Quilting Machine with 130 Built-in Stitches, 9 Presser Feet, Sewing Font, Wide Table, and Instructional DVDwith lots of frou-frou embroidery stitches, so I was looking forward to having this Singer as a backup for heavy-duty projects or high-volume days where I have to sew miles & miles of headbands in one weekend for a craft fair. The Brother is terrific, and really works fine for basic projects as well as fancy ones, but I worry that one day I'll beat it to death by trying to do hundreds of straight stitches super-fast for days on end! I'm very disappointed that it's been so hard to get the Singer 5532 working, but I will probably take it to a repair shop and try to get it going eventually. The motor seems very strong and very FAST, so it would be fantastic to have around if I can get it to go fast AND turn out a beautiful result! It just stinks that it doesn't work the way it should right away. If I can get it working, I'll write an updated review as soon as I can!
EDIT/UPDATE: These stupid crap spools have now ruined countless projects. If you thread them beneath the spool as my machine dictates, they become wound around the spool pin because the spool cap doesn't fit neatly inside the small end of the spool. If you thread them above the spool, they fit into the larger spool cap perfectly but continually get caught on the bobbin winder. Either way, first they get stuck, then they yank the bobbin thread through the project, then the needle snaps in half. I wish I could give this thread a rating of negative infinity! DO NOT BUY if your machine feeds thread from below the spool, it will not work!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -I don't really follow color charts; I look at what the design is going to require and what color fabric base I'll be using, and sometimes vary widely from the recommended colors for a particular pattern. If you prefer to follow color charts exactly, you may have a problem with these for two reasons. First, based on the other reviews, these color numbers may not match up with your machine's brand or your pattern's advise. Second, the color number is printed on a sticker at the end of the spool, which must be removed before use. Maybe you could peel it off carefully and stick it carefully somewhere inside the bottom of the spool, I'm not sure.I have a Brother DZ820E, which is basically the same as a PE770. It came with a starter pack of Radiant Thread, which worked great, so I sought this brand specifically. The thread is nice quality, rich colors, and usually moves smoothly through the needle and inner mechanisms of the machine. With 100 spools, you obviously get a pretty good variety, but I was disappointed to not see more shades of gray and no "peach" that looks quite right for a caucasian skin tone (I like to embroider a lot of pinup-girl motifs). Also, be aware that these are are 550 yards, so they're about 1/2 the size of what I was used to - the spools themselves are shorter in height, not thinner wound. There are plenty of infrequently-used colors that should last a good long time on a small spool, but for things like black, you'll run out extremely fast. Wish they could have skipped a shade or two of bright orange and thrown in an extra black.Though the thread is nice, the spools are hateful little things! They are the main reason for the 3-star review. They are cheap plastic, with rough edges where the thread occasionally gets caught. The worst part though, for my machine, is that they don't fit tight to the spool cap for mounting on my horizontal spool pin - other brands I've purchased (Marathon, ThreadArt) fit neatly into the spool cap like a puzzle piece and rarely get tangled around the pin. These spools leave a small angled gap between the cap and the spool, and the thread gets wound up around the pin CONSTANTLY, stopping the supply of thread to the machine & needing to be rethreaded every single time. It is extremely annoying and hard to prevent. In fact, just as I was typing this, some thread got tangled up so tightly around the spool pin that it actually snapped off the end of the needle way down at the other end of the sewing machine.I've had almost no fraying with this brand of thread, but the spools are just too much of a pain for me to ever buy these again. I've got the ThreadArt sets back on my wish list and will just have to try and supervise these spools as much as I can to try and keep them unwinding smoothly off the spools.
Installed the cutting blade, and the attached plastic circle that is removed once the blade is seated came off so quick that it stabbed my index finger...Got past that with a band aid, and attempted to cut a 4&#34; circle - paper bunched up; faulty design!! Returning
Pure junk! It's only purpose is to stick paper to mat & it doesn't do that for more than a few days.
I read the instructions and watched some videos but they didn't seem to help much.  When I tried embossing folders the results were disappointing.  The card stock wrinkled and sometimes the embossing cut clear through the paper.  Using the Spellbinders Shapeabilities die's - some worked beautifully and others  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  I had a rectangular die with lots of scroll work.  It took me six tries to get the perfect look.  The die wouldn't cut on one side, the embossing cut through the paper.  I tried repositioning the dies and I followed one of the videos that I had watched.  I wasted good paper and I was very upset that it took me so long to get a simple cut and emboss.  I am returning the Spelllbinders Grand Calibur Die Cutting Machine and I will get a Cuttle Bug.  I am very satisfied with the Circuit products that I use.
I am buying this kit because I really want it and know it is fabulous.  however, I really don't like amazon's repeated practice of not giving the measurements of what you are about to buy in the description of the product.  I have stopped using amazon for any item that they don't give measurements on or if the measurements are incorrect.  they are really bad about craft punches.  how are you supposed to know if it is what you want or not?the measurements on this item are written: o inches high, 0 inches deep and 0 inches w.  they didn't even forget to put them in. they took the time to type in the wrong numbers.well, I am breaking my own rule of not buying the measurement free items, but only because I have seen it and know how big it is. and this is why I gave them only one star.  i'm fed up.thanks for reading my rant.  oh by the way,  this is a wonderful set of tools and they make the difference between kind of cheap looking flowers without the tools, to very professional flowers with the tool. using the tool in a circular motion breaks down the cardstock and makes it easier to style.  you get much more realistic flower results.
I wish the description had been clearer (or I had bothered to read others' reviews!).  I was so disappointed-- assembled, this would not even hold a standard gift card or business card.  Who has that little to say?
This software didn't work for me.  It keeps locking up my computer by freezing and totally dropping my pattern.  I'm sure this won't happen to all people.  I'm a computer fixer from way back and I can't see why it's freezing up.  I wish everyone well with this software and hope it works for them.
This software purchase was a great disappointment.  Too much money for too little performance.  It claims to make it possible to load in other fonts, but it is not an easy process, and then when I purchased a new computer and tried to reload it, that feature has disappeared.  I have worked in software most of my life, and I know a bad product when I see one.
I purchased this ruffler from a different company, and i sure wished i had read the reviews on this particular ruffler. I have over 50 years experience with sewing on different sewing machines. Well this ruffler DOES NOT WORK on a BROTHERS CS6000 computerized sewing machine. It was a little challenging to get it connected to my sewing machine. Adjusted the needle position for it to go into the tiny hole, but it still broke the needle several times and made a nest of bobbin threads under it. JAMMED my machine over and over again. I have used ruffler feet in the past, so i understand how they work. Decided to just go back to using my tried and true OLD 100 year old Treadle Singer sewing machine with the ruffler attachment that came with it. That works perfectly, just tiresome for the legs and feet to keep treadling the foot pedal. My other tried and true method is using a cording foot and zig zag over the cord and pull the gathers on it. PLEASE DON't WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS RUFFLER. Go to a reputable sewing machine dealership and bring your machine and have them put on the CORRECT foot for it. Have them demonstrate how it works on your machine. IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND A LOT OF HEADACHE.Update. Everything should be given a second chance. Tried it again on my Brothers CS6000 sewing machine, still does not work on it. Then i tried it on a older model Brothers sewing machine, and this time it did work like it needed to. Guess that it is like most of the rufflers made the same kind of styling like the original ones made years ago. If you have an older model sewing machine, then this pretty much should work on it. I think the newer model sewing machines just don't have enough clearence for this attachment to work properly. Like i said, it does work on my older brothers sewing machine that has manual settings instead of automatic settings. Glad i didn't have to throw it in the garbage. Really need a ruffler for the curtains i was making for my kitchen. Love my old 100 year old singer, but also like the ease of electric powered sewing machines for the speed in getting projects done. So, in all, a little bit of trying on diffrent machines does give diffrent results.
I purchased this for my brother machine and it was very hard to get on. Yes I have a low shank machine and this is for low shanks machines but it didn't fit right. The black bottom part scrubbed the feed dogs. Once it was adjusted it didn't want to adjust again and felt like if I pushed too hard it would break. I sent it back and ordered me a janome brand for my janome machine. It is 1000 times better!
I could not line up the needle to fit through the ruffler.  I adjusted/positioned the needle as much as possible but could not get it to go through the ruffler.  I would have broken needles.  I was very disappointed.  I sent an email to Weidner CS with no response.  I received emailed instructions from Amazon on how to return the item.  I printed the label and returned the ruffler in original packaging materials along with printed instructions for its use--i mailed it back to the seller's address via Priority Mail.  Cost was $6 shipping to return.  Even if I get the refund which has not happened, I'll be out a minimum of $6 with no item.  If I never receive the refund I'll be out $16 for this ten dollar item.  Right now I have no idea if it was received or if I'll ever see a dollar returned on this $9.98 item.  It was not worth the hassel and I suggest reading every review on sewing machine items to see if your machine has problems with the item fitting--even though the seller lists your machine as compatible.
This does NOT fit either of my Brother machines. It doesnnot fit my Singer machine. This is second time I've bought a universal part and the second time I've been disappointed.. I am NOT a novice, so I do know what works and what doesn't.  I've returned it for credit, and ordered the genuine Brother Ruffler foot. Sometimes we have to spend more to get quality.I wish the seller would list exactly what models they THINK these after market parts fit. It would be extremely helpful, as I see the only one making money on this deal was UPS !
Does not work on blades
Not sure why I bought product.  Thought it would make things easier to trace but it really did't help.  I was better off just making dots and cutting them out with razor knife.  OH well..win some loose some.  Too much trouble and effort for what i needed it for.
I LOVE all SIL products... except for this. This has a weird angle and ended up ruining a mat. I actually went and purchased the &#34;bugs&#34; brand of spatula. Hope you revise your design SIL.
These mix tiny glass beads were the worse out of all the beads I bought through Amazon. They were shaped differently and I had to use a bead reamer to adjust the holes. They came in a bubbled wrap envelope and was not in a zip lock Baggie. Thankful that I open my packages carefully other wise I would of spilled those tiny bead everywhere.  I thought to send them back but didn't want all the shipping hassle. The price of them was the only thing I liked about them.  Also it took the longest to be shipped.
I can't recommend these because many of them are stuck together. When you try to separate them, the paint peels off of one leaving a big clump on the other, which when you remove the clump, removes paint from it. So all the beads that are stuck together are unusable. The colors are beautiful and the size is great, such a shame the quality is poor.
1st off, these beads are PLASTIC, not glass. The one side is pretty, it looks like there is glitter inside & sort of a crackle design... The other side has ugly metallic paint that looks like someone just dabbed some on & went to the next one very quickly. I will NOT buy these again, nor anything else from this company! It'll probably cost more to return them than they cost, so I may just throw them away. VERY DISAPPOINTED! :(
The beads were not like the picture, they were painted with bright colors, different color from bead itself, on half of each bead & most were peeling & or chipped. I've bought these beads from other vendors & they were lovely & matched the picture & description, but not the ones I got from this place. There was no way I could use these, they're ugly, chipped, peeling & cheap looking, they were garbage & like all garbage they went in the trash!
PLASTIC! These are not glass!!! I took a razor to a brown one and kept shaving off pieces. I will put it in the oven to see if it melts but so far it looks and sounds,feels like plastic!
These are a great size, but a great deal of them are stuck together. Getting them apart peels the paint off one bead and leaving a lump on the other. When you remove the excess, it damages the other bead. Cannot recommend.
This big old thing was a total waste of money. The toe is so big, it gets in its own way, and certainly does not make it easier to use. It hops up and down, pop, pop, pop, clunky, clickety thing. Save your money. But all plastic darning/quilting foot and clip out the round circle to make it a half-circle toe. Past this EXPENSIVE foot up.
These are not as bright as the ones I purchased previously. Some are very dull, like these a film or glue on the stones, some were missing stones altogether. I had to pick through & throw a bunch away. Will find another vendor if I buy again, as these were disappointing.
These cheaply made, low-quality Rondelle spacer beads are in no way Swarovski quality.  The &#34;crystals&#34; do not have the beautifully cut facets or the shine or Swarovski products.  The metal is light-weight and cheap.  I can not use these in my jewelry.  BEWARE:  the product description is not accurate.
I didn't receive the second cutter the ad stated. I have attempted to contact them three times. I did contact them on two other occasions to ask technical questions and was impressed with their service. That was before I purchased this kit with the additional design software and pens. It could be mis- communications, unfortunately the only access I have to them is e-mail, a 800 # (which I'm not getting a response) or Amazon reviews. I have been looking at a kit for 2 days that I would love to explore. Since there is a ding on the top of the machine (should not affect performance and is barely noticeable) I will not download the software in case there are other problems that I will need to contact them for or return the product. If it is indeed mis-communications I will be happy to alter my review accordingly.
I was so super excited to get this.  I did one project with no problem.  The next project?  all of a sudden the paper will not load correctly to cut.  No matter what I do there is nothing to fix this.  Customer support from Silhouette is terrible... to basically nothing.  You pay top dollar and they can't even give you an owners manual?  There are no listing for error codes...a few videos on YouTube that do not cover my problems with this.  At this point, I think it is best to return it...and stick with my Cricut...stay away from this POS....nothing but trouble
My mom taught me the basics of sewing when I was in elementary school. I never did learn to do very complicated projects, but it's still safe to say I have been sewing for about 30 years. I learned on Mom's heavy-duty Viking, and have owned at least 4 machines of my own - everything from Walmart's cheapest no-brand model to a 100-lb all-steel antique attached to it's own desk. My current machine is a mid-range Brother that does a few fancy stitches, and the machine before that was a very low-end model that basically made straight lines or zig-zags. What I'm trying to say is, I'm neither a sewing newbie nor a mega-feature snob; I know what I'm doing and appreciate a workhorse machine over a showhorse. I sew almost every day, to make inventory for my Etsy shop, so I thought it would be nice to have a basic model for backup in case something happens to my primary machine (or on the rare occasion that someone who wants to help me sew).Unfortunately, this Singer is an utter disappointment. For starters, I've never used a horizontally-oriented top thread and it just felt all wrong. I'm not sure which direction it should be unspooling, or if there really is a right or wrong way, but it just felt like the tension was all wonky and there was a lot of potential for knots and snags. It honestly didn't seem to cause any problems that I could see, but I just don't get it. It doesn't feel sturdy at all.I have used a front-loading bobbin before, this exact style as a matter of fact, so while it isn't as convenient as the newer drop-in bobbin housings, it's not a problem for me. Another reviewer mentioned that you have to slide off the front half of the platform every time you change the bobbin; I actually just leave it off all the time, but if you like a deeper platform that would definitely be a pain in the butt. If I were new to sewing, as I suspect most people looking for a cheap, basic machine are, I would have a much harder time using this front-loading bobbin over a drop-in. I've tried to teach newbies to use front-loaders before; it can be pretty confusing and it's very easy to mess up the thread tension.As several other reviewers have mentioned, the automatic needle threader does not work well at all. It's not a great feature on any other machine I've tried; it's always hard to get the angle and tension just right so it catches the thread to pull through. But this Singer really feels flimsy and it's a challenge to get the threader arm to hold on before even trying to get it to catch and pull through! After several attempts, I did get it to work, but it seemed to fray and damage the thread on the way through. It was not particularly thick thread, just the basic Dual Duty Plus that I use all the time for lots of projects. I suppose it doesn't matter that much if the tails are damaged because they get snipped off the final project anyway, but it just doesn't seem like a decent machine should damage your thread before even starting to sew.Another reviewer mentioned that there is no automatic needle positioning, you need to use the hand crank to get it into the right spot. I've always used hand-crank machines so it didn't feel odd to me, however this may have a lot to do with the problems people are having with the automatic threader. The needle needs to be in the EXACT correct position for the threader to line up, and millimeters do matter. Most other machines I've seen that have an automatic threader also have automatic needle setting, because it's so important that the position is perfect. This would be very frustrating for newbies and veterans alike.Another complaint, albeit a minor one (and not unique to this machine), is that the power cord is very short. Be prepared to either sit RIGHT next to the power outlet or to use an extension cord. I have my sewing desk situated just a few feet away from the wall so I can face outward into the room, and the cord did not reach. Bummer.And the biggest problem of all: I could not get the Singer to make more than 2-3 stitches without jamming! Forwards or backwards, both directions jammed almost instantly while attempting to sew through just 2 layers of basic lightweight cotton. There wasn't even any big knot of misfired thread around the bobbin, which happens sometimes on any machine if the tension is wrong; I couldn't see a reason for the jams at all. It just would make 2-3 stitches and be STUCK. Over and over, I had to turn it off, snip the fabric out of the jam, remove and rethread the upper spool and the bobbin, and in 2-3 stitches it would be stuck again. As you might imagine, that's a bit of a deal-breaker!I currently don't have time to spend a few days taking this machine apart and troubleshooting, but when I get some free time I will put more effort into getting it to make basic stitches without jamming. I'm hoping there is something that I'm doing wrong because it would be so nice to have a backup machine on hand, but it's possible I have a lemon that will never work properly. Even if I can get it to stop jamming, I still am not thrilled with a lot of the other features as mentioned above. If you know what you are doing and are willing to put time and effort into getting this machine to do it's job, it's very inexpensive but is NOT easy to use. I would NEVER recommend this for someone new to sewing. Even if it doesn't jam up, the basics are not streamlined or easy to use. Sewing is supposed to be fun, and this is a headache.
I have had this about a month now, but because it did not arrive anywhere near the date it was supposed to, I had to go to Hobby Lobby and just buy some stabilizer to hold me over. I started using this yesterday and HOLY COW! By far the WORST stabilizer I have ever used! I don't get what is going on with it. It is destroying my shirts and thread. Every shirt I have used this one so far it has caused giant holes on them. Shredding my thread. I know it's not any other issue either. The only difference is the stabilizer. Every shirt I was working on the same day before this happened had no issues. And I have no problems with my thread when I work on a different project with different stabilizer. I have also changed out the needle a couple times. This was clearly a WASTE of money, and it will just have to get tossed into the trash, while I go back to Hobby Lobby and buy some decent stabilizer off the bolt!
it doesn't cut well, i have to use scissors anyways, its a waste of money, i feel like it doesn't have the knives right, probably it was just the one they send me.
Editing my review due to response from Fiskars.  You can't get replacement blades.  The only option for me is to buy a new trimmer.  I'm permanently done with Fiskars products.Probably the only decent product I've gotten from Fiskars in the past 3 or 4 years.  However I have yet to find where to get replacement blades,  Since mine is chipped.
They didn't work just a waste of time and money not happy about this product at all do not order
I am a wedding stationery designer. I bought these in hopes of making applying crystals to paper a little less tedious.  I have realized it is much better to simply buy hotfix crystals and use a heat tool to apply them.The wax tip tends to make the crystals permanently cloudy. The crystals stick the the wax better than they stick to the glue. We tried several times to use these before just throwing them away. The good news is they are cheap so we aren't out very much...
When I ordered these lobster claw clasps, they were the same product I had order approximately a year ago.  The product in the previous order was excellent.  These are not.  One-half of them do not work and the other half barely work.  In addition, it took so long to receive them that I actually forgot that I had ordered them.  I did not know they would ship directly from China.  I used several of the clasps because I was desperate for them but I'm going to have to replace them after all because they are so poorly made and difficult to open.  My suggestion is DO NOT BUY these particular lobster claw clasps.  I am so frustrated and disappointed with this order!
Just got these. While they are pretty, there is NOT 100 in the bag. There is only 70. Too expensive to return so I'm stuck with them  :-(
The head pins are so bent up. I am so disappointed, it is beyond words, I told one of your associated this the last time I spoke to one of them.
I knew I was taking a chance, but hey - it was worth a shot.They look nice, until you actually try to twist them into shape. The silver plating comes right off. I wouldn't recommend buying these, especially if you create jewelry that you expect to sell.
If I were to make kid jewelry it would be ok? They are really not big enough for a lot of my bigger pieces.
These are not at all what I expected and in fact I can't for the life of me figure out what to do with them.
I like a heavier gauge, so that was my fault.  Very light wgt and flimsy. Had to keep straightening them over and over.
I liked the concept and thought I would make lots of cards with this..however....I thought I would just cut it out and it would be done. IIt takes a while to put together  because you have to use glue and match up the pieces. I still have not completed a card since I don't like gluing the parts.I have to admit, there are better and faster ways to make this kind of card.Too expensive for the effort. :(
This machine offers illusions of grandeur.  It is heavy. slow. and easily stops and ejects while trying to send dies through it.Dies do not always cut completely through, the machine is not as well made as the manufacture's make it out to be.I sent it back and they "refurbished" it.  They obviously did not see my, please keep your crap and refund my money request.  It will never come out of the box they shipped it back in.Best thing I can say about it, it is a nice looking heavy door stop.
I ordered these because of the picture on the internet I never thought I would receive those small cheap beats that were sent to me.
...the paint or whatever the coating is comes off and leaves the cutouts on white paper a coppery yuck.  I tried washing them, rubbed them down with rubbing alcohol, it doesn't change a thing, paper looks dirty.If you have noticed the same problem with other Spellbinders dies, PLEASE contact Spellbinders and complain about that.  They claim that nobody in the whole wide world has mentioned anything like that to them about their dies, but I read reviews and know that others are having problems since the dies are made in China.I'd be a lot happier with this die if it weren't for this ugly stain which ruins expensive card stock.  I am about to kiss Spellbinders goodbye if this continues.  These are expensive dies, yet the quality has gone to shoddy at best.Update, June 2013:Spellbinders has acknowledged that there is a problem with their dies leaving unsightly stains which is very noticable on white and light paper.  They are looking into what is causing this and hopefully fix it soon.
I tried this edge puncher as my third edge puncher, and it was horrible. I bought three edge punchers together and my other two designs were easy to handle. Hopefully I just got a bad one, but every other time I pressed it to cut the design, it would stick together. I had to wiggle it quite a bit to open it back up. It was hard to press, I tried many different ways with my hands, both hands in the middle, one hand on each side, one hand on two corners, even pressure, uneven pressure. I was really disappointed, I liked the design, but it isn't worth the frustration.
I love punches and was looking forward to playing with this one.  I was disappointed with the results, it is cumbersome to use and I dislike the die that comes with the base tool.  Spend your money on a nice pretty circle die set.
Taking clues from the pictures, and the reviews, I thought I knew what I was ordering when I did, but I wasn't.From the supposed 100 beads, I only received 94 in 2 Ziploc bags inside a larger Ziploc bag.out of the 94, at least:14 came with the grommets the metal part) broken or separated from the glass. (adding that these were the ones without the grommets in it, some of the others you can take it off with your hands easily)4 without grommets. nowhere to be found in the plastic bags.11 chipped. some of the pieces in the bags (2 or 3 little pieces) the rest were obviously broken before shipping.21 wont even fit the bracelet they are intended to be. and some, when push, just unglued the grommet from the glass.27 ( YES, 27!!!) were hideous black and white dices that look like they were painted by a child.10 were big beads, black with supposedly white stripes. I say supposedly, because  part of the white stripes came off (not in the bags so prior to shipping) and you can see the indentation where they were suppose to be, with sharp borders I might add.That means a whooping total of 87 unusable beads and 6 missing, with a total of 7 just OK if I'm not too picky about it (small chips, gluing the grommet back)Of course I knew they weren't going to be real murano. they are cheap (very cheap) glass bead, but going with the pictures (BTW, I did not received one, not even one, of the beads they show in the item descriptions) they have of the beads, I took a change of at least 50, 40? being ok. what a big disappointment!I threw them at the trash can after speaking with Amazon Costumer service and getting a refund (they told me to keep them or donating them. Too hideous even for that!) I haven't reorder form any seller yet fearing a repeat ordeal.I took pictures of all of them just in case.
I bought these as a replacement for the mat that original came with my Cricut and these are AWFUL! They smell terrible and are way too sticky! I only use thick cardstock and it still rips and curls the paper every time. What a waste! SO disappointed!
If you already own an iPad, you know you can get apps for it.  FREE apps.  So why buy this?  Well, you shouldn't.Crayola Photo Mix and Mash is basically a ploy to get you to open your wallet.  It has very limited capabilities; if you want to do anything special, you have to BUY the options.  Really?  There are free apps for that.It does come with a stylus, a digital pen, and a morphing tool, but these are so big and clunky they are hard to work with.  Meanwhile you have this FREE tool already --it's called a finger--that works much better.Just say no to this.
This product is part of a recent batch of products that requires you to download an app.Its really impossible to review the product without mentioning the app, because you wouldn't use the product without the app.  In fact, the app is really the main point, these accessories in the "mix and mash kit" are like the tail of the dog.  And the tail doesn't wag the dog, as the saying goes.I've been reviewing several of these "app plus product" combinations lately, which is probably bad news for Crayola because their product is very weak in comparison.The "app plus product" combination worked really well forPerler Beads i-Pegboard.  In that $10 product with "free app", the app worked well and was intuitive.  Enough was provided in the app for free to get plenty of enjoyment.  in app purchases were acceptable, because, plastic perler design plates cost real money too.Another option is to look at what Runtastic did:Runtastic Bike Case for iPhone 4, 4S, 5 (Black)If you bought their iPhone case that mounts on a bicycle, you got a code to unlock the full app functionality.  Just like with the Crayola product, anyone could download the runtastic  app for free but it would have in app purchases.  Buy their product, and you get all the in app purchases.So what about the Mix and Mash?  You would think that $20 for this mix and mash would be enough to get a full app!  But you would be wrong.  You basically get a few pieces of plastic, these pens... and then you can download the same free app that everyone else does and pay what everyone else does.  Now, if the Mix and Mash were $10, I wouldn't be so critical, I'd probably give the product 3 stars.I really don't recommend it.  I think its a bad value at $20 plus whatever in app purchases you buy.  Get your kid something else to play with.
For $20, you are getting an app, three tools you probably won't use much, and a small carrying bag.  Let it be known now, even my 4 year old kid wasn't impressed with that.  Geared toward 3-15 year olds, it's not hard to see that this app is really aimed towards the younger spectrum.  Kids who are over 8 are far to sophisticated to use such a simplified photo editing app - at 15, most kids would want to beautify their photos, not cartoonize.  Kids 3-4 are probably too young to trust with a $400 iPad.  That leaves the 5-7 year old kids, like my son, who after using this app with the included tools unceremoniously handed me back the iPad and asked to use the "better picture app" instead (his words, not mine).There is nothing this app cannot do that others can do for a fraction of the cost.  They may not be as "kid friendly" as Crayola, but with the level of sophistication and speed that kids are learning now a days, that wouldn't be necessarily a bad thing.  The app itself runs fairly slow, although I didn't have problems with it crashing my iPad.  One thing that galled me was that the app continued to try to "nickel and dime" by encouraging kids to buy more stamps to add to the app.  You'd think that a bulk of the cost was absorbed buying the app - now you're telling me I have to buy more because my kid wants the additional stamps?  The remaining appeal of the kit would be the included tools.  It's a shame that the tools simply don't work well.  Since the kids had little interest in the app, I figured I would use the stylus for navigating other apps on my iPad.  To my surprise, the stylus wasn't responsive at all...you have to push down the stylus significantly to get it to respond.All in all, I would spend the money on other photo editing app.  The tools don't work, the app is mediocre, and for $2, you probably will have a more powerful app with more options available.  Heck, and if that doesn't work out, you're out only $2 and can download another app...maybe even for free.  Not recommended.
The Crayola Mix and Mash comes with a digital stamper, a stylus, and a digital morphing tool. My kids were excited to try Mix and Mash, so I loaded the app onto a bunch of tablets and let them at it.  They were immediately frustrated.  The app would stall or close midway through their creation, and they always lost their work.  There wasn't a single tablet on which the app ran smoothly.  We tried tablet after tablet after tablet.  We finally got desperate enough to try the original Kindle Fire, which let us load so we thought there was a chance it would work.  My daughter said, "Mom, tell them they don't know how to make an app."We used the following tablets:- Kindle Fire HD 8.9" tablet- original Kindle Fire (won't activate)-XO 7-inch Kids Tablet XO-780-Pyle Astro PTBL9C 9-Inch 8 GB Tablet-Pyle Astro PTBL72BC Android 7-Inch TabletMy son actually awarded two stars and not one, because he likes the concept.  My daughter gave it two stars instead of one because it takes pictures.  We don't need this product to take pictures and any parent buying this for Android tablets would want a refund.  Maybe it works better on other operating systems.  For us, I'm giving it one star.
This has so much potential.  If it didn't cost nearly a hundred bucks (why it was in Vine I'll never understand).  If it didn't take THREE heating cycles to get the crayons melted.  If it didn't only come with two molds (crayons and rings).  If, if, if.  I'd LOVE to use this in my classroom but it would take so long to make rings or crayons for my students they'd be in college by the time one set was ready (and I teach primary grades).  This has great potential but simply doesn't make the mark.  I strong suggestion to skip it (especially at 90 bucks!).
I wasn't expecting gold-plated crochet hooks for this price but I was expecting SOME level of quality.Out of twelve hooks:*  None are marked with the correct size.*  One had a metal shaft that wasn't fastened tightly into the plastic handle*  All of the blue-handled smaller hooks had misshapen hooks and are unusable*  One of the hooks is formed incorrectly and is very sharpSo out of twelve hooks, six are totally unusable.These are definitely not for the serious crocheter and, because of the problems I've noted, I wouldn't let children use them on craft projects.I do not recommend this product.NOTE:  I received this item in exchange for my honest review.
It was great for about 8 days, then the power started cutting out on it.  Not up to Brother's standards.
This is cheaply-made, lightweight metal that looks and feels like silver- colored (not silver-plated) chain and I've designed jewelry for years.  The chain turned black the first time it was worn.  The picture in the Product Description may be confusing...it only comes in 5m lengths and not in spools.  I can't use this in my jewelry designs.  A waste of money.
