You can get this for about $40 less at B&N directly (plus tax), or at that same lower price, without tax, at their site.
I bought the Nook color after using the original Nook wifi to read a few books.  I'm sure like many people I was drawn to the "color" of the screen.  It is crystal clear, it's great for books with drawings or art in them.  Really brings it to life.  This is about all I've really liked.What I don't like is its heavy.  Compared to the original Nook and the Kindle it's a heavy monster.  The screen glares with everything.  I hate seeing myself in the screen when I'm trying to read.  The touchablilty of the screen is 100 times better than the b/w Nook.  It doesn't turn when you turn the Nook itself, even though you have the screen adjustment feature turned on.  Did I mention it was heavy?  Also I took it outside and yes I adjusted the brightness all the way up.  However, I could not read the screen with my sunglasses on even at its brightest setting.  It's like my Iphone, can't see the screen in sunlight.  This is the part that frustrated me the most.  Also the lighted background of the reading screen seemed to make my eyes excessively tired after long periods of reading.  The battery life is pretty short too.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this ereader.  Get the Kindle, you'll be much happier and it's cheaper.  Also Kindle books don't charge tax to buy them like Nookbooks.
For what I wanted it to do, namely display some of the pdf files and books that I already have on hand, this does a pretty poor job of it. The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the "top 100" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work. The battery capacity went down 20% over 4 days, so I don't think that it would make the 2 month mark that it should have.For all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device. Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default. The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N; were just being lazy when putting it together. Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software. I would rate this as 4/5 if it came unlocked by default.
This is an update from my initial review.This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal. It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was "Take the money and run!", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit "just so" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.;The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.
I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The "paper-white" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The "5 day battery life" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor. Well, I don't like crippled, so I'll look elsewhere, thank you very much...
The cassette, as other have said, makes a clicking noise as it runs.  I have it in a 2001 Rav4 OEM stereo.  It will also cut out when tracks change on the music player.  Very annoying.  I would not have bought this except for the Maxell name.  Disappointed.
Worked well, but after about one year it died.  I'm guessing water got into it.  My daughter used it in her shower, and I'm thinking she allowed it to be directly exposed to the shower.
I have used a couple of types of Velcro cable ties in the past.  The best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with  a slot in the top, so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped.  These have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie.  You have to wrap it carefully (and not particularly tightly) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks.  If you unwrap the cable the tie falls off.  These a just considerably more annoying to use than the type I first described.  One other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you aren't going to be undoing them regularly.  True, but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost.
The Palm V and Vx may have seemed totally awesome, but I never fell for the hype. The Palm V and Vx have a rechargeable lithium battery. When it's day is done, there's an agonizing choice: go for a replacement one of these, have the battery replaced and risk it not working correctly, or buying something that as one user suggested could run off of easily replaceable AAA batteries. The Palm V and Vx were never cool enough to overcome that stigma for me. If you can find that the Palm V/Vx has an acceptable set of trade offs and opportunity cost, to quote a drop dead gorgeous economics teacher I had, then it is definitely the belle of the ball. If on hand B you are practical, and want more steak and less sizzle from your handheld, the Palm VII or Palm VIIx may be a far better option.Just alerting you to something the positive reviews may gloss over.
I ordered both the Belkin 25 ft CAT 5e and the Belkin 50 ft. CAT 5e cables since I was not sure if the 25 ft cable would be long enough --- as it turned out the 25 ft cable was just what I needed so I did not use the 50 ft. cable.  The 25 ft cable comes in Belkin packaging and markings but (like other reviewers stated) the 50 ft. cable comes in a plastic bag that says made in China and there is no indication that the cable is a Belkin.I gave this 2 stars because it does not appear to be a Belkin product --- I would give the 25 ft. cable 5 stars.
This cable says BELKIN on the box, but the protective sheathing is of a poor quality.  50 feet is a long length, and if the quality is poor, you can expect crimping, snaging, twisting, and a mangled mess.  I bought this cable anyway.  I used the cable for three weeks.  I removed the cable after three weeks.  JUNK AFTER THREE WEEKS.All those who say 5-star -- maybe they only used it for a day.  After they got paid for writing a glowing review, they junked it after 1 week. Plan to junk yours too. Hey, it is only your hard earned money. So what?I cannot tell you how much it HURTS ME to write such a poor review.  Dam you, BELKIN.
Bought this to use for labeling binders and to label how much money remains on gift cards.The ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long. It partially prints each letter/number like some of the ribbon has gotten old and won't stick to the label. I would not recommend this product.
I should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product.  Handhelds, including this one, are pretty useless without an external antenna.  Perhaps it was defective, but this one wouldn't even pick up a broadcast 50' in front of my truck.  Nonetheless, this would be a great value if it worked.  It includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments.
I purchased this unit for a road trip cross-country. I was very disappointed with the quality. If I could return it at this point I would. Range is less than 1000 feet without an external antenna mounted to the vehicle. I've had other handhelds in the past with much better reception.
The product is great.  The Chinese who put it together are probably great too.  But the service doesn't exist.  The frame is set back too far from the edge on my new Dell Inspiron.  I don't know - if I was marketing this I would try to find out what PC's it worked on and make a couple drop down lists on the webpage so you could find out, without having to order it, pull it out of the package, see that it doesn't work, try to get it back in the package, buy a roll of tape, pay over half the cost to send it back, and then get know notification that it was received and no notification when it supposedly gets credited back into my account.  When you send it back they have you download two forms.  Each form is the same and contains both forms.  If I wanted to see how angry I could make people, I'd quit my job and go work for them.  I would say that qualifies as non-existent service.
I wanted to give "The Plug" a fair shot, so I bought a pair.  First of all, everything you have read about the stock foam earpieces is true; they are worthless.  The foam expands way too fast for you to compress it, shove it in your ear, and have it expand to get a good seal.So I followed some of the recommendations given in the reviews here, and modified some roll-up foam earplugs.  Now at least they will stay in my ears.I am recommending that people spend a little more money and buy the Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia earbuds, and here's why:-They seal really well to your ear canals, once you have selected the proper size silicone adapter.  The result is excellent bass.-You can put them in and pull them out really quickly.  On insertion, they just go in and seal, there is no waiting around for the foam to expand and seal.  You can quickly yank one or both of them out, and be able to plug them right back in.  This is really a good thing if you want to use them at work.-The sound of the Sony earbuds is just plain superior to the Koss'.  Really, it is.  They are worth twice the money of the Koss', which is about what they cost.About the only reason I may keep the Koss' around is that, with my foam earplug modification, they probably block more ambient noise than the Sonys, and they seem to be more efficient (more volume for a given drive level).  These two factors make them a good candidate for use when I am riding my motorcycle.  If it weren't for this, I wouldn't even consider them over the Sonys.
I bought these earbuds specifically to wear while riding a motorcycle. This application requires good sound isolation to protect against dangerous levels of wind noise and a close fit without protrusions poking into the helmet liner. The Plug received good reviews on a few MC forums so I had to try it.The noise isolation is OK, about as good as theKlipsch Image S2 Comfort-Fit Noise-Isolating Earphoneswith silicone mushroom-type seals. The photo of these Kosses is deceptive though, and the plastic part that stays outside your ear is much too big. Not only does it snag on my snug-fitting Shoei each time I remove it, the sharp edges of the silver-colored ring also dig into my earlobes. (The Klipsch are similarly too long, but at least they have no sharp edges.) For any other application these are probably a good value for money.tl;dr if your helmet fits correctly, these won't. I'm returning them.
As a long time Philips HE592 user I was looking for something better or at least as good.  In a head-to-head comparision the results are clear.  The Koss require more power on the signal to create the sound (1.5-2x more).  The bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor.  There is not nearly as much bass as the HE592.  Compared to the HE592 it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal can.
Here's the good stuff: great isolation from outside noise, comfortable, damned near excellent bass, and very power efficient. But I'm returning my pair to Tower Records where I just bought them for $15. Why? Because the sound itself is truly awful: compressed, dead, flat, hazy, and tinny (the great bass notwithstanding). These 'phones literally suck the life out of my music, by destroying its dynamics, detail, rhythm, tonal accuracy, and high frequencies, and then layering a harsh fuzziness on top of that. I can't say enough bad things about the actual sound. I suspect you can have a more rewarding musical experience at your dentist's office. I know I did.
Purchased to be used to adjust the volume of my Pro 4AAT phones while snoozing at night, the tiny volume control, no balance, and flimsy construction make these useless for me.At $10, not worth the hassle of returning.Koss should not put their name on such a piece of junk. Next time, I'll pay more and buy something better.
I used this to control the volume of a 2.1 speaker system.  however it does not control it properly.  The sound gets switched between speakers sometimes.. other times it just does not reduce the volume.  Havent tried it with a headphone though.
Feels and looks cheap.  It seems to work ok but sometimes you want a product for more than just functionality.  Its a little embarrassing using this ugly thing when I really like the look and feel of my headphones.
It didn't take much use before the volume control stopped responding and the cord began shorting out the audio playback.
Does what it says, works as expected. Cord and jack look a little spindly compared to everything else I have, but so far so good. Very small and light, making it highly portable if you need it to be. About 30" of reach. I've only had this for a week or so; well worth the $7 as long as it survives a respectable lifespan.UPDATEI can't remember how long I got out of this, but it wasn't long enough (a few months). I really like inline volume controls, but will choose a different one next time. This unit got touchy and created buzzing. Look for something with better quality cable/shielding.
An inline volume control is a great idea - we've used Sony headphones in the past that offered this, but the headphone quality was poor.  When I saw the Koss Volume control, I was happy I could get back the control, while still using my high quality 'phones.Unfortunately, the max volume with the Koss installed is diminished quite a bit.  I'd say about 20% lower than regular headphones alone.Another issue is the small size of the slider - I find myself fumbling to find the slider and use it.  Something with a bit more of a 'thumb switch' would be better.  I understand you don't want something that can be easily bumped accidentally, but the tiny slider bar this unit currently has is just not adequate.Because there's no other options I've found for something like this, I'll stick with the Koss Volume control, but if there were other options, I'd jump in an instant!
The earphones are fine, but they create too much pressure physically on the skull (ears).  They don't just sit, they squeeze onto your ears.  Definitely a minus for me.  Maybe I'll get used to them, but so far I feel it was a bad call.
The space between the speaker and the temple rest is too small and it hurts the ears.If you have big ears or a big noggin, don't get these.
I had a pair of Portapros for years and years.  When they finally wore out, I didn't feel bad replacing them.  I bought a second pair on Amazon last year (2012) and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use.  Reading the Sportapro review, the plug seems to be a weak link and I'm afraid that the Portapros have the same issue now.  It's really a bummer, they used to be GREAT.  Not sure what to replace them with.
Based on all the reviews I thought this was going to be a nice set of cans. Unfortunately I'm very disappointed. I'm comparing them to the Sony MDR-V6, which in my opinion rates against headphones in the $200+ price range.The PortaPro is not a bad headphone, but its not a good headphone either. The bass is present but muddy. Not clear or crisp at all. The mids have a decent amount of detail but the muddy bass bleeds the mids out quite a bit. And the treble.... where is it? I haven't heard a headphone with less treble. This lack of treble futher leads to the overall lack of detail and excitement found in other headphones. Are they worth the $25 that I paid? Yes. But I wouldn't pay more than that for them. Save up and buy the ~$67 Sony MDR-V6, its several tiers above the PortaPro, not only in sound quality, but in noise isolation and build quality. If you can afford the Sennheiser HD598, I also very very highly recommend them as well.
Wish I would have bought a different pair, as now I'm back on here searching for replacements.The sound of these is decent, but you'll find the cushions fall apart quickly and the pair will end up in a landfill after little use.Do yourself a favor and buy something more durable.
As of 06/04/2014, Amazon's page on these R-80 headphones states "Detachable, 8-foot, single entry coiled cord with 3.5 mm (1/8-inch) plug and 6.3 mm (1/4-inch) screw-on type adapter for flexibility and reliability".  I can assure you that the item which Amazon just shipped me does not have a detachable cord.Amazon's description also suggests "and 6.3 mm (1/4-inch) screw-on type adapter" is included.  It is not in the product.  However, that is not a deal breaker; I have a few of these laying around.Sound quality is good, and the fit is good for my large head, and does a good job (but not excellent) of isolating outside noise.I'm still debating whether to return these to Amazon because of the cord not being detachable; it was one of the primary reasons I wanted to purchase this set of headphones.
bought this phone just for casual usage, to listen music and movies at home.on the plus side, the quality is awesome, excellent bass and good isolation from external noises.on the minuses, this thing is bulky and super heavy. It causes too much pressure on your head and hurts just a few minutes after putting them on. Also the cups make way too much heat, and you can barely stay with them on after an hour or so.It may be a good headphone for DJs (that are constantly putting them on and off), but for continuous usage there may be better options.
I used to think these are good but as I realized it was more a placebo thing because 1) I used to think Sony makes the best electronics so it would naturally include headphones 2) I was ignorant in the world of headphones.  Do your research, Sony is not even close to being in par with the best headphones manufacturers like Sennheiser, Grado, and AKG.  These brands are, in my opinion, the best in the business.  After listening to jazz with my AKG 702 and switching over to the Sony, I feel like just throwing this piece of garbage on the wall like really hard.  The sound coming from it sucks so bad in comparison with my AKG.  Don't believe me?  Read all the bad reviews in any review web site, not just this site, and you will hear the same thing: muddy.  Sony headphones sound muddy.  I own 3 Sony headphones and they all have the same characteristics: loud, muddy, and bassy.  Now 1 and 3 are not bad qualities, but 2 is just unacceptable for anyone looking for good sound.  Now these will for sure sound better than really cheap portable headphones or your ipod buds, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are any good.
There's so much personal taste involved when assessing headphones. There's always a tradeoff to be made in terms of what headphones have what strengths--but even at that, these headphones are pretty disappointing.These headphones have great depth (boomy) but in midranges they lack a lot of detail. The sound is full but very flat. Crispness is really lacking.  If you've heard some higher-end headphones, or are the sort of person that appreciates high-end satellites and tweeters when listening to a conventional speaker setup, you likely will be profoundly disappointed with these headphones.On the plus side, they are very comfortable to wear. They also do a very good job of sealing the sound in, so people nearby won't hear your music if you're wearing these. So they are a very good choice for work if you can put up with the sound quality.Worth serious consideration instead (for a closed/isolating headphone w/DJ functionality) would be the Sony MDR-V6--which are similar in construction but beat the V600 in every way, or the AKG K81DJ, which also produces far superior sound for the same money.  Those are not quite as comfortable as the Sony's--but sure sound better.
The headset fits the standard 2.5mm jack found on many cordless phones. The fit is comfortable and the sound is fine, both incoming and outgoing. However, mine broke just shy of two months after I bought it.
Several notes (mostly negative):1.  The cord is unbelievably heavy.  And the jack is massive.  It may very well be designed for durability, but these headphones are not portable in any sense.2.  The headband just is not well designed.  It is made of very wide metal, with a vinyl padded cover.  The headband bows out tremendously -- I mean like 2-3 inches wider than your head on either side, unless you play offensive line in the NFL.  This not only looks awkward; it feels awkward.  Essentially the headband makes contact only at the very center of the top of your head.  This might not be a huge deal, but the headphones are quite heavy (compared to, say, any Bose headphones), and so you feel the whole weight of the phones on the top of your head.3. The earpads feel pretty nice.  But when I switched back and forth between 2 Bose around-ear headphones and these, these ones were much more cramped around your ear.  So not terrible, but not all that roomy.4. The sound struck me as very bright.  The most treble I have ever heard from any headphone or full-size speaker.  On certain songs, this is a plus, but for most, it is a bit irritating.  [I listen to a wide variety of 60s-90s rock mostly -- from REM to Snoop Dogg to Bob Dylan to the Clash to Soundgarden to Stevie Ray Vaughn].  In head-to-head comparisons with other high-end headphones, I judged these to be very light in bass.  It's hard to say if they are deficient or the others are exaggerating the bass (I am not a wannabe audiophile), but to me, these headphones lack fullness.  On the plus side, I can hear cymbals and snare much more clearly than with most headphones.  But the botom line is that I need to set my equalizer to reduce treble and/or increase bass to enjoy my music.  And I am someone who rarely touches the tone settings on a stereo (preferring a neutral sound) and am particularly unlikely to feel the need to increase bass.5. They are not very loud.  Only a bit quieter than the Boses, but if you are using an Ipod, they really aren't quite loud enough in my opinion.  The Monster Beats headphones are much, much louder, if that is a concern for you.6. While they do not actively cancel noise, I found them to be quite good at isolation.  Ambient sound was significantly reduced, arguably more so than with the Boses.Overall, too big and heavy and uncomfortable.  I would possibly overlook these issues if the sound was incredible, but it lacks fullness in my opinion.  It might be very good for some kinds of vocals and music, but not for rock music.
*** THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN UPDATED AS OF 7/23/2013. UPDATED INFO AT THE END OF THE ORIGINAL REVIEW. ***I actually purchased these for field listening while recording commercial video and have used them occasionally as backups for enjoying my music on my laptop, iPod and Android phone. The sound is very good, with solid bass response and crisp highs, but they actually hurt my ears (physically, not aurally) if I leave them on too long...which usually equates in to anything more than 15 minutes.For the record, my hat size is a 7 1/4, so I would say the overall size of my head is average. A person with a larger head size may find even more discomfort in a shorter amount of wear time.In the past I had used the less expensive Sony Monitor headphones found in department stores. The sound was adequate, but I felt I wanted something more professional. These are definitely a step up from the Sony department store models, but same uncomfortable ear fitment.The bonus to these is they fold up nice and compact for better storage, so I don't have to worry so much about breaking them. They also come with an inexpensive little carrying pouch for added protection.Bottom line: Sound great, but uncomfortable for periods of long listening.*** 7/23/2013 UPDATE ***These did not last long. The left side stopped working and I had to throw these out. I paid too much for a pair of uncomfortable headphones that didn't even last as long as the cheaper Studio Monitors I've bought at Target. It was enough for me to know I am done with Sony headphones.
These are okay headphones for the money but the earpads are totally faulty; they don't last very long, which is really annoying. I had to replace them at least once a year, at additional cost and frustration because they split open. While you can buy replacement ear pads it is really a pain to install them. Sony simply needs to make more durable ear pads.  The other thing is that they cook your ears. After a while wearing these, your ears start to feel really hot. The ear pads also press against your ears so they start hurting after wearing these for a while. These are not made for long listening periods unfortunately.These headphones look cool and provide fairly good isolation and good sound quality over the entire frequency range. They are the same as the more expensive MDR-7506 models except these don't say "Professional" on them and have less of a warranty.For the price, these headphones are fairly comfortable (but not the most comfy headphones available), and they sound pretty good although I've certainly heard better. There is little to no sound leakage and they provide good isolation in a foldable design that looks cooler than most other headphones. I would say these are good entry-level monitoring headphones (for audio engineers, DJs, etc.). For music lovers, they are certainly usable but you won't get that 'tickle me ears' type of 'Wow!' feeling from the sound out of them like with some other higher end headphones.If it wasn't for the truly faulty ear pads, I would give these a higher rating.
I have used this when using the iPad (and obviously had it plugged in) and it still runs the battery down, just slower than it would have otherwise. It is ok but there have got to be others out there that will work better. I mean, Belkin makes some great products but this is not top of the list. I use it and its ok but I would really like to find a 10 foot iPad cord that actually works and not rely on thsi thing. When your computer is plugged in, it should not run down to 70% when being used. So, based on that...I consider this product kind of a failure and the only reason it gets 2 stars is that I actually do use it
I'm not a super savvy IT person, but for home use I can usually handle it.  I bought this and a Motorola SBG6580 from Amazon and both were returned after I was never able to get everything working.  It's been long enough that I don't remember specifics, but I remember being able to get a portion working but never all of it.  I don't think there was a specific issue with this but it and the Cable MODEM would not play in the same sandbox.
When it arrived, one of the ports didnt work.  I dont know if this is common with Netgear products, but this one is not worth the price.  Will not buy this brand again.  Going with Cisco.
I have several of these switches in place and every few months I start seeing huge amounts of latency and dropped packets in my Internet connection.  After going back and forth with various ISPs and checking everything else, I realized the problem was in these switches.  Unplugging the FS108, waiting a second and plugging it in, the problem instantly disappears.  After some periods of time, and possibly under occasional heavy use, these switches begin to not function properly and need to be reset.  Once they're reset, they work fine.  This is an otherwise solid unit except it cannot be left unattended and operate reliably in my experience.  Unfortunately, that's what these switches should do.
Durable. I have plugged in three computers into this 5 port switch and all of them work fine. With the Ethernet cards installed in all my systems, I found the installation to be a cakewalk. The configuration is so simple and it just takes a few moments of your time. I just had to plug in the power cable first then connected the Ethernet cables of all the comps and it was ready. But it needs an external power supply chord and does not have a power on switch. The metal casing makes this device quite heavy. Not that I carry it around all the time but it could have been of lesser weight.The LED lights and the Ethernet ports are on the same side. This is a major disadvantage for me because the wires flow on my desk. Had the ports been at the back I would have had some control in keeping my desk uncluttered.My FS105NA also gets warm after continuous usage for more than an hour.
I have had this switch for many years, and recently it has been cutting out.  I have a desktop PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and Samsung HDTV connected to it now, and often when I turn my computer off then back on, the switch does not work until I unplug it and plug it back in.I realize the device is positively ancient, but this should not happen.
I misunderstood what it was. I needed a wired router and actually don't know what this is for, although I looked it up. My mistake.
Dead just under 2 years after placed in service (actual usage time about 20 months). Powers on now and even provides some limited intermittent function between two computers connected to it but wont talk to the route and will not connect to the net which tells me the up-link port is completely shot and the other ports are about done for. Warranty is for all practical intents and purposes pointless as the customer is expected to pay for shipping both ways and in the end you have a refurbished unit that only carries the original purchase date warranty (i.e. in my case warranty would end on 7/7/2015 with the 5 year warranty this model has) but shipping cost more than buying a new product. I am dropping my review to 2 stars since it did when all is said and done last 20 months which comes out to $1.20 a month at the price I paid and $1 a month at the current price. Final verdict, I will consider getting another one to replace this but only if I can't find one with a better warranty plan for about the same price.See original review below...There isn't really much to say about a switch, it has one simple job and as long as it does it that's what counts (A switch for those who are not certain is easiest to explain by saying it is akin to a power strip, you can plug all the machines you want into to it, but if you don't plug it into a managed source of signal such as a router or server it is like expecting a surge strip to provide power and work when it is not plugged into an AC outlet). If you want to split one LAN Drop (Network plug in) at for example at your entertainment center and hook up your PS3, Cable/Satellite box, Internet ready TV, A/V receiver with internet radio, etc. This is for you because all a switch does is take the one IP address assigned to it by the host system and share it out over all devices connected to it (while they are turned on and seeking connection of course, it doesn't allot bandwidth to devices that are not currently asking for any).Bottom line is this does the job so far and is well constructed, at this very moment unit has been plugged in for almost two weeks and is cool to the touch (I have it wall mounted behind my TV were it gets plenty of airflow) so time will tell but I have seen units like this in multiple brands at customer sites (I'm a network tech) work for years, if this one fails in an abnormally short time I will revise my review to reflect the time and details/circumstances of the failure.
I have 2 DYMO Letra Tag Label makers and in general I like them. I use the plastic tape to label my spice jars. While the print holds up to the frequent handling, the labels don't stay stuck to the glass bottles. No matter how carefully I clean the jars before applying the label they start peeling from one end or the other (and sometimes both).They also don't like to stick to the plastic caps.I am disappointed with this product, but haven't found anything better.BTW - The metallic tape was no better.
After upgrading to all Gigabit networking, I ended up using this router as a small local router for my Tivo.  It was fine for several years and then it just died a few days ago.  Only port 5 shows activity any longer - ports 1-4 are dead.  I've never had a router fail like this before (and I have 5 in my current home network in various places all over the house).I was using the original transformer that came with it and measured the voltage - it was pumping out 10.6v under no load and 9.5v when connected to the Linksys.  That's 26% over the proper voltage (7.5v)!  It's quite possible that over-powering the unit during it's lifetime would have shortened its life.
I bought this EZXS55W 2 years ago. There was no problem till 2 weeks ago. Now the internet connection got very slow or I get error message; " No Connection".Since this product does not have a reset switch, I tried to power circuit this, router and cable modem. None helped. Our wireless router is Linksys's WRT54G. This one has been working without a issue since we purchase it in 2005. I tried to upgrade a router to Linksys-Cisco's newer N product last year but found out WRT54G worked more stable, so I had to return a newer one. I trusted Linksys more in the past. I do not think their quality and reliability are not good any more. Very sad.
If you are a Macintosh user, you should know of a very important limitation of all Linksys hubs & switches, including this one: This switch will NOT route AppleTalk information on your network.  What that means is that if you are a Macintosh user who is trying to use file sharing via AppleTalk, or if you have an older AppleTalk printer (such as the older line of HP LaserJet printers), you will be out of luck with this switch... or any Linksys hub/switch.  Besides the lack of Macintosh AppleTalk support, this switch seems to work just fine.
I bought this to replace a Linksys 5-Port Switch that died after several years of use.  I'll be surprised if this one lasts a year.  I definintely got a bad one, but it's so inexpensive, it's not really worth the expense and inconvenience of returning it to either Linksys or the marketplace seller.  This should be a fool-proof device, and probably is if you get a good unit.  Mine, on the other hand, thinks there is always something connected to port 4, bringing down the entire network.  Actually connecting something to port 4 solved that problem, but I'm still experiencing intermittant periods of packet loss of about 25% that require multiple restarts of the switch to correct.  If you're looking for an inexpensive switch, I might suggest buying several of these so you can be sure to get at least one good one, keep another good one as a backup, and return the remainder.  Otherwise spend the extra money for a switch made by a company with actual quality control.
I've had two Linksys products die on me shortly after a year (a 4-port router/switch, and now this 8-port switch).  It works fine until it dies (but that's like saying a stapler staples correctly: it's supposed to).Just to note: I run them in a very friendly environment -- no dust or heat or voltage spikes or any of that to blame for the problem.  (Also, you can count me as an "expert user".)I myself will never buy another Linksys product again -- I'll try out Netgear & DLink and other brands, but goodbye Cisco/Linksys.  If you chooose to try their products, caveat emptor.
This is a good enough surge protector. GIven how much Monster knows about multi media setups, I wish they had spaced out the sockets a bit more. I seem to have a lot of fat headed plugs (adapters for hand drives, cable modem etc) that really crowd out the sockets. There is a lot of real estate on the unit, so I dont know why Monster did not space the sockets out.
ON the positive: these are great as compacts that fit inside your car's glove box or in your pocket.  On the downside: the optical quality and stability is poor.  But then, for the price, you get what you pay for, especially with binoculars.A note if you do buy them.  One of my rubber end-caps fell off somewhere in the woods.  These rubber end-caps are just slip-ons, so you will need to put a drop of rubber cement on them to be secure.Overall: For the price and easy of storing they are great: 5 stars, but, for the optical performance - 1.5 stars.  There are better binoculars for a little more mula.  Conditionally Recommended
These are very poor binoculars. The optics are very low contrast, no very sharp, very difficult to focus, flare easily. The focus wheel has lots of slack and feels junky. The eye pieces have very little tolerance, frustrating to use. Pay a little more and get something you will enjoy.
I know they were only $13, but they are poor quality. It's very hard to get a clear picture with both eyes open. Put the $13 towards a better set of binoculars and don't bother with these.
Very convenient to use, nice focusing, rubber eye cups, but you get what you pay for. Binocular users don't usually realize what they're missing until they check out Nikon or Minolta binocs. The images focus into crystal clarity but the price is close to a hundred or more bucks. But it's like a digital camera. It doesn't matter what the features are if the images are crappy.The lenses in these binocs have rings around the inner perimeter that are always out of focus. The center image is pretty good until you compare it with better binoculars, then there are more colors, a brighter image and, of course, consequently, greater viewing pleasure.Also, like most lens caps on binoculars, the lens caps on these should be discarded with the plastic wrap and box. They fall off with gravity and you'll soon lose them anyway.This one's a good model for kids. For yourself, use your tax cut and buy a more expensive model. If you're going to walk 12 miles into the woods, you deserve to have primo optics.
I bought a pair through Amazon Warehouse Deals, that were in Like New condition.  I could tell that right off the bat the optics were poor.  There was a double image produced and no level of correcting fixed the situation.  I have a small portable pair of 10 x 25 binoculars.  I was hoping the additional light I would get through the larger lenses and the extra 2x would make a difference.  But I did not experience that.  I noticed that they did not get me any additional closeness that you would expect and any light gains were minimal at best.  They are not bad, but size wise you might be justified sticking with a 10 x 25 or going with a 10 x 50 because you won't notice the gains.
I have the Powerview 16x50 model.  They are difficult to hold steady and difficult keep focused.  The Powerview 20x60 model has 25% more magnification, so I assume it's 25% more difficult to hold them steady and 25% more difficult to keep them focused.  The Zip focus is a handy feature.  You'll need it!  I find myself refocusing the 16x50's all the time.  For the same price, I think a good pair of 10x50's would be easier to use and provide better image quality.
As others have reported, quality is disappointing. Thought it was a good router at a decent price, until it started breaking down, regularly (shows red diagnostic light).Linksys website indicates that company knows about the problem, and will replace (only) if within warranty period.  Technically within their rights, but seems unethical to me -- they sold a defective product and aren't taking the responsibility for it.Recommend you avoid this, and be careful about other Linksys products.
I'm tired of this quality! I don't even remember owning this, it lasted so short.It's a crap shoot how long they'll last. 2 years? 1 year? 6 mos?
I've owned several of these routers for many years.  I've upgraded and downgraded firmware trying to find something that was really solid and reliable.  I've come to the conclusion this unit is good for a small, non-critical network, but it has reliability issues.Since Cisco took over Linksys, the long-term stability and reliability of their products has diminished in my opinion.  This router works well, but it will occasionally freeze up for no reason and require a hard reset/power cycle to work again.  Also this unit will sometimes reset and reload factory default information with no notice.  If you change the default admin password you may find it reset back to the default.  Sometimes it will just lock-out and you have to do a hard reset (pressing the reset button while powering up) to reload factory defaults.  This router should not be used in any environment where it would be left unattended for long periods of time.  It simply is not reliable in that capacity.
Very easy to setup and once setup, pretty much maintenace free. You have heard all that, BUTmy first router quited after 11 months and 2 weeks. The connection was intermittent. Took a weekend to isolate and identify the source of the problem. Its the router's (not the cable modem, the ISP network, the network cards, the OSs or the computers connecting to the router). Customer support is so so. Gone thru the diagnostic routines quite a few times before support admited that the router was bad. Took three to four weeks and many emails/phone calls to get a replacement. Replacement was a DOA. Took another 3-4 weeks to replace the replacement. Make you wonder its reliability. With the life cycle expectancy of the router in mind, I am shopping for a replacement. and it is not going to be a linksys.
This card embarrassed me.  I recommended it to a friend with a Gigabyte mb, and it crashed the machine repeatedly.  An obsolete NeXXt card delivered the goods.  I was puzzled, as I had used it successfully on an IBM mb and an ASUS mb :(
I was looking for a radio that's good on batteries that I can listen to while going to sleep.This one misses that boat because the sound only comes from one earbud. not acceptable.
Okay, I realize that these are very inexpensive headphones, but I had hopes for them.I usually just use typical iPod ear buds for regular use and a couple of brands of over-the-ear headphones for holding in place during running and strenuous workouts.  My plan for these headphones was for using while outside working in the lawn with mowers and other machinery running.  I realized that they wouldn't silence other sounds in the way that the much heavier, fully padded/insulated headphones do...but I had expectations of them being able to deaden outside noises as much or more than regular ear buds.  I was reluctant to wear the heavier headphones that completely surround your ears while outside working since I didn't want to completely tune out what was happening around me.It didn't take long to come to the conclusion that they offer nothing at all in the way of outside sound reduction.  The in-your-ear buds cover outside noise better than these do.  So, I thought...oh well, I'll just use them for regular indoor listening.  They're certainly comfortable enough.  But, they don't stay on...or at least they don't stay on me.  I have to remain perfectly motionless or else they slide off my ears.The sound clarity is decent for the price.  The cable is plenty long at about 4.5.'  The XBS port is supposed to offer increased bass response.  I maybe noticed a bit of difference there; but it's of little help when the headphones won't stay in place on my ears.
I dont do well with headphones they irritate my ears. I itch when I use them so, if you dont have that problem then order these. For the price your cant go wrong. For the kiddies they are a bit too cheap and wont hold up under the hard useage.
I bought my first set of these in June, 2010 for $4.27.  Great price for the sound quality.  Ten months later, for no discernible reason, the left earpiece went out.OK, I figured, they were only $4.27 - besides, perhaps I did something to cause it (unlikely, because I'm gentle with my electronics).So, I bought another pair in April of 2011 for $4.80 (tax this time, doncha know).  This pair lasted six months before it became necessary to wiggle the plug to get the left headphone to work.If you don't mind replacing these every 6-10 months (that's my experience, anyway), these are a great budget pair of headphones: they sound good, and are comfortable.  I'd prefer to pay double, or even triple, the price and have a set that would last for at least a couple of years.Why must so many products be designed this way?!  It's bad for the environment, and it's inconvenient for me.
As it says in the title, they were to small and therefore uncomfortable for a man's size head.  They would probably be okay for a kid especially for the price.
These headphones are fine for the money, but I would definitely suggest that you spend just a little more and get the Koss KTXPRO1 headphones instead.The Koss phones are MUCH more comfortable (I can't stress this enough) and they also sound better. Trust me, your ears will be glad you spend the extra bucks.I wear the Koss phones for hours each day at work, and they never hurt. These Panasonics hurt after less than an hour. I think it's because the face of the phones isn't parallel with my ears, so the from edge of the earpieces digs into my upper jaw.Of course, your head may be different than mine, but I think most users will find the Koss phones more comfortable.Good luck!
I bought these headphones for use with my iPod. While I do spend up to 20x the price of these for home usage, I don't like spending too much on phones for my iPod as they get beat up easily. I figured five bucks, good reviews, worth a shot.These headphones sound bad. I do know these are quite cheap, but I've still heard better even for this price. The problem is the sound is plain tinny. Even with some equalization in the mix, I couldn't get "good bass" or a full sound out of these. Also the midranges, specifically the upper mids are screechy and overproduced. Another issue is the volume. I have to crank up about 70% of my recievers volume for moderate volume, and the iPod is even worse. Yes, they are cheap and comfy, but they sound as good as they cost. I've found that both the Sony Walkman headphones (MDRA110) and the Coby CVH42 for the same price sound better.
I may not be listed as an actual purchaser of this item because i returned the two broken pieces. In the past couple of years I have owned this item, had good service from it, and felt satisfied even when a part broke. This time, it cracked into two pieces within the first hour of ordinary use without any particular strain - it is possible that I received a headset with aged, fragile plastic. Amazon honored my request to return and credit the cost of purchase.
I was hoping these headphones would sound like the Panasonic RP-HG10 headphones I have used for years and years.  They have been discontinued, and were one of the absolute best headphones I have ever used, even though they were cheapo $10 ones.  Unfortunately, thesePanasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Portdo not sound anything like the RP-HG10 model, and don't even strike me as being made for music.  They also don't fit flat on the ears.  I think they would be best as computer headphones when watching news videos and such online.
These work good for the low price, and the easy over head use, but sadly my head is way smaller than what these are intended for, wouldn't work for children then either.  They're adjustable, but even on the smallest setting theres a huge gap leaving it not snug and easy to move around with them on :/
These binoculars arrived with problems and I returned them:- the right-lens diopter is very iffy and difficult to adjust. In fact, I never was able to get a satisfactory focus with it.- both lenses displayed significant distortion around the outside edges- It was impossible to clearly focus on anything beyond 50 yards- the quick focus mechanism frequently failed to work and took a few tries to adjustUnfortunately I had some similar problems with recently purchased Bushnell 20x50 wide angle binoculars. Bushnell used to be an inexpensive and decent brand.  Not anymore.
Optically these binoculars are OK, considering their low price. But wow do they seem flimsy. The parts that slide in and out to focus are supposed to slide both sides together, right? Well nothing is rigid, so one side can get ahead of the other by quite a bit. Both sides will get pushed in, changing the focus completely, just from holding the binoculars up against your face lightly. The little rocker thing you adjust with your fingers to change focus seems pretty cheapo and fragile. They might be OK for disposable situations, but I would not buy these binoculars again.
The lens is an entry level lens and would be well served to have IS built in.  But even in ideal conditions (good lighting, fast shutter speed, tripod mounted), it is still a subpar performer.  The images aren't crisp and sharp and the colors are a little flat.  It does allow for a nice enough bokeh (background blurring) when taking photos of someone 15 feet away or so.  Generally that isn't easily accomplished by the 18-55 kit lens.Good photos can be taken with this lens... but more photos will be lost due to blurring or simply not being crisp enough.If you are on the fence as to whether you will use your DSLR, then this may be a good option.  If it turns out you really like it, then invest in the 55-250mm.  If you are starting out and you KNOW you will like it, then invest in a 55-250mm from the start.
Manually crank the lens to 300mm Infinity and nothing in focus. Back it off a bit and now it is in focus.
I've used a lot of different telephotos lenses, from this one, to the better Canon70-300mm model, the70-300mm DO, and the wonderful70-200mm f/2.8 L lens. This one is not terribly great. It tends to softness, particularly at the upper range, can show flare and CA, and the build quality is poor. In fact, after a couple years of use, the autofocus on mine stopped working, the only lens I've ever owned to have such a problem. I've seen similar reports on other photography forums so mine is certainly not an isolated problem. To repair it would cost almost as much as the lens itself, so it basically was trash at that point and I certainly was not getting another one and upgraded instead to the 70-300mm which is a far better lens all around. I'd suggest that anyone that needs a lens in the $200 or less range look at the latestSigma offering, which is a much better performer than this lens and gives you some decent macro capability as well, or the newCanon EF-S 55-250mm lens. While I've not tested this new lens myself, it's gotten very nice comments for the most part and IS in this price range is a real bonus.
Lens functions OK, no issues there.  What is disturbing is its ability to clearly focus.  All my distance shots are &#34;fuzzy&#34;  As a test, I took a shot at mid range or 150 mm and magnified it with standard photo editing software.  All the detail was fuzzy.  I took another lens and performed the same test and the magnified image was sharp.  I now have a rather pricey paper weight.
I bought this along with my Canon XS as part of a packaged deal in 2008.  I have used this lense about 4 times.  I like the reach but that's about it.Sorry but this lense just doesn't do it for me as the focus is slow and the images are just not sharp.  Honestly if you want something I would suggest the 70-300 usm or even the 70-200 f/4 L.  The build quality on this lense is cheap.  The focus ring is small (obviously most of the users will be using autofocus anyways).  The filter does move whenever you focus (not good).  There is no image stabilization either.I wouldn't recommend this lense unless it was pretty much free.
Disappointed that this can't be used safely with my Canon 50D.  Have to return it for a safe one.Before putting a 285HV on your camera, please check with the camera manufacturer first.  The 285 HV open circuit trigger voltage measures as much as 12 V. and many cameras are not rated for this voltage. Canon USA claims that Canon SLRs should not be used with triggers above 6V. and Olympus says don't exceed 10 V.  Nikon says 12V. is the maximum safe trigger voltage.  Cameras that meet the ISO 10330 spec. are supposed to be safe up to 24V.Most modern cameras use solid state flash circuits (not mechanical contacts as old cameras did), so the use of even a slight overvoltage can instantly do serious damage.  Building a "universal" electronic flash with a 12V. trigger voltage for today's cameras is really not very smart engineering when most well engineered units trigger using 3 or 4 Volts maximum.It's interesting that Vivatar uses a "HV" designation for this flash unit.  The old (film era) "plain" Vivitar 285 and Vivitar 283 flashes had a trigger voltage of over 250 Volts, but the "HV" version is 12V, which, unfortunately is still too HV for many cameras.If you do a web search for "Electronic flash trigger voltage", you will find tons of info on this subject.
I started out buying more expensive Canon flashes but didn't need the E-TTL features.  Based on a web review, I bought a couple of Vivitar 285HV's and used them with my existing off-camera triggering system (which consists of Elinchrom Skyport radio triggers and Wein optical hot shoe triggers).  All of my existing triggers fired through the hot shoe of the flash and have worked with a variety of flashes, including older Vivitar 283 flashes.However, the 285HV is triggered on a different contact point than most flashes.  It works fine on-camera, but doesn't work at all with any of these remote triggering options.I've found that you need to use the trigger port on the side of the flash.  Wein peanut slaves have a high failure rate, but Sonia triggers seem to work much more consistently well with this flash.Once your system is working, these will fire consistently well.  They don't recycle as fast as some of the more modern and expensive designs, but if you take your time and compose each shot well, you should be just fine.  I've been replacing all of my other flashes and standardizing now on the 285HV for my field gear.I use these for semi-professional fashion and art photography and it often surprises people to see me using such humble looking equipment and yet I get great results from them.*** LONG TERM UPDATE ***These flashes only last a little over a year and then they are kaput. I have had a few of them, all purchased around the same time, and in the middle of a shoot they will suddenly flash brightly and then not work anymore. As far as I can tell, these units are sealed up and not meant to be repaired.
I tried in my sunny garden to baseline the quality and it did not come out good.  Comparable to CVS pharmacy disposable 35mm.  It went downhill from there:  The underwater pictures were not worth it.  Out of all the pictures, there was only one of my dog splashing into the pool that is kinda keeper.  But, it's 6 bucks.  So, c'mon, experiment with it.  If you don't like it after that, you're out 15 - 20 bucks after developing.
My old review is below and I still think the ergonomics are great with this tracball.  HOWEVER in the last 6 months I have gone through 2 controllers.  I have 2 wireless tracballs and 2 broken controllers.  I am sorry but there is no excuse for electronics without moving parts to be so fragile.  Until logitech builds durability into the controllers, STAY CLEAR OF THESE UNITS and get a corded one.Real shame, these are very wrist friendly designs but 2 breaking without any damage is wrong.  Fool me once shame on you, twice is on me.Some have complained that the control part of the wireless mouse that plugs into the USB is too big.  I velcroed it to the lid of my laptop and also can stick the wireless trackball unit itself to the velcro on the lid also.  That taken care of, this is one excellent ergonomic trackball.  Having it now wireless is only that much better.Best trackball/mouse for ergonomics but so far not as durable as it should be.I will try a second one and report back on that one as well
This did not fit my GPS. My vista cx has a micro sd card mount on the left side of the battery case. The back for this did not have a notch going around it, so it would not attach to the GPS. I dug out my dremel and cut out a notch in the back in order to get it to fit.If you are looking to have this fit your vista cx, or any other garmin hand held that has the memory card mounted next to the batteries, make sure that you are able to modify the mount to go around the memory card if your gps is set up that way. Not all are, but mine is, so this had to be modified to fit. Be aware as this is NOT a universal bike mount for all the garmin hand held GPS units listed in the description. You may need to modify the case in order for it to fit your GPS.
I called Logitech about the way the scrolling was not working, and they attributed the problem to the fact that I was hooking it up to a laptop through a docking station.  (Dell Inspiron)I love the look and feel of the mouse, and the button action feels good, but I really wanted the scroll wheel to work.
A while ago I wrote a simple review of this stating how well it works.  I've since changed that statement... I am absolutely disappointed in the performance of this unit!This unit will work fine if you are indoors - I have had a 95% failure rate outdoors in a variety of lighting conditions, and as close as 1' from the unit.  Everything I've read during my extensive pre-purchase research led me to believe (blindly) that it could at least get moderate success at a relatively close range (5-10').  All the DIY hacks in the world in regards to foil or other reflective attachments aren't enough to increase the communications between the flash and this unit.You are probably better off in the long run to save a fairly respectable chunk of your hard-earned money and put buy a set of Cactus V2 triggers (A.K.AL "Ebay" triggers/"Poverty Wizards").  They will set you back about $30-40 for a decent set.  True, they are NOT a Pocket Wizard in any sense of the word, and will not perform even near the same.  However, they certainly beat the annoyances that are sure to come when using this product (line-of-sight is not always possible with OTC flash).In fact, the best option for those not willing to shell out $200-300, may want to check out PC sync cables.  Yes, I know, it's an older technology (some say more cumbersome), but with the right quality brands on equipment - as many things in life - you get a very stable and consistent set up.  No more explaining to your client why you didn't get that last shot.Okay...back on topic...PROS- Compatible with all Canon Speedlites- Offers wireless triggering capabilities for off-the-camera flash- Has decent battery life- Can trigger multiple flashes simultaneously- Fairly simple to use- Convenient buttons for high-speed sync and flash power settings- Works well in small to medium-sized roomsCONS- Only works with Canon Speedlite series of flashes- Non-standard battery- No battery-life indicator- No 2nd curtain (slow-sync) flash capabilities- Unreliable in outdoor settings (and some indoor)- A little pricey, based on features
this camera bag is made good but it's way too small. It's good only if you are taking just one camera and no lens out for the day.
The construction of the bag is very good but I was disappointed that it was so small.  Guess I didn't read the ad correctly.  When I have my large lens installed on my camera, it will just barely fit in the bag and there is no room for other lens or other attachments.  The outside pockets would hold some of my accessories but there's not enough room for everything I have.
This is a basic flash that makes all the decisions for you-it's auto only. However, the fixed flash head does not allow bounce flash which to me is a deal breaker. Indoor shots can be so beautiful and evenly lit with bounce flash, but this unit is just a better version of what's built in to the Rebel or G series, complete with harsh lighting and blown out detail. It's too bad Canon feels this is a good entry level flash-Nikon has the very basic SB-400 for a similar price, but has bounce ability and is much more powerful than a built in speedlight.
I really enjoyed this remote at first and it did a great job.  However after using the notch in the side to retain the cable, the cable fell appart.  The notch tore the sheath of the wires and they are now exposed.  I did not have it that long, about a year, before that happenned.  It was not heavily used and spent most of its life in my camera bag.Not sure what I would recommend instead but given the price I needed it to last longer.
I bought this bag after seeing the illustrations, and it looked like it can fit a digital SLR and 3 lenses, The fact is it does, but really really tight, you need an extra effort to make them fit in it. I have a Conon EOS 20D and 3 lenses, 18-55, 28-135 and a 70-300. They all fit but i can feel the camera telling my "this is too tight". Consider buying a larger model.
The picture is not very useful illustrating flashes, telephoto, 2 dslr body's and lenses. I have just about what they have and no way with what I have.  My lenses are just a fuzz longer making this marketing illustration not so accurate.  Use a tape rule and measure what you have against marketing meausrement for the best idea if your gear will work.  It took me hours to reconfigure the interior using dividers from other bags. Wasn't able to use hardly any of the velcro partitions inside that came with the bag. I had to glue in velcro on the left and right ends since there was only a little 1&#34; wide strip centered on the end, top to bottom.  There wasn't enough velcro to allow dividers to attach on the ends where I wanted or needed it.  The front storage pockets are OK.  There are two zippers to each of the front pocket that go left and right of each pocket.  The problem is the zippers go all the way down to the bottom of the pockets and beyond making it difficult to get the zipper back up in any speedy fashion especially in the middle where two zippers are side by side.  They wanted the pocket flap to lay flat which is ok but closing the pockets using the zippers is funky and takes a bit of time, if your in a hurry forget it. If the zippers fail,  this bag will be worthless.  Should have used connectors more somehow and zippers less.  Live and learn.
This is a standard "Made in China" earbud.  Not worth any premium dollars.  Works as advertised, but overpriced.At least they could put the brand in larger letters for the money!
The Senn MX-400s boast a distinguished brand name and an astonishing claimed audio response; it's also a real alternative to the vast array of earbud speakers. A volume toggle is a nice touch, but it's probably unnecessary for players that already have a volume switch.The package claims an extraordinary frequency response well above and below normal human hearing -- and certainly beyond that of your average player. If you have an iPod, you may find the "Flat" or "Electronic" pre-sets the most satisfying.Obviously, for $15, you're not going to get sterephile sound. The MX-400 has a pleasing sound with a "bump" around the high-middles. Heard objectively, they can err to "clacky" sound, but as with many phones, you can get accustomed to it.These faults are minimized if the buds are fitted just inside the ear. But if the buds are fully inserted, some music can be problematic on percussive tracks, with a forward bass absorbing what's left of the modest highs.To be fair, this is a $15 earbud, and in this price range it's an extremely competitive product. But if you're looking for replacement phones for your iPod, or decent phones for your CD, you may not find music playback completely satisfying.
On the back of the package it says -1) Transparent sound and powerful bass. - The "Transparent sound" part is true and "powerful bass" part is totally untrue.2) Metal stabilized system for high levels. - What was that again? Metal stabilized system?? It has antiroll crossbars I guess!!When companies start making vague claims about their product - thats when you know that there is a problem.These sounded terrible at first - no bass - period.The sound changed for the better once I put on the foam covers. I could hear some bass at that point but even after equalization, it was clear that this product is designed to deliver a lot of high frequency, decent midrange but little by way of bass - even though it claims to have frequency response going from 18Hz to 20kHz. It fits my ears properly, so that is not a problem.This product sounds far inferior to a pair of "Aiwa" ear-buds that came with a "Made in Japan" walkman purchased in 1990!I wouldn't even compare the sound of these MX400 to the excellent Koss over the ear headphones I purchased recently.Maybe they are better than the IPOD headphones (which suck even worse), and the reason people give this 5 stars. Really - no more than a 2 star product.Expected much better from Sennheiser. With this experience, I've decided not to go for their noise cancelling headphone and instead go with the one from Panasonic. Reputable companies should think twice before selling junk in the marketplace.
I bought several ear buds for my wife's iPod because she was uncomfortable wearing the stock earbuds. Sennheiser always has had a good reputation and these got good reviews. She didn't like any of the options and prefers lightweight over the ear headphones so we put them away. I then bought an iPod and tried the different options that I bought for her. These produce a very muddy sound. By far the best are the Creative EP-630s. I now use those and store them in the Sennheiser case which is a great design and prevents cord tangle.If the carrying case comes with these ear buds (and some reviews say that it didn't), I'd buy them because the case is worth $10.00.
If failed after about 1 month of use.  I would not order another one. I went to Radio shack and purchased one that works much better
I bought this to help while building my desktop computer. I had it clipped onto the chassis a few times off and on at the start of building while I gathered/unwrapped parts and when I went to clip on again the clip broke. I tried to reassemble but no luck.Wasn't bad for the price but would not buy again.
I didn't realize when I ordered it, but it is not your standard Ethernet cable. Didn't work for any of my modem or standard computer connections. I need to be smarter when shopping. Not the company fault, but would like a better explanation for us amateurs.
As another reviewer said, Margin Mart does not ship the grey Belkin cable that is shown but rather a cheaper quality no name cable. I had wanted the grey to help identify it in the cable maize behind the computer but I got another black one that looks like all the others. It's also very light weight. It will probably work and considering how cheap it was it's probably a good deal..just not as represented! With the free Prime shipping it's not worth pursuing but I just want all to know that the picture and description is not what you will get from Margin Mart!
I ordered this cable for my Canon Pro 9000 inkjet printer so I could extend the reach from my laptop. After trying many times to install the driver, I found out that the printer cannot work with a cable longer than 10 ft. Just to prove my research from other message posting that this was true, I hooked up the printer to a shorter USB cable and the driver and printer installed perfectly. Hope this helps others who might have wanted to do the same thing. I will just keep the cable and use it for some other device as the price is so low that it is not worth shipping it back.
This cable is not the name brand they are advertising on AMAZON.  It is a cheaper knockoff that is probably made in China.  I am sure this cable will do just what it is supposed to do but when the picture is not the same as what i received, when the post is false the advertising is false and they should be looked at by Amazon and removed from their site as a service if they continue to be this shady of a company selling on the Amazon Site.
This set was barely enough to remove the back of my MacBook laptop. I could not replace the battery and had to order another set to get the needed screwdrivers.
I was excited to get this kit, but then the screwdriver broke the first use. The little ball that holds in the screwdriver bit came out and can't be repaired. Will RMA and order another. If that one is better will update review, as this did seem like a pretty nice set until it broke so easily. Maybe I got a dud.
I didn't expect a much different product, but some things were even cheaper that i thought.  (the &#34;flashlight&#34; has been an ongoing joke in my small shop - it is worse than something you'd get for 25c in a four pack at a dollar store - including some cheap batteries)  The tools are pretty bad - there's nothing here I expect will last beyond six months, and not even a week of real consistent work.  I bought these because sometimes I do work outside of my shop, and I thought this would be an easy to grab kit.  I know I am spoiled by my Wiha tools at home, but these are not something I'd give to my 12 year old if he was serious at all about the work he was doing.  Fine for a grab and go, emergency only, situation - beyond that - if you use tools such as these for your work, forget it.
I returned the filter because it was used, old (ancient packaging) and had scratches and fingerprints on it. It was advertised as new. All this is a seller thing, and not the filter's fault.The filter, though, was very weak. That is, I doubt it would take my glass down 1/2 stop-seriously. I also noticed (without mounting it) that when used on an LCD monitor for testing, it was very weak at rejecting light at 90 degrees. That is to say, the effect was very weak. In addition, the filter's outer glass just spun freely. How would I fix that?I feel that my best glass (70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM) deserves to look through something phenomenal, so I traded up to the:Heliopan 77mm Circular Polarizer Lens FilterBaddest piece of glass I could find! Brass rings instead of the aluminum ones in Tiffen and Hoya, and a calibrated wheel with markings make this the choice.There comes a time when checap is just too expensive. I want to make my L glass better, so why would I put layered/laminated glass over it?If you have a cheap lens (at 77mm? OK, whatever!), then this might really be a value. On the other hand, if you know what a circular polarizer even IS, you probably should be buying the best.:)
The Panasonic Lumix FZ35 has a really nice Leica super-zoom lens that opens to very wide angle - great feature, very useful. When this filter is mounted on the lens (it screws onto the end) the four corners of the frame show the edges of the filter. All four corners are black. Once you zoom in a bit this goes away, but it's annoying. I don't know if this is a problem with the filter or the lens but I'm disappointed.
After reading many reviews I have decided not to buy B+W and to save some money.Thought CP filter will take my photography to next level after seeing comparison images from other customers.To be honest I used it 2-3 times and I was so dissapointed since then it is still in original box.I understand user should know how to use filters but effect from this filter is just discouraging.
This filter has an okay effect and it spins pretty easily, but the part that spins is extremely loose. It moves about a full millimeter forward/backward just from tilting the camera. If I take it off and shake it, it sounds like the glass is about to fall out. It is extremely loose and I will be returning it.I may have gotten a bad copy and I suspect it could have been damaged in transit since Amazon put virtually no padding in the box. Either way, I was looking forward to using this and I am disappointed because this is the third time I've had to return some piece of camera gear I just ordered from Amazon. Sometimes I think Amazon orders sub-par batches of goods and I really wish their warehouse would put some more padding in the box. I'm not sure if I will reorder the same item or if I will reorder from Amazon.
PRO- Adds a potentially reasonable amount of protection.CONS- So does an expired condom. It doesn't matter how well this protects the lens' surface if you can't actually take good images with it attached. If that wasn't the case, why would anyone by something other than a lens cap?SUMMARY:You get what you pay for, and maybe even a little less.RATING BREAKDOWN:- Good protection at a great price, which is job one for a UV filter: 5 Stars- Super-ultra-spectacularly crappy glare control: -4 Stars- Allowed me to work an expired condom reference into a review in a context-appropriate manner: +1 StarTHE REVIEW:This is an inexpensive filter that's also cheap. The glass is stable and mounted securely to the metal ring, so I'm sure it will do the most important job a UV filter can do: protect the lens from incidental scratches and light impacts.However, in terms of optical quality, this filter sucks. Part of the problem is the 67mm barrel. The other part of the problem is the cheap optical coating. It doesn't reduce glare;It enhances it.This isn't very noticeable until shooting into direct light in low-light... such as shooting people in front of things like Christmas trees. The light goes in the filter, hits the lens, bounces off the treated layer, hits the backside of the filter and stays there. Whatever specks of light you have out in front will stay there as ghosted &#34;lightows&#34; (I couldn't think of the technical word, so I figured a lightow is like like a shadow, only with lights instead of shade).As a base layer of protection: excellent. As an addition that will lend itself to any quality other than detrimental: excellent.
I trusted some of the better reviews both here and elsewhere. I felt I needed it because I love to include the Sun in my shots. Also if I encountered an unevenly lit scene then I can balance the light.Problem is that this is NOT really a Graduated filter. It is ABRUPT filter. Lower half is clear and upper half is 2-stops dark glass.Only way this will be useful is such perfect scenarios can be found where upper half is lit and lower half is dark. Problem is that only once in blue moon do you get such opportunity, otherwise in most of my shots, the horizon is NOT in the middle of the picture. Which means that a CLEAR DARK LINE CAN BE SEEN ABRUPTLY. Now many can miss it, which is why I said this is a great filter for untrained eye.I have a sick feeling it is going to take up space and weight and never really be useful. It is very hard to line up the bright and dark areas as well. It is NOT easy to see it in viewfinder so you have to guess little bit where the horizon is as your tripod is not intended to be perfectly even, but in post processing it is obvious where the dark line is.Maybe one day I will get a perfect sunset shot.....and it would be worth it.
Tiffen usually has good quality control. This particular ND filter has spots in the coating. I still use it, but have to remove the spots in post. Just take a picture against a blue sky, and if the spots are there, return the filter.  If i had known about the coating issue i would have bought a Cokin or Lee filter instead.
When I got this for my wife's new Panasonic FZ35 last year, it was slightly loose in it's housing and then today (Christmas 2011) it completely unseated within the circular frame and the camera kept trying to focus in on it rather than the intended subject.Threw it away and just ordered the Hoya in hopes of a better filter (at double the cost).
When I bought my camera I bought both a Tiffen and a B+W filter just in-case there was really a difference.I started noticing strange flares and reflections on some of my photos. Having seen comparison photos in other reviews of this product I decided to test. After extensive cleaning of the lens and filters, I put the camera on a tripod and swapped out the filters. The Tiffen created quite a few obvious spots and halos. At night it caused reflections. Without the filter it all went away. With the B+W I was able to produce some very small spots in the same situations, but nothing noticeable without pixel peeping. I plan to replace my Tiffen with a B+W even for my cheap kit lens.
I bought this filter to protect a Canon EF 85mm/f1.8. It does the job, but I get noticeably better photos with it off. I guess the debate rages over whether a filter to "protect" the lens is even a good idea, but I usually like to have one on, especially if I'm outdoors or in a dustry environment.If you are going to go the "protect the lens" route, I'd recommend something better, like the HMC / multicoated filters from Hoya.
A few criticisms. It's packed in a plastic case (from the manufacturer) which is far too large for it, so it slides around and rattles inside the case. No foam or anything to hold it in position or even cushion it slightly.The glass on the one I received did not look clean. I thought it was dust, but cleaning with proper lens cleaning materials failed to get the glass looking properly clear. It looks permanently pitted or marked in some way. I will not even bother putting this on the lens it was ordered for.
This filter came with my Canon 70-200mm F/4 IS USM lens "FREE" from Amazon. First night I took few pictures of the moon.... guess what, the photo was not too bad but the flare was very bad like there were two moons. Well, what do you expect?..It was free! For the time being, I kept it attached to my lens as a protection. Will definitely buy another filter.
I got this filter before I understood the difference between cheap filters and ones that actually work well. I was getting such great results with my new 50mm f/1.8 lens during the day, but at night i was getting a lot of ghosting and flaring in my pictures. It took me a while to realize it was because of the filter. After doing some online research, I decided to remove the filter, and my pictures were all suddenly better with that lens. The glass was affecting my picture quality!The glass used is cheap, and not very good quality, so it can actually degrade your pictures. It works well to protect the glass on the lens from scratches or dust, but it's a much better idea to pay $20 more and get a good filter that will actually help you get better pictures. If you don't want to pay the extra for a decent filter, you might be better off just leaving the filter off. I reccomend Hoya Pro1 and B&W; filters; and in the 52mm size, the price is very reasonable. Once you start buying nicer lenses that require 77mm filters, that's where the good filters really start adding up. But again, you aren't going to want to put a cheap filter on a $1000 lens.I know this review might sound negative, but if it helps someone capture a  memory better because they decided to get a little nicer filter, it will be worth it.
This is not a multi coated filter. Using this on your lens makes the picture quality come down by 2 notches.If any direct sunlight hits the glass (even if the sun is not withing the picture frame), the whole picture appears washed out. I only bought this because I got this free with my lens purchase. I always buy the sigma multicoated filters for my lenses. They are truely multi coated and reflect a dim green just like the expensive camera lenses. Unfortunately tiffen does not make any true multi coated lenses.
I used this for a few weeks before I got tired of all the artifacts and glare present in my pictures.  I should have bought a higher-quality UV Filter right off the bat.  Oh well, live and learn...
I got this filter for free because I bought some other items, and up until I got it I had been using B+W filters, but I decided to give this one a try just to see what it was like.First of all, this filter has a metal ring, which is really nice especially for a filter this cheap. Unfortunately, the optical quality is lacking. You get a lot of ghosting during the day and even more at night, so there is a noticeable degradation of image quality. I wouldn't leave this on my camera because of this.The filter works fine for protecting you lens, but the question that you need to ask yourself is if you are willing to suffer lower image quality in order to save a few bucks by buying a cheap filter. I would recommend staying away from cheaper Tiffen and Bower filters and going for something that will actually improve your images, such as a B+W Filter (B+W 52mm Clear UV Haze with Single Coating (010). If you're really looking for something that will exceed in performance, go for the model with an MRC coating.
I get glares and reflection artifacts so I never use it, just sits in the bottom of my camera bag
This is the kind of thing you buy when you have absolutely no money and just needs something to temporarily protect your lens. To simplify here are the ups and downs.Ups:-Good build quality. Glass is nice, smooth and without any noticeable warps. The frame is pretty solid for what it's worth.-It's dirt cheapDowns:-The threading on the frame is OK. It screws down all the way, but it's not very smooth. The biggest downside is that the OEM lens cap won't fit snuggly. I dislike the fact that sometimes my lens cap will pop off if I don't secure it tightly, but it's difficult to tell when the cap won't fit all the way down.-There's not coating. Not even one. This will affect the IQ. Not a lot, but it's very noticeable when there's bright lights. You will see some ghosting and unintended flaring.So in the end, this could be a good insurance filter if you have nothing else to cover your valuable lenses. But try to get something doesn't compromise your IQ.
haD TO TAKE IT OFF AS THE LENS FLARE WAS RIDICULOUS...I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT ...pay a little more get something better
I put this on my 50mm 1.8. It cost me around five bucks. I had been very happy with it until one day I suspected that all the ghosting, glares, and reflections of light sources on some photos might come from this filter. I do an experiment with a light source, a lamp, in the photo. Yes, the refection is in the photo. I can even see the reflection through viewfinder. I then swap it with a HOYA HMC. The refection is gone. The reflection for sure is not there if I don't put any filter on. This filter does protect my lens well. But the whole purpose of the lens is to take quality pictures, not to be cherished behind a glass.Tiffen filters of different sizes have been Amazon best sellers. Yes, they fit well. The build quality is good. But you will be very sorry when you finally find that it is the cause of the glares, ghosting, and reflections. I believe Tiffen has coated versions. But I didn't try them.The problem is not on the quality of the filters. They are simply not coated. But if I have to be mindful about what it might harm my photos when I take them in certain situations, I cannot use them.I know B+W has good filters, but they are expensive. I have been having good luck with HOYA HMC. It is around twenty dollar range. Very affordable. So my suggestion is dump this filter and go with that one.
I ordered the Tiffen 58mm UV filter to use on a Nikon 50mm f1.4G.  It didn't look all that bad, but I immediately noticed increased flare and degraded sharpness in my pictures.  It required a filter wrench to remove it from the lens because the mount is very soft and threads not quite machined right.  After I removed the filter, the glass was rattling loose in the ring.  It is now in the trash bin.  I purchased the B+W 58mm UVA (Ultra Violet) Haze MRC Filter #010 to replace it.
I was initially excited about this UV filter for my 28-105 Canon L lens. It's metal and came in a nice box. But the glass part feels cheap and produces glare and artifacts in low light conditions. No other UV filter has done that. Currently seeking a new one.
I have a lens filter tha tis a direct 49mm for my Minolta, & I can only take pix, after extending the lens some. Otherwise, I have the ends of the filter lens in the picture. VERY SAD for a 49 to 49 lens. It ruined some great shots too. Well, not ruined, as in I can't use, but not the full shot either.Just a note about filters, that I have come across. Extend out, & everything is fine. But, can you rember to do that with every shot? Me either.Hope you find this useful, & get some great shots.
I bought this kit about a year ago. I was so excited about my new camera purchase that I wanted to make sure that i was prepared. Please be warned that anything you put in front of your lens will degrade the image to some degree. The quality of what you put in front will determine the degree of that degradation.With that being said the UV filter in this package is garbage. It causes ghosting in images. Ghostings is basically where you can see a ghosted image of a light right next to the original light source. This is an easy indication of a poorly made filter.The Warming filter is pretty cool. Being a Caucasian in the winter isn't always the most pleasing of skin tones. Its gimmicky though.The polarizer is decent. When stacked i sometimes have spots on the image.The pouch is actually great. I use it to hold the warming filter my ND filters and the polarizer.If you are just starting out, trust me when I say that quantity in this hobby is not worth the sacrifice of quality. For the price you are better off buying a multicoated UV protector. Save up and buy a polarizer later if you want. As your skills increase you will notice that you will quickly outgrow this kit, rendering most of it useless. Also make sure your buying the right size. that MM is very important :)Happy picture taking!
The majority of my cases were damaged in shipping. I immediately threw away about eight, but as I tried to use the rest I gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well. Maybe I'm alone, given the other high ratings, but these seem more fragile than other slim cases I've used in the past. I'd give them 3-stars (because they're cheap) if they didn't have to be shipped.
I didn't think I could connect my old reliable HP 4000N LaserJet Printer with its parallel printer port through a USB port.  I didn't expect this to work.  I was wrong.  It worked perfectly.  It auto-installed the printer.  FYI, I run a Gateway 64 bit laptop running Windows 8.1.  No problems.Update:  6/27/2014 - It just plain quit working after operating flawlessly all this time since my first review.  I can't get it to work again.  I checked the printer itself with its old parallel cable from an old 32 bit Vista machine.  The printer works perfectly.Now I understand why such a large minority gave this cable 1 star saying it didn't work for their situation.  Somewhere there is an obscure incompatibility problem that rears its ugly head intermittently.  Reliability isn't there.I feel certain the problem exists somewhere in either the updated driver software or the old parallel driver software.  Some bit, or flag or something is causing the 'print' command to be totally ignored across this cable. This cabled didn't simply 'break'.  There is a compatibility flaw somewhere.In the meantime, I am forced to save my print jobs on my Win8 64 bit machine into a PDF file that my Vista machine (on the same network) can read and print from.
The problem here is that in any group of 12 outlets ... or &#34;many&#34; outlets there are bound to be some of them that are for those power bricks, and the receptacles on this are arranged longitudinally ... so that power bricks will not really work well with it ... which makes it useless for what I want to do with it, which is charge lots of things on my work bench.  It seems just silly to do that and obvious not to.  2/5
few days on and already making noise.It was quiet at day 1 but i could already hear it the next day.Its quiet noisy if u ask me. I wish i could post a video for you to hear it. But even video wont be enough.
I can't remember what I did with this, I don't remember if I returned this or left it in an old computer.Which leads me to believe it wasn't good enough to move to my current config.
Makes too much noise at this point so removed it.
Buying these are like buying a cheap bike. They'll probably stay in your drawer and quash any interest you have in either viewing celestial or terrestrial (or in some cases, telestial) objects. In short, these binocs will probably last at least a  lifetime because they're so poor in rendering a respectable image. Seriously, buy a NIKON. You won't regret it. Also, if the people who gave these binocs a good review knew what they were buying, they wouldn't be buying entry level Bushnell binocs.There are so many things going on when binoculars are focusing an image, things like chromatic aberration. Colors focus at slightly different points and a good lens has to bring them all together into one crisp image. The best way to see what I'm talking about is by picking up a pair of these binocs and then comparing them directly with a decent pair. Now please realize, even NIKON isn't considered GREAT, just decent. To get GREAT optics, plan on spending six or seven hundred clams, and more than a grand for super-photo quality optics. But, as with bicycles and everything else, there is usually a point of diminishing marginal return somewhere along the way. The basic rule of thumb is to NOT TO BUY CHEAP. If your binocs have Busruby-coated lenses, run, don't walk away from them! (These Bushnells aren't that bad, but your eyes deserve crisp, contrasty images, and with these binocs, you'll find yourself first focusing and then refocusing, vainly trying to find that sweet spot of clarity that never comes.)So what are you doing still reading this? Point your mouse to a NIKON or try to find a pair of these used. You should be able to find them cheap.
I bought these thinking they would be a good investment.  I don't use them very often, so I thought they would last a long time.  They broke where the zoom feature is.  I am bummed.
I like my Linksys equipment.  But in my cinder block Hawaiian house, the wireless hub is on one end, and not more than 40 feet away, I can't reach the dining room table or the kitchen, where I prefer to watch movies stored on my Linux machine.I even got past the problems with the XP install and it works like a charm sitting right by the hub.This card needs some more boost.....
Microsoft should really take a lesson from Logitech here.  I tried the Trackball Explorer as a replacement for my WELL worn Logitech Marble-Man FX (discontinued - though I'll never understand why.) My hands are M/L - totally typical.After 1 hour of use, my thumb was killing me.  You see, you must reach BACK to far to hit the thumb button.  If you compare it to logitech, you'll see that they have the buttons in-line with the ball or just under where your thumb falls naturally, meaning you can click on them without bending your thumb at all.The mouse is accurate, and the ball feels nice, but you have to use those buttons... and they are awful. If they'd move them forward about 1" this would work as well as the Logitech MarbleMan FX does.It's no wonder those things are going for $150 USED on Ebay... Logitech had it right and nobody has yet repeated it.
I bought 2 of these to help control the extension cords in my wood shop. Specifically I had 2 12/3 50' cords that needed to be off the floor.Assembly was quick, easy and straight forward. Only tools needed for assembly are a Phillips screwdriver.Overall the design of this thing is pure genious. however the materials weren't exactly the best choices. The overall plastic construction appears sturdy enough, however I do expect that these are not something that would put up with every day professional shop use and abuse. However in my hobby woodworking shop, these are more than enough. The tire for the wheel that pulls the cord through to the basket is where I have the issue...The difference comes VERY apparent if there is any dust, dirt, or whatnot on the jacket of the cord. One of my cords WAS covered with sawdust, the other not. The clean cord would up exactly as it should have with no slippage. However the dusty cord slipped on the hard rubber tire without even the slightest attempt at grabbing. I had to wipe down the cord with a damp rag, then follow that up with a dry micro fiber towel, and THEN the cord would up cleanly.I believe a softer rubber compound to the tire would make all the difference in the world traction wise. The manufacturer of this item would be well served by reading these reviews, and perhaps actually testing their product in the areas that customers are complaining about, and fixing the problem.Overall I am happy with the purchase. And I KNOW I need to keep my extension cords clean, it just annoys me that the cord winder is forcing me to keep them clean before I can wind them up...***UPDATE***I have had these for several years now, and I use them with 12/3 extension cords. My initial happy withe the purchase and willing to tolerate its quirks has worn off considerably. I have ended up with slips, failures and I end up fighting this thing trying to get the cords reeled back in place. I have a Harbor Freight self retracting air hose reel that I love using, a simple tug to get it to release and it retracts. I am now looking to replace the Wonder Winders with a pair of self retracting cord reels if I can find some with the heavy gauge extension cords...
It's a bit annoying when you buy something as a gift and the gift receiver has to later tell you that there was a part missing.  In this case, the crank was not included in the box thus making the entire thing utterly useless.  The packaging was very plain and nondescript which had me wishing I hadn't bought it as a gift in the first place. It was just a basic craft colored cardboard box - not somehting you would pick up at the store to give as a gift.  The first time the gift recipient looked at it he thought it was one of those small basketball hoops.  Maybe a single color photo would have been appropriate SOMEWHERE on the box or inside the packaging.  Now we're off tho start the return process.  Thankfully, Amazon is the best at what they do so it won't be a huge problem.
I've owned this now for about four or five years, and have never found it as good as many others apparently have.  I use it with a very flexible, heavy duty extension cord in my basement.  This gadget has a large plastic wheel inside attached to the handle.  There is also a plastic paddle with a button lever that sticks up at top that you press against the cord to create contact and friction against the wheel.When I first got it, the wheel simply didn't grab the surface of the cord to pull it into the net.  Annoying.  Over time, the cord surface got dirty and it actually started to work a little better.  But even after years, I find it frustrating to use.  I can press the button lever, and turn the crank, and the wheel mostly slips against the cord.  I lay the cord out straight from the mouth of the winder, and there is no tension on the free end of the extension cord - but it still barely winds into the net.I'm astounded at the apparent good luck many others seem to have had with this winder.  I'm jealous.  Wish mine would wind reliably.  But it sure doesn't! And it never has.In terms of quality of construction, I do find the plastic of high quality, and the bracket has been sturdy.  If only it did what it was supposed to do.But I also have a free hanging extension cord in the basement that I use as often, if not more. When I'm done, I wind it between my hand and elbow, and then hang up the looped cord.  To tell the truth, this is faster and more efficient than the cord winder has proven to be - at least for me.
This product arrived completely disassembled sans any directions whatsoever. I finally traced the manufacturer on the Web and was able to call them. To my amazement someone actually answered the phone and - after I explained that I had no clue as to how to assemble the device - lead me verbally through putting the thing together. They promised to send me the actual instructions that were missing from the package, but a few weeks later all that I got in the mail was an ad from Green Leaf.I mounted the unit to a stud and then proceeded to attempt to load it with 50-ft of #12 wire extension (a special cord designed to remain flexible in the cold).The Wonder Winder is awful - at least for #12 wire. It's awkward enough to press that friction lever back while you crank but when the wheel slips and doesn't grab the cord, it becomes almost impossible to load the wire into the basket. Perhaps it will work better in warmer weather - when the friction wheel softens and the wire becomes more pliable, but I'm using this in a cold garage to hold a cord for my snow-blower. It might also work better with lighter gauge extension cords, but that's for someone else to report on.The Wonder Winder would get at least 3-stars if it was well-made, but alas it's made of cheap flimsy plastic and I don't expect to get more than a few months out of it before material fatigue takes its toll and the unit self destructs.
The remote is decent, but I should have read more before ordering it.  I would like to have the ability to focus, especially if I'm doing tripod work and the subject(s) are not stationery.  This remote control is basically only a shutter release, with a slight delay and if your target moves out of focus, you end up with a blurry picture.  Additionally, it's way too small.  When I opened the box and saw how tiny this remote was, I was disappointed.  This remote is good for remote shutter release, and that's about it, really a novelty.  I wouldn't have bought it, had I known this up front.  I need to pay closer attention to the reviews next time.
I bought this Wireless router after doing quite a bit of research and getting good reviews from co-workers (even network guys) on it.  I have owned it for almost 2.5 years now.I will break this down step by step:Installation:Couldn't be easier.  Had the whole thing setup with my Cable Modem and my desktop in less than 30 mins and was surfing the net.  in an additional 30 mins or so had my wireless laptop going and didn't have a single problem.  Switching from an Orinoco or a Cisco wireless card on the laptop was easy and no problems there either.Initial Usage:It had problems.  It would keep stopping and requiring a reset or a full power down/power up.  I updated the firmware (keep on top of firmware updates) and this problem went away.  Updating the firmware is very very easy.Performance:I will review only the wireless part this.  For internet browsing and basic stuff, it performs great.  No complaints here.  It was a little slow on some of the more heavier network utilizing applications but its wireless you can't expect the speed of a Lan line.Range:I didn't have problems with ranges in my townhouse.  It worked everywhere without any degradation.  When I moved to a two story colonial, I started to see some range problems.  It would work fine on the floor where the router was.  On the ground floor however it would move from excellent/good to fair frequently.  Sometimes just turning the laptop a certain way would do miracles.  I never had a complete dropoff though.  Never did try the basement :-)Features:I couldn't have asked for a more easy to configure and more featured router for my usage.  Supported all the  protocols (IPSEC/PPOE) for me to VPN to work.  Had nice control over ports and traffic.  The control of DHCP and static IP addresses was nice too.  Didn't use much of the other features.Now with all that said here comes the BAD part:about a month ago, the wireless part stopped working.  I was surprised at first.  I checked the router.  Lan activity Lights were on but not the wlan activity lights.  I hit the reset button no go.  Checked my desktop.. the lan connection was fine.  Did a full power down and power up.  Still nothing.  Checked the website for firmware updates (in case I missed one that fixes something).. nope I had the latest firmware.  This was on a friday so I just let it be.  Saturday.. still no luck.  After going nutz on Sat, I finally emailed Customer Support on Sunday.  They responded fairly quickly (within hours) and after a couple and back and forth emails.. the response:  "This can happen if you are under warranty we can replace it"  Well the warranty is a bleak 1 year and I had had this router for 2 years...soo.. bottom line.. I am getting a new router and probably not going with Linksys again.  A response of "This can happen" is not acceptable to me.
This device works perfectly if all you intend it to do is browse the internet. It will not work properly with certain video conferencing and audio communication programs.(such as paltalk) Go to Linksys.com and notice that with the Linksys wireless WAP11 and the BEFSR41 router under product features they say: Compatible with All Standard Internet Applications. See if Linksys says this for their BEFW11S4. They don't. The BEFW11S4 would not work with my print server which uses a IPX/SPX protocol. The distance is typical and I checked it to the Linksys WAP11 and it was the same. People that buy these wireless units and believe they can walk over to their neighbors yard with their laptops will be disappointed in the range. Adjusting the antennas and router position does help greatly. I switched back to my old Linksys router BEFSR41 and plugged in the Linksys wireless WAP11. Everything works, video conferencing, audio communication, print server. The extra plus is I can move the Linksys Wap11 to obtain the best wireless distance. Try that with the BEFW11S4, you will have to relocate all the wires....OK, its been some months now and I'm still flying with the Linksys BEFSR41 and the WAP11. Remember, The BEFW11S4 will not work with certain programs, such as certain print servers, video conferencing, special networking programs etc.
As I began to write this, it had been almost six hours of attempts to set up our wireless network with no luck. The wired portion of the router did work out of the box: no problem whatsoever. It was the wireless part that was a pain to deal with. After following ALL the steps in the User Guide that comes with the router, I got on the phone with a guy from Tech Support, who ran me through most of the same steps in the User Guide (that's fine, that's part of his job), yet after 30 minutes or so with him on the phone, we still couldn't get my laptop and my desktop to be on the wireless network for more than a few seconds at a time... and they were both using Linksys products, for compatibility's sake! In the end, I was able to figure out myself the reason for the problem, or so I thought... for a few days. This past weekend, after I had to unplug the power to physically move the router, it stopped working for good. I am returning it.I don't even know why I give it two stars: I guess wishful thinking that it will eventually work (basically, after a month of having bought it, the best thing I can get is an exchange, although I'd love to get a refund for my money!), and I will be able lay in bed while I surf the web, without a 50 ft wire running through my living room... So far, I've found the router to be annoyingly complex to set up. I would NOT recommended for starters or even for expert people: I have been using computers for almost 20 years myself, and I was not able to get this setup going in a reasonable amount of time!
I initially chose this router because of its low price. Sometimes, you get what you pay for, and that is exactly what happened to me. As a wired router, this works well enough. It connects four computers to the internet. Just don't do anything to intense with it, and you should be fine. I noticed that when I view video media, the connection totally freezes. But for basic internet and downloading, it works.I generally find, however, that no one buys a "wireless" router not to use wireless, and that is where the problem is. The receiver is so painfully finicky, it does not keep connections. The configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery. The linksys support team tries to be helpful, but I can't seem to make this router reliable. It drops reception all the time. Many times my laptop won't even detect a signal. The wireless performance of this router is abysmal.I sincerely hope that if you have this router, it is working flawlessly for you. I can't get it to work well for me not matter what I do. The difficulty that I am having with this equipment is so bad that I am going to replace it as soon as I can.
Like somebody else said here... I used this for about a year or so thinking it was great but not realizing that it really wasn't. Looking back, many times it needed rebooting and true enough I never got the wireless wep security setting working. So anyone could've hijacked my internet connection and network. Finally it died and I dumped it - got a Siemens SpeedStream model 2624 instead and it works beautifully - much better.
I've owned many Case Logic CD cases over the years. The quality of the construction has declined markedly during that time. This one feels cheap and not durable at all.I'm going to buy a Targus Citygear case instead; its construction quality is superior to this one.
I had high hopes from the reviews. I open the box and immediately think did they send me the correct case? I go online to check and then I notice other reviews that are new advise the company changed the case and it is different than what was shown in photos. I'm not pleased with this purchase at all!
I would have to agree with some of the other reviews.  I have some older Caselogic CD/DVD cases that are far better quality than this one.  It is just so cheaply made.  It seems to be just thin plastic.  I doubt this case will hold up very long.  At $30 it is grossly overpriced.  $10 would have been about right.Caselogic is apparently in financial trouble.  When companies start changing to cheap materials and workmanship, it can only mean one thing.  They are in bad shape, financially, and are trying to cut corners while still charging the same prices.  In the end, the customers suffer and the company inevitably goes out of business anyway.One lesson that other companies can learn from Caselogic's mistake is that if you manufacture high-quality products and charge a fair price, even if that price might seem a little on the high side, customers will still buy the products and the company will continue to thrive.  There is no point in trying to save a few pennies here and there, because it will cost you mega-bucks in the end.In the end, I guess I will keep the case, since it is too much trouble to return it.  This will be the last Caselogic item I will ever buy.  I am no longer a customer of theirs, I am a victim!
I'm going to take this opportunity to fully vent on the subject.  If you want the executive summary, buy Belkin or Netgear equipment, and avoid Linksys.  If you like the ravings of a frustrated IT pro doing someone a favor, read on.I hate these things, I really do.  You absolutely MUST install the software for it in order to get them to work with Windows XP Home, but here's the kicker: it won't install the WLAN.INI file to the system.  Oh no, you have to manually copy it to the system in the &#34;Program Files\Crappy Wireless Lan Adapter&#34; subdirectory yourself.And then reboot.  And then, quickly now before it notices, open up the WLAN Moniter (yes, they spell it exactly that way) and click through to &#34;Profiles&#34;.  You may get lucky and it will allow you to edit the profile, so you can finally pick the router's broadcast channel and get connected.You might think, &#34;Well, XP has the Wireless Zero Configure function&#34;.  And it does.  And Linksys defeated it for hours.  There's just no tab in the Windows side for channel selection.  I'd like to give a big shout out to Microsoft:&#34;yo, you guys missed something.  Like, the ONLY THING THATALLOWS THE ADAPTER SEE A ROUTER.  STUPID!  DUMB!&#34;&#60;sigh&#62; They're cheap, they use USB, it's inevitable someone you know will have one.  Once installed, they just work.  Nothing special, nothing especially cool, they do the job of hauling packets for you wirelessly.  But so what?  It's supposed to do that.  The added value is in ease-of-installation, isn't it?Fred
Great product for intermittent use, like if you fire up your computer and browse the web, answer email.But if you want a constant long term connection, forget it.  After about 100 mb transferred, it hangs your system.  I've reproduced this bug, and a normal NIC card gives me no problems.  So you are always rebooting every day if you are serving.  I even updated the drivers too!There are a couple of other reviewers who have experienced this too.But if you do need it for short-term stuff, it's great!
I gave these to my sister in-law because she needed speakers.  I was not happy with the sound quality, and $20 Logitechs sound better and take less space
dumb buy, bairly louder than my iphone alone and way to bassy
I needed extra speakers immediately for a last minute project and had to buy these at Radio Shack because they were the closest store that was open. If I had had the time to shop around I would have purchased something much better.The sound quality is so-so and about what you expect for low-end computer speakers. They need an isolation filter and better shielding. The light in one speaker started flickering 3 weeks after purchase and went out completely 2 months later. The lights serve absolutely no purpose other than to let you know the system is powered on, so it is not a big deal. The blue lights are kind of unattractive and cheap-looking anyway.The connector to the subwoofer is very poorly constructed so that it generates significant noise whenever the wire is touched. If you have the wires lying around unprotected or dangling off the back of the desk, you are likely to have issues with noise and static.The worst part is that the speakers are sensitive to cell phone signals. Anytime a cell phone call comes in or goes out and the phone is within 15 to 20 feet of the speaker, there is a extremely loud clicking signal passed through the speakers. Also, anytime the cell phone is pinged by the phone system, this noise occurs - you don't need to have a call coming in to have it happen. I have no other speaker system that has this happen to it. I've had the speakers for about 8 months now and would have replaced them if I used them more often, but I don't. I don't have the time to open up the subwoofer and the satellite speaker to fix the shorting issues, so I can't say if the problems are even repairable. I assume they are, but they never should have been so poorly made to begin with.The good thing is that these speakers are pretty cheap. It is hard to find anything much cheaper than these and sometimes that is all that you want -- something that puts out sound and not necessarily of good quality. So if you want to take the chance to buy them and they don't work out for you, you aren't going to be out a lot of money. On the other hand, there are much better speakers for about the same cost, so you shouldn't have to throw away good money on these when you have other alternatives.
They might sound bad to me because I am used to Audiophile headphones.  But they don't sound terrible.  Nice clean highs, but the bass is a little muddy.  Maybe it will clear up in time as they burn in, but for the price...  I especially like the volume control and headphone input.  It works excellent and matches my system.  But these speakers are great for the price.  If I spent 100 on them I would be mad with the sound quality, but for less than 30, they are excellent.  I just picked up a new pair of speakers which sound way better than these and they were cheaper too.  Check out my other reviews on which speakers I got.  These will be sitting in my closet for a backup pair, not worth sending them back.
These speakers worked okay for me for a while until the volume knob failed and I was unable to use them any longer.
This item has had a bad volume nob from the start, but I was so busy doing other things I was not able to return it to the store, and when I contact warranty support they say I have to ship in the whole unit. They cannot just send me a new nob because it is all wired together it does not work good. It goes from low to high in a short space or has static when I move the nob.
These speakers probably have the best sound you can get for less than $75. Unfortunately, they also have the worst radio interference I've ever seen. The cabeling is very poorly sheilded, and is hardwired to the speakers, so you can't easily switch to better wiring. There's a constant faint buzz, which gets worse from time to time. Somethime sound will play crystal clear, othertimes there's horrible distortion. It's a real shame that these speakers weren't made with better cableing, or atleast designed so that you could switch the cables to something better. Ferrite beads ($5 from radio shack) may be one solution, if that doesn't work, I'd try rewiring the the cables by hand with something with better sheilding. Still, since I only paid $5 after a rebate for these, I can't really complain, if nothing else they've increase by understanding of the problems that can occur when setting up an audio system. If you don't mind tring ferrite beads or other RFI solutions, or if your computer is somewhere with no interference, then try these speakers, you won't find simliar onces cheaper, and they sound much better than a 2-speaker setup, as long as the RFI isn't too bad.
Sometimes you get what you pay for and this is no exception.  Don't waste your money on this set, just spend a little more and get a set of Logitech speakers with a subwoofer.  You won't be disappointed.
The WEB site said it would work, and the package also said it's &#34;For all LK models&#34; BUT IT IS NOT THE CORRECT PART, NOT EVEN CLOSE!The voltage and amperage is good but the plug is the wrong size and is too small to plug into the keyboard, as if that wasn't bad enough the positive and the minus pins are wired backwards for my keyboard. The keyboard needs negative on the outside of the barrel plug from the adapter but it was Positive instead..I'm in electronics so i replaced the plug (using one from my box of my junk adapters) to the correct size and rewired it so the polarity was correct.
-----------------------------------------Bottom-line-----------------------------------------Nikon should either retire this lens or drastically reduce its price.------------------------------------------Performance at each stop------------------------------------------* f/2This lens is unusable at f/2. Very low resolution and poor contrast all over. Chromatic aberrations (CA) are pervasive from the center to the edges. It will ruin any picture.* f/2.8The center performance improves drastically. Contrast goes up noticeably and CA goes down to very low levels (still there). The mid-frame is still fuzzy and CA is observable. Towards the edges the fuzziness and CA is still unacceptable for a prime lens.* f/4Now center performance is impeccable. Excellent contrast and no hint of CA. The mid-frame is still somewhat fuzzy but the relative clarity and contrast is improved over f/2.8. Unfortunately the edges still disappoint: still poor contrast and CA (better than f/2.8 though).* f/5.6The center is flawless. Excellent contrast, no CA, high resolution. The edges improve dramatically: very good contrast and very little CA. The fuzziness is still there for the mid-frame (pretty much at the same level reached at f/4).* f/8Ok, now we're talking. Excellent performance all over.-----------------------------------------------My opinion-----------------------------------------------The performance of this lens is very poor below f/4 -particularly so considering it's a prime lens. At f/2 is a mess, and at f/2.8 it's only good in the center -quite useless for low light photography (again, considering it's a prime lens).Stopped down to f/8 this lens is very good for landscape photography -also it's a very small and light, adding very little weight to your bag.In short: you are paying for a max aperture of f/2 when the lens is only good at f/5.6 (maybe a third of a stop less)and over. At the current MSRP this lens is completely overpriced. The Nikon 35 f/1.8G is far better for much less money (yes, I know that it's a DX lens).-----------------------------------------------Alternative 1: Samyang-----------------------------------------------Many times better than the 35 f/2d is the Samyang 35 f/1.4 (which also goes by the name of Rockinon and Bower but it's the exact same lens).The Samyang is an optical marvel which can put the equivalent Zeiss to shame. Leaving the fact that it's manual focus (same as Zeiss and older Nikon 35mms), the Samyang is the absolut bang for the buck. Nothing comes close to it. Considering it's manual focus changes the equation a little bit and levels the playfield with the other 35 primes.If you have no problems with manual focus, if you can live with it, then the Samyang is "the" bargain of 35mm prime lenses and an absolute winner irrespective of the price.-----------------------------------------------Alternative 2: Sigma-----------------------------------------------(Note: I sold my Samyang to buy the new Sigma 35mm f/1.4)The difference between the Sigma and the Nikon is abysmal. Gigantic. Staggering.The improvement over the 35 f/2d is far beyond what you can expect from the price difference.The Sigma is sharp and contrasty @ f/1.4. It also has less distorion, less vigneting, better contrast, and significantly less optical aberrations than the nikon 35 f/2Against the Samyang is neck to neck. Below f/2 - f/2.8 the Sigma is better. f/4 goes for the Samyang. f/5.6 and above is a tie.The big bonus of the Sigma over the samyang is the autofocus. It nails it at f/1.4  9 out of 10 times. Incredible.------------------------------------------------Recommendation------------------------------------------------Save some extra money and get the Sigma 35 f/1.4 (which is lightyears ahead of this Nikon).If the price for the Sigma is way above your budget, then go for the Samyang 35 f/1.4, which is a phenomenal optical marvel -and again far, far better than this lens. The only caveat is that is manual focus only (with green dot confirmation though)If manual focus is not your cup of tea and don't have the budget for the sigma, then consider a zoom lens which will give you a reasonable IQ at 35mm and additional focal lengths.If you still want to go for this lens, be warned that it has very poor IQ up to f/2.8 and only acceptable (on average) at f/4 -and as I said, is flawless at f/8.As of this moment I wouldn't pay more than $150 for a second hand copy of this lens. Anything above that (given the alternatives) is wasting your money.
At $1,500, this lens should be mint straight from the factory.  My copy failed to auto-focus properly and appeared to have serious backfocus issues.  Although the "Silent Wave Motor" made for very quick focusing times (if the copy had been focusing properly), it made a pronounced metal-on-metal or metal-on-plastic, high-pitched scraping sound at times.  I understand this is endemic in many copies.  Lastly, I did not think I would miss the added focal length of a 17-55mm or 18-55mm, but that extra 36mm-55mm range really does make a difference, and makes this lens less usable for DSLRs.  More importantly, when focused (by chance), the optics did not produce sharpness substantially superior to my other, less expensive, DX lenses.On the other hand, this lens is not as heavy or large as other reviewers have noted.  I would have no problem carrying the 17-35mm all day, every day.  Perhaps my review would have been different if I received a different copy.  But for $1,500, this should never happen.  We as consumers should not be forced to return substandard equipment in order to ultimately get a copy that works.
I had one of these on my car for a few years and noticed the rubber base protector had cracks. My OLD antenna looks like the pictures in Amazon (including base pad and Cobra logo) but the NEW one does not.I noticed there was no Cobra logo which is strange but I'm fine with that BUT the rubber base plate (protector) has been redesigned and is now terrible.  Where the old version was fairly thick and heavy duty the new redesign is as 'thin as a condom' and only comes 'part way up the base'.  The magnet base without the protective covering is SHARP and would scratch the paint if used without the cover.I had a hard time because the base cover had slipped off the magnet during shipping and was difficult to get back on because of it's thinness and small edge grip.New is not always better and I'll stick with by old base plate (cracks and all) and just replace the upper parts.Electronics has been my profession for years and while the antenna would work fine for 'awhile' I'm not going to try it. Magnet mount antennas are often moved or removed for car washing, security or other reasons.Shame on Cobra for the obviously bad design!I do NOT recommend this 'Cobra HG A 1500 Base-Load Medium Magnet Mount 300W CB Antenna'!
I picked these up because I like to run and thought some lightweight headphones would be more comfortable for longer runs. I was wrong. These are indeed extremely lightweight but that's not a good thing. They never stay in place and I am constantly readjusting them. They always feel like they are about to fall off of my head. It's very annoying and I have already stopped using them for this reason.If you're considering some lighter headphones for working out with, it's just not worth it to save a gram here or there in weight. Headphones like these are never really heavy in the first place, so just get some normal ones and skip these.Sound quality was fine. I don't expect theater quality sound from any pair of cheap headphones.
Cord is way too short, that is my biggest issues here.  I kept pulling it out of my phone on the plane.
what you pay its what you get. thats all i have to say for this product. thanks for reading. l
These headphones hurt the insides of my ears and the sound quality is not the best.  I wouldn't buy them again.
I wanted earbuds on a light headband, but these don't fit in my ear far enough to hear the sound well, and are quickly uncomfortable in my ear too.
Just got these headphones figuring they would feel and sound like the sony walkman headsets of old but they do not. Cheap feeling plastic, thin sound, no bass and strange wire exit from the speakers make the headset a sub par replica. They are not worth a penny more than 5 bucks. Its not worth going through the hasstle of returning, so I'll just keep them as a backup. Guess I have to deal with the modern earbud style to get decent sound quality. Oh well.
Don't get this thinking that it will save your wrist/hands. It has no forward/back buttons, so you end up moving the cursor around a lot more than with a regular mouse that has forward/back buttons.I own this trackball, yet it was so limited that I put it away in favor of a mouse with lots of buttons. I've taken it out a couple of more times thinking that it *must* be worthwhile, but it isn't -- I spend too much time moving the mouse around just to "Go Back" in the browser, or in Windows Explorer. The Marble Mouse trackball by Logitech is much nicer than this "Trackman" model. It has a different shape, but has small forward and back buttons, in addition to trackball and regular left and right mouse buttons.The Marble Mouse is better for these reasons:* Has forward and back buttons* Can be used both LEFT- and right-handed.If your right hand is hurting, consider trying the Razer mice. I've tried a LOT of different products, looking for something easy on the hands, and the Razer Lachesis is one that I found has these advantages:* Has forward/back buttons* Can be used left- or right-handed* Has a wheel (like other good mice)* Several other buttons, which stay out of the way if not needed, but can be programmed to do more than just forward/back* Has very SLICK pads, so it moves very easily* Can be made to move far with very little movement(This is good if you have more than one large display. It can be put in low-resolution mode with a button press.)* Lightweight(Requires less effort to move around.)I haven't written a Razer review, but probably should. I just saw this Trackman in passing and just HAD to warn others. It gets pretty good reviews which led me to purchase it in the first place a couple of years back. If there were any reviews like this one, I sure missed them. I haven't tried everything, yet, so there's probably something even better than my current mouse, or the Marble Mouse trackball. Which reminds me...I use the Cordless Optical Trackman and use it daily on a Mac. It works flawlessly on Windows, but jitters at higher acceleration settings on the Mac. Still, I've found *no* better trackball, because it:* is wireless* has forward/back buttons (essential)* has a couple of other programmable buttons* has page up/down buttons (tiny and awkwardly placed)* has a scroll wheel(Note: the Cordless Optical Trackman is only for right-handed use.)If you haven't discovered the time/wrist-saving forward back buttons, do yourself a favor and get a device that has them. If you're expecting them, steer clear of the Logitech corded Trackman Wheel Optical.
Wish I had another of the earlier model - this one is a pain to use.My biggest complaint is my middle finger keeps inadvertently pressing the right key.I like moving the ball with my index finger and the earlier model had a smaller ball.
This review is for a trackball, not a mouse with a ball.I have been using a trackball for years because computers are easier to manage when my hand does not have to move a mouse around, and the trackball can be manipulated fixed in place, without a mouse pad, I might add. Unfortunately there are fewer and fewer real trackballs available. The mice made with a ball are not really the same as a trackball.My new computer does not have a PS2 port, and my Trackman Marble FX does not have a USB connector. So, I bought a new trackball with the USB interface, and here is my experience with Logitech's Trackman Wheel Optical:For years, as a right-handed user, I have been using their TrackMan Marble FX where the ball is placed for use by the right index finger. This arrangement it far superior to a ball that's placed for use by the thumb, as is the case with this Trackman Wheel Optical. The thumb is needed for clicking the left button, not for moving the ball.Apparently I am not the only complainer about this change. My Trackman Marble FX is not made any more, and I have seen used ones offered for no less than 200+ dollars. I wish Logitech would reconsider their marketing strategy and re-issue the very good Trackman Marble FX in a USB2 version in its original 30-40 dollar range; maybe even wireless.
This was a replacement for one of my speakers. While removing and replacing, I tightened the screw that holds the speakers at a set angle, and it shattered from metal fatigue. I love my Bose system, and had to replace this bracket, but you'd think it would be made of a higher quality and/or better design.
I bought this because my car stereo is old enough that it only has a radio, a cassette player, and a single CD player. I wanted to listen to my *own* music, but I was getting tired of burning CDs and cassettes would be even worse, so I decided to try one of these which I'd use with my iPhone or tablet. This adapter works fairly well except that in my car it clicks. Constantly. *click* *click* *click* over and over and over. It gets annoying. It's loud too. I can turn up the volume enough to cover it up, but that can be *way* too loud - I have nothing against loud music, but I do like my hearing...I'm told that this is a pretty common problem with all adapters like this however - it's the auto-reverse mechanism kicking in since because the "tape" doesn't move, it thinks it's stopped. I've found a potential fix online and will have to try it, but until then, this thing is only worth 3 stars to me. At most.EDIT: couldn't figure out a way to fix it.EDIT2: after about 3 months of use despite the clicking, the cord snapped upon being pulled by accident, so it's pretty weak. I've decided to try another brand. Apparently from what I've read, your mileage with one of these may vary. It's pretty random.
Skip it.  Sound quality is only fair.  I bought it to use between my Palm Pilot mp3 player and my car stereo.  Later I purchased an FM wireless transmitter that plays through the radio.  Cheaper and much better sound.
I am a Sony devotee, I love Sony and it is my brand, and I was enjoying the product for what it did.  I was able to listen to my ipod in my car and it was great, but recently I started to hear clicking. A regular ticking with a pretty consistant period, and it drives me crazy. I tested my ipod with headphones and it played perfectly, my radio played perfectly so it wasn't my speakers. I just find it frustrating that it only lasted for 5 months or so.
Cables function ok. They are not very durable at all. Almost like a soft jelly plastic covering the copper lines.
Copper coated aluminum, low strand count.  Garbage wire; my speakers sing now that I've replaced this aluminum junk with proper oxygen-free copper wires.
it work,for the price i didn't expect much,poor quality,they break off leaving all the small pieces if you ever gonna take the speaker wires out,maybe i didn't use the proper wire cutter,but it wasn't good quality copper i thought.so we do get what we paid
These, as other similar adapters, seem to be made to fail in no less than an hour.  The connections are poor and barely work, the quality feels cheap (after all, it is, but finding one built with pro / lasting specs is next to impossible)  I cringe whenever I need to use these, and am  sick off making excuses to client why one ear is out, whips the signal drops when the move two inches to the left, etc.  Id say &#34;stay away&#34; but I don't have another suggest where to get anything better.,.
This surge protector will work if all your plugs are of conventional size. I have an air conditioner and timer plug that are fairly large, and cover more than their own outlet.  As a result, I am returning this product.  A design flaw in my opinion, and not reflected accurately in the picture.
I can't recommend this turntable. Its cheap junk. I've had it for a few years, but I've never used it much at all. Its spent 90% of that time in the box. In the last month I started listening to more vinyl though, buying a few jazz LPs off ebay. Now when I move the needle to the playing position it wants to retract and stop. I can get it to work, but then it will start doing it again. I opened it up to try to figure out what was going on with it. I can see what's causing the behavior but I don't really know what happened to make it do what its doing. Its like there is something missing. I got annoyed looking at the stupid, cheap design of the thing and just resolved to buy a new one (not Sony) with direct drive that will hopefully last.
I paid about $50 for this turntable one year ago. The biggest problem with this turntable is that even the slightest floor vibrations cause obnoxious bass thumps that make my speakers bounce like crazy. And don't turn the amp too loud or the vibrations from the speakers cause obnoxious feedback through the turntable. This turntable needs some kind of shocks or suspension to absorb floor vibrations. When the needle hits the record, or is lifted, it also causes loud bass thumps through my speakers that strain the amp/speakers. Another problem with this turntable is that the RCA output cable is literally 1 foot long- I am NOT exaggerating. So if you plan on placing the turntable more than a foot away from your amp, you'll need to invest in an RCA extension cord and an RCA female-female converter. I won't comment on the audio quality because this is the only turntable I've ever owned, but it seems mediocre to me. Once again, another chintzy Sony product.. they really make junk these days. =/
Just don't like the layout. Very hard to get used to the buttons since they're so small. Really got used to the microsoft trackball explorer and since they stopped making them I guess I'm stuck with this. It's about the closest I can find to it.
I don't think I need to repeat the great reviews on this item but I can tell you that it works very well with my D90. The auto focus is pretty fast even at low light unlike some of the comments I saw. The auto focus Nikon body has a male drive pin that engages to the female pin on the lens ring and the focus locks it plenty fast for most applications. You need to make sure that you engage the auto focus switch next to the lens lock button on front of the D90 body. Switch it off for manual focus otherwise you will not be able to move the focus ring. Being able to use this motor-less lens was one of the main reasons why I purchased the D90 because it just saved me $500-%600 getting this lens. I am sure a $700 lens will be faster but since I don't use this lens much it suits my need quite well. Just took a photos of a duck zoomed in all the way and compared it with my $350 18-105 Nikor zoom, the difference is day and night due to the optical zoom of course. Now, I can take photos of birds. Can't see any reason to spend $700 for a dozen photos a year which is what my usage rate is. The lens has no VR so I braced myself and took a photo of a duck and the result is stunning. I compared the same photo with a friend's with the 18-200 and I must say the result is better on the 70-300mm since it is really a 450mm optical zoom. Not really a fair comparison since it is twice the zoom but now I can clearly see no reason to get the 18-200. My 18-105 with the 70-300 give me the complete range coverage I need. I don't make a living with photography and I can't really tell the difference between photos taken with this lens and a $700 lens unless I put them side by side. If there is a difference, you would have to use a magnifying glass I am sure. The photos are just great already. I would not buy this lens if I have a D40 because it will not work with auto focus. There is a Sigma lens for $50 more if you have the D40, not sure the result you will get with that lens. I have an old Sigma lens which is just horrible but this was purchased 15 years ago, I think a lot has changed since. If you have the D90 or any focus motor body Nikon camera and want to save big money, you will be very pleased that you get this one.Update: after comparing with other lens, this lens is not sharp enough.
These are my first Telephoto lens, I don't like  optical quality of pictures are not sharp, with some cromatical aberration and it's noisy. Good autofocus. I think is better to save more money and get another like 70-300 VR.I like  to take pictures of birds and animals, but the pictures are not sharp, maybe to other needs but not mine.It could be that mine are defective.Second Revision:Now I'm using a Monopod I get Better results, My pictures still look a litle blurry at 300mm, I'm taking pictures at 270mm  with very nice results .
I loved these speakers for nearly 3 years. Then the DIN cable that goes from the control pod (right speaker with controls) to the subwoofer stopped working. Search the internet; it's a common problem after you've had them for a while. Don't buy these if you want them to work for more than a few years.
With minimal use- I am talking about 50 hours of use during a 3 year time period, the subwoofer malfunctioned.  I did expect to get more quality and use out of these speakers.
Quick Update : The picture quality of this camera is horrible. Too many blurred and/or out of focus pictures. Had to sell off my S200 because it can't take sharp/crisp/clear pictures even in daylight ! Many other users on dpreview forums have same problems & Canon hasn't released any firmware update to fix it. My suggestion now is to avoid S200/S230/A40 because of focus problems.My old review continues below :Canon has another winner in its new S200 model just like the S110 and S100.It has the following positives,1. Excellent looks/build quality.2. Great night shots, not found on any other compact 6 oz. camera, new long shutter feature in manual mode for upto 15 secs (tripod a must for this).3. Very reliable and tons of features like charger works all over the world, PAL/NTSC video out, all cables included (unlike Sony).4. Accepts cheaper Compact Flash cards which are easily available in sizes upto 256MB. Not expensive 64MB sticks here :)5. Very much pocketable. Easily goes into any pocket.6. 2.1 MP may looks low compared to other 3/4 MP cameras but this one offers more features without sticking you with any sticks ! Don't just use MPixels as your sole criteria when selecting camera. If you won't print them bigger than 8x10" then 2MP should be enough for now unless you have that extra cash :) Also Canon can't have a 3MP on the Elph's since they have to sell their S30/S40 also !7. 2x zoom very faster to start and fold back. Works smoothly. You can turn the digital zoom off permanently.8. LCD is superb, pictures look great on the 1.5" LCD. (a bigger 1.8" LCD on other need not neccessarily mean better quality, my last years Fuji had 1.8" and comes no where near this 1.5")10. I haven't encountered any problems downloading pics till now. I don't see any reason to buy a CF card reader, the included cable works fine took just 3 mins for 100 big pictures11. Comparing this with S330 is really very tough. S330 is heavy and feels rock solid, looks even better than S200 and has 3x zoom. S200 because of its light weight and smaller significantly smaller size is better to carry around. Play with both in your local store before deciding between the two.11. Great user interface... think of these Elph's as Nokia's of digicams. Other cheaper camera's out there might not have same reliability, features, user interface and picture quality.Things that could be better,1. Only 2x Zoom, Canon needs to get this up to 3x next year. (And 4x on S330's replacement).2. Battery... you might have to buy a second one for extra 45 bucks depending on your needs... I guess this is the case with any ultra compact camera3. The battery/CF doors feel flimsy.4. Canon's ZoomBrowser EX software is very unstable. It has crashed atleast 5 times in one week on Windows XP. also it takes long time to "update its database" whenever any pciture is deleted or addedd to the directory. Canon needs to iron out the problems in this. You may be better off using some other SW for editing/managing your pics, use this one just for downloading pics.5. Price is still high for a 2MP camera, although its become much more affordable than last year.6. Movie mode is almost useless because of 5 sec limit on decent sized clip. Its just a marketing thing.7. Included CF card is just 8MB ! Someone has to start including these necessary things like a decent 64MB card along with new cameras.8. Camera gets pretty hot in a few mins of use and the buttons on S200 feel tough to use compared to S330. This is part of the deal in buying a such compact camera.Spend few extra bucks on this cool camera and you won't regret ! Getting a camera this compact has some compromises but well worth the ultra portability you get.
When I set this up it worked like a charm and I was very pleased with my purchase.  When it stopped working, as recommended by some reviewers, I placed it inside a cozy birdhouse where it would be protected from the rain and wind.  It worked a few times after that but then stopped working again altogether.  It was great while it lasted and it is indeed a bargain for those people for whom it functions as intended, but not for me.
UPDATE - I lowered rating to 2 stars. I would not buy this again. Mine worked well until the first set of batteries were down, exactly five days after my Amazon deadline to return it! The sensor and receiver lights still come on but the alarm no longer works making it useless! Mine worked well as a motion alarm until the sound quit. This is not a quality made product. I'm going to try the more expensive one made by another company.I call this motion sensor system a limited good value buy due to its downfalls that despite the low price will be a deal breaker for many people. I'm a gadget guy and I'm budget minded in that I practice money management. I let go of my money at least as hard as it is to get it.To save a penny or two, someone (not "they" or the "company") decided to broaden acceptable manufacturing specs such that the motion sensor is enough out of round on both ends that a light wind will cause it to rotate and set off the Chimes.To hype sensor sensitivity or save a penny by using the most common off the shelf 180 degree sensor, usefulness is  reduced.I've been experimenting with this unit since I got it to see what exactly I can do with it. People can walk across my driveway on the sidewalk & not activate the chime but a car, SUV.or truck passing by the same way on the street sets it off every time.What many people want is a more focused sensor like mall stores had to compensate for having a wide open door way. More like an light beam straight line that chimes when something passes through. Like it is with hearing aids, the sensor industry has not kept up with the digital revolution. The Chinese have a less MBA notion of profit. Guess I'll have to search Chinese retailers for the inexpensive, low energy, feature rich security sensor  digital revolution technology makes possible.
I have tried everything to avoid false alarms, but it seems to me that this item needs to look across a perfectly barren expanse to work. I have a few 10-ish-foot-tall trees on both sides of my drive within about 30 feet of the pavement, and every time it's windy at all, as well as occasionally when it's not, the sensor activates falsely. The only thing moving in its view when it goes off is tree limbs 45 or so feet away. Narrowing the sensor's field with tape to less than ten percent open resulted in no alarm when needed, while about 15% open still gets lots of false alarms. I have tried many different positions and apertures with no better results. Upon thinking about it more, it seems obvious that a motion sensor is going to go off if anything nearby is moving, so any trees it its view would spoil its efficacy. I give it two stars because it does go off when somebody goes by it, but even a few false alarms every hour is too many. Doesn't anybody make an electric-eye type of driveway sensor? Why not? My garage-door's electric-eye stopper works great.
Sound is for the teens = boommie w no details ,but 4 this price its OK...
The sound is good enough to live up to Sennheiser expectations, but the ear pad sits on the soft cartilage of your ears, rather than your scull bone, so it is uncomfortable and too warm.I have a lighter Sennheiser at work that I wear all day without problems because it has a very gentle and light ear piece that rests on only the middle of the ear. When I come home and put on this heavy, uncomfortable set, I am always disappointed.
Why would they make a cord that is like 10ft long?  What are you supposed to do wind it up and put it in your pocket?  The construction of these are very cheap, just one piece plastic headband that hurts your head.  The cord is VERY thin and will break easily if snagged.  It has decent sound, similar to all the cheaper over the ear headphones  on the market.  Another problem I had with these, as I have with all over-the-ear headphones is that they make your ears sweat really bad!  I just can't wear them very long because of that.  I have relegated these to my use when making some recordings because of the long cord, but I never wear them while listening to my iphone because of the long and very fragile cord.  I know if I snagged them one time the cord would break.
