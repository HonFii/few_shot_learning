This mount works really well once you get it up and going.  Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV's and their mounting hole locations.
For the price, this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money.
I'd never bought one of these, mainly due to the high prices in the retail stores.  I hadn't looked online much, and hadn't really needed a monitor mounting device until recently.This thing is well built, and it does the job.  It's not fancy but if you are just looking for an inexpensive way to hang a monitor (TV or PC) on the wall this will do the job.  It comes with a nice bag of heavy-duty hardware.  It is primarily designed for mounting TV sets, but you can get it to work with a PC monitor, as long as it has the VESA mounting.It mainly articulates side-to-side and in-and-out.  It'll pivot a bit up and down, but that's limited.
I am impressed with the solid design of this TV Wall Mount.  I think this weights more than the 26" TV it is supporting.  It also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the TV isn't too difficult.  The one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the TV.  This does assure the TV stays put but if you plan to move the TV on the stand a lot this may be a negative.  Overall I am pleased with the stand - it seems like a good value.
Very well made, strong mount the only problem I have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed. Pictures do not distinguish between Stud mount and concrete. Also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsFor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually 1.5 inches wide so this mount only requires 2 lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a 23 lb TV. The four outboard holes on the wall mount are 1.3" apart so don't try to use them in a wall stud measuring 1.5" wide.Helpful hint: I have help install at least 6 other wall mounts because of family or friends so I cannot say that I am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to do.After comparing the instructions on this unit to others I have installed I still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail. Some complain that the back plate was too big for the TV they used but it's fits perfect on theLG 32LK450 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTVI am using it on.Works perfectly for the area of the room I am using it in which allows me to rearrange the room without the need to move the TV.
It took about 10 mins to install this TV Wall Mount with a 48 inch Samsung TV.  It does the job, there are much more expensive arms, but this does the trick.
It is up know and should work fine, but it was hard to get it to fit my TV due to the bulge on the bottom, but I made it work and it is on the wall.
I have a 26" LCD monitor mounted on unit.Seems sturdy enough, would prefer a more fluid motion and a way to adjust the pivot of the screen without tools.  As it is I keep it loose and it is reasonbly adjustable.For the price I certanily can't complain and would recommend this unit.
I thought this was a great value for a wall mount.  I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.  It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket.  Is it the best quality ever, no.  It is decent quality, and it worked well for me.
I bought this device not expecting much out of it.  Reading books is a breeze...the screen is clear even in bright light.  The device is VERY light...feels like holding a small clipboard. I find myself touching the reading part of the screen....just a bad habit as I am used to using my iphone.  As with any device, you might want to breeze thru the manual first because I sure didn't...took me a while to figure out that the "n" on the front is the "home" key.The craftsmanship feels pretty low end.  I think if for some reason it fell out my hand, it would definitely break.  i have never dropped it...that's just my opinion.  Battery life is good...tho using the wifi decreases the battery life a lot faster.  Though this can browse the net, don't even think about having a good experience doing that...the browser sucks.  Keep in mind, this is not a computer, nor a pocket PC/tablet PC...so if you're looking for something to browse the net, you should buy something else.On a whole, I find the device to be a little slow, but great for what it is intended for. it probably "turns" the pages as fast as you would turn the page of a real book.  I'm already used to fast devices, so that is probably why this seems slow to me.**International Buyers**This device will download books if you're outside the US, however, you need to have a credit card that was issued from the US to purchase the books.  I even tried purchasing an eGift card from Barnes and Nobles and using that to purchase my books, and even though i was successful in purchasing the gift card, it will check your default credit card prior to deducting credit from your gift card.  I ended up having to change the name on the account to my mom's name and used her credit card to purchase books. (she lives in the US)
First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called "LendMe". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N; or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.I'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.
I have been working on my fiction writing skills, and wanted an eBook reader so that I could read a variety of other novels to learn from them.  The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the "loop" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to "root" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.
First off, do not expect Nook Color to do wonders.  It is not meant to be tablet or an iPad replacement.  It is foremost an e-Reader with some bells and whistles.If I'm given a choice, I would not buy a Nook.  For the price, I would rather get a Kindle Fire.  I own 4 laptops, 1 iPad 2 for my wife, and 3 Kindle Fires for my kids.  Nook Color is an afterthought and it is for me.  I bought my used Nook Color on another site for $114 (free shipping) 2 weeks ago.  And it was a steal.  The Nook I received was in working order and it looked new.I had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly.  The only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets I own.  Again, I reminded myself that this is not a tablet so I had to be fair.  The features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best.Fast forward to today.  B&N; was smart to release an update (1.4.1).  If you already own a Nook Color, you should get the update.  The update improves the speed dramatically.  The navigation still lacks finesse though.Here are some of the goods- I bought it cheap- It has an expansion slot.  I inserted a 16GB micro SD card and Nook recognizes it right away.- The web works fine.  It can now even watch some YouTube.  It also runs Flash.  Nook 1, iPad 0.- The new update allows NetFlix to run.- There are some apps that are extremely useful.  I love the Smithsonian Channel and Pulse.- The magazines look great.  The update also improve the navigation.- The interactive books are great.  My daughter absolutely loves it.And now the bads- I constantly look for free stuff.  Unfortunately, B&N; doesn't offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile.- The apps itself, is sad to say the least.  The offering is a fraction of what you can find in iPad and Amazon.  And most of them are costly too.- While the update improve the speed of web-surfing, it still is slower than iPad and Kindle Fire.- The speaker is terrible.  It is located on the back of the device.  If you hold the Nook on your hand, you may cover the speaker. The best solution is to use a head phone.- The navigation overall needs to be improved. It is a basic Android without much thought.  At times I don't even know whether to double-tap or hold to get more options.Here is my final take.  If you are short on cash, and would like a good e-reader/tablet.  Go get a Kindle.  If you can find a Nook for less than $150. Go for it.I would not spend more than $200 on a Nook (be it a Color/Tablet).  There are much better options out there.Update January 24, 2012I have used my Nook for a month now and all in all, I like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books.  It sure beats a 10 incher tablet.  The update 1.4.1 is definitely a must if you want to use Nook Color to its full potential.  However, I found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dual-boot and disable any sideload of apps.  The version 1.4.0 allows the Nook to load Amazon app and the Launcher EX.  Basically it allows other apps other than B&N; to be loaded.  The automatic update 1.4.1 disable this option.  So, if you are dare enough to install other apps, you can backdate the version to 1.4.0 if you want to load other apps.Update February, 2012Nook continues to lose to Kindle Fire in terms of contents.  B&N; could not match to the behemoth of Amazon and I don't think it will ever be.  However, if you are stuck with Nook, there are a few apps that you must have (they are all free).  It helps the Nook Color to be a good companion in a boring world.- NetFlix is a must.  7 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones.  You are good to go.- Smithsonian is interesting.  Want to learn something that you forgot.  This app works great but contents updates are slow.- Dolphin Internet Explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing.  Very fast and very convenient.- Don't know what interest you, try Stumbleupon.  It randomly pulls internet content based on your interest.  Works great on YouTube vidoes.- Good with words, try Nook Crossword.- Who doesn't use Dropbox.  It is a must.- Springpad is great to jot down quick notes.- Pandora works great too, but you need a pair of headphones though.- Who needs newspaper when you have Pulse.
I have been down and up with this reader for the past 5 months, but since April, it has been a joy.  B&N; has gotten its act together.  The problem I had with not being able to open books has been solved. B&N; not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them.  There is no longer any problem with opening any books.When I first bought my reader, the tech support people were not well-trained. They are now.  I have 80 books on it and no problems with any of them.Now, the goodies:  B&N; just introduced Enhanced Editions of some books. These have videos, audio clips, animated maps, etc.embedded in the text.  It's wonderful.  I'm reading D-Day, and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text.  For instance, you read about Eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the Normandy Coast.  You don't just read about bombing or fighting,you hear and see as well. It's a whole new reading experience and available only on the NOOKcolor (or the iPad with the NOOK app.)Pictures in magazines like National Geographic are gorgeous.  They look better than the print versions. There is a selection of apps for the NOOKcolor, with more coming out all the time.However, if you want all the Android apps, then  you can get an N2A SD card on Amazon that turns your NOOKcolor into a full Android tablet with access to the Market. You then  have the option of booting the reader up as a NOOKcolor or an Android Tablet.  You can even get a Kindle App so you can get and read books from Kindle on your NOOKcolor.Some people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you can't read it outdoors.  Not true.  I read my NOOKcolor in my sunny back yard all the time, and, although I'm a 76 year old lady, I can read for hours on it with no problem.Now for the goodies besides the Enhanced Editions.  You can get an app that allows you to work on Office documents on your reader.  Downloading files, pictures, and music is a breeze.The NOOK also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries.  All you need is a library card.  Libraries all over the US are lending ebooks.  So, you don't have to buy all the books you want to read.  That's a big saving. And, it takes less than a minute to download a  book.  You just connect your reader with a USB cord and Adobe Digital Editions displays the books you've borrowed & you drag the ones you want to the My NOOKcolor shelf.  As with Kindle, there is also a Lend Me feature so that your friends can borrow from you.The touch screen is very sensitive and I'm very clumsy, so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily, rapidly, and without bringing up unwanted menus.  But that was true of the iPhone when I got my first one,Why don't I go all the way  and give this 5 stars?  Because the device doesn't have a "sync to farthest point read" feature, so if you decide to look at an earlier page,the only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar.  I can never get it to stop at just the page I want.  The same is true of clicking on endnotes.  When you're through reading them, you have to navigate backwards to the text. There is a Back button displayed on the Notes page, but it disappears before you can read your note.  B&N; has some work to do on this.In sum, if you buy it at Barnes and Noble, the NOOKcolor is only $249, half the price of the cheapest iPad or even Android Tablets.  Yet, for $39.95 more you can get the card to turn it into a full Android Tablet.  It is incredibly more versatile than the Kindle. Page turning is smoother than on the Kindle--or am I the only one who sees the afterimage of the page you're going from while you're turning pages on the Kindle?  On the NOOKcolor, like the iPad, you just touch and you're  on the next page.One other thing: naturally, a touch screen will get smudged.  B&N; says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth.  I found that didn't clean it enough.  If the screen isn't clean, it can get jumpy.  So, knowing that the iPhone has a capacitative touch screen as does the NOOKcolor, I tried using the products sold in the Apple Store to clean the screen.  They work perfectly.As mentioned in my earlier review, I also like the NOOKcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page you're reading.  Also, I find the Web browser is just fine. In fact, when I'm  reading and see a name or word I need more info on, I just touch it and when the popup appears, I choose Wikipedia or Google and surf to my heart's content. Then I just touch the "book" icon on the lower screen and I'm back to the page I was reading.  It's smooth and fast.I belong to Goodreads and when I'm through with a book, I can just go to the Goodreads app on my NOOKcolor and post my review immediately. Small touch, but nice.
I should preface this by saying I also own a nook (non color 3g) and an iPad 3gI order a LOT from amazon so when it came down to getting an e-reader it was a tough choice to pick B&N; over amazon.Why did I do this?I still LOVE the value of a retail store, living down the street from a B&N; i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books. There have been plenty of books that by their cover (yes i judge) and short summary I would've bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books, you really can't experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad. All that being said, I decided to support B&N; because their library is just as large as amazons and I throughly enjoy their storefronts.Ok onto the review.Reading on the nook color is easy, the Android interface is fast and reliable, not to mention easy rootable!Reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook. There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it, I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at $250 (buy directly from B&N;) you cannot complain, Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.
I agree with the other positive reviews. The color nook is an excellent reading machine, much better than either the Kindle or the e-ink B&W nook. Using the color Nook is totally intuitive with only a few positive surprises at some unexpected capabilities. The battery life is around 8 hours, so you will need to have your special recharging cord, which comecolor s with the Nook, handy. There are small imperfections in the Nook operating system that will get corrected as Barnes and Noble releases updates. The same was true with the Kindle and B&W Nook when first released. The key to a good reading experience with the color Nook is to turn the brightness down, way down. That way eye fatigue is minimal, similar to the e-ink B&W readers with similar brightness. Even with the brightness down, the contrast is excellent and the letters clear. When browsing the web, you might want to turn the brightness up a bit to beautifully display all those colors. The web browser is excellent. It works for email, especially Google mail.  The trick with the power limitations is to keep the brightness down when using the Nook as a reader and turn the internet off. Only turn the internet on when browsing or shopping. That way, when you put it down at night, the power level will be the same in the morning as it was when you went to sleep. Costing only $249 (Dec 2010) at Barnes and Noble, it's affordable and useful, especially if you travel.  The minus 1 star is for the few little glitches in the 1.0 operating system (based on Android 2.2), for the 8 hour battery life, and for the current lack of Apps. For what it is supposed to do, it does it well; it's better than an i-Pad (smaller, lighter, and far less costly). Upgrades and Apps will follow, making an excellent device even better.
Bought this for my wife to replace her aging Sony reader. She really enjoyed it as a backlit reader and web browser for many months. Then I decided to root it and turn it into a full Android tablet. Now it's sooo much more than what she ever thought she needed and something she can't live without. Performance isn't bad on anything we've installed. Rooting takes some tech skills, but isn't too bad. I would highly recommend the tablet even if you don't root it.
First off, for those of you buying this product expecting the e-ink experience, you are wrong.  This isn't an e-ink screen, if that is what you are looking for, go with (a) the original nook, (b) the kindle, or (c) any of the other e-ink dedicated e-readers on the market.This iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers:-The Magazine reader-Students with text books that have graphics-Childrens' books with lots of pictures-Comic book readersIf you notice, these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics, which is something e-ink can't yet do!PRICEFor the price, you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality, though, with some technical knowledge, it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market (though it may void your warranty, so do it at your own risk).  Similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color, but they come with full functionality.  Another device this has been compared to is the iPad- which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model.  On the price point, you are definitely getting a decent deal, though, you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost.Also note, you are not getting 3G access or any other cellular service to access the market- unlike the original nook, that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go.  The likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser- this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content- which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get.  Instead of mobile data service, users have the option of accessing the BN market and the full internet through wireless.  With today's cell phone technology, many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go- when they are away from their home network.  Overall, this isn't a big deal to me, but I am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the BN market, so this would be a draw back for you for sure.WEIGHTHonestly, this device does run a little on the heavy side, however, I do believe that it is slightly lighter than it's predecessor.  Still, for the e-reader market, it is heavy.  For the tablet market, it is a little more reasonable.  The weight is a sacrifice, but as long as you aren't trying to read while laying on your back, you should be ok.USER FRIENDLINESS AND EXTRA FEATURESI find this device to be quite simple almost immediately.  Every function that I have looked for has been where I expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me.  The page controls while you read work great, and I love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook.The full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard (which is always annoying).This device also integrates with your facebook, twitter, and google accounts.  This is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media.Another feature that is nice to have on the reader is Pandora- it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader.One thing I wish this device had was access to android market, but I guess you can't have everything.OVERALLI like this tablet.  I think it was a good buy and I would buy another one if this one broke.  For the price, you are getting an underpowered tablet, but it still has access to the full internet- which you can use multiple windows in.  It is primarily a reader, which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as e-ink, but for the market it is being geared towards, you can't really complain about that!
I purchased my nook color in june of 2012. i had been online looking at various e-readers and comparing the features. i finally decided on the Nook color.**pros**-beautiful screen-very responsive touch screen-excellent battery life (you must leave the wi-fi off unless you are using it)-good overall feel to the device..seems solid and fits nice in your hands.-pretty decent web browsing (youtube etc)-custom sized text sizes, (you can go from Small to very large)-expansion micro sd card slot, (supports up to 32gb) for music, documents etc, note you CANNNOT Store e-books purchased from bn.com on the card!**cons**-diffcult to read in direct sunlight, (due to the technology used for the color display)-books CAN Be expensive, but are generally slightly less than retail, no physical book means you don't have tons of read books cosuming space around your home.-nearly have to pay for ALL APPS, (angry birds, etc)-Wimpy single speaker that is HARD to hear even with volume turned all the way up- if no screen protector is put on this device, you will have greasy smudges and fingerprints galore. invest in a good screen protector i would suggest the 2X caseen Glareshatter. here is the link: [...]-sometimes the nook color will freeze, prompting you to restart.also, you will want to purchase a cover for the nook color to keep it from getting scratched, or banged up here is the link to the black moko case i have.[...]Considering what it does, it is a great device, its not a $800.00 ipad, so if you purchase this with the expectation of it functioning like an ipad YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. this is a nice color e-reader with basic web browsing, email reading and sending capabilites, so if you wanna check your email and do some light web browising, this is for you. the battery life is amazing, but this is only true if you KEEP THE WIFI OFF. if your wifi is left on, and your not using it, battery life will be short. i only turn on wifi when im downloading a new book (takes about 30 seconds) and when im doing email or web browsing. the web browsing feature is ok, but no subsititue for your desktop or notebook. just keep this in mind.all in all, a good purchase, very pleased with my nook color!update 11/15/13*** e-reader seems to be performing well.if you LEAVE THE WIFI OFF you can get very long battery life.this device was great for its time, but since being released back in 2010 better things have come out.its fine for reading..but not much else.
I initially purchase the Nook Color last year as a cheap alternative for a web device to check email and surf and read a few books now and then when not lugging my laptop around.  When they upgraded and opened the Android capabilities it became an Android Table PC with dedicated email app and improved web goodies.  At last check they now have 366 apps and growing, most are kid stuff and games but do have some useful apps for weather, calendar, note taking, Flight checker, etc.  I can transfer Word, Excel, photos and music to it and learn more each time I mess with it.The one thing missing was a 3G capability of the black n white version.  Both 3G and Bluetooth are built into the guts but who knows if and when they will be turned on.  My solution is Virgin Mobiles Broadband2Go MiFi wireless that supports up to 5 connections.  You can use it for as little as 10 bucks for 10 days or 20 bucks for a month and more options.  I've used the USB version as a backup when traveling for about 3 years so felt OK with the WiFi version.  Works fine with the Nook, did have to use `Forget' and reconnect the first time but now have a fall back `secure' WiFi connection.Doesn't have some of the fancy features of bigger better and more costly Table PCs but for everyday email and surfing, ez to carry around with a nice cover, enough apps to suit in general with more to come it more than meets my needs and NO monthly bills to use it.
The new Nook "Simple Touch" is easy on my eyes for long reading sessions.  The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.  It is July in Texas...so I have not tried using it in direct sunlight.The Nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time.  Turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe.The battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize. At that point, it was using about 2% of the battery for each hour or two of reading.  Reading an hour or two hours a day and using the Wi-Fi an hour or two per week would result in 3 weeks or 4 weeks per charge.  In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.  The Nooks is at its best with a book with plain text, as illustrations, art, drawings, etc. look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.  Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.  My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the "fine print" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.  If you will be reading books, you will like the NOOK Simple Touch. Look around and compare price...the price of the Nook varies widely between stores.
While it doesn't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years. However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires. Even can play Angry Birds if you really wanted to.
Its a good ereader.  How it compares to the kindle, I dunno I seen raves and complaints for both.For an ereader I love the nook.- battery life is awesome.  would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators.- the display looks great, even in direct sunlight more or less.- The simple touch looks cool, very simplistic. no buttons all touchscreen for the most part.- The extra $40 warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nook.covers anytype of damage from what I understand.- Not as many CCNA/cisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast.- No addswhat I dont like;- only comes with 200mb of internal memory.  You have to pick up a microSD card- Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it. Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see;- new screensavers for download- better support for PDF files- ability to read word doc- solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.
I love reading, and in a lot of cases I found myself leaving a book at home because I didn't want to carry any heavy things. This is great! I put in a small 512MB card and now it holds ~50 books! I gave it 4 stars only because the dictionary function isn't very good. I think it has a literal copy of a dictionary, which means it doesn't explain the word fully but still doesn't allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window...
There are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the Nook and Kindle, so I'm not going to go into a full-blown comparison and review. I'm going to focus on my experience owning both, most specifically battery life and availability of books.My husband uses the kindle and I use the Nook. The reason I went with the Nook is because initially I was very "anti" non-paper book. He wanted a kindle and I sneered at the idea. I was being a book snob and didn't like the idea of books in electronic format, so I snubbed my nose at it.However, after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books, and I had 8-10 big paper books, I began to reconsider my position.  Upon return from our vacation I elected to get a Nook. I did so because I liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard, which I thought made the kindle look klunky. I thought overall that the Nook was more aesthetically pleasing. So - I ordered the nook.There are two major things that the kindle has on the Nook, and that is far superior battery life, and significantly more books available for download - especially so if you read non-fiction.The battery life on my Nook is awful. So much so that I ordered a new battery thinking perhaps I had a dud. Nope - it's performance is just the same. If I am actively reading a book I have to recharge  every 3 days. If I don't read it for 10-14 days it will drain on it's own. Comparing this to my husband's kindle, he can go an entire 2 week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle! It takes a couple months to drain with no usage. The kindle's battery life is mega-much more than my Nook. I have serious battery life envy. For that alone I've begun to covet his kindle.The second bummer is that most of the available books for Nook are fiction. There are some of the more popular non-fiction type books available. Usually whatever is most trendy at the time, but for the most part any professional type texts, or anything not on a best seller list that is non-fiction can't be found for the Nook platform. However, when I go to Amazon, 8 of 10 times, I'll find it available for download on the kindle.BUT! One thing about this is that for me, I tend to mark up and highlight my non-fiction books a lot because I'm using them for reference sources. It is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real, paper books. So I've actually come to realize that I'd likely be purchasing my non-fiction as real paper books anyways, so that I can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags (yes - I'm a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books!) So, I'm now fine with the fact that I can't readily download non-fiction to my Nook and instead I continue to buy them as regular, paper books. As I said above, I'd likely buy my non-fiction as real books anyways since I use them as references.I now download all my fiction books to the Nook. So it's become my source for pleasure reading, which is great, since that is the kind of stuff I take with me when I travel or about town anyways, and can just stuff the Nook in my purse.However, I VERY MUCH ENVY THE BATTERY LIFE OF THE KINDLE! If I could stuff a kindle battery into my Nook I'd be a super happy girl.If I had it to do over I'd likely buy a kindle for myself despite it's less aesthetically pleasing appearance. The battery life and availability of books is far superior to the Nook.
I got the Nook the day before Nook Color was announced. I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.There were some rumors that the Nook Color would feature a screen with Mirasol technology, and I was disappointed to learn that it actually had an LCD screen coated with something to reduce glare. I state at an LCD screen all day at work, and don't want to do the same while reading. Plus, I'm not sure how well the LCD screen would fare in the sun and I'm interested to hear feedback from Nook Color owners.I think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines, or textbooks, or kids' books, none of which I'll be doing. Nook Color also stores more books (6000) and allows the reader to send updates to Facebook and Twitter directly from the eReader. Personally, I didn't find any of these extra features particularly appealing, so I'm happily sticking with the original Nook.My Observations/Pros of the Nook-It's bigger than I expected, in a good way. It's not heavy, but has a nice "significant" feel to it.-I think few people realize how clear and book-like the e-Ink screen actually is. I showed the Nook to some friends, and that was the first thing they noticed.-The bottom LCD touch-screen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers.-Getting ePub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy, although you have to connect the Nook to a computer in order to transfer the ePub files.-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.-The instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the Nook.Cons-BN.com has a Free NookBooks section, but for some reason, not all the free eBooks are listed. I saw some Kindle titles that were available for free, and when I searched on BN.com, turns out they were free there as well.-I didn't care much about the LendMe feature of the Nook, but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased eBooks can be lent out. Publishers control which titles can be used for lending, and each book can only be lent out once....ever.-The PDF manual for the Nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing.-There are definitely more Kindle books than NookBooks available, but I hope that will change in the near future.All in all, I am pretty happy with the Nook and I think the fact that it supports a wider range of eBook formats outweighs many of the cons. I like not being tied down to one proprietary format and being able to check out eBooks from the library is priceless to me.
I haven't had these long, but they appear to work.  Only time will tell how long they hold a charge and how many times I can recharge them.  Price was good though.
These batteries work flawlessly. The charger is why I dropped a star. Sometimes it doesn't recognize the batteries.
I've had this kit for a few months now and have recharged a pair of the batteries 3 times, and a third battery once. So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 (Luxeon Rebel LED, 11 - 200 lumens), and a Fenix P1 CE (Cree 7090 XR-E LED - 90 lumens). For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 1-1/2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels I'm using. I don't use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so that's plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included, too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 11-14-09I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles (which is what is supposed to happen), so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11-17-2010I guess it's time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but that's because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer (2010). I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off (that how you replace the battery). I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well, it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery. I didn't have anything to lose so I trimmed off the plastic that was torn, and sealed the case up with some super glue. Fortunately, the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine - still had a full charge! I've since charged it twice and it is still working great. STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Glad this is available and at a decent price.  So many cables are overpriced just because the seller can get more for it.
I have this slot in my Canon 60D which states it is for a HDMI cable that can be hooked up to a HDTV.  It is supposed to provide a sharper picture so I thought I would get one.  Canon wants $50+ for the cable - no thanks.  On Amazon I found a cable for less than $4.00 - can you believe that?  It works great.  Sorry, Canon, but I have found the price of all your accessories way out of line.
These cables are good. Not top of the line. However, they do get the job done and seem to work well with my DSLR.
Nice, economic hdmi cable. I got it for my mom to use with her new tablet. So she can connect it to the tv if she ever wants. It works just great. Nice and long cable. I was surprised how thin the cable was, but everything works fine with connecting her asus transformer to her led and lcd tvs.
I bought this for my 7D, it good, material seems ok, bit cheap, but it works. But I think it is still a bit expensive compared to same cables from MonoPrice.The thing is that I discovered that having a converter from mini and regular HDMI and a cable works better for me.
Use this to play my ipod in my nissan maxima tape player. Works great and the audio is pretty good. Better then radio quality but not cd quality.
I bought the original version of this radio back in the late 70s. We've had this one for over two years.  It's a great basic radio with loud enough sound for shop/work use.  We left it in the Vegas sun and it melted the case a little.  It still works!
It is very large but does have pretty good sound and reception, I live in an area where some people cannot get half of what I get on this unit....buy again because of performance...yes.....buy again .... maybe not because of size being so large....
Some products seem to predict their own futures.  Corning Ware was introduced long before anyone even knew what a microwave oven was and it turned out to be the best cookware for the ubiquitous food zapper.Now, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III takes its place among such prescient products.  Your humble communications technician, seeking to hear another human voice  while on the job in a computer room, found the Superadio III remarkably  well suited to the computer room environment.I had previously brought a  Grundig Yacht Boy 400 and a Sony ICF-2010 to work to listen to an AM talk  radio station, only to find out that what makes them so good for world band  (shortwave) reception are the very things that meant disaster in the  computer room's EMI (electro-magnetic interference) rich atmosphere.  Being  digital receivers, their computer-like circuits eagerly plucked from the  air the squeals, drones and squawks of the network servers, PCs and PBX  system that occupy the room while adding their own synthesizer noise to the  weakened signal.  I pondered the possibilities for better reception.  I  could put the radio nearer an exterior wall, crank up the volume loud  enough to hear while seated at my desk, and be promptly thrown into the  parking lot, since others in the room don't really want to hear the same  station.  Through the interference on the Sony came a commercial for the  CCRadio by C. Crane, a tabletop receiver specially designed for long  distance reception of AM news and talk radio stations (Translation: The  speaker ain't so hot for music).  Pricey but perhaps worth it.I read a  few reviews of the CCRadio and another model kept popping up as the  undisputed CHAMP of Long Distance AM Radio Reception, the standard against  which other contenders are measured, the one, the only, ladies and  gentlemen, let's hear it for the GE 7-2887 Superadio III.  Wow, I thought,  how often I had seen them at WalMart and Kmart and how often I said to  myself, yeah, right, Superadio, ha ha.  Yet, here were some of the  toughest-to-please SOBs who ever twiddled a tuning knob using this radio as THE benchmark.  I was intrigued.A quick visit  to the usual suspects (Best Buy, WalMart, Kmart) proved fruitless  (&quot;Sorry, if it's not on the shelf, we're out. . .No, I don't know when  we'll have more&quot;).  In desperation, I came to Amazon.com, typed  &quot;superadio&quot; in the Search box and there it was in all its  &quot;usually ships in 24 hours&quot; glory, and for less than  the best street price.  2 UPS Second Day Air days later, it was waiting for  me at home.  I didn't unbox the radio until I was back at work the next  day.Even before digging into my Sausage McMuffin with Egg breakfast, I  unpacked the Superadio III, plugged it in and was, indeed, amazed.  The  interference no longer dominated the signal from Los Angeles radio station  KFI.  It was still there, but not as much as on the Sony and Grundig.  The  Superadio III's analog tuner is, by its nature, more immune to it.  Throwing the WIDE/NORMAL switch to the NORMAL position reduced much of the  interference.  Judicious tuning and adjustment of the separate bass and  treble controls brought forth the desired sound while further fading the  interference to a tolerable level.  Thanks to the 2-speaker sound system,  the Superadio III delivers more &quot;presence&quot;, allowing it to sound  louder even though the volume might be lower than on a radio with inferior  sound.At the minus end of the scale is the tuning scale itself.  The  aforementioned station at 640 kHz appears between the 650 and 700 markings  (675 kHz?).  If you do a lot of station hopping, keeping a station list  with each's position on the 1-to-10 &quot;log scale&quot; above the AM and  FM scales might be a good idea.  Made in China and imported by Thomson  Consumer Electronics, the Superadio III has a less-than-substantial feel to  its construction and controls.  Better-built radios DO come out of China  (can you say &quot;Grundig&quot;?) but they also cost accordingly.For  its price, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio does just what  you buy it for and will probably continue to do so for many years to come  as more and more computer room hermits discover its ability to bring the  outside world inside.  They can block your access to Web radio, but they  can't stop you from listening.
I just purchased this radio. It has an excellent reception comparable to portable radios that cost over [price], and the quality of sound is very good.Pros:- reception quality on both AM and FM bands;- has a built-in power cord, may use batteries as well.- attractive price for the quality you get.Cons:- a bit heavy, I assume primarily due to speakers (it has two, one of which is quite large) and built-in power adapter;- cavity in the back to hide the thick power cord can barely accommodate the cord; I managed to back it back after several tries.- vernier (non-digital) tuning and no ability to pre-program stations; at the same apparently due to excellent reception, dial range for stations is very large, so tuning to a station is not a problem at all.- built-in power adapter makes a constant humming noise that at lower volume levels can be heard within 2-3 ft form the radio; I assume this is not a problem when using batteries.
I am not going to repeat all previous reviewers on excellency of AM and FM receiving.  It's all true.  But quality of product is just horrible.  Look, I formerly lived in Ukraine and Soviet Union and to tell you the truth I haven't seen such horrible finish and quality in Soviet portable radios.  Quality or a lack of it is just appalling.  The tuning knob will fell off very soon.  There's no soft material under battery door-so battery rattle (I put some paper inside it cured rattle).  I understand this product made in China, but look you can buy Sony, Grundig, or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in China, as a matter of fact, almost everything nowdays made in China.  It's not a question whether or not something made in China it's a matter how good it made there.  This radio is obviously was made in garage in China.  Just tell me why, but why there's no light on tuning scale, how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb.  GE seems not to care about quality of their product at all.  I wouldn't ever buy this product for looks.  It looks awful, but reception on AM is excellent, yes it is.
I have used Maxwell for some time. I liked the price and having used these in the past, you can retape over them many, many times. I use them to tape television shows on air after my bedtime. You get good, clear pictures even after several months of taping. I would reorder these again. Also, there are few, if any, places locally to purchase any brand of VHS tapes.
Maxell is a well trusted brand that has quality products. Bought these because I still use a video recorder. Have never had any problems with them and am sorry to see them go.
They work as I expected they would without too much extra material left over and here are my last words.
These little cable ties may not be of the highest quality, but they do work, and you sure get a great deal considering the price.There is only Velcro on part of the strip, so I don't know how long the tie would last if  you were tying and untying it all the time.  What I have found, is that if I just tie something up and leave the cable types alone, these work great.I am happy with them.
Belkin has never let me down.  I had order 2 of these packages and used them all - and am ordering more.  I'm also ordering a longer length version.
these work for just about anything that you might need them for.  there are only six in the package so you don't get very many.
These are the typical hook and loop solution.  They are mostly loop, and towards the end there is a 1&#34; piece of loop sewn on.  I found this to be rather stiff and didn't readily bend to conform to the cables I was wrapping.  8&#34; is a nice length, but much longer than what I needed, so I ended up wrapping around a few times before trying to close it.  You could probably cut an end off, but I like longer ties, as it seems I'm constantly moving things around and I get very frustrated when I find something a few inches short.  If the 1&#34; hook part were not as stiff I'd give it the extra star.
Nice for small cable bundling, but not enough Velcro for large bundles.Works great in computer cases for cable dressing.
I use these to hold my kitchen appliance cords.  They work great, I use to use twist ties, which worked, but these are just so much nicer.  The entire strip is velcro and then the one end has the sticky part.  They come in multi colors.
Got these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center. In essence, they work. They are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords, holding them in one, neat bundle. They aren't really meant for identifying cables,  but for holding several in a bundle. Because they work great, I can't give them less than 4 stars. $3 and change is pretty cheap, but if you wanted, you could do the same job with much cheaper products,  which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.Summary: Works great. Cheap, but cheaper options available.
Usually it's better than average,but this one is not as good as I bought before. I have quiet few Belkin's items and I like /trust this brand. Everything would be fine if not for the cheap plastic plugs ...If ur intend to unplug/re-plug it often, than I recommend other brand-Belkin screwed up on this one;) Thought it's cheap-don't like it-throw it in the garbage.;)))
I used this cable to hook up my BluRay player to a Ethernet switch.  It was inexpensive and works great.  Would recommend it.
You can't beat the price, but if I were to buy one in the future, I would get a 10 or 15ft. I bought it for my bedroom and 7ft is pretty short to reach everywhere I want.
I can't complain too much -- it's cat5 cable, what's there to say?  It's a good price, and I like being able to get various colors because it helps with cable management.  But this cable had a different sort of plastic sheath on the connector head than I am used to and I do not like that at all.  In order to press the plastic release for the connector, you have to fit your finger between two raised edges.  Clearly this is to protect the release from the common breakage problem, and I appreciate the attempt...but this was too hard to use: couldn't release it with my thumb, had to use my index finger.  Plus you can't do it from the side, you have to have your finger at the correct angle, which can be a problem when you're under a desk with your hand snaked around behind your router or what have you.
Works well! I needed a shorter cable that would not get in the way, but allow me to move away from my desk (7 Foot). I can enjoy higher speeds with this CAT 5e cable connected vs my wireless connection. I like the snagless design it offers good protection from tab breakage.Belkin International, Inc., is a American manufacturer of computer hardware that specializes in connectivity devices, headquartered in Los Angeles, California. I feel all warm and fuzzy supporting a American company.I have purchased Belkin cables in the past and i still have a few of their cables laying around they are still working after years of use. I have some missing tabs on a couple of my generic CAT 5e cables. This is the reason for my interest in Belkin's snagless design. Without the locking tabs the cables slip out if moved.
Just what they siad it would be and it works just fine. The color helps to see which item is pluged into which port.
The current protection is good, the design is clever, and it feels much sturdier than my cheap-o power strips. But why does it cost $40??
When I hear PDA, I would like to now envision a device that may look roughly like the Palm V, but has a lot more packed in it. Palm V is an excellent device and it is a great buy for the sake of the technology's first step.But, after using it for about a year now, I am being selfish. I want more memory, I want color, I want sound and I want a floating connection to the rest of the world. So, my advice - when you buy a PDA, go for something with at least color and more memory (for the sake of technology's next step). You are going to run out of the Palm V's 2MB if you are like me and like to download all those available applications. Palm Vx has 8MB memory which should be enough for the time being, but I want more (Sorry !).I am looking at the PDA to be the materialisation of Isaac Asimov's vision of a hand held device which is carried by everyone in the world and has a unique identification number. So if you want to talk to your sister, just punch in her id number and there she is on the screen looking at you and yelling at you for buzzing her when she was in the shower !! Our privacy is going to be under fire, but it is going to be fun all the same. Asimov said that by 2010, this will be a reality. And, the world is fast getting there. Palm V is only an initial step !! My advice - go for the next step.
I can't believe this can still be reviewed.  I don't have much to say, but I have a few old contacts still on my ten year old Palm that I still havent transferred over.  I know.  The point is that my Palm sits in my drawer and always powers on perfectly.  I don't think I have even charged it in a few years.  This thing is amazing in its longevity.
These labels are great for CD's and DVD's. The labels have perforations in the paper to give excellent neatness that gives your projects a professional look. Great for thin and thick media holders.
I used these to make covers for slim lined cd jewel cases. The photo and music list lined up perfectly, without adjustment because I used Memorex jewel cases. The only issue I had was with the design software. I never could figure out how to import the list from my burn program into the templet for the covers. All the icons and instructions were clear, but the did not work. I could see the list download from the cd in the drive, and it showed up in the software library, but it would not insert into the proper frame on the cd cover.  Ended up typing it in manually. Also missing was any button to control the layers between the text and the photo. it defaults to placing text first then inserting your photo. I could not find a way to bring the text to the foreground. So I reversed the process, placing the photo first and then the text on top.The paper quality was thick enough for use in the slim case, however I wish it had a gloss to it. The photo came flat and a bit muted, even after changing out all the ink in the printer.Used this for a give away music cd for a party. It was fine for what I was doing, however I would not use it on a professional work project.
It's hard to gush about a cable, but this was the right amount of cable for a short run, and it worked fine, and the price was good. You have to order it as an add on with something else to make the shipping work.
I needed short cables to connect my home theater devices to a single Ethernet Cable by way of a ethernet &#34;switch-router&#34;. These cables fit the bill nicely and the quality is good. Local stores charge much more money for 6' cables which would be an expensivecable eyesore.
I bought this for my Onkyo receiver which required a direct connect Internet connection to receive the dozen or so channels available (XM, Pandora, Rhapsody, etc.).  It is of good construction and looking (color) and adds some fun to my otherwise mundane system layout.  Live it up and try come of the colors available.Since using daily I've not had a problem at all.  Arrived on time, well packaged, and as I ordered.  Solid good product.
It worked for me, but then I pulled it out of a box of other cables. The plastic tip broke off because it caught on something, the other end was already broken. The ends must be quite fragile.
This is a simple Cat 5 cord and inexpensive. It works great! I would recommend it. I have has no problems.
This cord works great and the length is just right for me. My only complaint is that the orange isn't quite as festive in person. I thought it would be more neon, but it's actually the dingy orange that you sometimes see on really long extension cords. Orange is my favorite color, so I paid a little extra for it, but I wish I had just gotten one of the cheaper ones.
Not much to say about wire - it does the job.  We use this to connect an upstairs computer with a downstairs printer.
It's a piece of cat5 with snagless ends.  It is blue in color and approximately three feet in length.  Good for making short patch connections.  Nothing wrong with it at all I would purchase more if needed.
And now I have one.  I tested it, tied to multiple connectors back to the source and it works perfectly, with no delays, etc.
This drive made it possible to read some old floppy disks on a new PC.  The new motherboards do not have floppy interfaces.
Not much to say here, it works for me.  I was able to access my old floppy drives.  Windows detected it without needing to search for drivers.
Does as advertised, performs well. Worked flawlessly right out of the box. Everything needed was already present in my Wintendo 7 install.
I received a defective one the first time and it would take forever to load any file or it wouldn't load it at all.  So we contacted the company through amazon and they sent us another one free of charge.  The second one works just fine and have not had any problems with it.  It is nice being able to save all my old files on a computer and not having to lose them.  It also works great for if you want to install an old operating system on another computer that doesn't accept floppy disk.
Never thought I would actually buy a floppy drive in this day and age, but when a friend came to me, asking for help with stacks of floppies that contained baby pictures taken with a Sony Mavica back in the day....I did.  Discs would not read at all in any of the 5 XP computers at work that still had floppy drives....errors and &#34;format disc?&#34; options....but no reading what so ever.Bought this and plugged it up to my Win 8 machine....and first disc read like a charm.  Other discs popped errors, but after reinserting/opening 2-3 times, all would eventually read, and I was able to retrieve 190 of a total 215 pictures from the stacks of discs.Can't say I will ever use it again, and it DID take a little wrangling and a lot of time...BUT $14 isn't much to spend to retrieve priceless memories from 15 yr old floppies no other drive would read.  Money well spent.
Works just fine
This tape works fine for my label printer. The adhesive holds pretty well. It is not very flexible once you have it stuck on - I would not advise using it for labeling cables unless you use the &#34;flag&#34; method. I have noticed that if you leave the labels on something for an extended period of time it leaves a white residue behind if/when you remove them.
Label tape works as advertised on Brother PT-90.  Just take the cover off of the back and insert cartridge.  It works wonderfully but I think that it's pretty sad that I paid more for the tape than I did for the whole labeler.  Regardless, I'm still very happy with the product.
Brother has hit a home run with their labeling tape systems.I used to spin the old Dynamo labeler to make labels but nomore.
I just purchased a few of these and it was disappointing that it was half the price of what I paid for the whole unit with a couple of these. Overall, it works as described so I only docked it 1 star for the price.
These cartriges are well build and the tape dispenses smoothly they are a littl;e prices but it does a good job.
Brother makes good labelers that works and sticks.  This is a convenient model and is useful in everyday labeling.  Not too expensive and stays on the items you apply.
** IMPORTANT NOTE: This product also fits theBrother PT-65 Labeler!!! (The description only lists the newer model label-makers.)I love my label-maker and can't imagine life without it. I label Rubbermaid totes, charging cables, A/V equipment, boxes, leftovers for the freezer, etc...and it always sticks to everything...and actually comes off cleanly as well. Just make sure whatever you're labeling is dust/dirt free and you'll be good to go.
Works well with label printer and is easy enough to use.  Overall, I don't use the system frequently enough to comment.
Lovely, useful product. Works as expected! But...I would rather pay for a slightly larger labeling machine in order to get a MUCH LARGER (and longer) tape cartridge. If Brother were to increase the label tape length, it would only cost PENNIES to do so.Is Brother's profit important enough to damage the company's public reputation? Why not offer a more equitable cost/value ratio to customers? If the company (Brother) had GIVEN me the labelling machine free of charge, I would be more agreeable to their high prices of the consumables.
What I like about this labeling tape is the pre-cut line running along the back of the backing paper. It makes it very easy to remove the label from the backing paper when you're ready to stick the label.I did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past. The tape jammed upon installation and I had to throw out a new tape. You can avoid this by being careful during tape installation.
I got my wife the Brother P-Touch labeler (PT-1200 I think) to use in organizing things; primarily the 50 or so 18-gallon plastic tote bins we use to store things in the basement and garage.We've found through a few years of experience that the 1/2&#34; is superior in longevity to the smaller width tapes for labeling these plastic bins -- little to know spontaneous peel-off that you get with a smaller width tape.I think it has something to do with the surface area to volume ratio for the adhesive and the slightly irregular and porous nature of the recycled plastic bins.In any case, we like this -- aside from the durability -- you can print LARGE FONT so you can easily identify the contents from the label from a distance (saves having to take everything out etc.)
genuine Brother tapes are the only way to go!  Clean and correct printing each time.  I like this item.  Thanks!
reasonable price ad it works all the time.This product never disappointed me for labeling folders and some asset lists i label them.
Long time user of Brother Labeler & only beef is the price of the replacement cartridges.  This was a good price, but kinda slow shipping.  Otherwise ok.
Update 03-14-2010: These tapes can get pricy.  Buying three or four tapes can add up to more than the cost of the printer.  This is how I deal with it.  Order three or more online at Amazon.  Remember, these labels help you organize your life and or business and or customers and I have come to believe the value of this outweighs the cost by a long shot. White on Black is the best as I have tried Black on Clear but if the surface is dark then you can't read the label.  I have used Whit on black but the letters are not as clear - the advantage is it looks classier then the white labels.Three years ago I purchased Brother ptouch PT-1950 (there is an update to this model which is even better) for about $72.00.  It is larger and heavier but you get much better results than the smaller brother PT-1180 which I bought around 2002 and replaced the cutter a couple of years ago.  The PT-1950 has USB and I recommend downloading the update drivers and free software from Brother because it lets you get more out of the tape reviewed here because you can print 3 lines instead of 2 and any font installed on your computer as well as many types of boarders.  You can even save the labels you make and open them later to reprint.  Once you go the USB route and see how nicely you can arrange your labels it is HARD to go back to the little handheld units.Review Starts Here:This is the classic black letters on white tape.The magic: the tape is separated from the backing in the label printer then the letters are burned with a thermal print head from the inside of the tape then it is stuck back down the backing and comes out of the machine. This is why the letters cannot be wiped off even with alcohol or other cleaners.Black letters on white works on all surfaces.  I have used black letters on clear backing which looks nice but requires the label be stuck on a light surface.  If surface is dark it is hard to see the label.  Black on white is also the cheapest most common tape.Brother's price is on the high side and I don't know of any generic aftermarket tapes.  Amazons price is about the best I have found and I trust Amazon.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TIP: Buy three tapes at a time so I don't run out and it makes the cost easier if you take your lumps in one shot!  If you buy the tapes one at a time you will be reluctant to use them when you need them.TIP2: Ways I use brother tapes:On the ends of power cords (like the type that comes with typical wireless router).  By labeling them it make it easy to relocate cords or pack up and move or if a power pack gets separated from what it belongs to it is easy to match up.Car: I label the date and miles I last changed the air filter, fuel filter, or battery, etc.  These labels will last for years in your engine compartment!Customers: sadly I used to label computers with a magic marker! Yuk!  Labels look very professional.  I also add notes such as "be sure to remove cable x before y" etc.My "P3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor" that I bought on Amazon this summer.  I put a label on it that says something like push "up" 3 times to show Watts (which is the only function I use).  I also measured every electronic thing in my house and put a brother label on it that showed the power use when off/on and idle if that applies.I labeled my brother CX4800 computer printer with the info for the generic ink cartridges - Amazon!I will label a flashlight what bulb type PR-xx and where to buy it.  I label hard drives with the size, data I bought it etc so I can see that without removing it to read the label.  If it's for a customer I record the date installed.There's a million uses for these labels and the make your life more organized and better (The bible says God is not a god of chaos - Amen!)
It fits my labeler.It does the color scheme as advertised.It's the right width.???It's sticky...What all can you say about tape?
Good price for acceptable yellow label tape used in a Brother P-Touch (PT-90). Will probably buy some more, maybe some red and blue versions next time.
It is what it is. It works but when removing the tape months later, it seems to leave residues. I had no problems other wise.
I bought the p-touch and wanted some label refills that were black on clear.  this was perfect for me.  Not much to say, but it is what is advertised.
Needed a CB for a Jeep Jamboree and will likely only need it once or twice a year. Perfect for this radio. Price is right, easy install, good for a Jeep where there's 0 room for full size perm CB. Did a perm antenna install, ran the coax just to the right of the console, keep the cb in the center console and pull it out when I need it. Can't speak for the portable performance but as an in-car cb, it's perfect for occasional use.
I use this in the car when driving long distances through major metropolitan areas - listen to the truckers discuss road conditions.  I can hear pretty good with this.  Talk power may be limited - even though I've got a good roof K40 antenna with a good SWS.  Acess to squelch and volume is is a little trickly while driving.  I wish this unit had adaptive squelch so that I don't need to constantly fiddle with it.
Nice compact little radio that fits on most motorcycles. Ride in a club where many members have these. One of the only suitable CB for a bike that doesn't come with an OEM CB. Range will depend on antenna. Rubber unit that attaches to the radio and is part of the package is good for short distances. Would guess 1/4 mile or so depending on the terrain and conditions. Weather band is a nice feature as is the cigarette lighter external antenna connector. Also comes with two battery packs and a charger for the pack that uses 8 AA rechargeable batteries. I am currently trying eneloop batteries in the unit. The other battery pack holds 6 regular AA batteries. Both battery packs as well as the cigarette adaptor slide on and off easily so you have plenty of options. I don't see why 6 rechargeable batteries couldn't be used i the 6 battery holder. You would just have to charge them in the other pack or a regular charger.
Convenient size, great adapter arrangement for use as a mobile CB. Both reception and transmission are very clear. Reception from a distant source can be hard to hear on the built-in speaker. I haven't tried a headset yet, but I think that would help. Range with an external antenna is good -- several miles with no problem.Display is good, but I wish the display had a backlight instead of lights off to the sides and I wish there was a way to keep the lights on when plugged into the car adapter. Lit keys for night use would be nice, too.Solid construction. The one I received was flawless.The removable antenna is really convenient. I added a 27" collapsible to replace the rubber ducky that it comes with to extend the range when using it as a handheld.
Product is solid. The plug-in/portable battery clip on is great along with the ability to plug into an antenna like a lil Wil.Reception is not great, a couple miles, but typical unless you plug into an antenna, again typical. full scan and 9/19 scan is a solid feature.Nothing amazing about it, nothing bad about it. Great back up when cell service is not available.
The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the lack of SSB on this unit. Otherwise is is exactly what I have been looking  for. Newer trucks don;t have all the extra room to mount toys like the older trucks did so this fits right on in.
Purchased this radio as a hold over until I mounted my other radio in the truck.  Worked fine.  Speaker is kinda small so hard to hear at times with the windows down.
I have this attached to a 2' Firestik on my Jeep and it seems to work just fine for our trail runs where we're within a mile of one another. I really don't use CBs for anything more -- like long-distance chatter with truckers and whatnot. It's got some cool features, but honestly, I haven't used them. Either way, this thing is good for what I use it for. Plus, when camping, we can go mobile with it. 10-4 good buddy.
Great radio. I bought with to be portable. Has the ability to plug in the cig lighter or use batteries. Also can plug in an antenna if you want. Range is short with the stubby, but that is to be expected. Love that is has the scan feature and weather. For the price it's hard to beat.
The Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB Radio is a solid handheld CB with just a few flaws that prevent it from being absolutely great. If you are looking for a truly portable CB radio this is the one to get bar none. It is important to understand the capabilities of this radio. Many people rate radios poorly because their expectations far exceed the capability of the radio.  Most CB radios are 4 watts which is generally good for a distance of 2-6 miles. As with any radio there are a lot of variability's that will impact the effectiveness of the radio. CB radios are not for long distance communications. If you need long distance comms then you should consider a ham radio which requires a license from the FCC.Pros:+ Multiple methods to power the radio: Car charger, alkaline batteries, and rechargeable batteries+ 4 Watts+ Weather channels work great and can be very valuable+ Quick button to transfer between channels 9 and 19+ Very easy to use+ Radio itself is well built+ Can use high setting for 4 watts or low setting for 1 watt which will save batteriesCons:-The adapter for the car charger and alkaline batteries are very stiff when removing from the radio-Both alkaline and rechargeable battery cases seem delicate especially when being separated to put the batteries in the case. Time will tell how durable these will be over the long run.Recommendations:+ Upgrade your antenna to theCobra HA-TA Hand-Held CB Antennawhich, in my case, significantly improved reception. It is also good to have a backup antenna.+ Get theWILSON 305-38 300-Watt Little Wil Magnet Mount Antennafor your vehicle. You will not get reception if you use the rubber duck antenna in your vehicle.+ Get the bookEmergency Radio Communicationsby Caleb Watts for a good understanding of radio capabilities, rules & regulations, and a good example of an emergency radio plan.Overall Assessment:The Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB Radio is a very flexible CB radio that can be used in multiple situations such as in your vehicle or out hiking. The radio itself is very well made and while the battery cases seem a little problematic they are not a deal breaker but they do cause me to give this radio 4 stars instead of 5.If you are looking for a handheld CB radio the Midland 75-822 is a great choice.
Fits like a glove and very streamline. Works perfectly and keeps your computer safer from the stealing  temptation of others.
Locks the laptop to a table or a bar or whatever you wrap the cable around. Secure and reliable lockset.
This product does its job once you learn how to properly operate it. I first tried it on my wife's new hp laptop and it worked well. Then I decided to try it on my macbook and it actually pulled the plastic frame away from the screws on the left side leaving a small hole in the frame. I quickly removed it from my macbook. Since it didn't stay on my macbook long it doesn't seem to have caused any permanent damage but buyer beware if you are using this on a macbook. It will damage the frame.
Purchased four of these locks for various computers around the house, both portable and desktop types. Took a little while to coordinate the latch/holding pins position to get the lock to insert into the docking slot in the first computer, mostly because of the ease with which the inserted key rotates and how easy it is to inadvertently spin the latching mechanism off-alignment so it will no longer insert properly. But once you've figured out that tidbit the lock becomes simple to operate correctly and the subsequent installations became a breeze to complete.The attached encased steel cable is thick and stout, more than what you might normally see in other installations such as certain retail store tie-down security setups, for instance. This should provide relatively good protection for any computer fastened down with one of these locks. It's not to say that the computer is now impervious to theft, but the would-be thief will now have to have a fairly heavy-duty set of cutters in order to get through this cable. The lock mechanism itself seem pretty solid as well; the sort of force needed to break through one of these would likely inflict more damage to the adjacent computer than to the lock itself.Solid product at a more than reasonable price.
Overall I'm very pleased with The Plug headphones and I've been using them daily for over a month now.I purchased these headphones to replace the stock IPod headphones.  I use my IPod almost exclusively for listening to podcasts while I do my morning walk and while I'm driving to and from work.  For that reason I didn't need high fidelity.What I was looking for was 1)a headphone that would block external noise and 2)stay in my ear 3)comfortably.  4)Good sound was important to me, but I'm not that picky since I don't listen to a lot of music.  Here's how "The Plug" fulfilled my criteria:1. Noise cancelling: 5 stars. If you take the time to compress the foam by rolling the foam between your fingers and get it inserted correctly you get almost no external noise.  It acts almost like a regular ear plug.2. Stay in my ear: 5 stars.  Again if you compress the foam and let it expand in the ear canal.  If you don't it still stays in well, but not nearly as well as it does when it is compressed and allowed to expand.3. Comfort: 4 and a half stars.  The half-star deduction is because the hard plastic part of The Plug presses against a spot on my ear and causes just a little bit of a pressure point.  Everybody's ear is shaped different so your mileage may vary.4. I did try these with music and they do sound great.  I've never had an expensive headphone so I can't give a comparison there.I really liked everything about the stock IPod headphones for my use except the ear bud itself.  The foam covers kept coming off and they didn't stay in my ear very well during my walk.  The Plug headphone does remedy those problems.I'm knocking off another half-star because The Plug headphones have a thin cord that gets tangled much easier than the Apple headphones.  This is probably common to any other "aftermarket" headphones though.
Apparently I have non-standard ears. Normal buds will fall out easily. So I focused my research on in-the-ear buds that would hopefully stay in my ears without constant adjusting. Onto the pros/cons:PROS* Block outside sounds out well. You can stick them in your ears a little for a little sound blocking, or really roll up the foam and deeply embed them into your ears for near silence.* The sound blocking really lends to the quality of the sound output since you hear more of the music and less of whatever else is going on around you.* Produces a lot more sound output at the same volume. I attribute this to cancelling outside noise and channeling all the output right into your ears. Does this benefit battery life since you're running reduced volume? I'd think so, but probably not a noticable amount.* Nice long cord.* Seemingly good quality.* Includes extra foamies.CONS:* You have to sick them INTO your ear. Some people probably would hate this.* They can block virtually all outside noise. Someone could be axe murdering my family while I listen to music with these things and I'd never hear it. Seriously.* If the cord gets tugged on or pulled it can transmit "noise" to your ears due to the fact the plugs are IN your ear. This is minor but annoying and it happens to me somewhat frequently since I primarly use this with my Shuffle in the gym.* I find the bass to be muddy. However, this is the case with every earbud I've used. Consider the price of these it's a very minor complaint.
Excellent price for a non audiophile. For me, sound is great and isolation is too. Nice snug fit. They tend to wiggle a but lose when I run so I use a headband to help hold them in. This works because they are so small and the headband doesn't make it feel like a vise.
The only fault I could find with these is that the cord is too short.  Other than that, they're great.
The first time I bought The Plug, I thought the sound was tiny and weak, and I immediately returned it.  Then I saw someone mentioned the purple v.s. blue (earlier version), and I purchased it again, making sure it was purple.  Sure enough, the purple ones are great!  Like other Koss headphones, you not only hear the bass, but you also feel it.  It's amazing that such big bass can come out of these tiny earplugs.  I replaced the included foam plugs with regular plugs from a drugstore and they make an even better seal.I also have the Etymotic ER6i, which costs at least 7 times more than this one.  When it comes to sound, of course the ER6i have a much higher fidelity (but much less bass), but considering the price difference, I think these Koss earplugs have a greater value.  Overall, the sound quality is just average, but if you mostly listen to pop while on the road, you probably won't mind or care that some notes are a little imbalanced and muddy.  As far as sound isolation go, after replacing the included foam plugs with the ones from the drugstore, they are as good as the etymotics.Be sure to get the purple ones!
I can confirm that this model here does NOT have the volume control in-line, thankfully.Edit:After owning these for several months, I put a pair through the wash.  They still worked but the foam died.  I bought another pair, and have concluded these are overall the best buds for the price.Edit #2:After ordering a second pair and using them for a bit, they too have given way and the expansive response of the foam no longer prevails amidst the sweat, etc.  Therefore I am off to buy my 3rd set.  For such a low price, I really could care less.
I'm giving a 4 star review for these earphones with a couple big caveats.  I've owned a lot of portable headphones throughout the years and most recently have used a set of Koss SportaPros that have served me well; they sound good (not as good as the PortaPros, but still good) and were pretty cheap.  But they leak sound terribly, meaning they're not a great choice for listening on a crowded subway or while at work, and also are not that convenient to carry around.  When I recently bought an iPod and finally got to try out some in-ear headphones, I loved the convenience of being able to stuff both my player and the phones into one pocket when not in use, but I never could get the stock iPod headphones to fit my ear.  They didn't sound particularly good either.  So I knew I wanted to try something else.I first bought a pair of Sennheiser MX-500's, and while I actually liked their sound a lot (better than the stock iPod phones), they didn't fit my ears any better.  They'd fall out even if I so much as turned my head to one side.  One of my co-workers then recommended The Plug, and at such a low price I figured I'd give them a shot.I've now spent a few days with mine and my feelings on the whole are mixed, but I do feel these earphones are a pretty good value.  Most importantly to me is that so far, they're the only in-ear headphones I've found that don't seem to require constant fiddling to ensure they stay in place.  I do have to use the largest of the several types of included cushions - I apparently have very large ear canals - but they seem fairly secure (though not tight) once they're in there.  Some people may find this type of earphone uncomfortable - you really have to place them well up into your ear canals (make sure you clean your ears well every day!) - but I find them much more comfortable than the standard designs included with most portable players because you don't have this piece of hard plastic wedged into your ear.Sound-wise, I'd say they're fine, though certainly not remarkable.  My MX-500's sound better, and my SportaPros sound a *lot* better.  I'd put these about on par with the included iPod headphones.  They're pretty bass and mid-range heavy, though like other in-ear headphones the "bass" isn't really very bassy - it cuts off well above what most larger headphones can reproduce.  It ends up sounding a bit forced and artificially juiced, and there's a lot of this fake "bass".  On the high end, there's a lack of clarity - things like cymbal crashes sound "muddy" and ragged.  This is typical of low-end headphones of any type.Still, I'd rate the sound "good enough" considering the application most people will use these for (portable listening), and considering the increased comfort and dramatically better physical stability vs. more conventionally-designed in-ear headphones.
I was intrigued by the raves for these very inexpensive headphones, and the Koss brand name convinced me to give them a try.I compared them to the Sennheiser HD56 headphones that I normally use for portables, and my AKG 240DF headphones that have been used by many studio engineers in recording albums.The Koss The Plug headphones have excellent dynamic range and sensitivity.  This means that you will get more volume out of weaker amps, such as those found in multipurpose portables, like PDAs and portable synths, like the Yamaha QY series.  They also have excellent bass, which together with the dynamic range, makes them excellent for any sort of modern dance music.Unlike another reviewer, I did not find any problem with the midrange or high end.  I suspect that this perception some people have had, is due to the fact that increasing the bass automatically makes the midrange and highs seem muted - especially in headphones.As others have mentioned, the fit is critical to the sound quality.  Read the instructions found on the inside of the card in the packaging.  Even the orientation of the earphones in your ear can affect the sound.  Experiment a little until you find the best sound.WARNING:  These headphones can go very loud with portables that have decent amps (MP3 and CD players).  Famous musicians like Pete Townsend and Jeff Baxter have hearing problems from hours of loud music - so be careful!
Two of my kids have a problem with keeping ear buds in their ears, always being too big for them. They love KOSS 'THE PLUG' IN-EAR HEADPHONES because you can manipulate them into your ear cannel, fitting snug. The only drawback is your earwax tends to cling to them, so they will need to be cleaned.
These have very good bass, although they don't sound as good as my Sennheiser CX300. The price is cheap so I mainly use it when I'm on the streets so, if someone steals it I wouldn't get very angry.
NOTE: the description I saw on the Amazon page does not reflect the product I have.  Above it discusses a headband and an adapter which are not part of this product.  Also, the rated frequency response is 10-20k, not 16-23k.  I think this is (or was) an Amazon editorial error.My interest for this product is as a solution to listening to music, lectures, and movies while travelling, and I travel a lot.  I have a set of Panosonic noise-cancelling headphones which were good (about five times more expensive than these earbuds) though bulky, but the plastic broke so they won't stay on my head now.These earbuds are an excellent alternative to noise-cancelling headphones for the frequent traveller.  I find them more comfortable for extended listening than most conventional headphones.  The ability to seal out noise from the external environment is very good, and makes it possible to understand what actors are saying when watching a movie on an airplane.The overall performance - sound quality and noise blocking - is not as good as the Bose noise cancelling headphones, but the Bose are 20 times as expensive, much less convenient to carry, and subject to damage from the rough world of the road warrior.  If The Plug had an optional noise-cancelling unit (say, combined with the eq), it would be a killer combination - are you listening, Koss?).The sound is good.  Bass-heavy, to be sure; I would like them better if they had a flatter response, but the product is marketed at the portable music crowd, and many of them are looking for dramatic bass rather than golden-ears sound.Besides, mobile sound is always a compromise, it's just a question of whether the compromise they chose works for you.Here are some problems I've heard and the solutions:1. "They fall out of my ear."  I think an older version of this product did not come with alternative cushions; the ones I bought recently (as pictured here) came with 3 alternative cushion pairs, one of which fit well in my somewhat large ears.  To make them fit well, roll the cushions in your fingers and squeeze them down, then hold them in place in your ears while they adjust the fit. Also, it is possible to fashion your own cushions (easy modification to commercially available ear plugs from pharmacy); go to google and search for "koss plug mods".2. What about when I have to replace the cushions, they'll get waxy/dirty with use?  See last sentence of #1.3. "They sound tinny".  I have a sense that the sound was tinnier on an earlier version of these earbuds, judging from comments I've read in feedback and on the koss plug mods page.  The purple plugs (as opposed to the older(?) blue ones) do not sound tinny to me; they seem a bit heavy on the bass instead.  Koss also makes a 3-band eq (20 dollars) for their headphones that can be used to adjust the sound some.  I have an eq on order, hoping it may temper the boomy bass a bit.  Of course, your player may have a way of changing the color of the sound, but my laptop does not.4. "They're easy to lose."  The price of their tiny size and negligible weight, is that you need to be careful not to lose them.  I've already lost a pair.  Koss also makes a carrying case which may help, or you could just put them in a 35mm film canister.  But at $... a pair (compared to $... for noise-cancelling headphones) I'll just keep a spare pair around in my travelling case.Overall I'm pleased with the price/performance tradeoff for these earbuds, and they are an essential part of my travelling kit.  They sound better than any other earbuds I've used, and they remove a good bit of the ambient sound, offering more pleasure in listening.  I give four stars out of five because I'd prefer a less bassy sound, though some people will really like the way they sound.
I use Sony 51's in the gym and they are a nice earbud phone but I've had them for awhile and wanted to try something else. I read some reviews and ordered these. First off they need to go it like hearing protection foam plugs. You squeeze and rotate the foam plug and insert it in your ear as you pull the top of your ear back with the other hand. They must be held in place for several seconds so the foam can expand and conform to your ear. If you insert them properly they do sound very good but with exaggerated bass. If you like exaggerated heavy bass these are for you. As for the guy who said buy a dozen or half dozen and thank him later, Idon't think that that's necessary. They are very nice sounding for the price and work good in the gym for me. If your mp3 player has an eq you can select a curve that makes them sound more realistic. Hope that helps!
The ear cushions that come with this product are terrible.  I used an awl to make a hole in the earplug, and then cutoff a bit off the top of the earplug. I cut it off a bit too much,just cut it off a little.The sound from this product is great for an earbud style headphone.To increase isolation, I use a hearing protector ear muff on top of The Plug and I really can't hear anything after doing it.The main point, buy foam earlugs and these things will be a lot more comfortable and will let you enjoy your music more by eliminating background noise.
For me, these feel better and achieve a better seal than the norm.  A good seal is essential for achieving strong bass.  They are rated a little more efficient (the dB rating) than many of the others, and this was noticeable.
I've used many low cost earbuds and there are a lot of decent ones out there. The really cheap ones are usually just that, cheap! I find the $10.00 to $40.00 range offer among the best qualities someone may be looking for in decent, good sounding earbuds. Most are good having varied degrees of what predominant type of sound you may be listening for.These Koss earbuds offer a very good bass range with overall good sound and volume. The mids and highs are not as crisp but usually can be adjusted well enough for good tone...these buds are mostly for strong bass.The fit of these earbuds is one of the most comfortable with nice cushy, foam inserts that stay in your ear well and really eliminate most outside noise. In turn, they also provide a very discreet listening experience. I find the best way to insert these buds is to give them a little squeeze and stick them in my ear and let the foam expand in my ear.Overall, the build quality of these earbuds appears to be quite good with minimal wire to bud noise transfer.
Definitely not high-quality, but good enough for the average person. At such a low price I have an extra pair on hand in case my kids break one of theirs, so we have a total of 4 sets in the house. If you want audiophile quality, you'll need to pay a lot more, but at less than $20, these deliver decent sound and I don't get sick every time I step on one or break a wire. For sound I'd rate them 4 stars, for durability I'd give them 2 stars, and price is a 5.
This is a lifesaver for using headphones with my Dell D610 laptop which boasts an extremely noisy headphone jack with lots of interference at low volumes. Using this volume control, I can turn up the volume on the Dell to overpower the static while keeping the volume of the music in my ears low.The control is even less sexy than the picture on the website, if that's possible. It also doesn't work great for an extremely loud source (like my Dell port replicator's line out port), because the sound from the volume control doesn't seem to be output equally in both ears at low levels.
I would have liked to see a larger dial that offers more levels, but if you need a simple volume control than this is the one.
This is a perfect companion piece for my f11 line-out dock and bluetooth transmitter/receiver for my ipod.  Allows me to control the volume at the mobile end of the set-up.  clip on back allows me to keep it handy.My only complaint is the small size of the volume control wheel.  It could stand to be larger and have some sort of tactile method of adjusting the volume before pressing play.
I typically have my ipod in a leather case, tucked in my pocket, and I don't want to have to dig it out when I want to adjust the volume.  This device is a practical & inexpensive solution to that function.
I use headphones at night to watch TV and this helps because I can clip it to my PJ's & adjust the sound level, on our 'ME' TV channel the commercials are at a higher sound level then the show even though there is now a federal law against this practice .... The wheel that makes the adjustment is VERY touchy, takes some practice to get used to it, so it lost a star because of that ...
It does what you would think it would; nothing more and/ or less.As far as I can hear (I used a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50's plugged into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 [studio quality set-up]) there is no loss in sound quality.I initially just needed an extension to prevent exerting too much tension on a heavy headphone cable. However, I figured being able to adjust the volume with an analog control would be a nice bonus. And it is!It does it's job and at that it does it simply and wonderfully.(Edit: After a while of use I noticed that it subdues the highs, lows, and even at the highest volume it is slightly quieter than without it. Still a good buy though!)
Good quality, no impact on audio quality.The wheel is small and recessed.  Maybe it was designed like this to prevent inadvertent movement if the device is in a pocket, etc.  But it kinda defeats the purpose of having an inline control if you're gonna stick it in your pocket.  Anyway, the a larger wheel or more open access would be an improvement.
The sound is perfectly fine.  I couldn't tell any difference in quality when I had it connected directly or through this volume adjuster.  The cord eventually wore out after a lot of abuse.  I wish it was stronger.
I got this because when we are recording music I dont like it loud in my eadphones and some time Freddy P wants it super loud in his ear.  This way we can both have it as loud or as low as we want.  Great deal.
I use it at work where I use in-ear earphones and this is very handy to lower the volume quickly when someone is talking to me. Very useful.
The volume control works as described and is well made.  The only complaint I have is with the long cord.  If you need to control the volume of your device at a distance this is the control you should buy.  Otherwise you will find yourself winding up the excess wire.
Does what it is supposed to do. Only criticism is the volume control knob is a little small.
My niece who lives with me loves to play video games, but we have wood floor throughout the house. This causes the noise from the video games to echo throughout the house. So I bought a RCA to 3.5 mm cable and hooked up headphones not realizing that I needed something to control the volume with. This is where this KOSS VC20 volume control comes into play it worked wonders for my TV (which is older and did have the RCA AUDIO OUT).One thing to note is most of the modern TV do NOT have an RCA audio out instead they have Digital Optical Audio Toslink output. This means you would have to get an adapter that takes the signal from Analog to Digital and back.
You can't beat the sound quality for this price. It's good all-around for every type of music. Clean high and solid low. If you listen mainly to hip hop where booming bass is important, you might want to check out other makes. I listen to all types of music, so this is a good all-around headset for this purpose.It does look a little dorky, but sound quality is more important to me than looks. The headband does pinch your hair occasionally, if you're not careful adjusting it. Mine did not come with a case. It came with a soft pouch instead, so not a whole lot of protection there for traveling purposes. Even in the folding position, it's not easy to get it in the pouch. The sound does leak (enough to bother my wife as she's lying next to me in bed). The ear foams feel a little weak and may wear out quickly after frequent use. Don't know if you can buy the foam separately. I gave it 4 stars mainly for sound quality and price ($30-$40). I've had mine for about 2.5 years now and they still sound just as good as the various $100 plus headsets I recently listened to at the local Best Buy store.
These headphones are really great, unfortunately mine broke early on. The return policy calls for you to ship the items back to Koss + $9.00 shipping and handling. I stood up and literally tore the cables out. In my own defense, they're not secured in tightly. I still give the headphones four stars because I believe they're stylish and the sound is really great. They really fit a comfortable niche for those that do not want sound-isolation; and, they have a really strong ability to throw sounds and convince you that you have more than two sound channels.
The Koss Porta-Pro looks delicate, but its folding design belies a hardiness that competitors should try to emulate. All headphones require a "burn-in" period before they sound their best, and that's certainly true of the Koss Porta-Pro.After burn-in, they show themselves to be equal to their reputation. Retailing between $30 and $40 or so, they offer good fidelity at low to medium volume, but grate a bit when pushed too hard. The Porta-Pro works nicely with a variety of musical styles, pop and rock to jazz, but occasionally has trouble with the distortion levels of punk; this may not be a problem with most listeners.While the sound is clear and offers fine fidelity, songs often lack "color" -- a common complaint with less expensive headphones. Yet, compared to its competition, the Porta-Pro offers a much cleaner sound; no irritating bass thump on these phones.These are the iPod phones of choice.
I bought these after Shure jacked up the price of their mini headphone from $30 to $90 (huh?).  Anyway, these sound just fine and are comfortable.My only complaint is how each side of the head band is connected together, that if I adjust it while on my head, my hair can get caught under the band.  Yoowwwzaaaa!  I don't have long hair, so I would imagine it would be even worse for those people.
I've heard nothing but good things about these and I finally decided to try them. The verdict? Not bad at all (for the price) but I'm not sure they deserve such high praise.Pros....1. Obviously, they're very affordable and they sound pretty good2. Compact and very portableCons...1. Sound can be a bit muffled at times. Sometimes there's a bit too much bass. This is not terribly distracting once you get used to it but it is noticeable if you're listening for it at all.2. The touted feature that's supposed to make them more comfortable doesn't seem to do much at all for me.3. The cushions are fairly comfortable for what they are but they are a tad small on my ears and this becomes a bit scratchy and uncomfortable after a couple of hours.I'd buy them again if I had a tight budget and needed a set of compact, portable headphones. But I'd think about stepping up to something a bit better sounding if I could spend more.
This morning they sold for $38.72 or something like that. Then they jumped the price to only a 10% discount. Now, it's a 15% discount.This is a bad business practice and Amazon is doing this more and more. It lessens the ability to purchase a product. I was ready to doit, but not when they suddenly jumped the price. I like the phones but not price jumps when I show interest in something.
I think these are great for the price, but they lack low end bass as they are compact, and the padding simply isn't there, to keep space to a minimum once again, but overall, I'm very much happy with them. Keep an eye out for a video review on the SonicOrbStudios YouTube channel for more :)
Things I like:- Metal band seems durable and is easy to adjust- Sound quality- Affordable price (I'm not an audiophile, don't want to spend $100+ on headphones but I still want headphones of significantly higher quality than earbuds)- LightweightThings I don't like:- Nothing so farI wanted some higher quality headphones for use with my desktop computer; I found many quality headphones at the $100+ price point but wasn't looking for high-end headphones. I just wanted a medium to medium-high quality pair at a decent price that would provide better quality sound than your standard headphones. After reading many reviews and doing a lot of research, I found the portapros and am happy with them. The sound is more rich, bass comes through surprisingly well without sacrificing the high end. They are comfortable to wear for an 1 to 1.5 hours at a time and are very lightweight so you don't always "notice" them on your head. I don't carry them around anywhere, but the fold-up mechanism does make these pretty portable if that's what you will use them for. I'm very pleased with these and would purchase them again; they come with a lifetime warranty though, so I may be set for life.I'm sure there higher quality headphones out there that produce much better sound than these; the portapros produce great sound for the average to slightly discerning listner and are priced affordably. To give you a better idea about the portapro's sound quality,,,0=worst, fuzzy, crackly sound that makes it seem like your listing to a poorly tuned AM station10=best, sitting in an acoustically designed room listening to cutting edge, $10,000+ plus speakersPair of $25 JVC earbuds I got at Walmart and junked within 3 minutes: 1Stock iPod earpieces: 3My Vizio soundbar (with subwoofer): 7Koss PortaPros: 5Surround sound system: 8
The sound of these cans is good but there are others that are its equal that have some better ergonomics.  The ergonomics are good once you get them on, but the headband and the "Tension Adjustment" for the earpads are fiddly.  I find that the Sennheiser PX-100 or the AKG K420 offer equal performance with better usability and similar comfort.
We bought many of these for Christmas for the kids (tablets, iPods, laptops, PCs) and the noise level in the house thanked us.The sound quality is astounding, considering the price.  These FAR outperform anything that says BEATS on it, at a tiny fraction of the price (our very brand conscious son actually bought and immediately returned a $300 pair after using these).The sound is, again, spectacular.The comfort, however, is less than stellar (the steel band hurts the top of their heads after a while), and they do cause some pretty ugly hair tangles for the girls.  For intermittent use, they're fine - but in long sessions, they have been associated with frequent whining.The only real downside we've found is that the cords are outrageously frail.  One yank (trip or snag related), and they're toast.  The conductors are SO tiny that repair almost requires microsurgical procedures.  It can be done, but you'll need a jeweler's eyepiece, tiny fingers and a lot of patience.Forewarned is forearmed.
These headphones provide the best bang for your headphone dollar. For a sub $40 price, you can get a headphone that is better than twice its price. But it is not better than most premium headphones that cost over $200.The bass, which was great by 80s standards, can't handle the lower frequencies as well as high end Shure earphones. Otherwise, there is very little distortion of the sound.The level of detail in the sound is impressive. I did hear many sounds (mainly percussion instruments and background guitar music) which I couldn't hear with my inferior iPod headphones. But again, the level of detail is not as good as Shure earphones.If you are on a budget and want to replace your uncomfortable and inferior iPod headphones with something superior, then this headphone is great. Unless you want to look retro 80s, however, you may want to wear them inside.
These are simply awesome. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I do have a few pairs of expensive and sophisticated earphones with super-sonic so and so and ultra-isonalting this and that. They're great and have their uses, but if all you need is a pair of earphones that you can carry in your jacket pocket or laptop bag, you won't find a serious competitor to the PortaPros.They're compact, sturdy, and of reasonable quality. Will you get the same quality as a pro set of headphones? Of course not, but you likely don't need high fidelity if you're on the metro, studying, watching Youtube, or perusing your podcasts.If you need a pair of nifty, retro, collapsible, and decent quality headphones, pick these up.Note that the phones themselves are about the size of an average ear. They will not cover your entire ear.
Excellent sound reproduction.  Comfortable.  Cord just the right length so that I can put my minidisc player in my pocket.  Just one thing that keeps me from giving them 5 starts.  Every time I take them off the metal bands slide so that I have to readjust them every time I put them on again.  A set of headphones like these that stayed the way I set them would get 5 stars.Added in edit:  Amazon lets you edit your reviews, but not your star-rankings.  I'm not changing a word of the text, but having to adjust the headband is proving to be an annoyance.  Lower my star ranking to 3.  From what I gather, there are lots of good headphones out there.  I wouldn't buy another pair of these.
I bought these on the recommendation of CNET and I wasn't disappointed.  They sound great, and they fold well for easy carrying.  For a non-audiophile (please note that before any other comments)  I didn't hear much difference between several other more expensive sets.  They have a rich sound and I have yet to listen to anything they don't play well.  However there is one HUGE thing that isn't stressed enough here although I did see it mentioned before I purchased mine.  I bought mine to study with and no one will study with me anymore due to the leakage.  These leak a lot.  My wife can hear me listening to lectures and my study partners can hear my music three seats down.  They are great but should not be purchased to listen to in a library.  The hair pulling happens occasionally, but you get past that by putting them on carefully and it isn't a huge hassle.  A little hard for me to get in the carry case also.  I am purchasing another set for study, but let me be clear, I AM KEEPING THESE for all other uses.  I just want to make sure you don't buy these for quiet surroundings.
**Update 9/8/10** These headphones are great but they do have one potentially serious design flaw.  The stereo connector is very flimsy.  Despite being very careful, mine broke in under a year.  The stereo connector literally just pulled apart as I was removing it from the ipod one day.  The wires pulled right out of the connector.  After checking the web, I see I am not the only one to experience this.  Someone was even kind enough to post a picture of it above, in the product photos.  I still think they're great headphones and I ordered a new  pair (although I plan to have these replaced under warranty and keep as a spare).  I knocked off one star simply because now I have to shell out $6 plus shipping to replace this set (although I opted to pay $30 for a new pair to save time).  However, if the second pair breaks as quickly as the first, prepare to watch the review stars plummet.  What good is something if it won't last at least a year?*** End of update ****I've tried pretty much all types of headphones. I was looking for a good solid pair, under $50, preferably over-the-ear but not too big (for gym, athletic use and better portability).  I stumbled across these on the web and saw that people loved them, so I came to Amazon to read some reviews.  Seeing that they were highly rated here as well, I ordered a pair.  These headphones have a solid reputation for a reason, they sound great.  The minute I plugged them in, I knew why they were so highly rated.  Clear highs, deep lows.  I mean, it's not bone rattling bass, but it's decent enough if you don't want to lug around a pair of $50+ self-powered heavy headphones.  Easily the best sounding headphones I've bought the past year.  And that's in a group of Skull Candy, Sony, Apple, self powered, noise canceling... I've tried it all the past year.  The only (extremely minor) gripe I have is that I agree with others that it does feel flimsy at times.  I like that the moving pieces are metal instead of plastic (can't tell you how many plastic headphones I've inadvertently broken from simply putting on and removing), but it still has a somewhat delicate feel to it.  They do come with a lifetime warranty, which is pretty sweet, (although a further check of the terms reveal you pay to ship them back and have to include a $6 check.  Something potential purchasers should be aware of).  I'm happy with my set and agree with everyone else that these headphones come in a portable package but possess full-sized sound.
I find them comfortable enough. They are also small and light. They do sound fine to me, but I am not a great judge of that anymore. However, there is one annoying thing, the short cord. I am sure that's all in the eyes of the beholder, but that's how I feel.
These headphones work great. I use them with my Ipod touch and my laptop. They are light, extremely comfortable and have excellant sound. Tough to beat for the cost, and the Koss warrenty is the best. Highly recommend.
These things have been around forever because they sound great. Sure, they look funny but if you're just chillin' at home, do it!
I bought these along with a similarly priced set of Sennheiser headphones about 9 months ago.  Not until I recently purchased a Zen Micro did I decide to test all my headphones on this MP3 player.  Needless to say, other than the Bose QC2 set, which is essentially in a league of its own, the Koss beat out every other set I own.  This includes both Denon and Sony closed systems.I guess the style and seemingly awkward design made me initially think these headphones were a bad purchase.  So, they were relegated to the bookshelf until the Zen player arrived.  I have to say that the goofy looking design is just that.  However, the sound quality (clarity, separation, tonal balance, etc.) is exceptional for an open ear system.  Nearly every bit as good as the Bose except that the ambient noise distracts from the experience at times.
I really like these headphones, but as others point out, they are not very durable. My first pair broke after a year -- and I am very careful with my equipment. I only use them at my computer, they don't travel or get abused. They fell off my desk and the right channel is now shot. Anyway, the sound was great -- very warm with fantastic bass and accurate highs. They sound nearly as good as my entry-level Grados, but are much more comfortable to wear for extended periods. But buy two pairs now, or plan on replacing them later.-edit-Several years later, I am back to say that the two additional pairs I bought are both going strong and they are still the best quality/comfort/price combination in the world. I have more accurate in-ear phones that cost $200+, but for comfort and long listening sessions, these can't be beat. I hope they are never discontinued. The design looks dated and a bit dorky on your head, but once you hear them, you won't care.
The portapro has very good sound and base,but the temple pads and metal hooks hurt my big ears,so I sent them back to amizon-Expo. The seenheiser px-100s also sound very good,but not quite as good as the portapros.I do like the px-100s because they are very comfortable.easy to use and are very well made and fold up better than the potapros,but Im still looking for a better headphone.
The most amazing property of these headphones is that it's almost like you're wearing nothing.They're light and comfortable and the pressure of the ear pads is adjustable on both sides.These are probably the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn and I've owned many sets of headphones from Sony, Panasonic, Seinheiser, Ultrasone...The extra set of head pads above the ears reduces the pinching on the ears you get with most headphones.That said, the sound quality (here I'm using the word 'quality' literally, as in flavor, not how good the sound is) is punchy and bass-y, at the sacrifice of high end and midrange.I tested these headphones with a Sony Hi-MD lossless minidisc player with a FLAC audio source.These headphones are what I would call "teenager headphones."  They have sound properties that kids would look for.If you listen to a lot of music that has valuable high frequency sound properties you may wish to look elsewhere.  The high and midrange on these headphones is a little muddy.
I bought the Koss PortaPro Headphones to replace the earbuds for my MP3 player.  They're light, comfortable and have decent audio capabilities.  You can fold them up and put them in my pocket.  I'm generally satisfied with them and would make the purchase again.  My only gripe is that the earpieces tend to detach from the frame.  There's only a small notch and groove holding them together.  Reassembling them when the earpieces come off isn't a huge hassle, but it is annoying.
Impressive set for the money, but obviously not professional quality. It does indeed catch hair and can hurt to pull off at times. If you want a good cheap headset, this is an impressive option for the price range it's in.
I bought the Koss Porta and the Panasonic-RP-DJS400because my Grado I80 poofed into disintegration. I'm poor so who cares. Anyway. Lets go. The Koss Portapros are great if you are using an I pod such device. The sound they give is very clear and crisp. I actually hooked them up to my Onyko 110 Rms surround sound system at 70 volume level and they did not blow they did crackle but these are not a stereo headphone but close.The Koss PortaPro is the best lightweight headphone for hearing all the great variety of pings and pongs with booms for the money. The displacement with these is incredible. The sound comes in so clear and uniform you almost think your in the studio but not quite. They are worth it.I bought the Pana...screw it look above.. ok.. These are great head phones the song displacement is no where near as good as the Koss. Koss has a lot higher range than the Panasonic. The Panasonic I think were designed to give a bigger bass with less treble in the high notes but they sound the best at the highest volume. I personally like that. You listen to music loud to get into it. So you have to listen to these cans loud to enjoy them. They are very good and better than AKG M80 MK11.. for the price(10 bucks cheaper that the Koss).So whos the best.The Koss Portapro got it down in the sound department and the construction is very good. Koss also stood up to my Stereo.The Panasonic sound muffled compared to the Koss but not that much. Panasonic also can be played on your stereo and they vibrate with bass on your head..this can be annoying though. The Panasonic are built though wires won't fall out and you can depend on them on a 110 rms system to deliver the better than paid price for the sound. They are ok no Sennheiser or Grado , Sony Mdr  sound quality.I choose the Koss for my Ipods and laptops... But I choose the Panasonic for a pretty good home surround sound system.  These are 2 different headphones. One is used for ipods and laptops the other is designed for everything. You like sound get Koss. You want everything with a lack in areas get the Panasonic. They are both constructed by someone who thought about the design. Boy is that important.
These cans are not as good as my Grado SR80s; however, they are very good.  The bass is realistic.  The highs are crisp.  The midrange is balanced with the bass and highs.  I don't transport them very much; however they do fold up and store quite nicely.  One thing which I consider a real plus is the metal band across the head.  The band makes it absolutely simple to adjust the width, between ears, of the drivers without damaging the headset.  For a set of sub-$50 cans these are a great choice.  I've heard that the KOSS Sporta-pro isn't as good as these KOSS Porta-Pros.  If that is the case I'd stay away from them and get the Porta-Pro instead.  Unlike my Grado SR80s these drivers do not require additional amplification when used with my iPod or iPod Touch.
These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable.  Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.PROS- Sound is great, bass and all.- iPod/iPhone friendly plug.- Lightweight and comfortable.- The price is right.CONS- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.
Get the SportaPros instead.  They look better, can be worn in a street configuration, cost less, and sound exactly the same.
Don't let the design deter you...These headphones produce excellent sound with good volume, bass and frequency range. For the reasonable price, I don't think you will be disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones. Also, they can be compactly stored (designed to fold together) and carried within included case.Okay, the bad...They're not the most comfortable "over-the-ear" headphones with a pretty tight feel and a bit difficult to adjust. Also, the metal/plastic headband slide has grabbed my hair a bit without following through with a kiss.When I first started using headphones (over 40 years ago now) Koss was the brand to get. This still seems to be true today. Overall, these are very good sounding headphones for a reasonable price.
Reviews are great, sound is great, comfort is awesome you almost can't feel they are there.However, some geek has decided to skip the two different methods of plug, that have worked just fine since plugs were invented.  Instead of a plug going straight in, or a plug with a 90 degree bend, they have decided to be cute and have used a plug that has a 45 degree bend.  In one great flash of brilliance (insert sarcasm here) they have managed to get the bad features of both other plug designs.  It sort of sticks out and it is sort of able to follow the line of the player.  But not quite.If I keep these, I will be rewiring to a standard plug.BAD IDEA KOSS!  Otherwise great headphone with a great history, now with an odd little glitch.
these have very good sound.  relatively comfortable on head.  I like being able to hear surrounding sounds, so I appreciate that.
I have been modding and testing headphones out for the past 2 years and these are my favorite. They can be used for any genre you can think of. Excellent sound all around and they aren't even burned in yet. Highly recommended for comfort and sound!Update: I am returning these unfortunately. Although they are great, they are not so good for exercising. I didn't even attempt it but if you get sweat inside the ear cushions, it will go straight to the driver. They are great for portable use still as well. They also were a little tight on my head, even with the light mode on. The light mode also wasn't working very well. I have a bigger than normal sized head though. If you have a normal or small head, these would fit great. It just clamped too hard for me. While I still recommend them, they are just made way too cheaply and hurt my head.
Sound is great for such an Extremely lightweight headphone; Construction durability remains to be seen.  Very fold-able / portable. Love-Hate wear procedure - bit of a nuisance: Because of the thin, spring headband, you Must spread out the earpieces all the way (you can't just slip them over your head and ears); wear the headset; and Then tighten the head band and click-adjust the Comfort buttons to get a good fit.  Great $ value with KOSS' Lifetime replacement warranty.  Appeared flimsy on first blush, but on the other hand, it is very flexible and should survive most abuse.  However as mentioned in other reviews, the cable insertion points at the ear pieces do appear vulnerable-fragile and Should have strain-reliefs which is present at the plug-end of the cable (Note for KOSS).
My old Sennheiser PX-100s were finally dying after about five years and it was time to find a new pair of jogging/traveling around headphones. The PX-100s were great, but with the success of that product Sennheiser changed the headphones somewhat and jacked up the price so I figured it was time to tryout their Koss counterparts. I'm a big fan of the PortaPros, they have punchy bass, mid-range is good and the treble is not too piercing. The result is a very good product, though I have to admit I don't like the sound quite as much as the Sennheisers. I think that the main problem is the bass, it's good, but the Sennheisers had a dynamic, fat bass sound that the PortaPros can't quite reach.  I'm a fan of a variety of music, and in rock and jazz tunes this slight deficiency is not apparent at all. With electronic music and, in particular, hip-hop, the limits of the bass show up. I should say that I do have perhaps an over-fondness for low-end sounds so it's possible that you'll like the fact that the bass isn't as strong with the PortaPros.  I will also say that while I don't like these PortaPros quite as much as the PX-100s, I don't think that the PX-100s are worth their new $50 price tag and I would purchase these Koss headphones again if giving the choice.
works great for my needs, but I'm not a fan of the coiled wire and angled plug. thankfully the coil is a softer compound so it doesn't pull on my head during use, but I would have preferred a straight wire. I know I know-- &#34;it was in the details&#34;. Well, I admit I apparently didn't read them all.the angled plug is more an issue, since a straight plug fits my needs better.I shopped Koss based on another Koss headset I bought. I'd buy Koss again (obviously).
I'm not an audiophile but i think these sound good. Mostly good bass response and block of the surrounding sounds.I have been using mine at work every day of the week. They are just as good as the day i bought them.  I have dropped them a few times but they don't seem to care.If these ever break i will buy another pair. Good value for the price.(Updated)I have now had these for a few months. (Using them right now as I type) I use them everyday at work, I drop them regularly, and they look and work as good as the day I bought them.
I bought these for my father who is temporarily bedridden. They are ideal for the rough treatment this entails-lots of cord tugging, pulling and crushing. They block out noise better than the open-ear style too.
I bought these headphones as a replacement for my Sennheiser HD202 (which I loved). The problem with my HD202's and many other headphones (I owned many) is that I would lose sound in one of the ears after a long period of time. (usually after 8-12 months) I found out that due to twisting wires (I would wrap my wire around the headphones after use) it could damage them and the special coating inside them.This is one of the reasons I love these headphones. There is a coiled wire, and it's only attached to one side. Very clever indeed Also, the wire isn't a ridiculous 6ft. long. The construction of them is plastic, so it doesn't feel the strongest. (My first pair arrived damaged and I had to get a replacement)Sound quality is usual. Nothing outstanding, but it's not terrible, believe me, it has quality sound. Just don't be expecting Bose quality.It fits my head nicely. For the price, I recommend these to anyone who wants some great headphones.
This review is for the Koss UR-20 headphones. The sound is pretty good, but I personally feel like the Bass is lacking. It's ok I guess. I love the cord length. My previous headphones had a real short cord, so this cord is a WELCOME change (I think it's 8ft). I kinda wish that the cord came out of the right speaker, but that's just splittin' hairs. It's good at blocking out most outside sounds (when my mp3 player is turned all the way up), which is great, cause my house is like American Idol...People singing ALLLLL the time. It's SO annoying!! So I bought these specifically to block them out. For the price, I guess I can't expect much more. These headphones are pretty good.Some things I wanna add to this review. The cord is thick. I don't know how important that is, but there it is. These headphones are kinda annoying cause you have to readjust them every time you're about to listen to music.
I have had these for several years and they have been subjected to steady use. I'm writing this review far, far in arrears.The sound quality is good. It's not a legitimate hi-fi listening experience but for general purposes they are good. The bass is not spectacular. It's present, but it's not what I'd call deep and rich. The treble is also good but not especially crisp. The sound quality is adequate. If you're accustomed to listening to hi-fi headphones, or a decent home system with a powered 10- or 12-inch sub, this doesn't hold up.I've had these for several years. They have been used for casual listening on the laptop, gaming, and to cover my ears while I'm mowing the lawn. So - a lot of sweat, a lot of wear and tear. They are pretty comfortable. This year the covering of the ear pads started to flake apart and peel off. There's a padded cloth beneath the plastic which is actually a lot more comfortable than the loose plastic cover, but it's going to get gross in a hurry if I keep using it for yard work / lawn mowing.Overall these are OK. OK sound, good durability. They are all plastic and pretty light, but hey, proof is in the pudding. These have lasted for years of heavy use. The drivers are still good. I've broken other pairs of headphones with no special abuse involved so this is pretty good durability. I can't say with certainty whether there are other offerings in the same price range with better durability or performance. Obviously, it would take years to do to another pair of headphones what I did to these, but overall, I'd say these are good. Not stellar. Not stellar sound. Not stellar durability. Pretty comfortable... maybe best-possible in that category. But they're not superior to a high-end pair of Sennheiser or Bose or Audio Technica headphones. They're just... good. If you want good, reliable headphones, good sound, good durability, for $40 or so, this is a good fit for you. If you expect lifelong durability or stellar, top-end audio quality and wonderful bass, this really won't do it for you.
I love these headphones in behind the head mode (especially now that I know the earpieces can rotate). In over-the-head mode I find the band a little tight. It works, but the earphones barely cover my ears. I have a large head, and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in over-the-head mode. But I'll likely be using it in behind the head mode even when I'm not outside wearing a hat, just because it's more comfortable.
Strait out of the packaging I hooked them up to my HDCD Denon player. Overall, they've got good highs and mids.  The 6khz treble region could be a little more pleasantly recessed than it is, but the high-end never gets  fatiguing at normal volumes - only when loud.  I must say that the bass is  a little exaggerated. It is noticeably overdone in the 30-80HZ region --  the lowest you can pretty much hear with headphones. This never *seems* to  muddle the mids, which is often a problem with bass-heavy phones. It  doesn't seem excessively boomy and there are oodles of low-end dynamics,  which I did not expect. They remind me a lot of the Denon 950's, but  without the Denon's tissy-fit highs. When I hooked them up to my Panasonic  361C portable, I was surprised even further. With Curve: Doppelganger, the  bass didn't seem even the slightest bit exaggerated. Unfortunately, when I  moved over to extreme low-end intensive music like Massive Attack:  Mezzanine, there was still a little too much bass, but slightly less than  on the Denon. Econoline Crush: The Devil You Know kind of had too much  bass, but most people would probably prefer it that way. Yet, on many CD's  bass is noticeably overdone.  Spatially, the SportaPros have a nice open  sound.The SportaPros fold up and this is where the other caveat comes  out. When using the headband behind your head, the little fold-up hook can  start rubbing against my head, behind my right ear. This only happens when  the band slides too far down, though. All Koss had to do was have the hook  facing the opposite direction to avoid this. They're still the most  comfortable headphones-that-press-on-the-ear that I've ever tried, and I do  love how they fold up; it returns them to a nice, taught shape. The Koss  has a good, short length of cord for portable use that also has a mute  button on it.I'll keep the SportaPros as a portable and bass-y  alternative. If used with bass turned down a tad, they would be even  better.P.S. Single-entry wires are not superior.  They allow out of  phase cross-talk to enter the opposite ear through the shared ground wire,  which is why audiophile headphones are almost always dual-entry.  The  classic Sony V6, for instance, has a cross-talk problem and is unsuitable  for binaural applications because of this.
I bought this item nearly 10 years ago in a supermarket for 375 Eur (~$450) when it was brand new!They're awesome headphones, about 4 years down the road the rubber starts peeling off, revealing the fabric to cover the ears.These headphones are quite loud, but 24ohms, so they're not as loud as a 4 ohms headphones, but make up for their sound quality.They are very neutral phones, sounding quite even in the whole register. If you're mainly doing techno and house stuff, you might as well go with the much cheaper Sennheiser HD505, not for sale anymore.They have the Sennheiser 202 which are very close to the 505's. SOundwise they sound about just as good, little less mids, just as loud (if not louder), just as good lowend, crisper brights. I find the senheisers better sounding than these sony's, although these sony's sound more linear, less crisp, more evened out in sound.these sony's are better for overall listening, like a variety of styles ranging from classic,to jazz, to pop etc... The Senheisers are better for techno, house, pop, dance, r&b;, hiphop etc...If I can compare these 2 headphones (as they're all I have to compare eachother with),I'd go for the senheisers, because they're less than a quarter the price of these sony's and overall just as good.If you're an audiophile, wanting to get the best, obviously these sony's are better, but not by much. In fact, most people might not even hear the difference even if they had to A/B them.
I just bought my second pair.  It looks like the build quality is about the same as it was before.  I am a DJ who loves music, and use these for all my work, and these have awesome sound.  There are a few problems with them, however.  If you're a DJ who monitors loudly, and you forget to turn them down after mixing, the drivers can and will eventually blow!  In addition, the round plastic cylinders with the L and R labels at the top of them break, and that is why I finally had to buy a new pair, but not bad for 5 years of use and abuse!Sound quality wise, if you're not a DJ there are better headphones out there.  If money is no object, get the Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones, much better, and filters out all the sound around you!  But if you're a DJ, these headphones are a MUST!!!! I've talked to hundreds of other DJ's, and they all have bought the Denons, Technics, Pioneer, and other brands of DJ headphones that cost the same or more, and they have all told me that those headphones DO NOT HOLD UP as good as the Sony's did.  Too bad the DJ headphone makers don't take note of this and make a better quality product.
Really good set of cans...very good overall...all genres.  These things need power to perform at there best, amp hungry.  They are not my Ultrasone PRO 550 or PRO 750...but they make an awesome set for a family set headphone.
The headphone cup that goes around your ear is nice for the plane because it eliminates much of the ambient noise that causes jet-lag lethargy, but if you want a better audio experience buy the Sony MDR V700 headphones. They are a little less cuppy on your ear, but the sound is far superior.
These are the best headphones u can buy.  I got them, put them on on the way home and couldnt believe how amazing the sound is!!!  I have had nearly every headphone, been searching for the "perfect" headphone and i just found it!!!  They look really cool, use only a trickle of power for mp3 players, and give u great sound that covers youre ear unlike earbud or anything like that.  With these you get very very clear distinguishable sound from headphones that are light as a penny.  They are as comfortable as wearing a hat, and you bearly feel they r even on.  it is definitely worth the [price] compared to [price] headphones that break in a week.  And i get [price] a week so i value money alot!  BUY THESE HEADPHONES!!! they dont distort music, they just give it to you with awesome clarity and precision.  They sound so much better than even my awesome sony speakers!!Edit:I wrote this review many many years ago, and apologize for the awful grammar and spelling.  I still own these headphones, and they still sound great, but after becoming somewhat of an audiophile, I have noticed that these emphasize treble and bass.  They sound very punchy and clear because of this, so 90% of people will love them, however if you want to hear music without any extra bass or treble, you will have to get some more professional oriented headphones from Sennheiser or the very well known Sony models.The headphones are well made, but as with most headphones, the first thing to break down is the ear pads and head pad covering.  After so many years of use, the pleather material has seperated from the inside of the ear cups and head band.  This does not interfere with comfort at all, but they don't look as nice as they did when they were new.  That said, the drivers still work great, and sound quality is what it always was.I lent these headphones to a friend who was a fan of rap and other music (that I don't listen to) and he refused to give them back for 2 weeks, since he liked them so much.  If you don't mind getting headphones that are many many years old but still sound great for most ears, these are a great choice.  Please disregard my previous review, I was just happy to find headphones that sounded decent.
I am an audio newbie and for me, these sound great. I know that one can always spend more money, but these worked just fine for me, but only for about four years. The left-hand side of the headphones just fell apart. One day, they were working fine, the next they break on me and become unusable, hanging by a single cord. I didn't use these every day, but only on occasion. I would have thought that they'd have lasted me 5-7 years, but I was way off.
The sound quality is the best of any home headset I've ever used. I bought another brand at a RadioShack and it sounded HORRIBLE.But the manufacturing quality is bad. It only lasted for a year before it broke and I had to buy a new one (I guess that's how Plantronics makes extra profits).
I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money.
I bought this for its durability, but the sound quality was pretty low/poor; volume was low too.
This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i.e. very good). The 2.5mm jack means it won't fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it's great (both 8820 and Pearl). As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming. Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around. It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference. I'll buy it again if/when this one finally dies.
I purchased this headset because my old Plantronics headset fell apart. I do like this headset but I have been told that people can sometimes barely hear me when I am talking, so I have to move the mouth piece a little closer which sometimes causes my ear piece to move away from my ear.  Overall I am please with this purchase.
I like these headphones a lot. It's been years since I've had over-the-ear headphones and there's no comparison in both comfort and sound vs earbuds. These are like being in concert. The MDR-V6's have a nice, neutral sound, meaning they're not overly base heavy but more realistic to what natural sound would be. The cord is coiled and doesn't detach from the headset. So for those who want everything to come apart these wouldn't do it. I use them primarily to listen to music when I'm using my computer and sometimes when I'm playing something I haven't heard in a while, like YES, I just have to stop and appreciate the music again. Wonderful experience.
I am very pleased with the sound of these headphones. It is detailed and well-balanced across the frequency range. I am happy to listen for extended periods and the headphones are comfortable. I cannot comment on thumping deep bass because I listen to the wrong kind of music for that. I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago but gave them to a family member. This newer pair cost much less but sound every bit as good.On sound quality alone I would give these five stars but the construction is a bit concerning. Pulling on the extenders to lower the earcups feels as if it is pulling the headband apart. The old pair extended smoothly. I don't know if quality has gone down or I just got a wonky pair. Since I can leave the earcups extended this is not an ongoing problem but it does raise questions about overall quality. I haven't had any other similar issues so far.
Extended frequency response for harmonics,  thus sound is crystal clear. Also bass response is excellent. Very comfortable on the head and ears. This phone does NOT eliminate ambient noise, nor is it designed to do so.
I have a hard time finding headphones that fit nicely and feel comfortable for long periods of time - due to my large head size.  These headphones not only sound terriffic but they are also very comfortable.  Super soft covers on each ear piece and the stretchy cord is a nice touch too.  This set feels good in your hands, and on your head, the quality is obvious and its a well made product.  I used these on a long set of flights recently and was able to watch many hours of movies and TV shows before I started to feel any discomfort while wearing them.  And that is really saying something!  I highly recommend these for general use, even if you have a large head.
I had always been using junk monitor headphones before I decided to upgrade to a serious set of cups. I decided on this headhone after comparing it to the 280 Pro (v6's amplification, and suitability for all kinds of music). For someone who has never listened to high quality cups before, it took some getting used from the boom-box style sound I was accustomed to before. In the end, I bought the OzoneMP (iZotope) plugin for winamp to get the sound profile I liked. The v6 needed very little amplification compared to my previous maxell HP-2000 studio monitor headphones. I was able to pick up sounds I never new existed. Unfortunately, for someone who listens to 128Kbps mp3 a lot, this meant a lot of noise, pops and clicks in the music. This was mostly bearable when the music is in full swing, but stands out in the silent sections of the music or really poor quality recordings. The same would be bearable in the Maxell (but without clarity).The headphone tightness around the ear hurt a lot when used more than half hour. I salvaged the Velour-like ear pads from my previous maxell studio head phones which fit the sony like a baggy pant. But what a huge difference and relief to the ear. The headphones are still tight, but much more bearable. Its almost a must that you change the ear pads, and consider that in the true cost of these headphones.
Not as much bass as i thought. But it's not supposed to i guess. Just for the studio to get true sound. I need bass headphones though.
Not that the 7506 is better or worse.  These have Samarium Cobalt magnets and the response has more of a smiley face to fool you into not noticing the roll off on both ends.  The 7506, with Neodymium magnets, has a flatter midrange but the lack of extension is more noticeable.  To repeat: both headphones lack extension, but one doesn't try to hide it and the other does.  Some people find the 7506 brighter overall.  Two different flavors of otherwise the exact same housing & driver design.  The nickel or gold-plated jack has no real world difference.  You might get a little more corrosion on the former, but the latter will just wear eventually anyway.  Samarium Cobalt and Neodymium both have their benefits.  Neodymium is stronger and doesn't significantly lose any of that strength over time (the sound might be more stable), but Samarium Cobalt puts out a more even magnetic field and is more heat resistant.  The fact that the weaker magnet on the V6 is preferred by some people might mean the "aging" of the magnet may have something to do with the tone people rave about on their 20 year old set.  Neither model has outstanding bass response or distortion characteristics.  Pick your poison.
These headphones have a very nice sound and are very comfortable.  I use them while playing my electronic piano and they seem to deliver a true and full sound. They collapse into a fairly small size and have a nice storage pouch. The cord is a bit short but otherwise they're great.
I bought the Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones to replace my beyond redemption Sony MDR-V600 headphones that have been re-soldered numerous times and Krazy glued more time than I can count. The only thing missing was duct tape.  Regardless, they were about 5 years old and when I couldn't find replacement ear pads, I had two extra sets, I new it was time to replace them.Anyway, after doing a lot of research, reading one review after another until I was going blind I decided to by the MDR-V6's.  Price was a big consideration and at $72.00+ and having very good service with the MDR-v600 this became a logical choice.I've only used the headphones for about 6 hours and I'm very pleased with them.  Some reviews mentioned a weak base and I agree, but tweaking the EQ corrects that well enough for light jazz and rock-a-billy (I go back to early days).  However I've found that listening to classical, especially Baroque, the MDR-V6's shine. Unlike others, I don't have a problem with the treble.  I've found it to be very clean, for lack of a better word.  One thing I did find out very quickly is I have to knock the volume down another 8-10 Db.  These headphones are very loud.As far as comfort goes, well Sony missed the boat.  I don't find them to tight but the headband is lacking padding. If you have hair on top it may not be a problem, I don't.  The MDR-V600 had excellent padding and I salvaged that padding and attached it to the MDR-V6 with a bit of Scotch tape.  Looks weird but they at least they are comfortable now.I did knock off a star for the comfort level but the rating is 4.5.  I think they are an excellent buy and the sound is also excellent for my type of music, others who need heavy base may be disappointed.  Finally they ear pads are very soft and comfortable.
