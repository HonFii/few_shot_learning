For the price, you can't beat it. Mine didn't come with any of the screws for the TV, but luckily I had some leftover from another mount so I didn't want to bother returning it. Also, not sure what they mean by tilt, but mine doesn't. The arm extends in and out as said, tv swivels left to right, but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation. Otherwise, can't beat it for the price as in Target/Best Buy etc., these are going for $60+.
I had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my 24&#34; LED TV in my bedroom. Other than that, seems to work fine.
Pro's: Easy to setup.  Supports many different VESA formats. Has some articulation.  Sturdy construction.  Can be installed by one person w/o too much effort.Con's: Cable guides fall off easily.  The joints are a bit too stiff; you really have to man-handle it to get it fully extended, and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again.  So far I have not noticed any wear from this firm pulling/pushing, but I worry because it is only attached to the studs buy 2 bolts.
Too Heavy and Poor weld quality .Lot of blow holes in welding, though painting was made nice to cover it or else it was made with inefficient welder. I think this is is not well designed by experts. Hope no calculations are involved in making it. Just copied the shape forms some other manufacturer.
I have 3 swivel mounts and this one is not the best. If you don't use the swivel feature frequently or don't place it where it may be bumped it will do the job. I prefer the strength and stability offered by mounts which have TWO arms extending from a longer wall bracket. These more stable brackets can be found at similar or slightly higher prices. Also look for a feature which allows the TV Bracket (and TV) to be lifted off the swivel arm more conveniently.
It is a solid mount and I doubt that it will ever fail to hold the 22" LED TV that is mounted on it.  My only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the TV is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans (up to 1.25" from one side of the TV to the other ~16") but for the price I can live with that.
I purchased this mount for my 37 inch LCD TV.  Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.  Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.Overall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.  I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most.
When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.
And what is it? Why it's an outdated B&N; Tablet! A friend of mine purchased this after seeing my 9in HD+ tablet, but wanted the smaller 7in version. It works fine for what it is, but it caused her much confusion as it did not seem "as nice" to her as my 9in concerning screen quality.And that's because this is not the NEW Nook HD with a 1440X900 screen resolution and upgraded hardware, firmware, and software which has been on sale everywhere since the B&N; Father's Day Sale was extended indefinitely. This is the OLD Nook color with a standard 1024X768 resolution screen and minus the upgraded hardware and OS.IOW this is the old model :)So if looking for that "new, on sale" tablet by B&N; like my friend was, well, this ain't it. She will be returning hers and getting what she wanted initially.As for this one it looks fine and works fine for what it was, but comes up short these days, period.
An eReader without e-ink? Really?eReaders are devices dedicated to reading, and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is eye-strain.By introducing a backlit eBook, B&N; removed the key point of eReaders.If you need a device that has a backlit screen (and can afford a $283 device), why wouldn't you pay the extra $200 to get an iPad, which does the job much more efficiently?Please, correct me if I'm wrong, because I really don't get the point of this device.Thanks.
A decent color e-reader, but pretty much worthless for internet use. The thing will only connect in the B&N store. Apparently it's extremely finicky about the wi-fi hub that it will connect to; meaning most wi-fi hotspots will not work. There's lots of online discussion of this defect in the color's design. I bought mine last summer. And now you have the option of the Kindle Fire. But I've just been reading that some of its new owners are having trouble with wi-fi, too. So, apparently there's no free wi-fi lunch with these relatively inexpensive Android e readers.
I got a Nook Color for my anniversary, and returned it within the 2-week trial period.  It worked fine; it just was rather pointless.  I have a Kindle, but I wanted something more functional that I could read in the dark (I LOVE my Kindle - the Nook was in addition to, not as a replacement).  To make the Nook into a true tablet, you have to hack it.  We did that, and it was ok, but still not able to access the entire Android market and some apps just didn't work right.  I did a factory reset and returned it, then ordered an actual Android tablet (which I have not yet received, so I can't compare them yet).  There wasn't anything wrong with the Nook, really.  It was just a lot of money for what is basically a glorified e-reader.
I bought the Nook Color for its intended role as an ebook reader. I have a Kindle DX but it has trouble with many of the tabletop RPG PDFs I throw at it and the 4GB is a tad small to hold my 14GB collection. The built-in PDF reader is worthless, slow to open files the Kindle DX had no trouble with and wouldn't even turn pages. I jail broke it, install a mostly vanilla image of Froyo and installed Adobe Acrobat and from there it shined. Page turning and navigation was a breeze and it complimented (read not-replaced) the Kindle DX quite well.It's a tad small for anything more in-depth than book reading and Angry Birds. Even casual web browsing can be a pain and it's place as a bastard hybrid of a phone OS on a 7" tablet form factor means it has the worst of both worlds. Maybe once (if?) Android tablets take off we'll see mobile pages more suited to them. The huge up side is that it fits perfectly in a large coat pocket and looks sleek enough to make you look cool removing it from the pocket of an aviator jacket.In the end it spends most of its time sitting on a shelf collecting dust. It'll probably end up a gift for someone who doesn't mind lower-end electronics. These days while the Kindle Fire looks good I'm waiting on the market to mature and Windows 8 tablets to ship before I go looking again.
I am new to nook color and bought over 40 books on the day I purchased the device, naively thinking that all Publishers adhered to the text size options available within nook (the 6 letter 'A' images incrementing from very small to the largest). Much to my dismay when I later had time to go through all of the books I'd purchased and play with text sizing and font options, I found that this was not the case. Indeed, the maximum size for many of the texts was too small to be read by people with visual impairments.My plea to Barnes & Noble, Publishers, Amazon and other vendors who produce ebooks is to please keep pepole with visual disabilities in mind and adhere to standards that will meet various needs. In the US alone, there are millions of partially sighted people who need for text to be enlarged, made bold, underlined, etc. My feeling is that 'corrected' versions of these books should be released and people who have already purchased them should be given the option to get free download replacements.Personally, I have visually impaired people in my family and I will no longer purchase any book that does not at least allow for larger text sizes.Nook color is a great device but in the end it is only as good as the software and texts that is uses, so for now I rate it 3 stars until the above issues are addressed and implemented. I know I speak for many, and thank you for your time and consideration.
It'll be gone soon, and I can't say I'll miss it. Our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so I got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the Kindle Color Nook. It doesn't overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as Our Kindle Fire's. Text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy. ONE advantage the Nook has over the Fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the Fire's percent of book read. Mrs. Spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percents.My wife and I are both comfortable navigating the Fire and barely had to refer to the owner's e manual. I don't like moving around on the Nook, and that may be solely because I'd become used to the ease of the Fire. Trying to surf the web on the Nook was very frustrating, and watching movies or video clips on the Nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion, slow responses, and freezes. We watch free TV shows on the Kindle Fire with smooth enjoyment.The Fire was a gift to my wife from me. She loves it. If I were to buy a small device for reading, I'd prefer to  buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads. That method may preclude the ability to get free books (it does on the Kindle), but it's a circumstance I'd accept.In summary, the Color Nook is pretty good as a reader. Those with children might be intrigued by the animation capacity of the Nook on some children's books and the option to have the book read aloud by the Nook voice. As a web browser, the Nook , in my experience, doesn't work as well as the Fire does.In choosing between the two devices, I chose the Fire because I prefer the Amazon site to B&N;'s, like the vast number of Kindle books on Amazon, and was totally persuaded by the vast array of  free books, movies, and TV shows that come with Amazon prime.
I don't read a ton so I didn't want to pay a huge premium for an e-reader.  I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.  If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.
Most of the other reviews have the details about what is good and bad in their opinion, and most of it is accurate. The battery life is misrepresented by B&N.; The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N; folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N.; Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be "upgraded" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N; upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N; will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T; with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library. I'll try not spill my soup on the NOOK while reading and eating -or it would become a SOUPER-NOOK.
I Wondered if this is designed solely for reading Text-only books/magazines. I have some books with i purchased are in PDF. Plus i have some word documents which i have converted to PDF. Both in my books and in my Word-Converted-PDF files have lot of pictures. Lot of the data are tabular representation are actually pictures. When i read them in nook, The letters in the pictures are virtually unreadable as they are too small. When i try to increase the font size, it does not work. IT WORKS ONLY FOR TEXTS! I Have never used kindle so don't know if the issue is there in kindle too. Also the PDF Pages are scattered all over the place. 1 Page in actual PDF file appears as 3 pages sometimes with a blank page in between. Not sure what is causing this.MY Nook does have a Web Browser but it only works with WI-FI, Not with the 3G. In 3G you can ONLY interact with BarnesandNobles.comThe touch screen response and user-friendliness are OK. Not great, After dealing with much more faster and better touch screens we use now-a-days.Go for it (And Kindle) if you are reading Text only book with very little or no graphics. AMAZON and B&N; Needs to improve their products and i am sure they will!
I bought these to power my wife's first high output LED flashlight. They did work, but did't last nearly as long as I'd expected. The charger worked fine and we had no real issues with the batteries, we just weren't impressed.I ended up replacing each pair with a single Panasonic 3100 mA 18650 battery and have been much happier. We ended up giving these away, along with the flashlight to my step-daughter when we upgraded the wife's flashlight to something with a little more punch.
VHS tapes, got them for my grandma, I'm sure they allow her to record the price is right without any trouble.
These straps are great for the general purpose of organizing entertainment center cords,  computer system cords... Etc.  My intended use for these straps was to manage cords for medical equipment during travel.  The worn straps these were to replace looped onto a cord before wrapping allowing it to stay in place when the cords are released.  Unfortunately,  these are missing that same basic design feature making them more likely to get lost as you need to secure it everytime you release the cord,  whereas other velcro straps remain secure at all times.  Not a big deal if you just want to organize cords of stationary electronics,  but then again for that purpose you may as well save a few dollars and buy a bag of classic zip ties.
Fast Ethernet cable built to last.  Bought this as an extra cable in case I needed it.  Works like a charm and is a great asset to have.  You can never have too many cables.
RJ45 cables are so common these days, you'd think everything would be worked out by now... apparently not so.The worst thing you can do to any electronic cable is kink it, bend it sharply, put a crimp in it. But my 7 footers, shown on Amazon in an appropriately nicely formed loop, all arrived in a tight wad with sharp bends every 3 1/2 to 4 1/5 inches along the entire length, and then tightly bound in the middle with a wire tie. Each kink even created a discolored joint on the cable jacket. Cables don't like sharp bends (mine have 17 tight bends along a 7' cable), those kinks make cables hard to string and route along small spaces, they make a rat's nest behind my comm gear, and they jeopardize the integrity of the cable.C'mon Belkin, your "Pro Series" packaging is a silly gimmick, because at a thrifty $2.50 per cable, I'm betting dollars to donuts there's nothing special about your cables, no rare metals, no exotic coatings, no braided stainless shielding... it's a generic Ethernet cable. Nothing more, nothing less. Kindly treat it as such. Treat them kindly and fore go the glitzy packaging.Meanwhile, my 15' cables from Mediabridge happily arrived in a simple cardboard box, in a neat 5" diameter coil. No kinks, no sharp bends. I try to order from Mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box, no fancy packaging, no rocket science, no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks, just a sound cable. Unfortunately, they did not have 7-footers when I needed them. So I went with Belkin, after all it's just a cable. Next time I'll wait for Mediabridge to re-stock.
This cable did what it was supposed to do, and was a great price.  I did recently upgrade all of my cables, including this one, but not for any reason in particular.
Well since most reviews have gone into the specifics of this device, I won't delve too deeply into those aspects. However, very rarely did I see any mention of how cheap of a device this is; the plastic feels of very low grade, the reset button litterally rattles it's so loose. Overall, yes the device works, so I won't knock it for that; unfortunately I have no means of testing the actual surge-protection, but I just have to hope that they used better quality electronic components then they used for the case build.Pros of the device:-----------------------+Smart circle design; obviously the main advantage of this is taht you are no longer limited by annoying power bricks taking up/blocking outlets. For that it works great.+Cute design; it looks slightly better than a normal surge protector with its circle form factor and brightly color coded outlets; however, the design is slightly hindered by how cheap the materials are, and looks less cute in person.+Long cord; 16ft is pretty long, so make sure you need that long of a cord, since the average cord length is around 6-8ft for a surge protector. Still for my application, a long cord is a plus (since I needed at least a 12ft cord).Cons:----------Really bad build quality; again, just super cheap plastic, and the reset button is really wobbly, barely feels like it's held on. The cord seems of decent gauge/insulation at least, and the device has some heft so it may just be cheap on the exterior.-No swivel outlet; for the cost of this device, it really should come with a swivel outlet connection, so if your outlet is upside-down (connected to a light switch) or you need it to go to the right of the socket, the cord will be tweaked in the wrong direction. I have no problems with cheap protectors not having a rotating outlet, but on something that costs almost $40 it really should have included it.Summary:-------Look, if we're rating the device on whether it provides power or not, of course it works, and should get 5 stars. The circle design is also very nice, and again worthy of some stars. But with how poor the build quality is on this (and this was ordered from Amazon directly, not 3rd party), and the fact that they didn't even throw in nicer features like a swivel socket for how pricey this retails for, I can't give this a fantastic rating (but will still give it an OK rating as it does in fact work, but that alone doesn't deserve 5 stars). I purchased the device on a Cyber-Monday sale, and even at the significantly-reducted price I'm still debating on if I should keep it or not. I have several surge protectors from all sorts of brands, and as such I'm somewhat disappointed with what should have been a nicer protector feeling and looking so cheap. I'd say for a sale price it might be worth it, or if you're really looking for a longer cord surge protector it might be worth it (although I have several longer-cord protectors that didn't cost near this much), but I've purchased much better protectors at even better prices when they go on sale.
A pretty good device overall, but one thing really bugs me.  I have it in a leather case.  I was carrying it in my hand one day and I dropped it.  Only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick, but the rest of the  device was cushioned by the leather.  That incident caused all the screen  touch points to drop.  In order to activiate something, I have to touch  below where it is displayed on the screen.  The functions on the bottom  moved almost completely out of range, and the writing area shifted down  also.  I can't tell if it's because the writing area shifted downwards, but  the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too.  I can't say  anything else bad about it, but what a letdown to know that it can't take  simple impacts.
I finally decided to spend the extra $$ for the Palm V and give my old Palm III to my dad.  Afterall, I loved the styling, but more importantly wanted the slimmer size.Unfortunately, when you use the hard cover that comes with the Palm V and put it in your pocket, it causes the power button  to turn on and then the up/down key constantly clicks.  Huh?So then I  went out and got the hard case (a rip off if you ask me), causing the  Palm V to be just as thick as my Palm III.  That left me wondering why I  bothered spending all that extra money to get a Palm no smaller than the  one I already had.Dad, can I get my Palm III back?
I needed to read the description better. However I feel I need to say that this paper is pretty much like a thicker printer paper, not really cardboard or glossy. And the printing comes out rather flat. of course I have used Memorex before, but have always used glossy before, so they make great products, but this one is pretty much of no use to me. But it's mainly my fault for not reading more carefully.
Memorex is a brand name that does offer excellent product support, and certainly this product is excellent for two reasons. First, because it's easy to use. Cover art from CD's that have missing artwork can be relatively easily dropped into the blank template software provided at the Memorex website, and you can create cover art that functionally replaces the missing original artwork inside the jewel cases for your CD collection. Where it gets tricky - if darn near impossible - is creating the rear front insert printing. But if you're looking to put a cover and a tray insert in quick and fast this is the product.The instructions for creating cover art that looks decent or retail-presentable is very spare if not available at all. Part of the reason for this is that 99% of all retail CD cover art and jewel case inserts are printed on glossy paper and not the type of paper that ships with this product. The Maxell product, however, is on matte paper. This requires attention to detail when selecting inkjet printer settings, as you want to use the amount of ink that is usually dispersed for, say, a matte greeting card. If you use the incorrect setting, you can often spoil the insert by using entirely too much ink and creating a "wavy" effect in the art that will doom your intentionally perfect effort to the waste bin. So do a few test runs before you make a final copy - or at least expect you'll use 4-5 to get used to the product if it's the first time you're making cover art.The format of the pre-printed and pre-perforated sheet is excellent, however. But there are some bits of advice worth considering when removing the cover art. As the manufacturer indicates, you will want to fold along the seams that need to be torn in order to get a somewhat clean cut from the 8.5" x 11" sheet. You won't get the seamless cut you get, say, from Avery business card stock of the premium variety, but you'll get an acceptably clean cut if you follow this rule.Also be careful not to tear the perforations on the rear art that are meant to be where the folds are. I did this on the first sheet and had to repeat!The software enables you to line up the different edges of the original cover art to the template itself - but as with anything on a printer, make sure your printer is lined up correctly with the paper so you don't have any overlap. My advice is to slightly oversize the original art (easy to do if you have a basic understanding of image editing software) so that you can be sure you have a complete piece of art without white edges on top, bottom, or either side. It takes some tweaking - it's not as simple as just dragging, dropping, and printing.All that said, this product is more than adequate - software and inserts - for making gift mix CD's. The intuitive software guides you through the processes of creating cover art with either custom or stock image backgrounds, and placing track lists on your inserts. In fact the software is so useful, I am considering the use of the software with my own sheets sourced from another paper supplier, and then cutting the art myself from standard sheet stock.In short this product is adequate for replacement of cover art of value-priced CD's to be sold at retail, or to give a faceless CD a new jewel case home for your personal collection. But if you're looking for perfection in recreating major record label quality cover art, then look elsewhere. Alternatively if you are making your own CD's to be jewel cased as gifts or to create DVD ROM cover art for custom projects - business or personal - this would be an excellent product. For example creating a professional portfolio or storage cases for personal media would be two excellent uses for this product. Since I have almost one hundred of these sheets, I'll work my way through them. But because I have customers who demand near-retail-new perfection in their purchases, I am going to have to begin a thorough search for a product that maintains more of that specific aesthetic.On value and price this is an excellent product - certainly much cheaper than the retail locations where I had seen them locally. And again if you're using these for personal data storage, home-made products, or whatnot, these are excellent. That said they provide an exacting and demanding customer an ersatz product, that, if printed on a low DPI printer, can appear even - dare I say - kitschy.But with Amazon Prime offers and excellent delivery, I'm not throwing stones at retailers - just letting consumers know that if you're looking for what I was looking for - replacement cover art with the aesthetic of that of the major record labels, you'll need to do a little more digging out on the market for a good fit.
Now, I'll admit I didn't strip it down and count how many twists per foot, but this blue three foot belkin CAT-5 cable is just about all you can expect from a functional blue 3ft piece of CAT-5 with molded plugs. Yup, shore is!
its an ethernet cable. seems to work fine. have had no issues, and passes the signal like it needs to.
Plugs are not plated (full plastic), which can causes mass problems.They do their job as expected for the rest.
As others have mentioned, only works with 1.44 disks.  Out of curiosity, did try a single sided 400 and double sided 800 but no luck.  Works ok.  Build feels a little cheap, dive itself is pretty noisy.  I ended up returning & simply using an old computer to read floppies.  If this is your only option worth giving it a try.
This same drive seems to be sold under many different brand names. Obviously not very high quality, but I need the ability to transfer data by floppy disk to an older machine & this seems to be the only option.I bought 2, 1 works (for now) and the other just wanted to reformat all the time, whether there was a disk in it or not. I guess I'll order a couple more for spares.
It works and it doesn't. The product itself works and yes it works with the Operating Systems but it didn't work for my needs. I had old floppies from and XP machine and wanted to get data back. With this I kept getting a message that there was no data on the floppy disks which I knew not to be the case (yes, I'm aware of degradation of floppy drives over time). I did some research and determined the issue was that the hardware is too knew so it doesn't recognize some of the older floppy disks.I managed to find an old machines with and internal floppy drive and did get the data off the floppy disks. All but 2 of the disks resulted in data retrieval. So while this actually works (drivers install, shows up as a valid drive, etc.) it really doesn't. Most anyone purchasing this is trying to get data off old floppies which this didn't do for me.
I like this product.  Just know that if you have labels on the floppy disk, more than one, the disk will get stuck on ejection.  The tolerance is too tight in that regard.
I plugged the drive in and my Win 7 PC indicated it was downloaded a driver.  After that I could read and writes files just fine.  It does have an annoying habit of refusing to eject disks with labels on them.  I've had to simultaneously hold the eject button and extract the disk with tweezers.
I expected this to work seemlesly and it did, so I do not have any complains. Amazon had a great price compared to the local staples., worked well for me.
Have a P-Touch Labeler? Have you run out of printing tape? Well, here you go -- just order this and you'll be all set to label until you run out of things to label!
P-Touch Labelers are handy little gadgets that should be in every household. There are all sorts of things that need labels. If you have a P-Touch you will discover the hundreds of things that you never realized would be ever so much better with a label. This black-on-white tape for the P-Touch is the basic label tape that the machine needs to be useful. The tape makes high quality durable glossy labels and works perfectly in the P-Touch machine.
I returned this item, I found an older production year so I could do the channel mods I wanted, I love the radio, the fact that it can be both a mobile and hand held has corba beat hands down.
I thought I was buying the Kensington 64068 but what I received from Amazon was a discontinued 64084 commercial model with an "HP approved" logo on the box and black HP-branded keys.  It works Ok but looks cheaper than the model in the illustration.  It's not worth the trouble of returning but I feel somewhat cheated since I saw an identical unit on eBay [...].
These are OK earbuds as far as sound quality but not better than ones that came with my Zen-M. They are more durable than orgionals and stay in the ear better but they seem to take more volume to hear well and I find the sound quality on the Koss "Spark Plugs" much better.
I got these in spite of some of the poorer reviews, because I wanted some  earphones small enough to slip in my purse, but my ears are too small or  shaped in such a way that regular earbuds are impossible and/or painful to  wear. This seemed like the perfect alternative.And it *could* be.  However, the &quot;slow-recovery&quot; foam earplugs included are more like  fast-recovery. I've never seen foam earplugs that go to full size again so  fast. They really are tough to get in if you leave the headphones inserted.The trick I found was to slip the plugs off the headphone pieces, roll  it up really tight and insert JUST the plug into your ear. Then slightly  move it around until the hole for the headphone is lined up, and stick them  in through the hole. That's the only way I think you could ever get the  things in your ear.Other than that, I'm pleased enough with them. They  definitely are way more comfortable for me and stay in better than regular  earbuds. Really makes you wonder though, if they even had actual consumers  try the earplugs out before releasing them.
Cannot accurately assess audio quality since the provided ear plugs did not fit properly, making it impossible to create adequate sound isolation.
I can't simply understand nature of such negative feedbacks.Don't like sound quality/durability/usability/etc? - Check price tag, scratch your head, try to find same durability/usability/etc for same price, I bet you can't.So this headphones perform amazingly well, compared to their $12 price tag. So don't expect $100 quality from these.If you still wonder what quality of sound these have, here's comparison with other KOSS products. This (The Plug), sounds worse than Koss Porta Pro, but sounds better than Koss UR10 (but you need heavy EQ usage to actually set these "plugs" to be better then UR10). Hope this helps.
UPDATE - I've stopped using this product and switched to a similar Skull Candy product. I used Koss for years and was a loyal customer. I kept having these break, at a rate of about one a month, and I was gentle with them! I think the company has seriously cut back on quality. I liked the sound and foam sound blocking, but reliability became a problem.ORIGINAL REVIEWI've owned several sets of earbuds and these are just great especially and truly when you consider you can get these for well under $20.For me the biggest issue with any ear bud or portable headphone is they let in far too much noise. You can spend a bazillion dollars on a set of snazzy phones, but if there's a baby crying next to you, well you're sound experience is going to be less than ideal. For a city denizen like me, common noise pollution is subway trains, sirens, chatty cell phone blatherers etc. Airplanes are another problem for portables because of noise.  The plug, by blocking outside noise so effectively, solves this problem.Another bonus you don't see often is that Koss backs all their products with a lifetime warranty.  Send them a check for $6 to cover shipping and they will fix or replace your plugs, even if you don't have a receipt!!The plug is big sound in a very portable package.  I'm hooked.
the koss vc 20 volume control works well. however it is cheaply made & if you start to leave the room without removing your headphones you might find yourself needing a new volume control. spend a little more & get one that is not so flimsy. again to it`s credit the device what it was designed for.
This product gets three stars for being the exact product I needed.  I couldn't find any other offerings for a headphone extension with potentiometer volume controls.  It loses two stars for how it crackled and had a poor connection almost as soon as I got it in the mail, due to a low quality cable that easily breaks inside.
product works ok, but the tiny wheel volume control is difficult to turn, I have to use my finger nail to really turn it. Other than that I am happy with it.  Not really a professional volume controller, but it does the job, what do you want for such a cheap price ?
One of the first things I do when I'm buying new ear buds is check the cord length.  The majority of ear buds these days have cords that are much too short for everyday use often resulting in the ear buds pulling out of your ears or the cord coming unplugged from whatever device you're using.  This is where an extension cord/device such as this one is very useful.  Like many people, I sit at a desk in front of a computer all day, listening to music much of that time.  The iPod dock that I have on desk is just far enough away that my ear buds don't quite reach and wearing them isn't practical or comfortable.  Thus I purchased this item to add some cord length and some extra volume control.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Adds approximately 3' in cord length.+ Volume control switch is at the end of the cord and has a clip to attach to whatever you're wearing or carrying.Cons- Sound degradation is extremely noticeable.  Feels approximately like a 30-40% loss of sound because of the extended connection.  While I expected some loss I didn't expect quite this much.  The Volume switch barely raises the overall volume unless you have your device volume at max.- Flimsy wiring and weak connections tend to short out quickly if there is moderate or active use.- Amazon's stock photo doesn't exactly match the item I received.  My model matches the customer image that was submitted so there are slight differences such as the angle of the male end of the plug.  Could be problematic for some.While this item is useful to me in my particular situation I'd rate it poor overall.  It works for me because it will stay at work on my desk and not see any travel use.  Since I don't listen to my music very loud at work as I need to hear if coworkers are speaking to me, the low volume isn't a huge issue for me.  However, if you're looking to purchase an extension for your normal headphones to carry with you this is NOT the device for you.  Especially if you're going to be around a lot of noise or people talking (i.e. the bus, train, subway etc.).  If you're going to be in any of those situations you're better off going with a different product.
These things are always temporary. Fortunately my new receiver has a better earphone output, complete with volume control on the TV remote, so I don't need to replace this in-line volume control.Nothing wrong with the product, but it wasn't sturdy enough to really last - and nothing else I've tried was either. The designers apparently have never lived with their own products. If they listen to music or TV at all they probably don't use earphones.Review by Tony. We both use Plant Lady's Amazon account these days. She has never used earphones and knows nothing about the highly technical science of running them off a TV set.
Nothing serious. The volume seems no different from when I control it via my phone. The only difference noted is the ability to leave my phone in my pocket. Not impressed at all.
I didn't care much for these the first time I heard them, tried them again and liked them very much, but later just seemed flat and not much life in there.  At first a wrote a positive review, but the more I listen the less I like
I got my PortaPro phones yesterday, and I am frankly disappointed.My intention was to use these phones with my computer for music listening at late hours. I was instantly defeated by the useless 4-foot cord length. I should have checked that out, but managed to miss it. Nearly every headphone designed for home use (as these originally were), come with at least five or six feet of cord-length. So right there, I was out of luck. Oh well, I thought, I can always use them with my MP3 player.My second discovery is that Koss, like many headphone manufacturers, is targeting it's smaller phones for the highly lucrative iPod market. This means that the guys in marketing are calling the shots. Not surprisingly, the phones have a cord-length that's right for the iPod crowd but not home users. Further, the sound has the exaggerated bass popular with kids into hip-hop, but at the cost of a balanced natural sound. I would describe the sound as smooth and quite pleasant, but rather unnatural. The low end is very exaggerated and the mid-range is down about 5dB. The highs are also way down, perhaps 6 or 8dB. Using my players equalizer I can make the sound acceptable, but these phones are typical of the "bass is what the kids are buying" school of design. Without a lot of tone control effort you should expect a bass-heavy sound that lacks any definition in the all-important midrange. I'm a lifelong headphone listener who has used Grado, Sennheiser, AKG, and even high-end electrostatics. I know good phones. These disappoint. I suspect that most of the reviews reflect people who don't use headphones much.One other point. Koss has been praised for it's generous warranty. Maybe, but read the fine print. Koss will replace or repair the phones (their option), if you provide a check for $6 and suitable packaging. Picture that. I spend $6 for repairs, $3 for a shipping box requiring a post-office visit, another $6 for shipping, and still another trip to the post-office. Some lifetime warranty. Incidentally, I would estimate the phones cost a maximum of $5 to make. Seriously, I base this estimation on material costs and the manufacturing processes, which I am familiar with.In conclusion, I cannot recommend these phones to anyone who values Balanced Sound over punchy bass.
For the price it sells it's not worth it, even you can fold them, and they have a good bass sound.I decided to keep it, but would not reccommend it unless the price is $ 10.Purchased different Koss model, much happier now, keeping both pairs.
I've tried out a number of portable headphones and these are the best I've found so far.  This is the second pair I've purchased since I liked the first set so well, and wanted another for my laptop bag.PROS:Good sound quality, lightweight, comfortable, fold up easily into a carry bag so it's portable.  The folded set fits very nicely into limited laptop storage compartments.CONS:Kinda flimsy feel, although I've had the first pair for over a year with no problems.  They also look a bit dorky but, eh, whatever.Overall I think this is a nice choice for the price.UPDATE:  I had the wire to the right phone short out after just over 1 year.  This pair doesn't get folded that often (and these are foldable, travel type phones), so I don't think that reflects well on the unit.  I've downgraded to 3 stars based on this issue.
This are pretty okay in about every way.  I suppose you might be disappointed, after waiting 30 years to buy them, but tough luck, pal.
I have been having Grado Labs SR60 and SR80 for a couple of years, but Koss Portapro always rings into my mind as they are much cheaper, and they are supposed to be really good with a sound signature somewhat similar to my Grados.Okay, I finally pulled trigger two weeks ago. My initial impressions are (only burned in for about 10 hours).- Bass is a little too much (that's expected and is a selling point for Portapros). But with EQing, I can make it a bit better to my taste.- Sound is not too clear overall (comparing with Grados of course), but this may improve over time with more burned in (based on my prior experiences).My sources are very decent MP3 players and laptop with external sound card. No external amps were used in any way.In the end, Portapro lives within my expectations. I like them for their compact shape, portability (which Grado lacks), comfort (slightly worse than Grados). I think these are not as good as Grado Labs SR60 and SR80, if a straight comparison has to be made. Value wise, I would go to SR60 if you can buy used. If you only buy new electronics, then these are really good values.
I've own Porta Pros since the middle 80's. They were my first good pair of headphones and I still have a pair today.Back when I first got them I thought these were a god send. They simply blew me away. I had never heard a pair of cans with such deep detailed bass. But then again I was used to listening to the cheap stuff that came with Walkmans. So the Porta Pros were a big step up the food chain. More then twenty years later and about five different pairs (the thin wire constantly breaks)they sound a little bass heavy to me now. I now do most of my listening with a pair of Grado SR60's. Much better all around but twice as expensive. My first pair cost me about $50 and that was as in 1980's dollar's. So if you take into account their current price these head phones are a real steal. And remember folks they come with a life time guarantee. The last two times that they stopped working I sent them in. The first time they were repaired. The second time I got a new pair. Not bad. But what they should really do is improve the quality of the wire. Even if it means an extra $5. I would recommend these to most but not to the very active or to folks who tend to break things, like my daughter.Love you honey.
Having recently sold my Sony MDR-V6 headphones (good cans but no longer practical for my purposes), I succumbed to the frequent hype surrounding the Koss PortaPros and ordered a pair, as a back-up to my Sennheiser PX100s and, if necessary, as a replacement.They certainly are no replacement, and I have yet to decide whether to keep them as a back-up.  Headphone judgments can be highly subjective, but here's one consumer's observations:1.  The PortaPros have a reputation as "retro-stylish" but providing cutting-edge, compensating sound quality.  My first impression upon wearing them, even before connecting them to a CD player, was that the comfort level is not equal to the PX100s.  I was highly conscious of an awkward tin band around my head and frankly baffled by the resistant 3-level "Comfort Zone" switch.  Admittedly, the initial sense of discomfort dissipated once the sounds of my player were picked up by the headphones.  They're indeed high efficiency (demanding less volume than the PX100s), producing an open, "non-canned" and transparent sound in the mid-range and offering  impressive detailing of the acoustic double bass on the low end as well as the drummer's ride cymbal on the upper end.2.  I began doing numerous A-B comparisons, noting that the PortaPros were immediately more arresting, producing bright, "forward" and "instant" reproduction of all frequencies, at times making me wonder if the PX100s weren't just a trifle muddy.  But soon the PortaPros began to sound slightly "edgy" and "aggressive"-- less balanced in their overall sound compared to the ever-pleasing Sennheisers.  Then an Achilles heel became unmistakable on a CD on which the PortaPros began to break up on the notes of the double bass unless I backed off on the volume by 50%.  With the PX100s the same CD produced only the slightest hint of distortion, which vanished when I cut back on the volume by a mere 10%.  Soon I wearied of the comparison: the PX100s had won the argument, and rather convincingly at that.  They're slightly more cumbersome to fold up and reinsert in their hard case than the PortaPro's (at least without practice), but that slight downside had never seemed more insignificant.3.  Neither of the above headphones would be ideal for monitoring or DJ work near a microphone,  the PortaPros more so because of their extreme sensitivity, which would certainly invite feedback.  For that sort of work, I depend on the largely overlooked Koss UR40s.  For comfort, frequency range, balance, and long-term wearability I would take these full-sized (but extremely lightweight) headphones over not only the PortaPro and PX100 but the Sony phones mentioned above. The UR40s handled the overly "hot" bass with absolutely no incident or rollback requirement.  Their weakness is shoddy workmanship (I'm on my 2nd pair): the head webbing came detached after a couple of months' use and the conducting wire is both excessively thin and short.  (If you purchase either Koss, be sure to save all of the order materials to be able to avail yourself of Koss' famous lifetime guarantee).
I bought this as a gift, so the largely negative feedback was really disheartening:*it sounds worse than cheap $5-10 total crap earbuds*it looks so futuristic*it snags hair*it takes quite a bit of force to pull them apart for putting on head*the same tightness that makes keep squishing together and inhibiting easy donning of them puts some unnecessarily pressure on the head and negatively impacts comfort.They're getting used.  So used, when I asked to borrow them to verify sound issues or find some resolution to the issues mentioned, they have not been produced so I can assess what's up.  If they sounded that bad and were that annoying, then I would have handed them to me for a return the first week.  She hasn't even managed to give them to me to check them out and now I can't return through Amazon.
I must say, these headphones are definitely unique. The drivers are huge, and so are the headphones themselves. These are insanely comfortable, lightweight, and easy to use.Audio quality is the major problem here. These sound very sub-par compared to other headphones in this price range. I would not recommend these whatsoever.If you are looking for headphones in this price range, I would go for the Monoprice 8323. Best headphones you can get under $50.
I was expecting a decent bass but the R80 is quite lean in bass. Mids and treble are balanced to my ears but the lack of bass makes the R80 not suitable for listening to my music. Build quality is better than I thought though.
I had some coby headphones around the same price as these, and I prefer thoes coby ones over these, sadly.....the coby ones I didnt have to tune my computers equalizer to make them sound right, these I do and I shouldnt have to. Unless this is user error, I dont think I need to tune my comp to sound right.....however on a plus for these, they are very comfortable to wear, and they are BIG headphones, also the bass is pretty, good. After all I guess you get what you pay for. I wish I didnt have to edit the sound, it sounds like im outside of a techno club listening through a wall, the sound doenst sound like im right there so to speak. I had to tune the 16khz up pretty much and the 1, 2, 4, and 8 up a bit, to make it sound right. The lower end just a touch for a tad more bass. Other then that theres my review 3 stars.
These headphones are good for the price, but nowadays you can find better ones.Why are these some of the best in the $10-$15 price range?* Very good sound quality, especially in treble range* Sturdy, long cable with adapter* They don't break easily (though they're still made of cheap plastic)* They're extremely light (still, that reflects on their plastic construction)That much being said, they don't stand up too well to higher priced headphones. Here's why:* The bass/mid/treble balance is off; low midrange is a bit quiet* The seal on the headphones is not good at all, so you hear ambient noise and others hear your music playing* The flexible design does not always align itself properly* They require quite a  lot of power from portable devicesSo, there you have it. These are good headphones in their price range. However, if you're willing to pay a bit more (perhaps some $20-$30 on Sennheisers or Sonys), you'll get much better bass/mid/treble balance, better build quality (not necessarily better sound quality, though), and generally a better seal around your ears. Also, you're almost always going to get better bass with in-ear earbuds at this price rangeStill, if $15 is the max you're willing to pay, these should do the job pretty well. Just remember, these are not professional-quality headphones.
Nice headphones for the money. Superb bass response and clean sound free of interferrence from outside noise.The 8-foot cord is awkward because it is coiled and constantly tugs on the earcups. After more than 15 minutes of wear, cups tend to go sweaty inside. It would help to have an uncoiled cord as an option.
These headphones are very clean.  Highs are crisp and lows offer no distortion.  However, the low end response is not so good.  At normal listening levels, I would like a lot more bass response and it's not there.  If you crank up the volume, then the bass starts coming in.  But I don't listen to music that way.Hope this helps in making a decision.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought something different.
First off I'd like to say that these headphones are very nice quality. I'm not an audiophile but I do have a pair of headphones on during most of the day. Playing computer games (WoW, COD, Fallout, etc) and listening to music, watching videos I prob average wearing these headphones for about 4-5 hours a day. My beef is they are not comfortable wearing beyond a 1 hour duration. The combination of having the ear padding too soft/short and the pressure that they put on each ear I have to take them off after because of the pain they produce wearing for long periods of time. I still use them on a daily basis, mostly because they were so expensive to buy in the first place I can't just set them off to the side and use something else. But after using these for a few months I might have to second hand sell them and look for something else that's more comfortable. To your average user these will be a good set of headphones, but to the guy like me who wears headphones for most of the day, I'd suggest looking for a more comfortable set of headphones.
I replaced 3 of these and then finally bought a DeCT 6 phone system and a dedicated all in one vs a cord like this. Cord and connection is a weak spot.
This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I'm guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor.
I spent many hours searching for a good headset for my Clarity XLC 3.4 Cordless Phone for the hearing impaired and settled on this one as the most bang for the buck. I was hoping for a headset to improve my hearing even with this phone, which it did, but only marginally so. It is convenient not to hold the phone to speak into it. The best about this headset is its very low price of $17.48 through The OEM Shop. For that low price, what can one really expect. (I did note many similar offerings for this headset from other suppliers ranging to several times what I paid). At any rate, the image depicts two ear hooks; I received only one size which seems too large to be useful. I received with the package a short adapter cable to convert the headset's connector from 3.5 mm to the necessary 2.5mm for my phone.  The assembly is a bit clumsy when connected to my phone. The ear cushion is rather small (the image shows two). The entire headset construction is a bit fragile, and I don't expect it to last very long, so treat the unit with kid gloves. No instructions were supplied to convert to the ear hook, and I hesitate to try to adapt fearing to break the plastics.
The headphones sound fine, they are comfortable enough -- but this cord is  a deal-breaker. As other reviewers have noted, it is very heavy due to its substantial coiling -- and as a result it will not comfortably rest on any surface yet cannot be left dangling because it is too heavy! Maybe an example would suffice... if I plug these into my Mac Tower while sitting at my desk, the cord is too short to not start engaging the coils -- which produces tension and then tugs on the headphones -- eventually causing the plug to pop out of the computer. ANNOYING. What's worse is that the cord refuses to rest on he desk either without sliding off because (once again) it is too short and the coils are too heavy. I have to secure it down which is harder than it might seem without duct tape, plus it really restricts my movement.For this alone, I would recommend another set.
These are well made headphones and have excellent response in the mid to high end frequencies but come up just a little short in the deep bass response. I did try them with several different sources. I listen to pretty much everything  classic, counrty, folk, rock, you name it( not much on rap or techno ). Compared to my Harmon Kardon and Pioneer speakers  or even cheap Skull Candy earbuds these headphones just didn't cut it for bass.
I did very well this past Christmas season.  I added theSennheiser HD-555and Sony MDR-V6 to my collection of headphones.  I intended to keep both because I was going to use them differently.  I got the Sennheiser HD-555 mainly for movies and the MDR-V6 for music.  Unfortunately, I had to send one of them back.PROS:- High quality build- Folds compactly- Fairly comfortable- Out of this world frequency range- Nice bass- Love the coiled cord- Includes carry pouchCONS:- Highs were harsh for meFirst off, I burned in both sets of headphones for about 2 straight days.  I then spent about 4 hours comparing both headphones with a variety of sources.  My intention wasn't to eliminate one but just to compare them since they were both nice headphones.Right away I noticed that the bass response on the MDR-V6 was much better.  Listening to rap, techno, trance, and synthpop was much more fun on the MDR-V6 than on the HD-555.  After a couple of hours, I started to notice I was turning the volume down on the MDR-V6 because it was causing discomfort.  However, I realized that it wasn't the volume, but that the highs in some of the music I was listening to were just harsh.  Too harsh.  The MDR-V6 is more than likely reproducing the highs accurately, but the trade-off is that some music was just too fatiguing to listen to.  Red Hot Chili Peppers just killed me!  If I hadn't been comparing them to the HD-555 I may not have noticed it.  I think I am in the minority of users who have an intolerance to those higher frequencies.  I was disappointed to have to send them back.  By the way, my source material were Lame VBR encoded MP3's, some FLAC encoded music files, and DVD movies.On the flip side, I felt that the actual physical comfort of the headband and ear cups were quite reasonable.  The pressure was not nearly as intense as theSennheiser HD-280 Pro.  The coiled cord, compact folding, carry pouch, and durability were all things I found to be very positive.I am not saying that the Sony MDR-V6 will be harsh for everyone.  I believe I actually have a heightened sensitivity to higher frequencies for some reason so it might just be me.  But if you get them and feel your ear drums ache, you may be experiencing the same issue I did.  A vast majority of users who have purchased them seem to have great success with them.  In fact, I recommend everyone at least try them.  They are an amazing deal on Amazon for legendary cans.
I have a lot of headphones. And have had for many years. I have these, and love them. These are closed-ear, clinical, precise sounding cans. They are hot on your ears. They are harsh. They are good for mixing recordings because they consolidate a lot of listening experiences. When you're mixing music, you need to listen on a variety of sources, sources you expect your music to be heard on: iPod earbuds, car stereos, AM radios, Disco sound systems etc. These are great because they relentlessly show detail. If your mix sounds good on these things, it'll sound good on anything. BUT If you are looking for a comfortable, moving listening experience; check out Grado. Audiophile quality, rich and beautiful. Recordings mixed with these Sony's will sound spectacular on Grados. These are an incredible tool, but they are built for a purpose, and it's work, not pleasure.
Pro:Great sound.  Fairly effective sound isolation.  Well built.Cons:i don't find these headphones to be super comfortable for extended wear.1) They are tight on my head2) My ears are bigger than the hole, so they kind of pinch.It might be that after a while they'll stretch out or relax to my head.... and they will become more comfortable.
There has been a degeneration of Sony products.  These headphones are cheaply made (wiring is not concealed) and are not as comfortable and well made as my Sony MDR-V600 headphones that are more than 12 years old. Fortunately Sony still sells replacement earphone covers for the good headphones that it formerly made.
Everyone's hearing is different so this is not really a critical review.I guess you really have to try headphones first, much like speakers.This is one disadvantage with mail-order products but Amazon is great with returns.
I got these about a year or so ago. They sound good and are comfortable but after a year the covers on the ear piece are falling apart and are not cheap to replace.
I had two pairs of these headphones that both broke in a few months. I don't get why the cord looks so very heavy-duty when the part you work with the most is so brittle.
Nothing outstanding about this that separates it from any generic cable you can buy - I was just in a hurry to get something, and this was at the top of the list.
I bought this so that I could use my webcam a little farther from the computer but it doesn't work.  I see warnings that 16 feet is the limit for usb cables, and with the webcam cable it comes to a total of 15, so I guess I'm on the cusp or something... Ah well, they're cheap enough that I'll just save it and maybe I can use it some other way, not worth returning.  No complaints at all about the seller, mind you.
The objective of adding the Sangean ANT-60 to the PL-398BT was to improve reception relative to the radio's native reception capability. The Sangean ANT-60 does not make a substantial difference in this radio's reception. That said, there may be no fault with the Sangean antenna and criticism may not be warranted, It may be the telescoping antenna included with the PL-398BT is just that good. The Sangean ANT-60 does connect and work as advertised. There is no complaint on quality of build or ease of use.
This switch is basic and it works just fine, it is a great value for the price that I paid.
This is advertised as a five port switch.  However, one of the ports is used to connect to the modem.  As a result, you are left with only four usable ports.  I had another product previously that I replaced after three years.  It was a five port switch but it had another port to connect the modem so it had five usable ports.  This is what I thought I was buying based on the description.  The device works fine and is a good product.  If you need all five ports, you should get another product.
This is your basic surge protector strip, with right angle plug and color-coded plugs for various audio-visual components. I have for a year and is still working
Good power protection device; colorful does not do anything in particular.
I needed additional power strips and this fit the bill.  There is nothing fancy about this strip minus the colors and the labels.  While it is nice for you to have labels so you don't have to follow the cord most of the time the labels will not fit what you are going to plug in there and will just have label them yourself anyway.  if you have the larger plugs like cell phone chargers you are probably going to take up two plugs as they are close together and not really angled for it.
It is what it is. Works perfect however when you read the directions in the package, honestly... there is no warrantee. your entire house would have to be grounded to this one unit in order for it to cover the damage from a power surge. That is what homeowners is all about. If you are worried about your saved computer stuff... then get a cloud. Although, I do not regret making this purchase.
Great product. works well. If you over AMP this product, it will shut off but will probably never work again. I have two surge protectors that got overloaded and never worked again. Monster has a great warranty & replacement, but they are a bit difficult to get to customer service or help. Make sure you know your jules and amps for what you are using it for. Otherwise, it works great and has decent spacing for 2 larger outlets.
So far, the only way I have been able to obtain my rebate is to pester the rebate company for months until they finally decide I am not going to give up until I get my rebate. Not worht it. The company uses a web site called "wheresmyrebate" com. Do not trust them. Other than that, the card is excelent and I recomend the card, just not the company policies.
Unlike Lexar or Sandisk, Viking does not design or make the components that go into their flash memory cards, instead they use off-the-shelf components (controller and memory core) made by others.  This means two things: 1) lower cost (to Viking), and 2) compatibility with devices may not be as robust as Lexar or Sandisk.  There have been numerous reports about incompatibility between Viking flash memory and various digital cameras and PDAs.  You should do a web search before buying this product.That said, this Viking CF card should work in most digital cameras or older Pocket PCs that take CF.  The rated speed of 8x means this is not suitable for digital SLR's such as the Nikon D70 or Canon EOS Digital Rebel which need higher-speed CF cards (40x or higher).  Most consumer, non-SLR digital cameras will find the speed of this card more than adequate.  128MB holds about 80-100 5MP, high-quality pictures (depending on the complexity of each picture and the particular camera model).  I personally recommend if you have a 4MP or more camera, you should have a 256MB memory card as your primary card, while carrying a 128MB card like this Viking as a spare.In short, this Viking 128MB CF card is good for the money.  Just make sure it's compatible with your digital camera.
I was not thrilled with these binoculars.  The main reason is that they do not have the option of sharpening one eyepiece separately and then sharpening the focus overall with the center focus "wheel".  There is only type of focus (the center mechanism) so if you have one eye that is sharper than another you cannot fine tune these binocs. for the weaker eye.  Otherwise, they seemed like a decent pair of binoculars for the price - just not for me.
I bought these specifically for a cruise in the Caribbean, the price seemed right. Don't expect to do any serious dolphin watching with these. You pay for what you get. They are better suited for near field viewing such as viewing birds in your backyard.The compact size is great for packing these on hiking trip, they can easily fit in your pocket or day pack. Although I have not tried they may also be good for the ball park or theater because of the practical size.
As a Traveler, I needed a Small, light-weight, folding-type of binocular with at least a 10x32 rating. Shipping was fast and i just returned from a trip where I used them in the San Francisco Bay Bridge area. The first thing that I noticed right away was how difficult it was to Adjust the Focus Setting, on the Right + & - eyepiece ... I had to monkey around for a while,and when I finally "set" it at a good position, the result was not Satisfactory, for me. It just seemed to be "off" a bit.I used them in both an urban and beach environments and they were just adequate ... probably more useful in a Archery or gun range, to be used only as a spotter scope, if that.Bushnell makes some really great binoculars, but this is the "Cousin" they never talk about!As a photographer, I'm always searching for possible working sites from which I can position myself and my camera ... but this was too much trouble, and I didn't want to use my camera's zoom, as that drains the batteries.* Conclusion - This would be a great Gift for a Cub Scout or new Boy Scout, as the Price is really great and they are small & lightweight, so that works. I was generous with 3 stars, because they are no better than a 2.5 star rating. But, for $25 bucks, I can't really expect a whole lot.
These work well enough and for the price I cannot complain too much. I do have issues getting to constantly show a clear picture. I bought these to help me sight my rifle's Red Dot at the range. It work well enough.
I ordered these binoculars to replace a pair that I had for years.  I wasn't exactly sure of the power of the originals, but they were close.  The binoculars I received from Amazon were indeed Bushnell Powerview... but they don't look anything like the picture you see.  I guess Bushnell changed the style and kept the name... and Amazon kept the picture.  I won't send them back, because these certainly functional.  But I REALLY wanted what was in the picture!
I have used the binoculars at a few concerts now. It worked very well at an indoor venue where I had pretty good seats.  I could see Adam Levine perfectly! However, at a large music festival, it did not work well. I could hardly see the performer and it seemed to focus on people in the crowd rather than the performer.  On the plus side, it is small and fits in my purse. I would say that the 8x21 would be good for concerts where you have really good seats and performances where it is a small venue (not a large music festival or if you are way in the back).
If you're looking for a pair that you don't want to lose sleep over losing or having your kid break, these are it.Having 20/15 vision, I find it's not easy keeping focus, because I have to change both the focus and the diopter on one of the lenses to bring an image into clear focus.
I wanted a compact and lightweight binoculars, and for what they provide, this set got great reviews. In practice they are easy to use and they are useful, but not a substitute for heavy and long distance binoculars.
Worth $10-$12 or so.  These are just what you pay for.  They are not a great bargain, but neither are they cheap junk.  For an every day carry or knock around in the car or Jeep, just perfect.  When you lose them or your kid drops them in the lake, no big deal, just buy a new pair.Two suggestions:  Buy the 8X25; it is a lot easier to get past the limitations and the 10X25 is hard to keep in focus.  Also, don't look through a good pair of binoculars or you will instantly be $200-$300 poorer.  I have German glass.  You won't ever want to look through them without a large credit balance and an understanding spouse.  I worked extensively with optics and lenses years ago and the more you learn and experience, the more it costs you.  And not just a little bit.  To get that last bit of quality out of lenses cost 2-3 times as much.Trust me, you are better off not knowing what you are missing.
good qualityeasy to managecould be a bit lighternot a must have but a good tool!
I got the 20 x 50 because I saw great reviews on the 10 x 50 and thought the extra magnification would be nice. They weren't that bad, but nothing to write home about. About worth $20 less than I paid. They aren't heavy so that is a plus. The quick focus was nice as well as the rubber grip. Would be good for bird watching if you are semi-close to the birds. You hardly get what you pay for here. I might have been expecting too much though. They were very solid and rigid.
I bought this for use with my new Slingbox and it works perfectly.  The only thing is that when I set up the sling box there was a IP address problem where the router did not have the correct setting but it was quickly solved by reviewing all the places where the router needed to check and match IP addresses.  Moreover, it does "hide" your computer from intruders.  However, the downside is that it lasted only one year and I had to get a new router. When it works, it really works, but when it dies, it's dead.
I bought the LinkSys when my 5-year-old Netgear bought the farm (I bought that one used, so it was actually even older than that).  I admit, I was lured in by the hot bright blue casing and high-tech style.5 years!  Imagine a product manufactured in this era that lasts that long!Now a month later the LinkSys is doing the same thing my Netgear did after 5 years -- intermittent connection.  Loading some sites but not others.  I can't speak to the poor customer service issue, from reading all the negative reviews here I can see I would just be setting myself up for all kinds of frustration I don't need.Back to shopping, this time for another Netgear.  The moral of the story is if a product works, stick with the brand!EDIT:  The problem actually was with the power cord, which would randomly stop working I discovered.  Any interruption in power between a router/modem/computer requires painstaking turning off/on and waiting to re-establish the setup, which didn't happen with the unnoticed power loss, explaining my spotty connection.  I'm now using the old Netgear cord instead and haven't had the problem again, knock on wood.
This router is absolutely amazing for almost everything except if you download many files (8+) at the same time via Napster or Cutemx peer-to-peer exchanges. This router will crash frequently if you are doing that and you will have to reset it -- no if's, and's, or but's. It will generally crash if data transfers get very busy, which is frustrating.However, this router has an impressive list of features like forwarding that allow you to do things like:- Setup WWW server. - Setup FTP server. - Setup remote control software.Combined with dynamic DNS services, you can host a fairly decent site on the web from your home.
I got this to span across my driveway to my snowmobile trailer, after the snow plow guy massacred the last one I had. The last cord I have had for some years and do not know the manufacturer, but it was orange, and stayed very pliable - the same as room temp - in any ambient temps.  This coleman cable does serve it's purpose - it works as an extension cord - but when I had it running across the driveway for a few days last week in cold winter temps (10-15F), I was unable to coil it very easily, it was pretty much frozen stiff.  Hope that info helps someone, other than the cold stiffness issue, it's a perfectly good cord.
I read a good many reviews before selecting the d-link nic card.  I found the install easy and trouble free- but the quality isn't what I'd expected.  The RJ45 connection is poor (cable doesn't lock in) and I've lost my  connection several times, having to remove the card to get a proper  connection.  This may well be a faulty card, but I can only speak from my  experience with the one, which thus far has not been great.
I have to remember I bought this for when the power goes out. I do use it almost everyday though. It's my morning bathroom noise maker, This is like something out of the 80's. was looking for something more stylish. but then i had to say to myself, we are looking for something practical. Practical it is, stylish like I said like my grandmothers onsee bathing suit. it gets the job done.
I bought a set of these for someone that has problems wearing earbuds (IEM), as well as staying away from my JVC-HAFX67B. These phones are perfect for the pc or laptop if you're looking for a 'quick' and simple device to catch news-feeds or watching tutorial videos. Please note that these are not noise-canceling headphones, but for the price with shipping, you really can't go wrong and they are pretty comfortable around your ears!About the phones:Works well with computers but I wouldn't recommend tagging it along with your portable music device -- such as an iPod. The reason being is that they do not do a very good job of suppressing or isolating sounds, which means you can still hear ambient noise and people sitting around you can also hear them. The earcups are designed at an angle facing inwards from the front (shaping your ears) and out towards the rear, this is good for people with flappy ears, but not for me and probably the majority. To get the full sound I'd have to press and hold them in flat, the XBS Bass effect works well but all other frequencies quickly becomes muddled, and surely one can't be doing this all along while wearing it.In retrospect, sound quality is decent, from a scale of 1 to 10 (being best) I'd say 6. You can hear the Bass but you won't feel it, it is there, only not as rich and tight. The Trebles could be better if it weren't for the Mids being a bit too high which resulted to somewhat of an overall 'flat' sounding device.Back to the design as I mentioned before, the angled-cup design could be a small problem to some people. It is certainly for me because this also reduces the overall volume decibel compared to my uber-rich soundingJVC HAFX67Bwhich at 25% volume level, I get a fairly high sound decibel as apposed to 50% level with the Panasonic. Also, I didn't like the angle plug, this could be a plus or minus to some. The reason: when it's plugged in to my Nano next to its charging socket, the angle-plug prohibits me to lay the Nano down on a flat surface, or I'd have to swivel the plug opposite but it'll stick up in the air (see my photos). In case you're asking, it CAN'T be swiveled to the sides because it is very tight with the charger plugged in, if I try, it WILL bend and damage the socket and phone jack plugs!Pros:Price, price and price (under 5 bucks)!Free shippingDecent soundBass (okay, but not rich or tight)Cons:Ear cup designAngled Plug (may or my not be for others)Flat soundingSound escapes even at decent volume levels
I wish I had a better rating. I guess it is a little unfair. The headphones themselves are amazing! The bass is really good with songs. BUT, unlike someone else's comment (which swayed my decision to purchase a little), it is not a good size for even kids. I have a really small head and these do not fit me. Plus, I have TMJ and somehow, it squeezes my jaw and it hurts after a few minutes. Ouch. So be aware when buying these that you are sure about the size. They extend quite a bit. So, I think the issue is having a really small head. Although, I am not sure about the other extreme (having a really big head). Ha. I guess the same issue would arise. I have no idea. I wish my head were bigger and my jaw was not so messed up... These are really great headphones otherwise. But, from my experience alone, I have to give a lower rating... Booo. Lol.
I bought both the Panasonic and the JVC with the intention of keeping both if they were about the same.  I already have the Sennheiser PC 31-II which I use daily for Skype & GoToMeeting.First thing that turned me off about the Panny is it just doesn't feel right on my head.  I even tried wearing it backward just to make sure, but of course that didn't work.  I could have kept it even though its sound is a little weak compared to the JVC, but the fit just completely turned me off.The JVC is much louder (like twice as loud), and offer a much better fit, even though the cups are a little small.I ended up returning the Panasonic as it just doesn't feel right on my head.  And will keep the JVC for my DJ purpose, since it fits easily in my 2U rack drawer and its loudness.
They sound decent, with adequate bass and overall good sound. They don't cup my ears properly or tightly enough, but sound ok despite that. Definitely worth the money, or up to $20.
Bought these to replace an older pair that the ear pads had worn out. Was somewhat disappointed after receiving them because, when I attempted to use them in my Samsung MP3 player the dongle would not transmit sound unless you played around with it. Once it did start transmitting sound it was inconsistent and would have be re-adjusted. Just my experience YMMV.
It's not bad...bass is quite strong for the most part.  It lacks the brilliant highs I'm used to, but I could use them as my main pair of headphones, if I were forced to. :-)
I needed a very inexpensive over-ear headphone set for my 5 year old to use at school computer lab. This works well for that. At five samoleans how can you go wrong? And the headband design is easy for him to put on and fits his head okay. But personally as an adult I would not want to use these for music. Overall they sound quite poor, especially on fine acoustic or classical music. Though on lighter fare like pop music, the bass is surprising strong and pleasant. I'm not sure how the bass can be so wonderful, yet the overall fidelity sound like a tinny AM radio. I could probably use these for tasks or as a study aid, like for spoken language lessons, audio books, transcription, listening to lecture recordings - I guess anything but good music.If you need something cheap and easy to take on and off, and fine to throw in your bag and not worry about losing, these are for you. If you want decent sound, not really.
And by "pinch" I mean, "your favorite headphones have bit the dust and you need a new pair to 'get you by' until you can replace the ones that died". The problem isn't so much with the FIT as it is with the static. Yes, I pushed the plug in ALL THE WAY. It CLICKED. There was no silver showing ANYWHERE. And yet there was still static problems everytime the plug was even SLIGHTLY bumped. I know....you get what you pay for...and to be honest, I didn't expect "Koss Quality" out of a pair of Panasonic cheapies...but I expected them to be better than they were. As to how to resolve the plug issue, I have no idea...I just know that the design currently used is NOT a good one. If you buy these, I hope you have a better experience than *I* did.
I would not buy these again for my computer lab. They are easy to break, uncomfortable to wear, and just feel cheap. They were cheap, so I can't complain, but they just didn't hold up under the abuse of the students in my lab.
I purchased 2 of these for my two children, 5 and 6, for some small netbooks I have that they like to use to play games or for a portable DVD player when we travel in the car.  They like the fit and feel of the headsets on their smaller heads vs. the plug style headphones.  One of the two has broken already after about 90 days.  The issue appears to be that the plug is a right angle plug which, when pulled out from the netbook or DVD player, it creates stress on the plug and it shorted out the connection.I ordered a replacement because the kids like them.  The kids like them and the price is right.  I have tried to get them to be more careful with the plugs, but I don't think it is their hands pulling on them as much as the design.  They are adequate and serve a good purpose for us.
You know what you're getting into when you buy these. They get the job done and are really cheap, albeit a bit dorky-looking. I'd suggest a decent pair of earbuds over these, but they sound fine and keep outside noise where it belongs.
Good, comfortable, basic headphones, but after using them for a month I would not recommend them for music. The audio quality is less than expected and does not have much range, especially bass.
All I can say is you get what you pay for and these headphones were especially cheap ($4.92). They reminded me of the ones that came with the old portable CD players.My biggest complaint is that they don't fit snug on my head so the sound volume is very low. The earpiece is made of foam padding. If I press the ear cups to my ear, the sound is ample and very clear. But I wouldn't want to hold my hands in that position for very long.I plan to invest in a good full sized set of headphones to get the fit I want. I am not concerned too much about portability since I usually listen to music in my recliner. If I were into aerobics I would probably stick to ear buds. For my listening pleasure, I would prefer padded ear cups that surround the ear and keep out noise.
likes:price: for $4.50 including S+H, you can't get better headphone than this.  this is really a $15-$25 headphone.good audio quality. (see "good for" below)dislikes:headphone is a little uncomfortable to wear due to the rough edges on the crown.  OEM could smooth out the rough edges.need to increase audio volume to compensate headphone's lower than average volume output.good for:regular home TV, talk show, audio book, news programming.bad for:high quality music appreciation (e.g. classical, acoustic, jazz).outdoor activities (uncomfortable to wear during workout)conclusion:i could buy another pair given the high quality to price ratio.
They work, but the construction suggests that they'll fall apart in a few months.  They're sitting on a shelf in my closet, because they aren't big enough to comfortably fit.
They are too light and don't really hold well on your ears but they are decent for the price and has a longer cable them most
Bushnell is the premier maker of Binoculars.  In this case these were advertised as having auto focusing - which are actually manual.  In the end they were light weight and magnified as expected.
It does work for the purpose I got it, but then when I use the lens cover to prevent them from getting scratched, it keeps coming off loose. Not sure if I will come back to this product. Thought, Bushnell was a quality product producing company, hmm?
No it's not especially if you take into account its intended users. If you use a Canon digital SLR and are satisfied with the kit lens (18-55) then buying this lens can be the perfect next step for you. Practically speaking, you will be able to increase your zoom reach to the point where you can A) photograph birds in moderately distant trees, B) be able to zoom in on the other side of a valley and frame something of your interest. Those are just two examples. One thing you will NOT be able to do effectively with this lens, however, is to take sport shots with it. How so? Consider some of the following weakness:*At 300mm zoom range the highest aperture is limited to 5.6 (You will have to use very slow shutter speed to snap fast action shots; remember the inverse relation between aperture and shutter speed.)*The lens size/weight combination makes it hard to hold steady when attached to a camera like the Rebel XT*Slow and often inaccurate auto focus (I just don't understand why Canon makes a USM version of this lens for $20 more, but never includes it in the triple rebate program)*Chromatic aberration is significant in high contrast lighting like in full sun (if you do not know what Chromatic aberration means search the term online or check out my review of the Canon 28mm 2.8 on Amazon, but to summarize, it would be a discoloration at the fringes of objects in your picture)Those kinds of weakness will limit your ability to use this lens in all sorts of other situations/circumstances. As a practical rule to follow, if the lighting is less than ideal this lens will give you a hard time. Meaning, it will be possible to use it, but you may get too many blurry images because of shake from slow shutter speeds. As for what are ideal lighting conditions? That would be full sun with few or no clouds and with the light bathing your subject/object from the front or the side.So is this lens that bad? Not really, as with many other lenses, when the lens is coupled with a good camera it still out performs most Point and Shoot cameras. Plus it provides results at par or slightly below the kit lens (18-55). So if you are satisfied with your kit lens, which provides you with a zoom range comparable to 3X zoom (55/18= 3), why not add another lens that will expand your zoom range by another 4X (300/75=4)? Nothing wrong with expanding your horizon!PS. TWO MORE POINTS ABOUT USING THIS LENS: First, if you're confident you can handhold this lens at slow shutter speeds (I know I can't) then the low maximum aperture shouldn't be a major problem. Second, if you're fine shooting at high ISO (more like 400 or 800) then again the low maximum aperture shouldn't be a problem. The nice thing about photography is that you can do one thing in so many ways, so don't be afraid to explore with this lens!
Here's the deal: I have an 18-135 mm EFS AF IS Canon lens, which provides for a decent zoom. I would say its quality is better than this one (from all the reviews I've read).I was considering getting the 75-300 for the added zoom only, but decided to run an experiment. I took a picture with my 18-135 lens with the best possible settings at 135mm. Then  I cropped the picture to get the equivalent of what the 300 would have given me. Even zooming in in the pictureI got me pretty good results. I haven't tried the 75-300 as such (they have a pretty lousy return policy here) but I can bet it will give me no better results. So I saved myself $150.
I bought this a few months ago and I already want to upgrade. I'm using it on a T2i and I get decent results, but like everyone says, IS would really help at those longer focal lengths. I'm going to start looking for the 55-250mm which looks great. This lens will get you started in telephoto photography, and I've even made some decent photos with it, but having to shoot at f/8 all the time sucks. Focus speed is decent but it has a very long way to go from infinity to 3 feet and it will hunt back and forth sometimes which makes me want to throw the lens off of a speeding train. I also think one reason for having a tele is to capture detail of something in a tight frame, and at 75 to around 250 this lens does an okay job, but at 300mm the detail gets lost, even it you get good focus and are stopped down. Bottom line, get something else.
not as sharp and definitely not fast for action auto-focus shots.for hobby only use on weekend, this would be okay, I've shot a lot of birds on this lens and they come out just okay, JUST okay. :)The construction is just average, barrel play on manual focus might be an issue for some.If you'll try to shot stunning vivid and fast shots, you might be better off spending a little more and pick the more PRO lenses.This lens is good for sunny days and for the newbie who just want to have a decent focal lenght lens. 300mm is really not bad.I've bought a Canon 70-200mm L IS USM 2.8f lens, big difference, both in sharpness, color and speed and also, really big difference in price too.But, eventually, that's what hobbies are all about, start small and grow, if you have the money, just skip this one and buy the real deal, memories are priceless, capture it the best way you can.
Of course... That are better lens than this one...But for the price... It's quite a nice lens...Whoever is looking at this one, is because want's a TELE to take some snaps with your dSRL...Extreme Photographers may not like these ones.. Many adjectives might be said... Slow (focus and F), Bulky, etc...But I am pleased with when using it on outdoor pics... If you are thinking about using it on indoor pictures, better have a tripod and also use a high ISO, specially at 300mm.the USM on it play it's role and I don't think it is slow as I have seen in some other reviews around here..But, for the price I paid and with my Rebel XT, and again, if you are looking for a good TELE lens, I would recomend it, but be aware that is has it's limitations...
This was my first EF telephoto lens when I transitioned to DSLR over five years ago. The first copy I got was part of my EOS 20D kit and it was a dud. Its AF was broken. I exchanged it afterwards. I didn't use it a lot. The only time I used this lens extensively was in Santa Cruz shooting the Monarch butterflies hanging off the trees. Overall, the picture quality coming out of this lens was not that bad. It 's just soft and you do need a tripod as this lens is quite slow. It would definitely help with IS. There are certainly more room for improvement. When Canon introduced the EFS 55-250mm, I quickly replaced the EF75-300mm with that, and it was a day and night difference. I don't know why Canon still continues to produce it. Although it is full frame compatible, I don't think anyone wants to use it on a 1D or 5D. It just doesn't make sense. Get the EFS 55-250mm instead. It's not that more expensive. You gain a UD glass element and IS. Picture quality is a lot better, and you 'll be a lot more happier.
This lens is a popular entry level zoom.  For the money you get a pretty big zoom range and ok quality in good light.  For a little more you can get the EF 100-300 f/4.5-5.6.  The 100-300 features ring-type USM which allows full-time manual focus--that means you can adjust the focus manually without switching to manual mode.  Also the focus is quicker and quieter without rotating or extending the front element so the use of circular polarizers is easier.If you can afford the extra money, I would recommend the 100-300 as a budget telephoto zoom.  If not, this one is ok but not good.
This is a good standard telephoto zoom with solid, but average performance.  This particular lens features Canon's micro Ultra Sonic Motor; therefore, it does not have the same focusing performance of the standard USM designs.  Optically, it is the same lens as the EF 75-300 III, and performs roughly the same.  Usually, this lens retails for more than the non-USM design, but I'd pay little more.  An oddity on Amazon has often had the price of this lens lower, and that's a good deal.As previously stated, the lens is a solid performer.  Good lens speed, but not as fast of focusing as the EF 100-300.  Additionally, the front of the lens rotates, which is not as nice when using filters such as polarizers.  The plastic barrels are OK, but zooming is a bit less smooth than desired.Canon also doesn't include much with the lens.  A lens shade is very useful for outdoors photography, and Canon is very pricey on an accessory that most include.  Canon's one-year warranty is also poor compared to most others.For a good alternative, look at the Tamron / Promaster 70-300 LD lens which has closer focusing, includes the shade, and both offer longer warranties.  However, neither are as quiet as the Canon lenses.For an upgrade, look at the Canon EF 100-300 USM, which offers a smoother, faster USM, and no filter rotation.
This lens has been around for a while. It's good value for the money, but there's better lens in the Canon line that won't break your bank either.You want to move up to the lens with the same description except for one thing, it will say USM. Those are the motors that autofocus uses. They're quieter and they work better. There are people that cite problems with autofocus. If you're buying this lens, you are probably using it on a body that is more limited in controlling the AF.But buy the other lens for about 30-40 more.
This is not the greatest lens in the world. I find it's very soft at the 300mm lens length. It is slow, f4 is the fastest at 70mm and f5.6 at the full telephoto.I tried it in various situations:1. For nature photography, I was grabbing a shot of a rare bird while hiking. It was not a great photo. The softness was annoying, though I got an acceptable enough shot for identification. IS (Image Stabilization) would have helped in this application, but this lens doesn't have that added feature.2. I put it on a very stableAmazonBasics 70-inch Adjustable Pistol Grip Head Tripodwhich is not a hiker's tripod but a very heavy, 10lb beast of a tripod that is going nowhere when you set it up. I photographed the moon at 300mm, using a remote shutter release. I didn't stop down the lens (perhaps that would have been better) but I was using a 1/10 second exposure and shakes happen even on tripods. The photo was sharp enough to see craters at the edge of sunlight on the surface, but they weren't razor sharp. The entire effect was soft (admittedly, we have pollution and it was a cloudy morning.)You pretty much have to use a tripod with this lens unless it's brilliant sun outside and even then...If you must have this length (and it is a handy one for sports and even candid portraits) then it's a budget choice. But compared to my 55-250mm, it's a lot softer and just not quite "the thing."
well, everyone needs one..  and for many (including myself) this is the first step in the telephoto road.  yes, the value is there, and for the casual photographer that "just needs a telephoto", this will work out.what you will soon discover is that with a aperture of 5.6. you will get some blurred shots as the sun goes down (or indoors).  you will also find that the clarity and resolution at full zoom just isn't there upon close inspection.  my brother and myself took the same photo several times.  I was using a 300mm prime, and he was using this lens..  the difference was amazing.  even I didn't think it could make that big of a difference going into a prime lens.  the image was easily 3 times the clarity and resolution on cropped images.now, don't fret, for the average point and shoot crowd, this will be a very nice step into the telephoto world, but if you are like many, you will be saving your change for the next lens after about 6 months.
On a tight budget when I purchased my dRebel almost two years ago - this lens looked very attractive. Since owning it for two years - it seems to go further and further to the back of my equipment bag - and not taken in my backpack at all unless the climate is too harsh for my more expensive lenses.In fairness to the product - it is very GOOD for what it cost and how it is designed. It makes no pretension to be anything other than an AF f5.6 >75-300mm&lt; telephoto. The construction has remained solid - the zoom (fairly stiff or tight when new)sometimes makes funny noises from grit lodged in the 'nether regions' of the lens barrel (I am a defense contractor who travels to some pretty rotten climates). Dust and dirt do not seem to be a serious problem with regular maintenance of brush and blower around the rotating parts of the lens barrel.Things I enjoyed with this purchase:1. Light weight, solid construction2. Acceptable optical quality in sunny outdoor use3. Accepts the same filters (58mm) as my dRebel kit lens4. Affordable for those on a tight budget5. Compatible with the dRebel autofocus and auto exposure system6. Expendable (if something bad happens) in harsh climates7. Draws absolutely no attention from customs inspectors, (or anyone looking to steal your stuff) when clearing security at ports of entry or return. Clears airport security without manual inspection.Unsatisfactory/annoying qualities that quickly became evident:1. f4-5.6 limited my use indoors or low light. Plan to spend much time in Photoshop to save your pictures2. Length of lens made it unusable with the dRebel pop-up flash (lens shadow). Immediate purchase of a 420EX Speedlight ($177+ see my review) cured this problem3. Front focus rotating lens element limited my filter choices to UV (haze) filter only4. Annoyingly SLOW auto focus5. Tripod is almost manditory with lower shutter speeds (see f4- 5.6 limits). The 1.6x magnification factor when seated to the dRebel brings the focal length out to over 450mm making off tripod use risky* Use of a BGE-1 battery grip ($100+ see my review) with this lens - lowers camera center of gravity-extra counter-weight makes lens use less stressful.Good price - fair optics - limited overall performance. Limits for the serious photographer make one want to look elsewhere. SIGMA has superior product in this price category, as well as the house brand at Ritz/Wolf Camera chains-while the discriminating photographer who has the resources should look seriously at Canon's "L" series (as I've done) or 'IS' series as suggested by other experienced reviewers.
I am a dad that likes to take pictures of my kids. I feel that this could be a little better, forgive me that I cannot put to technical terms what I find wrong with this. Just does not work that great for me. Good quality, well made, but seems lacking in the focus. I hope this makes some sense. Happy that I bought here for 50% less than Canon sells for.
I own several top quality Canon 'L' Lenses, so I am used to using the very best lenses.The instructions for this lens state: 'Do not focus in MF [Manual Focusing] when the focus mode is set to AF [Auto Focus].'The top of the line Canon Lenses allow you to tweak the focus Manually after the Auto Focus has done the best it can.The Auto Focus is slower than that of 'L' lenses.I captured a shot of the moon and the color aberrations on the on the edges of the moon were quite visible when the images where viewed at 100%.This is not a professional quality lens which costs $1,000 more than this lens.The lens at 300 mm f/5.6 is 6 stops slower than the f/2.8 lens, meaning the exposure time must be 6 times longer than the f/2.8 'L' lens.This is not a lens to shoot Weddings in a dark Church where flash is not permitted. This is not a lens to capture car races.Used outdoors in sunlight, this lens is quite acceptable. Do you want to take a photo of your child at bat in a day baseball game?This lens will meet your needs at $1,000 less than an 'L' quality lens.If you didn't understand what I mentioned about color aberration, and you don't use manual focus tweaking, and you don't want to 'freeze frame' fast motion, and you don't have a creative effect in mind that requires the lens open more than f5.6, this lens is a very cost effective lens.As a final note, while I own other Canon lenses that cost about 10 times as much as this lens, I am keeping this lens with a complete understanding of the limits of when I may use the lens effectively.It is a great value for the money!
I had previous given this product one star because of a completely worthless warranty service.  Eventually, after much hounding, the warranty department finally came through and replaced the broken PC cord that came with the flash.  So, I've moved it up to three stars.With that in mind, the flash itself is a four or five star item.  It does just what I want, a not too expensive dumb flash I can use for off camera flash work.  A few adjustable manual power settings, manual zoom and tilt provide about all the variables really needed for off camera flash work.  Sure, it'd be great if it would tilt more than 90 degrees, or swivel as well, but these things are more important for on camera work.  There could be more manual power settings too, but three is good enough for most work.So, if you want to get a cheap, apparently reliable (so far) flash for off camera strobe work it is hard to go wrong with this flash.  Be warned though, you may need to be very persistent with the warranty department if you have a problem!
I used this at the beach with one of my friends during the summer. Taking photos were easy, and with the camera in the case, we were able to take pictures without worrying about the film, not to mention toss the camera around (or chase after it after getting buffeted by the waves- the camera floats)When developing the photos, they came out slightly blurry (even the ones on the ground) and the colors seemed pale and washed out. While I haven't used film cameras in a while, I'm still positive that the color quality is much higher than what we achieved.Then again, you get what you pay for- and it's not many digital cameras that you can take into an ocean and walk back out of it with your photos. For the price we paid, we're just glad we still have the memories.
Bought these for our Hawaii trip, they worked fine, but after buying these, developing the film, etc, it probably would've been cheaper and more convenient to spend an extra $30 for a cheap waterproof digital camera.  At least that way we could've taken more shots and figured out if some shots didn't come out.  Now, I'm out all that money and if we go on vacation again, I'll plan to spend money on a waterproof digital camera, but I could have bought that last time and still had it.
I bought this for my husband to use while snorkeling on our honeymoon cruise. He enjoyed having it to play with and I don't regret the purchase.Just keep in mind that you get what you pay for. This isn't a professional, well-crafted waterproof machine, it's a disposable camera in a protective shell. It works just fine but the picture quality is just average. We were on St. John and the water was crystal clear, but it looks murkier in these photos. Again, that's perfectly acceptable for the price, but have realistic expectations or you'll be disappointed.
After reading the reviews, I thought this bag would be bigger than it actually is. It really only has room for the camera with attached lens and a pocket for a few extras such as filters or cards. I would prefer a bag that can hold an extra lens, but the conical shape prevents that.
The one piece of wisdom one should take away from the trackball issue is that every hand fits their gear differently. You probably wouldn't be reading this if you were completely satisfied with the mouse that came with your computer, but Logitech's incredibly popular Trackman Wheel work doesn't equally well for with all users.With the possibly exception of the Kensington Orbit Trackball, it's hard to find a device that feels so custom molded to your hand. Your thumb is in charge of cursor movement, while two sensitive clickers combine seamlessly with a scroll-wheel. It may take some accomodation until you feel completely at home with the TrackMan, and lefties are left out of the equation.Cursor movement isn't equally easy for everyone. On my Mac, with updated drivers, it took three or four scrolls to get from one part of the screen to the other, and this quickly became exasperatng; it's probable that the Windws implementation is more successful. Equally problematical, the thumb's positioning didn't provide the same level of sensitive movement as my fingers, making navigation slower.Legitech's software is where the Trackman is least satisfactory. The Kensington software allows considerable flexibiity of use, offering considerable accuracy. Logitech's software, frankly, is only rudimentary, with basic speed control as your only option.The Trackman is more perfectly fitted to the dimensions of the human hand than any major trackball I've yet tried, and there are times when you may find an effortless cursor novememt. To offer this at such a reasonable price makes this doubly attractive to anyone who values good looks in an outout device. The device is so comfortale that a few users have been affected by stiffness if used for long periods; you are sttrongly urged to stretch regularly in order to avoid tendon stiffness.All in all, it's an attractive-looking device that demands pre-use with a comoyter. There's every chance that you'll fall in love with the Trackman, but it may prove all but unusable with the wrong system.
I had this trackball for 2 years with an XP machine and no problems.Best trackball ever - not too big and glides well.  When I got a Vista machine it would automatically stop working after a few power downs.  I have to keep the computer plugged into a surge protector and as long as the power stays on, the mouse is fine.  But if I power goes out from a storm, then I have to unplug the trackball wireless module and either re-install or hope it decides to work again.  My computer just went into standby and the mouse was not working anymore again.  I had to re-install it again.  I've checked my bios power settings and the vista power settings. There is not much else I can do.  DON'T use this for Vista is all I can say.  It crashes all the time and doesn't like other USB devices except my keyboard & printer.  New Vista drivers don't help either.  Great for XP.
I have never cared for trackballs in the slightest, and when working as an IT tech found that whenever I discovered one in use it would always slow me down somewhat. I purchased this for my mom, who had always used one and preferred it to a conventional mouse. But although it was a Logitech and of the usual fine quality, she ended up abandoning it and going back to a mouse. I can see the advantages of having a small desktop, or a hand that just prefers that motion, but there is no doubt many reasons why mice are standard issue and have been, not trackballs.
I had the original TrackMan Wheel mouse (with a cord) and loved it.  I regretted letting my mother-in-law have it the very second I agreed to it.I purchased this one as a replacement once I realised I didnt like a normal mouse any more.  Plus I purchased a laptop and thought the cordless would be handy.This model works excellent and is great for use at home with a desktop computer.  Unfortunately, it doesnt mention in the description or photo that the receiver which plugs into the USB port is HUGE, its almsost as big as the mouse itself.  The size of the receiver and length of cord that comes with it is the same as having a mouse, completely defeating most of the purpose of a cordless mouse.  It is too bulky to carry around and setup on my laptop like I had hoped.  The receiver is much larger than the ones that come on the other cordless mice I have seen.If you like the TrackMan Wheel I highly recomend this one, it is top quality and functions flawlessly, as long as you dont want to rely on portability.  If you plan on carrying it with your laptop, I would recomend a different cordless mouse.
I got this to work with my Vista CX on my bike.  It does work, but only the bar clamp itself is needed for that model of GPS.  The Vista CX comes with a fitting to use with the stock battery-pack cover that is better than the one you get with this clamp.  I was warned that the replacement battery cover that comes with this will not allow space for the sd card, and since the GPS is useless without it, that's no good.  Also, the stock cover is rubberized to keep water out, which this one is not.  Don't use this battery cover, use the one that comes with the CX.  Maybe other models require this battery cover and don't interfere with the memory cards.So, the package costs more than it should for users with this gps.  I got a second one directly from Garmin for less, since it only had the clamp.  To be fair, though, this clamp puts the GPS futher forward on the bar than the other one I got, which keeps it out of the way of your knee when climbing out of the saddle.
If you have a newer Garmin eTrex GPS with a microSD slot, this bicycle mount will not work.  You need to buy the Garmin "rail mount adapter" instead.  That product is cheaper and comes in 2 different sizes to fit skinny handlebars (most mountain bikes) and fat handlebars (most road bikes).Garmin Rail Mount Adapter (010-10496-01)Garmin Large Diameter Rail Mount Adapter (010-10496-00)
I've been using an E-Trex for hiking, kayaking and biking pretty much since it came out, and I'm still pretty much enamored of it. This adapter certainly makes it easy to use the E-Trex on your bike, but I do have a few reservations about it.The adapter plate consists of a replacement for the battery compartment cover on the E-Trex and an adapter that clamps on to the handlebars with a screw. Remove the stock cover, slap on the replacement and it's ready to clip on the bike. If you intend on only using the E-Trex on your bike, this works pretty well. If you plan on using your E-Trex for more than one sport, you may be changing covers back and forth regularly, since the replacement cover doesn't fit easily in a shirt or PFD pocket,While the regular battery compartment cover seals via a rubber coating over the entire cover, the cover that comes with this adapter uses a skinny O-ring that's supposed to sit in a groove on the cover. The problem is that it pops out every time you remove the cover, whether to change batteries or just to switch covers. It's easy to drop the O-ring and it's a bit of a fussy job to get it back in the groove. Once sealed in, it seems waterproof enough.Since my main use for my E-Trex is kayaking, I finally decided to stick with the original cover and gave the adapter away to a friend. If you plan on using your E-Trex exclusively on a bike, though, this is definitely the way to go.
I bought this as a replacement for an older model of this item.  This one is improved in terms of the design.  The sides and bottom are stitched more "squared off", so it feels less bulky to hold.  The one one was sort of roundish when the unit was inside, which made it bulky.  It's still bulky compared to nothing, but the construction is better on this model.  They also improved the screen cover part.  Before, the screen would be slightly obstructed by the cover, but this model has a bigger area for the screen.However, some of the same problems persist.  To me, a snug fit is nice, but it's actually somewhat difficult to slide the unit into this.  And repeated times going in and out can loosen the protective rubber sides of the actual Garmin unit.  This happened with my previous case, and I've actually had to reglue the rubber on the unit.  Also, the case comes very close to the small multi-directional button on the face of the unit.  It's harder to use this button with the case coming so close to it.  The case should probably have a larger cut-out area which leaves the button slightly more free to move.  Lastly, I had to replace my old one because the stitching in the leather cover on the belt clip came undone.  I did get a lot of use out of it, and the product is inexpensive, so it's not THAT big a deal.  But I'll have to keep an eye on this for a similar problemOverall, having this is better than nothing, even if it's not the greatest carrying case.EDIT:  I just had to buy my 3rd one (August 2013) since owning the GPS unit (2010).  The problem is the stitching comes undone too easily on the clip, with repeated clips and unclips to a strap on my backpack.  The strap is woven nylon, so it's a typical material one would think this would clip to, but after a year or so of clipping and unclipping to my bag, the stitching breaks and it makes the thing darn near impossible to use.  For the price, it's ok, but it's not great quality.
Garmin eTrex case is a nice neoprene case providing a little protection for any eTrex handheld GPS, but not a necessary case.  It provides some protection for the screen, but at the same time making the screen more difficult to read when the unit is wet.  It does not provide its own tether, relying on the tether attached to the eTrex, which must be threaded through a small hole in the case.  But I still think it is worth getting just to give your eTrex a little extra protection.
First off, this case should be included in the cost of the eTrex ... having to pay extra strikes me as wrong!That said, this case is okay. I took it hiking with me, and while it protected my eTrex, I don't trust the case to hold the unit safely. The velcro connects the top flap behind the eTrex. The eTrex fits in fairly snugly ... almost too much so. I could see the eTrex sliding out of the case on the trail, and me hiking off leaving my costly unit behind.Would I buy it again? Yes, if only to avoid the hassle of searching for a better case.I'll use the case, but always carry it in my pocket ... just to be safe.
This mouse is convenient, but not as accurate as my old-fashioned mechanical ball mouse.  Sometimes it detects movement when my hand is not on the mouse... strange.The price was the hook.  But you might want to look at other newer models.
First, I admit I'm a fan of Microsoft mouses.  But I'm not closed-minded, and do have in my possesion the Logitech Mouse Pro Traveler mini-mouse which I carry with my Fujitsu notebook.I got the Wheel Mouse Optical Blue as a gift from my ex-employer as a pink-slip present.  OK, I'd rather keep the job, but what the heck, I don't decline freebies.The Wheel Mouse is nice and stylish, and is pure plug-n-play on Windows XP.  You don't need to install the software, although I imagine the Logitech software gives you some customization functions.  I never bother with customizing my mouses anyway; just stick with the one-click, one-shortcut-menu, and scroll-up-and-down basic functions.So the Wheel Mouse works very well on any surface; just don't try it on glass since it won't pick up reflection right.  Its cool blue color turns heads at Starbucks.  But I'm not all happy with its ergonomics; like many other Logitech mouses, including my prized Mouse Pro Traveler, your hand will get tired after about 15 minutes of use.  Of course, your actual mileage can vary, but the point is, Microsoft mouses are still more comfortable, especially for people like me with large hands.
A simple mouse that is optical and slightly more money than it's worth.  There is nothing exceptional about this which makes it more compelling than the seven-dollar generics at the computer store, except perhaps for the Logitech logo sticker.  I am obsessed with the Logitech logo sticker.  It's rubbery and I'm always picking at it for no apparent reason.  The case of the mouse is made of that slippery matte finish and slips out of my hands probably because the mouse isn't for normal adult male-sized hands.If you can get it for seven bucks like the knock-offs, go for it.  Definitely not worth twenty dollars.And what's with the very thin cable?
This is a nice mouse, but I find it jerky when used a certain wood grained surface.  I think my desk surface has a wood grain pattern that is difficult for the sensor to adapt to.  But the Microsoft optical mice work perfectly on this same desktop.  Other than that, this is a good product.
This probably depends a lot on your paint type but mine kind of comes &#34;unstuck&#34; sometimes. I think it might be when I am messing with the cords and give it a little tug on accident. It definitely isn't a very firm hold on my walls. It looks nice though and I painted it the same color as my wall so &#34;hides&#34; nicely.
These held my wires together perfectly, but as soon as I moved and had to take them off, it was extremely hard.Not to mention that I ripped off a chunks of paint along with some of the wall due to the adhesive.
This is like my 4th eyecup for my Canon 5D mkII. The eyecup just slides off too easily and later you pick up your camera and it is gone. Thinking about putting some rubber cement or something to hold it in place but not be permanent.
3 stars since this part should not have to exist!  easy to bump off while carrying your camera which is waht happened to mine...
(See updated notes at bottom!)First off, awesome idea!Unfortunately, the idea wasn't perfected.Getting your camera off the flash has gotten MUCH easier over the years - wireless triggers, ETTL cables, hotshoe-slaves, PC-Sync cables, you name it.The problem is getting that flash to carry ETTL wirelessly. So far only a few transmitters do it, and they're all VERY expensive (requiring not only a transmitter, but also a receiver for each flash). That's where this little guy steps in.The STE2 pops in your hotshoe and wirelessly triggers your Canon flashes (with slaves). The first problem here, is the "Canon" part - unlike the other options which work with ANY brand of flash, this one works with the Canon system. If you only own Canon flashes, no problem! If you own a mix, you've got a problem (the Canon's don't come cheap!)The next problem is that it's line of sight based. This means it has to be able to "see" the other flashes. Not so much of a problem indoors (it'll bounce off walls and generally hit the flash), but outdoors you'll have issues. Sunlight, especially, causes signal loss and (especially using multiple flashes) it's not something you want to have to rely on (you'll spend time either trying to correct it, making sacrifices or not notice that half your flashes didn't fire (which would be too late)).If you already own a Master/Slave flash (like some canon 580EXII's), try that on wireless mode to see how well it works outdoors, that should give you an idea of what to expect from this. Unfortunately, with it being unreliable, I just can't recommend it for anyone planning to use it outdoors. Indoors, you should be fine, but is it the option you need or would a cheap transmitter or sync cable do the same job for you?Next problem is the battery - for some odd reason I can't understand, they decided to use non-standard batteries. No AA or 9V here, we've got a "2CR5" here. Have a bunch of these lying around? Chances are you don't, and  you'll want spares for when you need to replace it!One very cool thing about it is that it has Focus Assist - that's the little red pattern that the canon flashes use to help you focus in low-light situations. If you don't need to use the flash, you can still use this thing to help focus in darker locations without needing to mount a high-flash on top. I know I've used my 580EXII as a focus-assist tool (not using the flash output), so having this (much smaller) option is very nice. The question is, is it worth the asking price? For me, I say no. For you, maybe it is.There are much better options out there - if you just need wireless, pick up a transmitter/receiver combo for 1/10th the price of this. If you need ETTL, spend 1.5x the price of this and get one of the new pocketwizards and a receiver - the extra range (and not having to fight with getting a line-of-sight) is worth it in the long run.--UPDATE 11/15/2010A 3rd party manufacturer, Yongnuo, has since released their version of the ST-E2 transmitter. Costing a bit less than the Canon model, it's nearly identical but with some improvements (including longer range (Autofocus assist beam and transmitter beam, ability to swivel left/right, runs of 2 AA batteries). While still not perfect, the Yongnuo version is a considerable improvement and one I can actually recommend if you're using ETTL!
Well I was very apprehensive about buying this item as it was overpriced, typical Canon sales.I was very surprised with the unit, (make sure you buy a 2CR5 battery)The unit is very easy to control, you set the flash to slave and attach the ST-E2 to the camera hot shoe and lock it into position, switch the unit on and you are now ready to use the unit.I wish I had bought one at the same time as my 580ex flash, I have been using the Canon OC-E2 off camera shoe cord for a while and have recently hacked it so I can extend the flash a distance of 50ft.The ST-E2 wireless transmitter frees you of the hassle of cables and it is great indoors with off camera flash per the Strobist techniques,outdoors might be a slight problem with distance and depending on how bright the day is when trying to use it, radio poppers or the pocket wizards are probably the way to go, but with the Canon ST-E2 you do retain full E-TTL.If you are requiring further distances and already have this product then Radio poppers would compliment this however they are more expensive than Pocket wizards but they do retain the full Canon E-TTL system.I wish Canon would come out with an updated model to this so that it would be a radio trigger and not optical.At least with pocket wizards and the correct cords you can trigger the camera remotely or the flash if need be.If you're on a tight budget then go with pocket wizards straight away as the system is expandable, They are more expensive than this unit, but you're not limited to one brand of flash either, a lot of photographers are using the Vivitar 285HV brand of flashes with pocket wizards and are getting great results.Hope this review helpsUpdate, I now own Pocket Wizard Flex TT5's and Canon 7DThe ST-E2 is no longer required.
I'm not impressed for several reasons:1) The build quality is poor... feels more like a toy compared with the flashes2) The thing didn't come with a battery, and uses an obscure battery type3) There is no sealing or locking mechanism for the hot shoe... you'll put it on a $250 flash, but not a $250 transmitter?4) No second curtain control... this is a big boooo to canon in general, who has turned their back on pro strobists and advanced hobbyists alike.Not sure I'm going to keep it, rather than spend $55 on a 30 foot ebay OCE3 cable that will maintain my rear curtain and doesn't need line of sight...Come on, Canon... get with the game.
This a good looking bag and well made.  Beyond that it is a joke.  In the discription it states that it will hold two bodies and six lens.  This I would love to see.  I was just able to house my 5d with a 24=105 attached.  Had to remove walls and lay the camera down.  My 70-200 would not stand up and again it had to lay down.  My flash unit has to be laid on top of the 70-200. The room that was left houses cf cards, batteries and remote control.There is no room what so ever for my 100-400 lens.  The bag really should be higher in order to stand up long lens.Another bag that doesn't do the job.So if you have one body and all short lens this may be the bag for you.
This bag is pretty nice quality and the front clip is great (love that it is metal not plastic) but it is too small, and just will not fit more than 1 lens comfortably.I ended up returning it for the slightly bigger amazon brand, but I think the build quality on this bag is much better, it just doesn't fit things as well.
just big enough for a body with lens 85mm and shorter, the charger, extra CF cards, and that's about it. A basic great grab and go bag that will not attract attention on the street (much) but gets the job done. Still, kinda smallish so get a full size bag to carry your whole set up. THis has good padding to protect your stuff, but it is kind of a tight fit. Good for the guy on the go, though
Good product and solid build quality. Looks very good.  Wanted to really keep it and tried hard to accomodate my Canon EOS 7D with EFS 17-55mm, f/2.8 attached. If you take the lens apart from the body - you can store both...but not attached. Plus not enough room left to store accessories (battery charger, cables, filters etc. Didn't fancy taking off the lens everytime..so had to return it and got the Canon Deluxe 200EG backpack instead.
I Prefer my Tamrac Explorer 1 DSLR bag - but to be fair, I got this Canon bag to hold a bunch a extras that i'd accumulated for my S3 IS and in that capacity it functions quite well.
This is a great bag, but the tag says you could put 1-2 camera bodies and 3-4 lenses. Maybe one OR the other! I used to store a Rebel XSi with the kit lens and the 55-250mm zoom, and it fit ok. Then I bought a 50mm f/1.8 lens, and managed to squeeze it in (it's such a small lens that it actually fits almost anywhere). After a while, I got a 10-22mm lens, and since I only put the lenses in the bag, and I carry the camera inside my backpack, without any protection, as all that gear doesn't fit inside the bag, as expected.The bag is very good, but it's small. If it actually held all the stuff it was supposed to, it certainly would get 5 stars.
I returned this camera bag shortly after I received it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. The product itself is perfectly fine and does as it describes. It may be a bit small, but is not advertised to be a large camera bag. This bag is great for carrying and storing your camera and one or two lenses, but that is about it.  What I was looking for was a bag that would allow me to easily access my camera and I found that in a different camera bag.
Can't understand why it doesn't work with the Canon 30D, but does with many other Canon cameras. There seems to be no wireless remotes for the 30D. It does work fine with the XT.
Worked fine until I dropped it. You'd think it could survive a four foot drop!
Pros:It really is wirelessCan be set to take the photo immediately or timedIt's small and includes a neck strap cover to attach to camera's neck strapI have heard this remote will work with the new Canon 5D Mark II (Will keep you posted when I find out)Cons:Range is pretty short, you must be closeMust be in front of camera to useMust point at camera to useMust set camera to timer mode to use (Note remote can release shutter immediately)Must wakeup camera manually before you can useCan change the exposure slightly in dark or night shotsMirror lockup mode will not work with remote!It works but...It works but I really have a problem with the several different unanticipated things that happen when you use it.  Please note all use of this remote testing and use was on a Canon Digital Rebel XTi camera using the included 18-55mm kit lens and a Canon 70-200mm 2.8 Lens on a tripod in RAW mode at ISO 100 your results may vary.Overview:I bought this remote to trip the shutter while taking photos of birds at my bird feeder without being next to the camera and to trip the shutter when shooting fireworks and taking Astrophotography (photos of the night sky, moon and stars etc.)  Having to be in front of the camera to take a photo is one of the biggest problems I have.  I BOUGHT this so I could be behind the camera and away from the birds so I would not scare them.  Why didn't Canon put a sensor on the back of the camera??  Or make this a radio controlled sensor?Self-timer mode to use:The other problem is having to put the camera in timer mode to use it.  After you put the camera in timer mode and you are using the remote on immediate exposure mode it will indeed take the photo when you press the button.  HOWEVER, if you are in the timer mode and you happen to be up next to the camera and see a bird at the feeder and press the camera's shutter button you will rudely find that the camera is in timer mode and will not take the photo for 10 seconds!  You have to use the remote to get an immediate exposure.Sleep mode:Also, if you wait too long to take the shot, the camera will go back into sleep mode.  Guess WHAT?  You can't wake up the camera using the remote.  You have to walk up to the camera, scare all the birds away press the cameras shutter button to wake up the camera then the remote is active again.Use a mirror:I did find a round about way to take exposures of the birds from behind the camera by propping a mirror up in front of the camera and aimed back at the camera.  The remote signal would bounce off the mirror and back and the camera and work.Low Light Astrophotography etc:Another problem is photography in low light conditions.  The exposure is OK in bright light, but, when using the remote in the dark while the camera is on a tripod I have found the illumination from the remote is bright enough to affect the camera meter and therefore underexpose what you are taking a photo of when shooting Astrophotography etc..  Therefore I am going to have to either return this wireless remote and purchase the wired remote or keep this remote for self portraits and also buy a wired remote.  Please note you can't see the light from the remote but the camera's meter must be able to.Self portraits:I thought this was were the little remote would shine, but guess what?  You have to point the stupid thing at the camera for it to work!!  You look a little weird in a self portrait holding this little remote in your hand and trying to point it at the camera without being conspicuous.  I think it's actually better to use the camera's built in timer.Low light photography exposure:I thought I could use this remote to trigger my photos when I use the mirror lockup function so the camera would not shake.  Guess what??  The mirror lockup mode does not work when using the REMOTE!  When you trigger the camera using the remote it takes a photo normally with the exposure happening immediately after the mirror goes up causing the image to blur anyway.10-24-2008 Update:I have a new Canon 5D Mark II on order and I heard that it can use this remote.  That probably means that the new 60D when it comes out will be able to use this remote.  Will let you know when I get the 5D Mark II if this is so.
This infrared switch requires no setup on supported cameras, but is only usable at limited angles, and unlike the shutter on the body, does not reset the camera's countdown to standby mode.On myRebel T1i, the only setup was switching the camera to "self-timer/remote" shooting mode, and setting a switch on the remote to either "immediate" or "2-sec delay".Unfortunately the placement of the receiver, and the size of my lenses, makes it such that there's a very small arc within which the remote will trigger the shutter on the first try.  I'd normally position the camera at some kind of angle (rather than head-on) on a tripod mount, so the lens further blocks the receiver on the camera, making the usable angle even smaller.  I usually ended up waving my hand around and having to press the button a half-dozen times per pose before finding an angle that worked. As such, I can't effectively use the 2-second-delay mode since I'm not sure if a single button press has actually registered.Worse than the limited angle is that the remote trigger won't act like the shutter-release on the camera.  That is, the remote doesn't wake the camera from sleep-mode, and doesn't seem to reset the inactivity timer, like using the shutter-release does.  I could turn off sleep mode while using the switch, but that's something else to remember to do (and to reset again later, lest the battery drain off unnecessarily).  Since this remote is officially supported on this camera-body, it seems an oversight and a major inconvenience to not have it at least be able to wake the camera.This remote switch is a good idea, but its design limitations make it useful very few circumstances.  I'll keep this remote in my kit, but will try out thewired remote switchwith an extension cable as an alternative...
I purchased this as a gift for Christmas but I tried it out to make sure it worked correctly before wrapping it. I am not overly impressed although it works well in front of the camera not that great as a remote trigger to prevent shake on a tripod when you are behind the camera.
I've used this switch and found that it does not always work. I haven't figured out what caused it to miss, but I usually keep firing until it trips the camera. It's okay for the price.
Works as designed, functional and light weight.  Provides good control for a wired device and is easy to carry around.
This switch is great for photos with high zoom or long exposures...just pressing on the shutter can move the camera and make the image blur.Unfortunately it does not start or stop video recording in video mode with the SX50 and of course  there is no zoom control....this camera really needs a remote for zoom control because just touching the control makes the camera shake.
its almost useless with how short the cord is! works fine but cord is soooo short. if it was longer i would give 5 stars
I'm sure everybody's review mentions this aspect, but the cord doesn't let you walk far enough away. I've used it for simple marketing-style shots, and I wish I could keep the remote in my hand while moving and adjusting product.Another side note: I have a T3i, so when I use the remote to focus, all it will do is focus on the middle of the screen. That's fine, if your subject is in the middle of your shot... but I found myself constantly moving the focus point, and standing next to the camera to take a photo. Having the aperture wide open made this very necessary.Other than that, this product does what it says: press lightly to focus, press firmly to snap a shot, hold and slide the button to keep the shutter open.
This is not as bad as some accessories but still, $23.00 for plastic is bad.It does the job and works fine. Cord is too short for my liking - YMMV.
Well the first part of the title for this product is true $25 for this is a rip off.It is the size of a bic lighter and about a well made, for this it gets three stars max. I have not used it yet but even if it works $25 for this? I was forworned by other reviewers but I was to gun shy to make my own, their are many post on the www on how to do it your self and save some coin you can put towards one of their $1,500 len.So this is another one of those situations where canon rips you off.so it goes, you need a cable release if you use a tripod.PS chicks are never free.... ever
This is a nice, well-made, durable backpack.It just arrived today and I immediately stuffed it with my Nikon D50 SLR, with an 18-55mm lens attached and 2 additional lenses. It was a VERY tight squeeze getting this little bit of gear into the backpack. The bag is bulging at the sides making it a bit of a pain to zip up. If I had it to do over, I would probably opt for something larger than this backpack but for what it is, and the price, it'll do. The good thing about it is that the space constraints can be somewhat alleviated by purchasing attachable lens cases such as the MX5378 and MX5375.
I originally purchased the standard Nikon bag which by the way holds nothing and quickly found out that I needed something a bit larger and could carry more than just the camera.  While I was a little disappointed with the bag at first i think it is just what i need at this point in photog life.  The picture from the manufacturer is a bit misleading.  Bottom line, it won't hold a lot of stuff but thats not to say it's too small.  Here is a list of my pros and cons:Pros:1. Scalability.  The M.A.S. and S.A.S. attachments are where this bag excels at.  While it won't hold everything at first it can definitely grow as you collection does.2. Rain flap.  This flap is not as cumbersome as some would have you believe.  It can get in the way but that is why we have two hands and opposing thumbs.....just move it over.3. Configurable inside and out.  You can move the dividers around to suit your needs and there are more straps on the outside to attach things than Carter has peanuts.4. Well cushioned which means your prized possessions are in good hands.5. Well constructed.  Stitching is great and no signs of it going to wear out in the forseeable future.Cons:1. The pockets in the front flap are almost laughable.  They won't hold much but thats not to say they can't hold what they were intended to, pen cleaner, maybe a notepad, extra batteries, a usb cable, and some memory cards.2. Super long shoulder straps.  I have no idea who is expected to carry this thing but the straps could have been a bit shorter.  BTW they do adjust....I'm just griping. :)All in all, this is a good little bag that can grow as your collection does and is perfect for the photog that needs more than just a camera bag.
This is a nice camera bag and has a great deal of storage capabilities. You have the ability to store many things and it easily customized to accommodate a diverse array of lens/camera body collections. This is an undeniable fact but is it a so-called "pro" bag? I sure doesn't seem like it to me.First of all, It simply isn't convenient and in the field can be frustratingly difficult to get gear out in a hurry. For instance, the shoulder straps interfere when you try to remove the locks that allow the top flap to be opened. Using only the front straps seem like it would be a good option but not if you have any weight in the bag.While the bag is probably great for DX bodies and kit lenses, if fails when it comes to the larger FX bodies and professional level lenses. I use a D800 and a D800E for my work and I require my 14-24mm f/2.8G, 24-70mm f/2.8G and a combination of either 28mm f/1.8G , 50mm f/1.8G or 85 f/1/.8G or 105mm f/2.8G micro, and unfortunately I cannot fit my entire combo in the bag at the same time. I work around this by keeping one of the bodies and lens out of the bag and only use the bag for lens changes and for other gear items. Not perfect but a workable situation, for sureEven though the bag does not hold nearly as much gear as I hoped nor does it allow the ease of access I had hoped it would, it does a good job of keeping a huge amount of non-lens/camera items well organized and are all somewhat easily accessed.If I wasn't so busy and really needed a bag for my work, I probably would have sent this back and tried another option. However, the time has passed and I'm trying to figure out a work around that will allow me to get the most out of this bag.
Have had this lens about 4 days. I have extensively tested it out. This is a well made lens with a nice feel to it. It has a wonderful review on Photozone and by reviewers on Amazon. It takes excellent pictures on both crop & full frame camera bodies.However I found close focusing, macro photography,  literally impossible unless a tripod was used. A monopod improved focusing but it was still not tack sharp. I found the 100mm focal length, actually 160mm on a 1.6 T3i crop body, to be difficult to hold steady without a monopod. The autofocus also gave me a lot of problems indoors. The lens focusing just seems to jam in low light situations. It gets stuck and the only way to release it is to point it long distance. This has happened on several occasions and really is very annoying.Like i said before, this lens has great reviews on Photozone, and other professional photographic sites, but it is just not working for me. My (EF 70-300 f/4-5.6 -"IS" lens)  is slightly heavier but it took better indoor and outdoor pictures than this EF 100mm Macro 2.8. I could not believe it when I compared the pictures.Will test it out a little longer for macro purposes. If things do not improve I will be returning it to Amazon as being defective due to autofocus jamming. Just a real diappointment.  It is possible that mine might be just a bad copy or maybe the autofocus technology is still lagging in this area of photography?Update: 7/21/12 -  After nearly 2 weeks of using this lens I decided to return it as I just could not tolerate the jamming on autofocus and lack of IS.It is however a well built and excellent lens for those who love spending hours doing macro work with a tripod and manual focusing. Autofocus however needs to vastly be improved in this area of photography.I gave it a 3 because I find autofocus for MACRO SHOOTING useless. I also find the F/2.8-100mm focal lens, 160mm on 1.6 crop frame body, very difficult to hold steady without IS.
I have had version 11 and sold it due to a soft right edge. Purchased used the original version 1 with the flower designation and it is better. This lens is fine on the apc crop cameras ie; rebels,10d-7d models but corners and contrast are weak on the 5d. I compared this lens under different conditions to the Tamron 24-135mm and Tamron xr 28-200 and the Tamrons have better resolution to the corners and superior contrast and detail. The best setting for this lens on the 5d is at 50mm.  It focuses quick and accurate so it's just an ok lens.
I have used three different in-ear headphones: MX-400, Koss "The Plug," and Shure 2c. Shure 2c is in a different price league and is noticeably better in sound and build quality. Between MX-400 and Koss "The Plug" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00081A2DQ/sr=1-2/qid=1134499532/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-9512091-3435233?%5Fencoding=UTF8), I would much prefer "The Plug" with the mod described on [...] With the mod, "The Plug" becomes a very comfortable sound isolating in-ear monitor. The sound quality, especially the low end, is much better represented than MX-400. The thin foam covers of the MX-400 is another problem. They easily fall off and break. Unless you are willing to pay for Shure 2c, go for the Koss earbud with the easy mod.
...but they're okay. As a matter of fact, I'm not what you'd consider an audiophile. Although I wasn't totally dissappointed with these, I ended up getting the MDR-J10.SOUND QUALITY: While the sound of these are better than some similar priced earbuds, the sound is just okay. The MDR-J10 from Sony in my opinion has a fuller bass, though not clear treble that the MX400's have. I have to turn up the bass on my player all the way up to get the bass out of the MX400, and it distorts a lot at high volume. If you dislike the sound of these, I'd highly recommend trying some Fontopia's or the h.ear from Sony.DURABILITY: These seem to be pretty durable. The plastic is pretty tough, but I wouldn't be suprised if they cracked or something.PORTABILITY: They're earbuds. Nuff' said.COST: For the sound, I think these are a little overpriced, and should be around the $5-$8 range rather than the $10-$15 range. The treble is clear, but the bass...the headphones free with my $5 cassette player had more bass.OVERALL: Get something else for a better sounding experience.
Even the "you get what you pay for" posts might admit that the MX-500 may be the best inexpensive earbud product out there. With a full high range, a surprisingly rich middle, and satisfactory lows, the sound actually eclipses the iPod earbuds. (In fact, some feel getting these as a replacement is a "no-brainer."At this price, one shouldn't of course expect stereophile quality; I love the trebly sound, but I have to confess that the sound can get a bit fatiguing. Also (as noted elsewhere), the cord is rather short, and the buds tend to get dislodged rather easily.All in all, the MX-500 offers a superior value for a cheapie earbud, but it won't convince you that your earbud upgrade path is done quite yet.
I had read a lot about these, but when I finally got them I was a little disappointed as they were not that great.  Ended up replacing them with a pair of CX300s for airplane trips and PX100s for home use.  The latter are way superior to anything I have used with my iPod ever!!!But I do like the case!!!
Very clear sound but like all the earbuds I've tried theyhave very little bass response, they also are a little too largeto fit in my ear for long, after 30 mins they become uncomfortable.I have the same problem with the Creative Labs buds too.
I don't really have an opinion about the sound quality of these ear buds.  They were so uncomfortable that I tossed them in the "Box of Misfit Toys" after an hour of very uncomfortabe listening.  The ear piece is the same basic design as the default Apple earbuds, but they feel larger in the ear.
The Sennheiser MX500 Lightweight In-Ear Headphone (Blue) with Carrying Case product is OK. They sound decent but the case is a bit difficult to use, however I can see how some people might want it to prevent the cable from getting tangled. The earbuds are not very comfortable (foam pads) compared to today's gel over-mold pads (in 3 sizes) which provide more comfort, a better fit... thus giving a more isolated sound.
This review is for the Sennheiser MX-500 Stereo In-Ear Headphones (Blue) when used with a Dell laptop (Crystal WDM Audio). I disagree with a lot of folks who have compared these decent earbuds with dis-similar products. I did a comparison with a pair of Panasonic RP-HC50 earbuds my pal had and the Sennheiser won.PROS: Frequency response is excellent (18Hz-25000Hz) for a variety of music. There is no manipulation to the sound and you hear the original notes with the same treble and bass.CONS: Bass could have been a little more improved. Some distortion in lower frequency ranges, but only noticeable in very clear (and high bitrate) audio files. Higher frequencies tend to produce a slight hiss, again mostly noted in high bit-rate audio files.Overall good buds at a slight premium (20%).
