I bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the TV based on our viewing angle.  In order to move it I had to loosed the screws each and every time.  I had it connected to a 27in vizio LCD which is pretty light.  Could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it.  Had to return
Have no idea why people love this thing so much, you can't load any applications unless they are from the Barnes & Noble store and you can't even download the free version of Angry Birds.Apparently Barnes & Noble is worse than Apple at remotely disabling Nooks they deemed rooted by end users. You have less control of this thing than you would your TV.The root kits are useless for this OS version 1.4.2 and the instructions to root / jailbreak it read worse than rocket instructions from annoying geeks !It is an overpriced Barnes & Noble franchise in your dumb little hands and you're well served keeping your receipt and refunding it.
If all you want is a tablet for reading B&N; books and periodicals and maybe playing the occasional cheesy game, this is for you.  Otherwise, pass.This is listed as an Android tablet but it's not.  It's Android on the surface but it can't access Google Play and instead uses the B&N; app store.  This means paying for apps that are free elsewhere.Also, my unit takes an incredibly slow 2 minutes to boot, drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a 90s drug store computer.Wonder where the camera is?  It's at the factory -- there isn't one.  Forget Skype or face to face video chatting.Spend your $200 on a real tablet.By the way, not a slap at Amazon, just the tablet itself.
The customer support people at Barnes & Noble site are clueless. They are useless for providing help. If you buy tablet, you are on your own. In the store it is the same.
I've owned this original Nook for two years now and have read dozens of books on it.  I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N;'s concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N; when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N; account with the new address and new B&N; password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.So, if you're into "going green", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.  If all you want to do is read, forget the Nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading.  Give the price of the Nook to a local charity.  Everyone will be happier.
This is a pretty nice looking toy but useless for any real application. No matter how hard I try I just can't force myself to try and read a book on the little 3" by 5" screen. The display is small, dim and has poor contrast so it's hard to read unless it's in bright sunlight and pictures on a page are too small to see clearly. It won't play very many types of books besides pdf files and Kindle books are not compatible. Also it goes to sleep if you don't keep constantly moving your finger around on it. Also it's supposed to be able to browse the web but the Web function doesn't do anything but show a Picture of a web page that talks about it's features but if that did work it would be useless since there's no mouse and no way to move around on the page. It can play MP3's that sound ok but it's 100's of times bigger than an iPod and too large to carry around.
Yesterday I spent over an hour playing with a real Nookcolor at my local B&N;, where I've befriended the staff as I go there almost every day as an unemployed.  Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.
Bought two of these for my daughters and they both have issues when reading books. The pages jump after a few minutes of reading and the menu screens pop up and down constantly. Power off and on to resolve but it keeps happening. I'm returning these today and getting a Kindle. Oh yeah and it locks up totally every so often and again you have to power it down, very disappointed. Barnes and noble support is terrible
I purchased a NOOKcolor a couple of months after it came out.  Within a week I had to return it because it would not charge.  A lot of hassle was required to get a replacement and it took a couple of weeks to get to me.  Once I got it set up I used it about 7 times and it locked up on the home page.  It took 2 days of conversing with a tech before they finally decided to send me another replacement.  I received my 3rd one and it lasted exactly 43 hours.  Screen went black and the lower right corner heated up to the point it was too hot to hold.  This time they were nicer about agreeing to send me a replacement.  The 4th one is sitting, unopened, in a box in front of me.  Well, after having trouble with three of them I no longer feel I can trust this device to work consistently (unless you consider always breaking as a form of consistency!) and would like to get a complete refund.  So far B&N; (the site I bought it from) won't do that for me.Moral(s) of the story:1. Stick with a Kindle - I bought an early version of it and still love it.  And if you want color go wtih the Kindle Fire.2. Only buy products though Amazon since they are very lenient and curteous about returns.  (They weren't selling the NOOKcolor when I purchased mine.)It's now about a year later and I'm still trying to get my money back.  My plan is to take this unopened box, all receipts and emails to a nearby B&N; store and hope pleading in person will get me a full refund.Wish me luck!
Unboxed the Nook. Charged it up. Won't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will. And it won't work at all until you register it. Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue. I'm calling the B&N; tech people. If they can't fix it fast then this thing is going back. I didn't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook's technical problems. I have better things to do.Update: Customer service didn't help. Took it to Barnes & Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldn't look at it. I figured if the battery can't hold a charge for that long than I didn't want the device. The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping. This thing cost me time and money, a bad experience all  around. I'll never buy a B & N product again, certainly not from a third party seller.  I've ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony. Hopefully I'll have better luck
We bought one of these for my mother-in-law hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use. It has been nothing but a pain. Her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library. This requires a process that involves going through hoops, a computer, and an Adobe ID and software. Having experience with an Amazon Kindle (the very basic one) and iPads with library books, this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my in-laws. What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook. There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself. Otherwise, it is nothing but frustrating.
I bought this Nook Simple Touch on Amazon.com, but when I received it, the WiFi would not connect. I tried my home network as well as several WiFi hot spots around town. Barnes & Noble Customer Service was NO HELP, telling me that, since I did not purchase the Nook Simple Touch from B&N;, they could not help me, and suggesting that I needed to return it to the seller. I did return it, thinking it was damaged somehow, and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument (kudos to him and Amazon!).Later, I bought one from B&N;, and it had the same problem. Again, B&N; Customer Service was NO HELP, but did send a replacement. The replacement has the SAME PROBLEM and will NOT CONNECT to WiFi. Now, I'm arguing with B&N; for a full refund.Most of the reviews are glowing. But what they don't say is that B&N; has this WiFi connectivity problem very commonly with the Nook Simple Touch. Even the B&N; Forum has many references to the problem.I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem. Just beware.CAVEAT EMPTOR!
.Paid $[...] for this in April 2010.  Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with "free" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N; with their service and nook product.For those who think this is a good product.  You are fools who don't know enough to make a valid judgment.  I laugh at you, because your nook will be dead within a year.
Works but got rid of it because of the loud mechanical sounds from the internal gears -- squeaking, grinding, crunching sounds. Much worse than my previous Maxell adapter.  Poor manufacturing! Ordered the Philips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter for which the Amazon reviews about noise are much better (and it's a buck cheaper to boot).  Indeed, the Philips was very good.  Buy it. Don't buy the Maxell. You'll be happier.UPDATE to review: about a year after purchase, the Philips is making louder and louder noises.  I guess noise is endemic to these adapters.
As two previous posters have mentioned, there's a problem with this product -- there's no template readily available for their use. The packaging directs you to a Memorex site that is defunct. You can search and find a third-party program that promises it will do what you need, while also installing potentially harmful adware on your computer as well. I would not install it as it seemed unsafe. I tried contacting Memorex, but go no response. This left no real options for their use.I needed to print my inserts ASAP, though, and didn't have time to find something else so I divised a template of my own -- with trial and error, it worked, more or less. It was VERY time consuming, though. Memorex should pull this product off the shelves if they aren't going to legitimately support it.
I got this and the cobra Antenna. This thing does not pick up hardly anything I am not sure its even working. I can pick up the weather radio but everything else seems to be crap. I am sending this back NOT HAPPY. It's a good idea but it don't work
I would to have give this one star out of the box I could not get anything the weather channel came in great all the other channels not so much also would say get a outdoor Antenna that help a lot now I can hear some people on radio also the Cigarette Adapter is great the only problem I have is when I hit the gas on my truck I can hear my engine threw the CB speaker which lowers the  quality of the sound I have to shut my truck off so I can not hear my engine threw the CB speaker. I would not buy this CB at all not worth the money and pain the only good channel I found again was the weather channel...Very unhappy with this CB
Sure these headphones have memory foam eat plugs, but the back of the earphone has 6 holes in it allowing sound to pour right  in anyway! This completely nullifies any sound isolation gained by the earplug style ear buds! It provided absolutely no noise cancelation on my plane ride.  I had to hold my fingers over the 6 holes to block out the engine noise pouring in through the back of the ear bud.The next problem is in construction. I am a tall guy.  The little eat buds are too small for my ears, so I use the larger plugs included.  They are too long and the plastic tube they fit over is too short.  The foam extends well past the plastic support tube, allowing the tip of the earbud to be squished closed as it sits in your ear. As a result, sometimes you hear nothing.Finally, the plastic fitting of the ear bud, where the foam meats the housing of the ear bud, has a rough edge on it.  I found it scratching my ear and it eventually caused a small sore, after the 15 hour flight I was on...Other than that, the speakers provide fairly good sound.  If it weren't for all the other problems, I'd say these were good ear buds.  But, because of the several flaws, I wish it didn't cost so much to ship these back and get a refund.  As far as I am concerned, I wasted $10 on these...
I own a number of different Koss, Sennheiser, Sony and Grado products and I am extremely pleased with them all.  (I truly believe Grado is the best of the four companies but they don't make an In-Ear product.)These "Plugs" are good for nothing in my opinion unless one wants to go deaf, get a blistering headache and have ringing in the ears.  The distortion can only be described as a "sonic bass mudslide" that overwhelms and perverts all sounds coming through these "Plugs."  I am genuinely shocked that Koss would put their name to such a terrible product; perhaps these "Plugs" are designed for a younger generation that wants to be deaf by 25 while listening to the type of "boom boom" bass that rattles windows?  But these "Plugs" are the exact opposite of what an audiophile or anyone else who wants to just "listen" and "hear" his/her music, books, etc. through headphones.  Before the blistering eight hour headache these "Plugs" had given me was through, they were repackaged and shipment was arranged for a refund.  I've never been disgusted by a Koss product before but I feel that I write out my experience as a warning to others.  Audiophiles and music lovers, BEWARE!In terms of In-Ear headphones, I would recommend the updated version of "The Plug" known as "The Spark Plug."  It doesn't have as long of a cord but they haven't set my teeth on edge or caused headaches such as the one I received from "The Plug" and they do offer some passive noise reduction.  I also recommend the Sennheiser In-Ear headphones.  They are more expensive (in the 60-80 dollar range) but worth it if you have the money because Sennheiser does make a better product in my opinion than Koss these days.  The truth is that Sennheiser surpasses Koss on almost everything these days.If you don't like In-Ear headphones (and I'm not much of a fan of them myself with a few exceptions) and don't want to spend more than $[...], the Koss PortaPro, Sennheiser PX-100, PX-200 (awesome and blocks sound!), the iGrado, Grado SR60 (the best for pure sound!), Sony MDR-Q22LP (great little set!) and Koss KTXPRO1 are excellent alternatives that I believe are truly worth five to ten times what they cost.  I hope this was of some help.
these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever. i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to  have the best sounding headsets for this price range.
The sound of it is ok but, the fit is terrible after a while of use they starting to hurt and itching inside the canal ear.
When I plugged in my stereo headphones I got nothing.  I found I had to pull the plug out about half way and jiggle it around to make any contact.  Then I got mono sound.  Think someone installed the wrong jack during manufacture.  Got a different brand elsewhere that works fine.
I bought this volume control for sports activities. Big mistake, it lasted for less than three months, the cable connection to the volume control is broken. The potentiometer that adjusts the volume is a piece of crap too. Don't buy this product for sports use.
After less than a month of being attached to my laptop, the volume control started introducing static, and suddenly it was as if the control was turned all the way down, no matter what I did with the volume wheel.
The 'gold' plug on these earphones is slightly smaller than regulation which causes the right earphone to cut out on some devices.  I bought TWO of these puppies and they are both defective.  The problem does not show up until they have been used for some hours (weeks).
I used the Sennheiser PX-100 headphones (very similar in size, price, and style) almost daily for 2 years when one side crapped out. Drat. So I bought the Koss PortaPro's as a replacement.1. The Koss are not as attractive. Not that important to me.2. The Koss are not as comfortable. The metal head band is cheesy, when compared to the Sennheiser's, and they are only $10 more. The Koss are also a tad too tight. My ears burned (even when on the loosest setting) after about 2 hours.3. The BIG problem, and I toyed around with equalizer settings in WinAmp (my MP3 player software of choice), is that the Koss are incredibly easy to overdrive, even at relatively low listening levels. Not so the Sennheiser headphones. Had I noticed distortion with them, I would have chucked them long ago.Summary: If you want a light pair of on-ear, portable headphones, spend the extra $$ and get the Sennheiser PX-100 (or higher models). The Koss may be adequate for portable MP3 devices where you cannot adjust the EQ settings, but for more ambitious use, they are far too inadequate. I'm buying another pair of the Sennheiser's.
After many headphones I found these and they sound WONDERFUL!! the frequency response of 5 Hz - 30 kHz!!!!!!Unless you are going to spend many hundreds more for studio monitor headphones, don't hesitate purchasing these!!If purchasing for a very discerning ear these sound as good or better than the Bose line that costs twice as much.Bottom line is -- THESE DO NOT SUCK!!!!!But months later,.... NOW IT HAS A BUZZ IN THE RIGHT EAR AND I AM F___ED!!
The cable I received is not a Belkin cable.  It is a cheap no name cable. The picture is of a gray cable with the Belkin name molded in the plastic ends.  I received a cheap thin plain black cable in a clear plastic bag with the made in china sticker. It was sold by "marginmart inc" and fulfilled by amazon.  I feel I was lied to and ripped off.
The cable arrived today and I was surprised to find that it is an old-standard USB 1.1 extension cable.  That's why so many other reviewers found that it didn't work with their devices, since most current devices need USB 2.0 spec cables. I elected to return my cable to Amazon for a refund. They said no need to return it, they'll just give the refund.Moral: If a USB cable does not explicitly state that it is USB 2.0 (or USB 3.0) then it's probably a USB 1.1 cable that won't support most of today's peripherals.Note: I knew this already, but people should take note that a USB extension cable can only be used together with another USB cable, to extend the length of the connection. It's not suitable for directly connecting a device to your computer without that normal cable.
It doesn't say anywhere in the listing that I could find that this isn't USB 2.  My mistake for just assuming it was, I guess.  Still, I think they should make it obvious that it isn't 2, since that's pretty much the standard today.
They don't mention is clearly enough that this is not a gigabit switch, waste of my money since I missed the 30 day return window. It sat in the box for over a month since the project was delayed.
The power connector on my FS108 is very sensitive - try to shift the unit or move the power cord in any way and it goes into a fit, flashing all lights and all connected devices indicate they have lost their network connection. My friend reports the same problems with his. Mine is being relegated to the spares drawer as soon as I purchase a replacement - not another Netgear. A shame, it is otherwise a nice switch.
Junk, Only one ethernet port worked.  Tech support sucked.  Will stay away from net gear.  Purchased a china model for 10.00 cheaper and it works great.
I own the version of this switch back when Cisco wasn't a part of it. In fact the computer this is being typed on is hooked up to it. My setup: 50MB cable internet via a Motorola Surfboard fed to a router. That feeds a cable threaded through my basement to an old Netgear switch that died, hence the need for this new EZXS55W ver. 4.2 switch. At that point my network splits and feeds the OLD version of this switch and then to this computer.Until I bought this new EZXS55W switch, I was getting more than my promised 50mb download speeds all over my house. No issues at all. The internal network transfers were only slowed down by how fast the hard drives of various machines are. Then my old Netgear switch died, so I picked up this EZXS55W switch. Everything slowed to a crawl. Max downloads of 1.5mb per second. Streaming Netflix/Amazon Prime videos to my Sharp connected TV takes ages to load and it's always low quality. Network transfers are brutal. Took me a few days to realize what it was. SO I went out and bought another brand of switch, swapped it for the EZXS55W, and miracle of miracles, all my speeds went right back to normal.Again, my EZXS55W  says ver. 4.2 on it, I don't know if that's relevant. What I do know is this thing is a piece of junk. Avoid.
it came and it turned on and nothing hap-end - ran an ip check on the network and nothing - software program ip check in case they changed the interface ip - the program sees my isp router but not this thing
This is the worst router that I have ever had.  Continues to drop like crazy even with latest firmware from Linksys.  I ended up to throw it aside.
The Palm V is the second Palm Product that I have owned.  (After purchasing a Palm Pro and experiencing numerous problems, I upgraded to the V, hoping to salvage my large database of entered addresses.)  And, for the second time, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the Palm Products.  BOTH Palm devices displayed the same problems, specifically:  (1) after a few months of ownership, the screen response begins to fail, requiring almost daily recalibrations of the Digitizer;  (2) many attempted recalibrations of the digitizer simply fail, because the screen become SO far out of alignment, that the user can NOT enter necessary menu selections to even request a digitization;  (3) attempted Full Device Resets become impossible, since repeated Full Resets begin to no longer properly reset the device; (4) as the screen begins to fail, the ability to enter keystrokes in the Graffiti language begins to decrease, forcing a user to rely on the screen's slow and tiny &quot;QWERTY&quot; keyboard; and (5) the Operating system still lacks simple security, such as permitting a user to set the device to automatically power off with a password lock (if a user wants a security shut-down, a user has to step through several screen strokes in order to EXPLICITLY shut the device off with a password...no automated lock is available on power down).
I had this about a year and mysteriously nothing plugged into it worked. Thought I had blown a breaker. Finally figured out this thing just suddenly stopped working... no reset.. no on/off.. just stopped working. Seems to be a lot of this happening with this strip. Now I have to spend more money on a good one.
This item failed after one month of use.There seem to be two breakers in this item:The first one is tied to the "reset" button. This circuit is closest to the shared socket side.The second one is tied to the "on/off switch". This circuit is closest to the wall side.The on/off switch is still lit up.However, none of the devices are getting power. The Reset button is useless and does not work.This item will be returned.
I've used Monster surge protectors in the past and had no reason to complain but when put to the test, this one totally failed me. This is your basic surge protector strip, with right angle plug and color-coded plugs for various audio-visual components. But does it give them sufficient protection? Unfortunately it did not for me. I was using it for my Tivo-TV combination and a bad storm one day fried the hard drive in my Tivo. So dock a few stars for it failing to properly protect my device. So now I get to experience this Monster warranty process. Suffice to say, you will be lucky if you get anything out of them, or can fulfill the requirements and 3 pages of information they want you to send them. In my case, I have a Tivo DVD that no one within several hundred miles of me is "authorized" to repair as they require, and they require an inspection of the damaged equipment by such a technician prior to filing a claim. I have to order a replacement part on the internet, which they don't accept and they won't reimburse after the fact. You also have to pay to send the surge protector back to them for inspection as well, so basically you have to spend a significant amount of money to file a claim and may get absolutely nothing out of it. So basically, the warranty in a lot of cases is of little use and not worth the trouble they put you through versus just paying for repairs yourself. So you can dock another star or two for that. So while I like the design of this surge protector, I probably will go looking for another one that will properly protect my equipment at least.
This is the most overpriced item, I own several Monster power items, and their higher end units are great but this thing is worthless, you might as well get a no name brand.I had this thing one my 3rd TV and it fried out within 2 weeks, and none of the others did.
Can't use the item since it does not work with 220V power outlet (Europe standard power) and there's no any information about this incompatibility. I've bought it to power all my devices with US power plug using one US-EU connector, but when I switch that device on I just have a power outage in the room. Now I'm not sure if it is still working at all.
UPDATED REVIEW:Let me say - I'm not a knee-jerk reactionary who goes around trashing products for no good reason. In fact, I get a little annoyed when people post 1-star reviews because they happened to get a 1 in a 1000 bad copy.Well, sometimes enough is enough. I ordered two of these and one was DOA as described in my original review. Hey, these things happen, right? So Amazon (not Monster) sent me a replacement. It worked. Forgive and forget. Well, because they were such a good deal, I ordered a third one. Unfortunately, I did not have a need to open it up and use it until today. Guess what? Another screaming piece of junk. 2 out of 3 DOA!  And of course it's far too late to send this one back. Monster's credibility has gone right down the toilet in my opinion (although I did also buy one of the big component boxes for my stereo rack and it has performed admirably, but I'm done with their "power strip" models. 2 out of 3 defective units is just poor design and horrible quality control.So, there may be a reason the price of these has really fallen.Feel free to take a chance, you might get a deal, just make sure you test it as soon as you get it instead of sticking it in the closet like I did.ORIGINAL REVIEW (3.5 stars):Because of Monster's self-proclaimed reputation, it was a bit surprising to find that mine arrived DOA. In reading the reviews, it seems this is more common than it should be. After nearly killing myself on the horrible blister pack and hooking up all my equipment, I found that the alarm was always screaming when the unit was plugged in. It was NOT the electrical service in my house.It arrived on Saturday, so when I called their customer service number, naturally they were closed. So I took the easy way out and returned it to Amazon (AMAZING service. Reported on Saturday, UPS picked up the broken one on Monday, and new one was delivered on Tuesday. No hassle. Thanks, Amazon!) New one seems to work fine.Does it improve the video and sound quality of my (all digital) home theater? Who knows. I don't want to get into that debate, but I do feel you'd have to have very high end equipment and ears to match, or have especially dirty electrical lines, or do a lot of analog in order to definitively tell.I wouldn't come close to paying MSRP, but at the fantastic price Amazon is selling these for, who cares? It's a nifty little device that offers a little extra peace of mind for only a couple of bucks more than a generic surge protected power strip.Note that it also protects your phone line (mine's VOIP, so it might not matter) and TV/Satellite cable. It includes a set of Monster cables for each (a claimed $27 value. I think it's an actual value of less than half that, but still, the cables alone make up for the price difference between this and an imitation power strip.) The stickers they give you for labeling your power cords is a nice touch too.Note: neither of the two I received was blue, as in the photo. It's dark on the bottom, and an odd halfway between gold and silver on the top. I would have slightly preferred the blue, but it's hiding behind the AV rack anyway.I'm docking them a star because of the first piece of junk they sent, and I can't scientifically attest to the quality of the results, but based on their claims, the extra peace of mind, bonus cables, and low price, this is a great deal. I'm going to buy a few more.
I bought this device at least six or seven years ago.  I should have shorted the crap out of Palm when I had a chance.  When the batteries (two AAA) are drained, you will lose all your data in the device!!!  Not only that, the lack of back light makes it difficult to read in an airplane, a dark conference room or in a dark restaurant.This device along with a very nice leather case will be donated to charity.
These binoculars look good and feel good, but the pair I received performed abysmally.  They have been returned for a refund.  There are too many alternatives out there to mess with a manufacturer who apparently doesn't test what comes off the assembly line.  My pair had exactly the same problem reported in the other negative review; namely, a doubled image.  I had no problem getting both sides simultaneously in focus, with good clarity on both sides, but no amount of additional fiddling with the binoculars would eliminate the doubled image.  Such an inexcusable alignment error represents either lack of testing of the finished product, poor design, or poor internal construction.  Over the years I've owned a number of binoculars from other manufacturers and none had this kind of problem.  Since the binoculars I received can only be used as a monocular, one star is as good a rating as they merit.
I had a similar-design pair of decent binoculars years ago (Nikons, I think), which were, of course, more expensive.  I was expecting these to be as small as those were.  These are smallish but definitely not pocketable in a shirt.  I was hoping to give them to a friend as an improvement on opera glasses but they are way too big and only marginally better optically.The optical quality is about what you'd expect for $20 or so. The eyepoint is awkward, there's a bright ring of light around the image, and there just isn't any sharpness except in the very middle of the image.  Flare characteristics are terrible. But if I were 10 years old I'd think they were pretty cool.  They look reasonably tough, as long as you keep them dry.If you want something small to really look at things try to get something at the lower end of the price scale of the name brands (Nikon Canon Vortex Olympus Pentax)I'm going to keep these in my car's trunk, just in case I'm desperate.
I returned this! I could not adjust it all. Maybe its me, but I couldnt see anything magnified, especially at night.And there weren't any instructions either..
Not having done my homework, and knowing nothing about binoculars, I mistakenly expected a higher magnification to be better - not! Using these 16 x 32 binoculars is like viewing through lenses held by someone with Parkinson's Disease - very shaky! I kept checking my hands - which didn't feel shaky at all - to make sure they weren't actually shaking, and they weren't. Later I read that binoculars with higher magnification produce very shaky images unless the binoculars are held still as with a tripod.Worse, you have to constantly adjust these if you try to view to the  left, right, towards you, or farther away. In short, a pain in the butt. I get eye strain and headaches after just a minute or 2 of using these. A waste of money. No, I won't buy a tripod; I bought these because they were cheap and because I didn't want to spend much money for the limited viewing I'd be (hopefully) doing. I ordered a pair of 10 x 50, and will see how they work out....
Apparently I am a slow learner in that by this stage of my life, I should have long since learned that you get what you pay for.  Based on some great reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase a pair of these binoculars.As I lifted them out of the case, a plate that covers the bottom of the focuser immediately dropped to the floor.  I assumed that it was something that snapped into place, but alas, it is apparently (supposed to be) glued into place.  Close inspection of the eyepieces revealed uneven fitting between the lens holders and rubber that surrounds them.  Amazingly, they came with no eye piece covers and the thin string that apparently is made to place over your head is a joke - I'm sure that will last only a few sessions.  I did not find the right eyepiece particularly easy to focus and I might add that you had better be prepared to rest these on something if you want an image that you can comfortably view.I found the instructions to be less than adequate.  Probably appropriately, the English version is the 5th set of instructions.  They are written with a microscopic font and are generic in nature not referring to these specific binoculars.  Come on Bushnell, you have been in business long enough to break the code on producing good optical devices.  You failed with this one!I would return them, but for the price it is not worth my time or effort.  It will make good junk drawer fodder.
These binoculars are terrible in my opinion. I could not even use them without closing one eye. None of my family members were able to use these. I ended up returning them.
These binoculars are the worst optics I've ever seen.  Dull images were out of focus and I could never get the pair to "focus" correctly. I had such high hopes as I remember Bushnell being superior quality.  Not any more. The optics are so bad, I was literally seeing double images.  Do yourself a favor and avoid spending any money on this product.
Received these today. Made sure the interpupillary distance and the diopter were set correctly and the binoculars still produced a double image. The factory seals on the package indicate these were not previously returned or tampered with. They either slipped past quality control, or were somehow knocked out of alignment during shipping.Binoculars that can't handle a 2 day trip in shipping aren't durable enough for field use, and if they left the factory like that, QC needs to be more vigilant. In any case they are unusable in this condition.It's a shame because they otherwise appear to be good build quality. The fit and finish was nice. But I need to look through them, not just look at them.
I've worked as a computer tech support consultant for years.  So I thought this would be a breeze.My goal was to free up my proxy server for other  uses.  This seemed to be a good and cheap alternative to a computer.  I  realized that I would be giving up some of the security capabilities of my  proxy server when I did this.I was not using DHCP within the network,  but was being served an IP address to the cable modem via DHCP.  Also, one  of my servers was set up for the default IP address of the router.I  was unable to get the router to recognize the network. I tried setting it  up as a stand alone router and still this didn't work.  I changed the IP  number of one of my servers, tried reinstalling it the router using the  default configuration. Tried resetting it several times.  You name it I  tried it.After a week with no Internet access I decided the benfits did  not outweight the continued hassle.  The benefit of running a proxy server  won.  I reconfigured my Proxy Server which has performed beautifully since.  The proxy has the benefit of being more configurable and provides a better  firewall.I think I could have eventually gotten the Linksys router to  work, but felt it was not worth the extended effort.If you have simple  network and do not need to make configuration changes to either the network  or this router, it would probably install ok.  If you have a more  complicated network, with specific options on how DHCP is being used, and  don't want to run the default router settings, you may run into problems.
When Linksys products work, they are wonderful, however, their customer tech support is EXTREMELY difficult to use!Linksys tech support is a MAZE of phone calls, robot voices,etc!You get switched to different level, the PeterPrincipal being VERY evident as you slog along trying to even understand what they are saying!I've owned 4 different Linksys products over a 5yr time frame, ONE of the products worked for 2yrs, that's a record with Linksys, the rest DIED and were thrown in the trash within months!Linksys, not worth ALL the bother!
Not at all easy to install or use. There are many, many options which you have no access to through the installation CD. There is a web interface for setting options, but the address is nowhere to be found in the documentation. You have to hunt through the Linksys web site to find it. Then go through tons of Linksys FAQs to find information for the different settings and what to do if things go wrong.After hours and hours of investigation and setting different options and going through technical support, my internet connection was still slow and constantly breaking off. Definitely not a good product.
Finally disconnected this piece of doodoo.  Got very tired of resetting, unplugging, etc.  Man, never thought a wired connection would be such a pain in the (&*%^*.
my onboard LAN went out on a gigabyte motherbaord. darn right? the way the connectors go, the metal outside would have to be inside let alone go through my motherboard before it would connect. I of course sat there trying to figure it out, and realized it wouldn't work so I gave my UPS uncle the package with a return label and sent it back. I would not recommend this unless your motherboard is upside down, where the smaller part of the pci port is closer to the outside of the shell
I have a G4 tower Mac that did have a built in Ethernet.  Unfortunately, a lightening strike took out the port and I was forced to get a PCI card to replace the port.  The first card I bought was the D-Link DFE-530TX+.  I was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with Macs and that the "minimum requirement" was OS 10.2.They lied.  OS 10.2 is the _maximum_ for this card.  For most people, it won't work with 10.3 and up.  D-Link has no driver for 10.3 or higher, only 10.2.  A google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with 10.3.  I couldn't.  I tried several different drivers (some users recommended a driver from Realtek) and none worked.It's my guess (and totally a guess) that this card is really only for older Macs that are limited to 10.2.  D-Link doesn't seem to have any intention of supporting modern Macs.This is the second D-Link product I've used (the first was a cable modem) and I've been disappointed both times.  I can't speak for Windows users, but this company doesn't deserve Mac business.
Maybe my set was defective, but it's not worth returning. There was static and poor sound.  The fit on my head was too tight.  I tossed these in the trash.
Reading impressively positive reviews here, I purchased two of them.  Unfortunately I was disappointed by sound reproduction of theses headphones. The sound is very weak compared to quite a few other equally priced headphones. If I press them on my ears, then I get a mediocre sound. It lacks depth of sound and matches its price perfectly. I got what I paid for.
These headphones delivered adequate sound for the money...for about one week. After that, the right channel went dead.This wasn't one week of grueling, sweating, working-out-in-the-gym torture. This was one week of "old guy sitting very, very still in a chair listening to music." And still...PSHHT!!! The darn thing crapped out on me.For the price, there's no point in trying for a return...nor much hope that I can make a repair. So even though they didn't cost much, it hurts to be adding them to the landfill. Other reviews indicate that this has been an ongoing problem with these headphones. I'm really disappointed that Panasonic couldn't add another fraction of a penny's worth of rubber to reinforce the cord and protect the wiring.
I give this headphone 4 stars, mainly for the price.  It's clearly not a 4-star headphone, but for the price, it's definitely worth it.Amazingly, this $5 headphone has better bass than a $40 pair of headphones I got last year sometime.  It's the best bass you'll find in a headphone this cheap, guaranteed.  I defy you to find better!The actual sound quality is 'ok'.  It's very low power.  If you're accustomed to listening to your music on volume 12, let's say, you'll need it on volume 14 or 15 with these headphones.  However, when you do, it gives a nice rich bass sound, a below average mid-range and a below average treble.Like I said, for $5.20 and free shipping (thanks to Amazon Prime) this was a no-brainer, and maybe the best $5 I ever spent on headphones.  This is a spare set, for when I forget my other ones (I have 3 headphones).  I lose headphones and sit on them or break them so often, it's nice to have this one around.But in realistic terms, if you're rating this in terms of sound, regardless of price, I'd give these headphones a 2.5 out of 5.Update: 9/15/10 - After only 2 short months of use, my left speaker rattles, rendering the headphones virtually useless.  I actually only used the headphones maybe 5 or 6 times before they blew.  That's $1 per use!  Garbage!
I bought two sets about six months ago because they were cheap.  While the sound is good, the fit is terrible.  Both failed within four months--likely due to stress on the cords.  They also don't have a volume control and they are not good for television watching, if that's what you had in mind. I believe they are under warranty, but at this price, it's not worth the postage to send them to Sony.
Returned it in 2 days.  Just awful.  Poor focusing and lots of hunting for focus on my Digital Rebel.  Slowness made every shot underexposed.  Lens mounted to the camera losely, so you could wiggle the lens.  Lens gave error 99's on the EOS.Avoid this product.Update:  Purchased the Canon EF 75-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens and it is absolutely wonderful.  Worth the extra money for better glass, Image stabilization, and faster focusing.
It really would be nice if they specified which camera's these work with, because this flash does not work with Pentax K-7.  The manual itself is as confusing as trying to read it in spanish.  Tried calling Pentax customer service and ended up with Indian Customer Non-Service.  I'll buy American next time.
This is the worst underwater disposable I've ever used. Out of 27 shots only 5 even developed, and those were so dark you could only see blurs.$10 for the camera and $10 for developing, a complete waste.
If you buy this, make sure you familiarize yourself with the lever for advancing the film -- you don't want to figure it out while snorkeling. After a few shots, the lever just spun uselessly. I have no idea how many shots I got -- I've been reluctant to waste money on developing.
The poor quality photographs that this camera takes will make you erase those memories even from your mind. It is better to just remember those moments and leave this camera in store. Buy bubble gum instead.
I had used these before and needed one for a quick scuba trip.  I don't know if this one was just bad or what - but it leaked ruining the camera and all of the film.  I most likely wont be purchasing these again
I have tendinitis which prevents me from using a mouse on the right side, even though I'm right handed. I must use a trackball on the left side.Logitech has no excuse for leaving out left-handed people. It is not so hard to make trackballs that work well for both sides. I don't see another comparable wireless trackball in Logitech's product line that would work for left-handed.
I have a corded version of this track ball that I use with my desktop computer and I thought I might use this with my laptop. The USB connector that sends out the signal is too big and in the way.
If you have a -CX based eTrex model (legend of vista), the back cover plate will not accommodate the microSD card.  So instead of this, I'd recommend getting a RAM mount:RAM Mounting Systems Handlebar Mount for Garmin eTrex Venture C, Legend C, Vista C, Venture CX, Legend CX, Vista CXor do it yourself and build your own mount, see instructables.com
What a disappointment.  The battery cover does not work on a eTrex Venture CX model.  What a disappointment.  The CX has a flash card slot on the upper left which requires a notch in the cover.  This one does not have the notch so it will not fit.  I also do not have the o-ring mentioned by the other reviewer so I am not sure if it will seal 100% on regular units anyway.What a bummer I threw away the packaging before I actually tried to mount it on the bicycle anyway.  What a bummer.
I bought one and eventually the primary mouse button no longer worked. I got a replacement sent free of charge but it now malfunctions as well.The cursor now disappears and reappears from a different part of the screen. While playing first person shooter games, the character spins wildly out of control.This never happened with my other optical mouse made by Microsoft.
Its a nice bag if you don't have larger lenses.  Its rated to hold 1-2 bodies and 7-10 lenses.  I currently have a 40D/grip, 580EX II, 70-200 f/2.8L, 28-135IS, and then tamrons 28-70 2.8 and 17-35 lenses.  thats full to the max.  I contacted Canon to find out what lenses it was rated for, they considered the 17-35 lens even to be larger than what it was designed for.  They designed it and rated it for two bodies, no grips, no external flashes, and the lenses are all small prime lenses like the 28, 24, and 50mm's.  They couldnt list 10 different focal length lenses that would fit in the bag...so why do they say that?  I had to special order this bag from my shop, so there are no returns, and Canon is sticking to their word that it holds what they say so they are doing anything about it either.If you can live with the camera/grip, flash and 4 lenses, then its a great bag, but if you are getting it to hold anywhere near the gear its rated for, go with something else.  If anyone wants mine, just email me...im selling it on here for cheap now.
I was waiting on this flash unit and then I got a message informed me that they canceled the order .
I ordered this flash as a replacement for a 420ex (that I was borrowing from a good colleague). The minute I opened I had the ominous feeling that it was going to be a disappointment. Indeed! The very first test shots were incredibly telling as to how lousy and shoddy this flash is. First, it does not swivel so you can kiss your hopes for bounce flash goodbye. Second, it's lacks punch and power. In many of the informal tests I performed, the built-in flash of my camera (and even that of a point-and-shoot I have lying around the studio) is more powerful!!!!!! I re-packed it and sent it back. Got a 430ex and am nothing but satisfied. In short, stay away from this flash! In this case you won't even get what you paid for--avoid!
Fantastic idea. Works great about a quarter of the time. Can't figure out why the engineers would've designed this thing this way. I'm referring mainly to the fact that for it to be "seen" by the camera, you need to be standing directly in front of it aiming in the precisely right place. Also, what the hell were they thinking requiring the camera to be in self timer mode, especially when self timer mode times out in a minute or two? When trying to wrangle a large group of people to pose for a shot, it can easily take longer than the time limit before it kicks back over to regular shooting mode.I was delighted with this product when i first received it and played around with a few self portraits, but after a few months of frustration, have completely abandoned it in favor of the wired remote.
I knew I was buying a small camera backpack but I had no idea that it was that tiny! The photo makes us think it is bigger but it is really tiny! It fits just a small camera such us Canon XTi (no batery grip), one extra small lens such as Tamron 17-50mm, and some memories or bateries - THAT IS ALL - The thing that really bothered me most is that it is too narrow, shallow, and tight. It is really impossible to fit all that gear showed in the photo they use for the commercial. DO NOT BUY IT! IT DOES NOT WORTH!
The clamp broke and easily came undone from the strap.  The strap itself had the tendency to come unclipped from the wristband.  You're better off going with another wrist band, though based on my experiences I'd probably rather just tie myself to the computer with a length of copper wire than buy another of these.
I have to wonder if my unit was defective or Belkin is actually making the units non-conductive as placebo's. Belkin could get sued I suppose if someone got electrocuted by making themselves the path of least resistance wearing one of these things. So maybe these are intentionally non-functional as a result, just to make people think they are protecting their precious computer.Or maybe I just have a defective unit. The molded connections sadly fall unrepairable.Anyway it seemed like a decent product, the wrist strap is pretty narrow be aware, though it will fit on most wrists it won't fit further up your arm or on your ankle or something you might prefer.If you really want to be grounded, test conductivity with a ohmmeter.
I got the product and tried to hook it up to my pc case to ground my self as i was reaching over the clip broke from the yellow strap. I guess you get what you paid for, good thing is its cheap bad thing is what a waste of money.
I plug in in my router was my surprise doesnt work with regular routers , maybe need more information how to use.
This is a nicely made cable; however, there are a few things that are not very well engineered.First off are the connectors and their ease of removal ... I had to remove this cable after I found that it was defective and not working, and I could almost not get these connectors unplugged from my modem or the wall jack.  This should be an easy and simple thing to do, however, the release tab on each connector end flexes way too much when being depressed, thus not allowing the latch to disengage the connector without a major effort.  I had a heck of a time trying to get this cable unplugged once it was plugged in, almost damaging my modem and wall jack.Second major problem was that this cable was DOA ... absolutely no DSL signal when I replaced my old cable with this new one.  I tried several times to get it to work, but I got nothing. When I connected my old AT&T; cable back up, all was well and working as usual.  I had to return this Belkin Modem Cable for a refund.Thirdly, be aware that this cable comes very tightly wound up into a small bundle ... Resulting in a much coiled modem cable when you unroll it.  It will take some time to try and straighten it out enough to get the full usable 15 feet.This modem cable did not work out for me, even though it was well made.  Sorry, but I cannot recommend.
Not what I ordered, Amazon did not have a good picture and it said USB not two different ends.  Amazon needs to label items so customers can ordered what the want.  I gave it only one star because I did not want this kind of cable.  Amazon did let me keep these, still in their pack.
I purchased this product since it was a "recommendation", along with a case, when I purchased my Fujitsu scanner.  This cable doesn't even fit the scanner! I'm sure it's a good cable and should be rated higher than 1 star - so take that into consideration.  Do Not buy this product as part of a "bundle" from Amazon because it's totally useless and isn't needed for the Fujitsu scanner.  I expect better - and normally receive better - from Amazon.
Notice how Amazon recommends purchasing together the Belkin cable and Fujitsu SnapScan???Well I thought I would give myself more flexibility in positioning my scanner by using this longer cable.  And since it was recommended by Amazon that others purchase these 2 products together (and Amazon cuts you a deal to boot), why not get both???BIG MISTAKE!  I spent hours reading every technical support item that came with my Fujitsu SnapScan to learn why my brand new scanner isn't "recognized" by any of my computers (after loading the drivers).  Luckily, it was too late to call technical support (they are only available from 5am to 5pm M-F).  So I took my new scanner home and slept on it.  When I woke up this morning, I thought let me try one more time:  this time I only used the products that came with the Fujitsu SnapScan = and it worked like a breeze!!!LESSONS LEARNED:  BELKIN (and other manufacturers' products) MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE !!!So if you are using this product with Fujitsu's SnapScan = definitely pass.And message to AMAZON:  Please do a little home work when you advertise bundled products.  I expected that your smarty pants technology guys would only suggest purchasing products which work with one another.
this product is not even worth a star, first it's not a 9 stop like they said, it is a big huge lie. DO NOT BUY EVEN IF IT FOR $1
This is a review of the:Tiffen 52mm Color Graduated Neutral Density 0.6 FilterBottom-line: useless. It makes no difference for exposure. A cheap equivalent cokin works much better than this.This filter is pretty much useless. I've recently bought a cokin grad neutral density 0.6 and is much better than this useless piece of glass. It makes absolutely no difference in my pictures (while the equivalent cokin one works fine).My suggestion is: stay away from this and save your money.
Okay so I don't believe that every ND filter from this company will come with 30-40 small cracks the entire length of the filter, but mine did (only on the coating).  It still works because it's so close to the lens it doesn't effect the images... unless you shoot at f/16-22, then we have an issue.
This is just a pointless filter to have.  It does very little for my Sigma lens.  I keep it on just to keep dirt and other garbage from actually touching the lens.  The difference in photographs is so minimal to where it is not really worth the price.  If you are worried about protecting your lens, get a filter like this.  As for it being a Density filter, I have not seen any results.  I have owned other filters but find myself using them less and less since I have really figured my way around LightRoom.
Cons only, can't find any pro yet!!!1. There are plenty of dirt on the lens itself!2. Light scratches found on the side too! Lucky me, it's not at the center!Go get a better one! Avoid this thing like plague!!!
I got this Tiffen filter to protect my new Panasonic FZ28's lens, and it has just proven that it cost $10.81 more than it is worth. I was testing the camera outside during the evening and, as I focused on the city lights, I suddenly noticed that the lights were bouncing off the filter and reflecting into the camera. I took a couple of test shots with the filter, removed it and took another couple of test shots. When I downloaded the images into my computer, there they were: horrible "ghost" lights scattered in the dark sky over the real city lights, and only in the photos taken with the filter in place. I know there is a technical term for them -- glare or flare or something else? -- and I also know that they shouldn't be there. This obviously means that the Tiffen 46mm Haze-1 is worthless. I want something that will protect my lens but that won't spoil my photos.My FZ18 (which is my mom's now) has a Quantaray multi-coated UV filter that never interfered in my photos in any way. I looked for that filter on the web but unfortunately couldn't find it. By the reviews here I thought I'd be okay with the Tiffen. I was wrong, and must now look for a new filter.
One of my friends brought it from here for a new 18-105mm vr nikkor (from D90 kit). After attached it to the lens, you will see a small spot at the middle. He showed it to me for finding the reason. I said Oh god remove it immediately.But it is too late. The glass of the filter hit the glass of the lens. The filter was returned, but the spot is still on the lens forever. - -"Update 07/06/10One of my friend bought this filter for 18-105mm. Again !!, the same problem
I have used Tiffen for many years when I used film cameras.  I recently bought an expensive lens and wanted to protect it so I bought this filter.  As my title says it causes reflections and those reflections show up green!  I know that with digital cameras you do not need UV filtering and I assumed that the coloration would not show in a digital--but I was wrong.  I was shooting into a glass door and got the perfect outline of it reflected back onto a dark chair.  I especially noticed this when using my new K5 II Pentax camera body.  It was less noticeable when using my Pentax KR.  I really don't want to have to buy some super expensive clear filter--but it looks like I may have no choice.
Multi-coated lenses help reduce reflections off the filter glass, something this doesn't have.  It is almost guaranteed to detract from any image where a strong light source (sun, street lights, Full moon, etc) is in front of the plane of the camera.  it will protect your lens at the cost of your shots.  Better to look for a multi-coated lens.  Pretty easy to find for less than 20 in 52mm thread.
This filter flares excessively and is unworthy of any optical system.  All inventory should be recycled immediately.  Once again you don't get what you don't pay for.  The clear Nikon filter that I replaced this with functions very well.
When I was cleaning it gently the glass came lose and now it just rattles around.  It's a piece of junk.
I don't like the threading (too tight), I don't like the lack of adapters for different sizes and i don't like the weird artifacts and reflections and glares I got from using this filter. My shots came out looking worse! Honestly, if you're going to use a UV filter for anything whether that be lens physical protection, or better images, go for high end brands. With filters it's all about the price, the cheaper the price, the cheaper the quality.I recommend this to no one, not even a newbie.
I bought this filter, thinking it would be fine, I bought a $18 filter for my 50 mm and it's been great. I thought price wouldn't matter so I bought this one for $6 for my 24-75 lens. Within two weeks, it lets all humidity in and locks in humidity and water moisture. I literally cannot take one photo with my filter on. Missed my return window by a day which is my own fault.
I just purchased Canon's 50mm 1.4 lens and this came free with it. I said to myself, well heck, maybe I don't need to get my go-to Hoya Multicoated UV filter this time. It's Tiffen, the name is synonymous with filters - how bad can it be? Well folks, it's bad. I only really experimented with it on indoor shots, but the reflections and ghosted light blurs are just ridiculous. It's almost comical how bad this filter is.Maybe it is ok for some conditions, but once a shot is ruined because of a UV filter, that's it in my book. Tossed it in my pile of retired photo gear and just pressed "order" on a multicoated filter. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. See my images for examples of the reflections.
Mounted this filter on a Canon 50mm F1.8 lens.  On semi-strong light sources, it has significant flare.  Removed filter, flare went away.  Looking for a higher quality 52mm UV filter now.  Can't recommend this filter due to flare.  Check the pictures for this product to see flare and no flare example (Tiffen UV filter removed from lens).
I've read a ton on filters for protection of my lenses...  Don't buy Tiffen, don't even buy Hoya...  spend the money on B+W clear protector filters.  They really don't mess up your images.  The Tiffen filters pickup everything and add nasty ghosting to your images.
Got this for my 50mm as protection.  Its well constructed and no issues with image quality.  I was a little concerned with the thickness, but no vignetting with my lens.  Get one!!!update (July 2010).  Am disappointed with this filter.  After some use I have noticed that the glass does not seem to be clean no matter what I do.  Used all sorts of cleaners etc but no effect.  Have been leaving it on instead of a lens cap, but I take it off before shooting.  Have recently acquired a Nikon NC filter that is head and shoulders above this...and well worth the price.  Lesson learned.  Will not make this mistake again!!!
I decided to try the filter in an old Beckman UV-VIS spectrophotometer, and replicate optical transmittance results in Poland.  Sure enough, Tiffen and window glass appear to be optically related in transmittance of long-wave UV.  Frankly, I've alays had the impression that Tiffen filtered images were less clear than B&W, and this kind of study may well explain the difference.  Here's a link to the original study results [...]
I bought this to protect my new Panasonic Lumix FZ100's lens.  Wifey is not too careful when handling cameras (I hope she's not reading this).  I wanted to prevent constantly cleaning fingerprints off the lens and the blame-game.  When I took pics of some birds on a sunny day, the birds were slightly off focus in many pics even though the camera has a terrific AF capability.  The pics did come out very nice except for the auto focus part.Indoors, in low light, the camera took a lot more time to autofocus than it usually does.  Once the filter was removed, focusing was rapid.  I think I'll buy some other brand.
I threw it away.  What a rip-off.All kinds of glare and reflections coming from this *very* cheap piece of glass.  I had to re-shoot a lot of stuff because of my choice to use this filter.  The amount of glare it picks up is ridiculous.  It was my fault for buying it.  I knew it had to be terrible at this price.If you have any doubt, buy one and find out for yourself.This product is 100% snake oil.  Buy a good filter or use your lens cap if you want to protect your lens.  Tiffen = Trash.I would rate it 0/5 if allowed.-Mike
barely works as a lens protector. Don't waste your moneyThese are NOT multi coated, I doubt they're even single coated. I see they're no longer advertised as multi-coated. They were when I bought them. These are plain glass, they reflect every thing a sheet of glass will.Why someone is trying to sell a warming filter in this day and age should indicate that these are old technology, aimed at film cameras. Digital cameras can correct for light sources, so this filter is for the bin. The polarizer does polarize....... a bit. but not much. It doesn't handle reflections well at all. The "UV" is plain glass - it really is a joke.The pouch is a ridiculous idea. who can keep filters clean in a pouch?Mine were clearly used also. with scratches in the threads indicating they'd be installed several times before. the glass was also very dirty, and was clearly handled by several people. I'm not taking stars off for the seller incompetence, but the condition I received these in was unacceptable.A poor product, clearly returned by several others. look else where.
Because the power strip is so narrow, it's possible to insert a plug incorrectly, with one prong inserted into the socket and the other prong hanging off the side of the power strip. This prong would be energized through the device/appliance, so you can get a shock from touching it. Also, the prong can touch the metal body of the power strip, creating a spark. I think a power socket should be designed so that this type of accident is physically impossible.
This product is very expensive. Of course all Tripp Lite products are over priced, in my opinion, maybe because they are built out of better components then their competitors, I do not know and in reality there is no easy way to prove that. However when I got this power strip I first noticed there is no surge protection. Seriously? Yeah I know it is in the description but come on. For $40 it should include surge protection. Oh well, just don't plug up anything to this that is important to you, right? NO! Additionally the plugs are not widely spaced enough for bigger, bulkier adapters which a lot of electronics have. So you may only be able to plug up half the devices you want. Sheesh. Talk about an over priced LIMITED and oddly designed power strip. Granted the cord is 15ft long but I don't need even a 5ft cord. And if you need it longer buy an extension cable.I ended up going to a local Home Depot and surprisingly I find a whole case load of 12 outlet power strips by Defiant for $19.88! Best of all, all the power ports are spaced WIDE so you can plug in even the bulkiest of adapters. AND...it has a surge protection! WOW! What a deal. The cord is only 3ft long but I'd rather have surge protection and widely spaced outlets. I compared the two side by side and the Defiant power strip is noticeably longer because there is more room between the outlets. And it is in a heavy duty metal shell. SOLD! Go to homedepot's website and search Defiant 12 outlet or SKU 1000021669.PROS:1. Looks nice and pretty.CONS:1. Oddly spaced outlet. Not suitable for bigger, bulkier adapters.2. No surge protection.3. Overly long power cord (15ft).4. Very pricey! Twice as expensive as the store bought Defiant 12 outlet which has additional surge protection and further spaced outlet.My advice is to skip this overly priced power strip and visit your local Home Depot. There are way better deals then this guy.
This device didn't work at all. Also the driver disc doesn't identify which drivers are for which devices. (IE: The phrase ST100S is not mentioned on any drivers, and there are a lot).Went to their website and downloaded the drivers. The folder for XP was empty. (Even though XP is supposed to auto install this, nothing I tried worked). Refund was instant and I didn't have to return defective product!
I had it for a couple of months, afterwards... the noise of the fan gets louder, and then dies. It was great at keeping my video card cool, however not a very long life card.
Several months ago  I reviewed this item in detail. Now here is my updated review...about 3-5 months after buying this thing it started to make a notoriously loud sound. It still works, but the annoying sound isn't worth it. I didn't expect it to break as fast as it did. Also since I broke it I got a much better graphics card, the MSI Radeon 7950, it  runs hot and this thing doesn't help much for higher end cards. A budget solution for a menial problem. If you have serious heat issues improve you cable management or get into liquid cooling - cheap junk like this just doesn't get the job done.Once was a 5 star review for a decent, nicely price produced now soiled. $10 bucks down the drain.
The description says that it fits "any expansion slot".  This is also stated on the product packaging.  However it does not even come close to fitting my PCI Express low profile slot.
item did not work - it made my system shutdown and not power up - I have owned A few  & this was not the same part in the pic - I got A cheap non working part - the plasic was cheap and breakable by heat - if any thing I got A used one as new
Unit died.  Receptacles for appliance plugs are all dead.  Light shows line OK, fault protection light is not on, on-off switch is lit.Can't even use as an extender because plugs are all dead.Protected against surge but then was worthless.
I bought this card and within 24 hours of receiving it, I was contacting J&amp;R for a RMA number.Installation was fine with my Windows XP laptop, but using it was another story. Anywhere in the house, even two feet from my wireless router, there was no signal. This was odd considering I had 4-5 computers at seporate ends of the house successfully receiving full wireless-B internet access. So, I gave up and for the heck of it, slid a Netgear card in. Well, it worked great! I could be anywhere in the house and receive near-100% link-quality/signal.If you're in the market for a card like this, I would highly recommend going with it's Netgear counterpart.
***UPDATED 8/04: In retrospect, my problems were due to trying to use this card with Novell and my VPN client, plus wireless was still a little new at that time for my IBM Thinkpad. Today, the is standard technology, Cisco has purchased Linksys and significantly increased overall quality, and wireless-B is outdated anyway.*** I purchased this card in November 2001`and experienced some problems setting it up that I needed to call tech support for. On my third call, the operator felt sorry for me and actually helped me more than any support tech ever has (10+ calls and counting). I got it to work and it ran great for about three months. Then, while trying to set up my VPN client, it stopped. Went through 4-5 uninstalls-reinstalls with tech support before finally they told me the card was bad and sent me a new one. So far I have been unable to get it to work after more problems simply installing the driver. Tech support tells me it is a newer model card that may not be compatable with my laptop computer (Win98 SE/top of the line IBM Thinkpad). So far have been trying since February to get it working again and am about to give up and get a refund. Of course, I'm still stuck with a hub/router that cost me twice as much so I could get the wireless feature. Who knows if it is the product or not, but I can say that Linksys tech support is absolutely the worst I've ever dealt with in 10 years.
Signal strength starts to drop off after just 10 feet, and the access point seems to randomly lose contact with the internet even when wired connections using the same lines have no problems. Extremely frustrating - you need to reset the connection frequently and on an hp PC with XP, using "repair connection" seems to hang the system more often than fix the problem. I'm in the market for something - anything - else.
if u have huge hand, get this. else don't bother.  I have medium size to small size hand and using this mouse actually hurt my hand.
To call this input device a "trackball" is misleading.  It does not "track" very well at any resolution setting.  You must install the Intellimouse software in order to change the default button positions, which places what we all know as the "right" mouse button to the left of the ball.  This is simply stupid and I cannot imagine that the engineers who designed this input device actually use this aging product anymore.If you have Windows XP, the built-in mouse driver with its welcome highly-precise tracking feature will be replaced, and turned off, with the Intellimouse software which also has a slightly different acceleration scheme and is a lot less precise.  Unfortunately you cannot use the built-in Windows XP mouse driver unless you actually want your "right mouse button" to be assigned to the "upper-left mouse button."The shape of the housing is very comfortable for right-handed users only.  Southpaws cannot comfortably use this device in any fashion.  The housing fits my right hand so well but the perspiration can be troublesome since your entire hand will be flush against the unit.When this model first came out several years ago it was over seventy dollars.  Get it under promotion and you probably won't be disappointed, but I think the twenty-dollar Logitech Marble Mouse is a massively higher quality and more useable product than this one.I think it's worth mentioning that the ball socket is lit up by several LED's that are only activated when you install the Intellimouse software.  If you don't install the software you only get one light (and a stupidly-placed right-mouse-button on the left!).
The unit is very easy to install, and works right out of the box.  Given the prevalence of wireless devices, switches like this are indeed coming down in price, and make for an easy addition to any home or small business network.However...Within 5 months of my purchase, the uplink port (#16) stopped working.  After much troubleshooting with their technical support unit, I was issued an RMA without any argument.  Somehow the RMA was enter twice and I was sent a second unit as well.  This took some time to convince customer support that they had screwed up, and I wasn't paying return shipping for the 2nd unit.  All was cleared up eventually, and the replacement began working immediately.About three months later, the same port died, and once again I had to go through the horrors of their support staff.  After three hours on the phone with their technical support staff, customer service, and two supervisors, I eventually got another RMA.  I am currently awaiting the third replacement now.It's worth noting that they attempted to blame the cause of the outage on a faulty router attached to port 16.  That is until I informed them that the router was a Linksys WRT54GL, that has been working flawlessly since its installation.  Replacing the switch was cheaper than replacing the router.It's a 5-star switch when it works.  But my expectations for its longevity are very slim.EDIT:  I received the third replacement unit today, and as I feared it has the same defect.  Of course, Linksys will not refund any money at this point so I can purchase a working unit. Looks like I'm just going to be put out for the replacement cost of a functional switch.  This is most certainly the last Linksys/Cisco product I'll buy.
This is a nice compact unit with pretty blue plastic and a lanyard so you can hand it on your neck. That's the end of the positives.The big, really big, negative is that this thing has such poor sensitivity that unless you live in the desert and no bird or plane ever fles over you, you will have problems getting it to work because it will not find satellite signals.OK, mild exageration. I live in mid-Michigan and it actually has found enough satelites to work if there was nothing above it. However, the moment you go under a tree, any tree, you will lose your signal and you will not get it back until you move out from under the tree. I think that if you put your hand over the Etrex Legend you will lose your signal.This thing is well named because a legend is often a myth and not based on fact. It is certainly a myth that the Etrex Legend is a useable GPS.Garmin should be deeply ashamed for selling such junk.
Must have had a defective unit, but this thing fell to pieces when I tried to reel the cord in. I was too busy to deal with it so I never sent it back. I tried to fix it but couldn't. Didn't work for me at all.
The microphone is incredibly sensitive to electrical noise from laptop power supplies or powered USB hubs, causing a very obtrusive hum when used with applications such as Skype.  As a result this Plantronics model can be used on laptops only when running on battery power.  Since that's not practical, I am now the proud owner of a stylish $40 paperweight.It would have been easy for Plantronics to include a low-frequency rolloff around 120 Hz which would filter out the hum, but leave voice signals unchanged. (Unless you're singing a bass part....)It's a pity, really, because otherwise the sound quality is quite good.
I got one of those rare lemons, so I cannot speak about the lens quality. Despite having everything set correctly, it would not give me an F-stop reading and would not focus on AF or MF on my Pentax K-5. Amazon was wonderful as always about a return and refund. I would not consider buying electronics and camera products from any other retailer. I LOVE amazon.com
I bought this card to go with my Nikon 4300.  It worked fine for about 6 months.  Now, although I can continue to take photos, I can't get them off the card my any means.  PC can't read or even format the card.Don't waste your money here!As an update, I went to the Viking website and noted that they have a 5 year warranty.  It was very easy to return, and Viking sent me a new one within a few weeks.  So far, so good...
This router is ok, at best.PROS:-Installation with cable or DSL modem is really easy. SEtup in windows XP is almost automatic.-Regular websurfing for WIRED computers works well.CONS:(NOTE: I am using a linksys wireless 802.11b usb enabled, which connection appears to be STRONG (4/5 bars); the router is located on the second floor, but not more than 40 feet away)- Though connection appears strong navigation is slow and lags. At time it does not even respond.- If you plan to do online games, forget it. You will lag out constantly. I also reinstalled it several times opening different ports, and nothing worked.- The lagging occurs even while WIRED to the router, so it is not the wireless feature that has this problem.- If you are a webmaster, and need to FTP to a server from your house, forget it. This device, (wired or wireless) only occasionally (1 of 10 times) lets you FTP files.Basically, for the most expensive 802.11b wireless router in the market, this is not worth the price or the trouble.I find myself bringing the DSL modem downstairs whenever I need to FTP files to the server, and sometimes during websurfing I get so annoyed at the constant 'hesitation' that I bring it down again. Defeating the purpose of having a wireless connection, (while leaving the other people without internet for the time I need to ftp files).I tried different ports, and none gave me good results.Any suggestions are welcomed.
If you use this router for heavy traffic it will disconnect you constantly, both wired and wireless. The router also disconnects you every 24 hours. If you are using Vonage, uTorrent, Windows media player streaming videos, the router will freeze up constantly, then you would have to power rest it. Every random hour the internet would stop working them you would have to unplug it and plug it back in for it to work again. One of the worst routers ever to buy.
I'd give this a 1 star only because it can't go any lower.Bought this router about 6 months ago. First month or so worked great, then I started to get dropped signals every few days or so and have had to unplug/replug the power cord just to get a signal again. Then it gets worse and worse... now I lose the signal daily and have to power cycle it at least once a day, sometimes 3 or more! Worse, the signal comes in and out when it says "connected" on my computer.Been talking to tech support and customer service for the last 2 months. Finally, tech support told me that they'd replace my router for me at no cost to me, and would even have someone pick up my old, defective router so that I do not have to pay for the shipping of the old router back to them. In order to do so, I had to call customer service for arrangements. To my surprise (and my waste of time) customer service coldly said that it's company policy that I pay the shipping for the routers.I agreed to settle the issue through replacement because I don't have to pay for the shipping and that since I will supposedly receive the new router first, I will not have any down time not having a connection at home. This was agreed upon with tech support, and customer service decides to change that? Isn't there some sort of credibility with company promises and first-decisions?I know it's their company policy that I pay shipping to send my defective router back to them, but since their techician told me otherwise, should they not also honor the exception?Sigh, I don't think I can take this any more. I'm going crazy. Do not buy from Linksys. They suck, they really do.
Plug the power in- nadda. No life. Will see if the replacement fairs better and maybe the next review will improve.
There are dozens of storage albums for CD's and DVD's.  This is one to avoid.  It has just one fault, and that is the zipper.  The problem is closing the album.  The zipper runs fine for about 1 1/2".  Then it must make a sharp turn, and there is nothing for you to hold onto to keep the zipper straight.  This is where the zipper will fail, and then it will not close at all.  It opens fine, has good storage, but closing it is a real nuisance.Buy something else.
Case Logic cases used to have 3-ring binders. When you wanted to remove a page of discs, you just popped it open and put it into another binder wherever you wanted. Now, with their ridiculous quick-lock system (or whatever the name is that some bozo in marketing made up), if you want to move a page, you have to remove ALL THE PAGES THAT COME BEFORE IT! And these aren't holes in the pages, these are SLITS! It's made organizing my collection a miserable activity.And why did they make this change? Because it's undoubtedly cheaper to make a binding system out of plastic than it is out of metal. And by boasting about the new system, they further insult our intelligence by pretending that it's more desirable and functional than their previous system. It's not. It's better than a case in which you can't remove the pages at all, but that's about it. Case Logic cases are otherwise well made, but this one flaw/change, especially after they'd gotten us used to the three-ring binders, is infuriating.
As of May 17, 2012, the 64 CD version shows one look in the first and second photos, while it is a different look / design in the third photo.  I didn't think it can look different before ordering... and I ordered according to the look of the first and second photo.And the item arrived... it is the one in the third photo... I don't know whether the problem will be fixed later on (I am going to return it and mention it to the customer service).  Hopefully it is fixed by the time you read this  comment.
Unfortunately, this product is being misrepresented in the pictures.  I ordered the 100 capacity folder and it has neither the strap on the spine nor the plastic "rings" that the pages ride along.  The flimsy pages are sewn directly in.  The whole thing is very shabby and is very very light.  I doubt it will last more than a few weeks unless you were to store it and never unzip it.  I'm very disappointed in Case Logic for this terrible product.
The outside is nice material but the sleeve inserts are cheap and flimsy and disk's dent to slide out to easy.  i actually just threw mine away due to to many disks getting scratched by the zipper while sliding out of the pockets/sleeves.
had several years ago and fought with it for a long time.  2nd floor, router on first.  belkin-n(rt2870) and netgear wg111 both connect with strong signal..........this thing would barely connect at all and constantly drop connections in XP(using linksys router). admittedly outdated but should be able to manage some sort of connection.  linux a total no go with this. sorry.
Purchased these from Amazon a few months ago.  Terrible bass.  Overallit was just lousy from the satellites to the woofer. We threw them outand replaced them with an old pair of Cambridge Speakers (sound works).Never will purchase them again.  Waste of Money.Danxo
Ok, so it fits as advertised. I did not appreciate the fact, that to make it work safely, I had to wrap a bare wire with electrician tape. That is really below expectations.
This was NOT an auto-focus lens for the Nikon D40X. It needs a camera with the motor in the camera. I got this to shoot pictures in a gym without flash (basketball, volleyball, rallies). Even though I maually focused the lens through the viewfinder, most of the pictures came out out of focus. It was alos difficult to get the right exposure settings. It just didn't work for what I wanted. I sent it back. Fortunately, JR Music took it back and issued a refund with no problems.
I got both nikon 50/1.4 and rokinon 50/1.4Images produced even on my D3200, is too soft until f/2.5.Even Rokinon 85 f/1.4 can be near-perfectly sharp at f/1.4
and the owner said, it's NeCon, probably translated to English as the con artists from Japan, and probably will not work with older Nikon models, but with a plenty of lubrication with oil pumping D6x0 camera, it may work.Why did human invented the word, "caveat emptor?"  This word didn't exist before Nikon.
I was looking forward to using this product.  When I received the CB Radio I find that it does not plug into the cigarette lighter as I thought, it connects directly to the vehicle battery.  Can't do that so it is going back.  I give Amazon one star for not making this clear.
Now You have to pay on Amazon for Absolutely same Item NOT $8-$10 but $120-$160 ? Amazon, Its Insane scam! I want to reorder this item today 5/28/14  (WHAT a Disgusting Surprise)  from Shopzilla I can get for 11 bucks SAME item). BUT I'm still loyal to you Amazon,Though...if you will keep holding on this scam any longer you gonna loose many loyal customers.Waiting as an apology Same Item I paid $8 for absolutely free!!!Note: All sellers who start cheating 1000's of buyers must be eliminated immediately. Thanks ,always yours ,Aless.
I decided to try these based on all the positive reviews and the price.  I run 3 days a week and lift at the gym 2 days. These failed the workout test.They kept falling off in the gym during various movements and, while running, they invariably needed adjusting.They may be OK for casual listening but are not intended for sports
These headphones are extremely flimsy and lack the kick needed to accurately reproduce music and even speech.  The Sony MDR-A44L was the benchmark of the vertical in-the-ear design.  It's a shame that Sony discontinued the MDR-A44L in favor of the overly cheapened MDR-W08L.
This item is about two years old now, it was used on a laptop the whole time. It failed slightly after the two year mark because right where it plugs in at is not re-enforced at the connector and tends develop a open in the wiring where it flexes often. This is a poor design feature by Logitech. You can find "refurbished" ones identical to this one all over the internet because they all develop this problem due to faulty cable. I do not know if Logitech ever fixed this problem or not. It involving replacing the defective cable from the plug leading into the mouse. I did this to mine and it is back working as it originally did new. Logitech had to know this was a problem and yet mass produced and sold these, shame on them.
For as much as people rave about this and the sound it produces, I was really disappointed.  I knew there would be a decrease in sound quality, but it was HUGE. It literally sounded like I was playing tapes again. So to me, I didn't find the need to use it unless I had long road trips.However, it has stopped working after sporadic use over two months.  I tried it in two different cars, and it just keeps popping out with "error" messages.  Sigh...
This doesn't work in my 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe.  The tape player rejects it and the stereo display shows "broken tape".  I am going to try some other brands of tape adapters hoping for a difference result.  At least this can be a warning to other Santa Fe owners.
Works ok, but anytime my AC kicks in, this thing makes my TV flicker. Very annoying. Didn't happen before with a normal surge protector. This was a waste of money. How many electronics actually get destroyed by a lightning strike? I think I'm probably more likely to get struck...... in my living room.
Hooked up my cable and internet to the splitter, turned on the TV. Both went off, traced it back to the splitter which drastically degraded the signal to the point of both not being able to operate. The degradation was apparent on the cable TV without the internet plugged in. I realized maybe I went too cheap with this splitter, seems to be held together by glue in the back, most splitters also have the degradation numbers on the back but this has no markings but RCA on the front.
I do not recommend this item.  I replaced a very old splitter to improve the signal to my TV and cable modem.  The signal was worse with this problem.  There are better options.
I bought this along with a couple of other RCA cables and a splitter. All of them degrade the signal strength.
Sent mine back. Your need real copper wiring to get the best sound from your equipment. Copper Covered Aluminum does not do the job.
I prefer the solid gold jewelry and solid copper speaker wire. I wouldn't mind so much if I was running some speakers in my garage that I got from the Goodwill, but if I want quality I should know. There is no mention that this is aluminum wire. If it is just as good, it should mention as much. How hard would it be to show a % loss running 50 feet of solid copper vs. 50 feet of CCA. Most people don't even know and RCA is happy to hide the facts. I don't mind paying more or less for something, but I do mind when I am deceived with sugar, err copper, coating.
cheaply made, very bad quality.  dont buy and look for something better ....... dont buydont buydont buy and dont buy
Stereo headphone plug works perfectly.  I must have my TV louder than most people and that prevents my darling bride from going to sleep.  I just plug it into my audio/video receiver and then turn the volume down and just listen to the movie.Purchased 06/04/13Update: After a month the brass ring came off what it was pulled out of the adaptor and the ring reinstalled. Last week it was removed while my was cleaning the room and the ring was lost.  This ring centered the headphone cord bayonet plug and now I must reorder but IT WILL NOT the same one.  All I can say now is that you get what you pay for it.
Title says RCA. this is a 1/4 inch plug. If you're thinking "red,white, yellow" or "three prong" or "standard" then look elsewhere. This jack appears to fit full fledged sterios only. It is almost gurenteed NOT to work on your standard laptops, HDTV's, game counsels or monitors. I kept the item and chaulked it up to bad luck. Then made another purchase at Cables to Go. If you came here looking for a RCA Male to 3.5 Female then try searching google for these products at cables to go. (I had links, but Amazon.com took them down...RCA Male Mono to 3.5mm Female3.5mm Male Mono to RCA MaleI've done buisness with cables to go before. They are very trustworthy & ship fast & secure.
This is a cheap trackball mouse and not as good as the Microsoft trackball mouse that costs much more.  The small ball moves too easily, and it is hard to be accurate.  Since it is cheap, I didn't bother returning it.  I expected more from Logitech.
First off, I did love this mouse when I first received it, but it only lasted a couple months of light use.  I was going to get the same one, but it now costs $100!  So I replaced it with a smaller mouse of a different brand, which I actually like a whole lot better.  This mouse is large and caused bad carpal tunnel, too, but I didn't know that was the problem until I bought the smaller mouse.  I had this same mouse before, and it lasted over 2 years, so I am disappointed that this one was so wimpy.Oh yes, and I agree the light is too bright.  It hurts the eyes when it's darker, too, so I kept it covered with a cloth.
Monster is a master at bamboozling gullible people into spending wads of money with no scientific-audible justification. Audio isn't a religion and these are not holy water. They don't work any better than cheap connectors, and they don't work any better than using the posts that come on the back of the receiver to attach your wires.Just gold? Why not platinum, or astatine?Women think that diamonds are the thing, men think it's high-priced wire with banana plugs. At least you get to look at the diamonds.
Dayton BACT-GRB Banana Plug Pair Compression TypeSimply BLOW these away, and they are 1/4 the price!!! Plus you can eveen mount the wire from the side!!!The guy at BB tried to sell me on Monsterwire about a year ago, and after I chewed him a new one, every time I go in there, they KNOW not to even ask me if I want to buy some monster garbage. It's a shame that the normal Joe, who isn't even worried about spending $$$ gets bamboozled into spending 3 times as much as they need to on cabling.My wife called me from best Buy and told me the salesmen was trying to sell her a $100 cable to go with the PS3 she was buying my nephew, I got him on the phone and he knew right away who I was, and was like "Oh it's you, well OK, I'll sell her the AR one for $15"
This lens does not have an internal motor, which is fine.  The clarity of the glass sucks when focused manually or with a camera body with its own motor.  It has been my only clinker lens.  The 2197 version is twice the price, but it does auto-focus and the focus is much sharper.  I've seen this in larger stores for $200 used.  Be patient and shop,
The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon's poor service, otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product.  I placed this order more than 30 days ago.  Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J&R.  If Amazon did not have the item in stock, they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping.
The sound was somewhat boomy but if you like a little extra base it was ok.  Only lasted three months though.
Set up the speakers but no sound from the right speaker.  I then called Klipsch and they had me connect my earphones to the right speaker and sound came through both earphones...the tech support individual indicated the amplifier is blown.  He stated the speakers probably got banged around in shipping??????
Unlike some other reviewers, my DIN plug is fine.  But after 2 years everything else is cooked.  First, the wire clips running off the subwoofer broke.  Then the subwoofer blew out completely.  I replaced the sub, but now one of the satellites has  loud static.  Don't know if I should even bother replacing it.UPDATE:I spoke too soon--  later in the same day as I wrote the original review, the DIN broke.  Don't tempt the fates!  ...and don't buy Klipsch Krap.
Note: This review is intended to inform readers about my personal research into the reliability of this subwoofer before I would make the purchase. I read all the reviews on Amazon and on five different websites that were all selling this product, and I found similiar negative reviews on all the websites. Sure there were positive reviews, but all the negative reviews were too important to simply ignore. I was first considering the Infinity Basslink 200-Watt, Dual 10-Inch Powered Subwoofer System (Black), but all the bad reviews about early failures and very poor customer support turned me off, so instead I bought the much higher rated, more reliable, and higher poweredPioneer TS-SWX251 10" Flat Subwoofer with Enclosure 800 Wattsalong the two Amazon recommended "Frequently Bought Together" items:Boss Audio R1100M Mosfet Monoblock Power Amplifier with Remote Subwoofer Level Controland theBoss KIT-2 Complete 8 Gauge Amplifier Installation Kit. I chose to have it professionally installed in my 2010 Honda Accord by the Best Buy Geek Squad Car Audio Installation Team for just $99. When I arrived for the appointment, they inspected the three items that I had, but said that one crucial item was missing for which they charged me an extra $20. The missing item was thePAC SNI35 Adjustable 2-Channel Line Out Converterfor which Amazon charges only $10.93. So if you purchase this system be sure to include these THREE extra items. The installation took a little over two hours and the sound is terrific and you can't see any wires. I would highly recommend that you consider a professional installation, as the installation is VERY complicated. The installer told me to give the subwoofer a week or so to break-in and operate it initially at no more than medium volume. After the break-in period, he said it was OK to operate at a higher full volume. I am very pleased with this combination and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting excellent sounding bass that actually vibrates the car at just medium volumes! I can't wait to hear it a full volume.
Compared to the other quiet keys (and nearly all keyboards), the space key (which is obviously used very frequently) is incredibly clacky. I've found this to be true on multiple MS natural 4000 keyboards in our IT dept. It's a design flaw, and makes the keyboard wholly unusable. I don't want to type on a typewriter all day, and that's what it sounds like.
I read the description and thought this would be perfect for our needs. After setting it up, it didn't sound off for any movement.  After several tries it worked twice, but then stopped again.  I was only a few feet away.  I tried at further distances and it still only worked in 2% of the tests.  Tried different locations, with clear line of vision and also without, but it still failed to work properly.  I kept trying for a few days and no good.  It is pretty rare I receive an item that is this bad, but it happened with this thing.  This product is not even worth $0 (free).  I would rather pay $100 on something that works.
Purchased for my business to alert me when I was in the back room and someone opened the door - worked great for the first couple of months-now the alarm will not turn off. Nothing is effecting the unit -motion,batteries light,tempeture,or sound but the alarm still will not shut off1. Is indoors, so weather conditions do not apply2. Placed on floor under a cabinet, so bright light does not apply,3. Moved to dark location off the floor where there can be no movement-no luck4. Changed batteries-did not fix the problem.5. Hid sensor in a drawer-turned on receiver (placed it in a  drawer in a different room)and the alarm has not stopped and is still going after 25 minutes!Total waste of money!
The thing goes off, every minute to two if it's sunny, for no reason.  Tried taping over part of the eye, like instructions said, moving it, etc.  Still does not work right.  Then in the evening, it doesn't go off, even when somebody walks right in front of it.  JUNK.
I was very pleased for about 19 days.About 4:30 AM the sender went into 'alert' every 4 seconds. Wrote to BigFly Sports via Amazon. I wondered why I did not hear back. Checking at Amazon, they did not give this site an accurate email address so my query bounced back. I didn't realize this til the 30 day return period had passed.Out $25 for nothing.Avoid this product and Stay Away from Big Fly Sports.
This hub is not 2.0.  This is an antiquated hub and will work very slowly if you're doing any data transfer at all.  I had transfers completely stop after one minute.Also, it doesn't come with a power cable, although there is a port for power.  Very cheap linksys.Avoid, and get the belkin 4-port, which is powered AND 2.0.
First, it's my fault.  I did NOT clearly read the info.THIS IS AN OUTDATED USB 1.0 hub.I never imagined that Linksys would still be selling such an outdated and basically useless item.  Had it been USB 2.0 compliante it would be ***** and a great item.  But sadly, it's not and is so slow even the computer flashed a message suggesting I use a better product.
Wasted my money for this SLOW hub...Be aware that if you want to connect your printer, scanner, ipod etc. to this device, think again!
For what they are, these are good headphones at a good price (because they are being discontinued soon).  But I can't stand them.  I find them uncomfortable and disorienting because they close out all outside sounds, and form an air-tight seal around my ears.  In addition, they crush my head and after a short time I have to take them off and throw them across the room.  BUT, if you like over the ear headphones, these are certainly a good deal and sound fine.I tried using them with a mic (playing Left 4 Dead 2 on my computer), and it was very disorienting as you can't hear your own voice.  So that was a bust as well.I have a pair of Sennheiser active noise canceling supraaural headphones, and I find them more comfortable, lighter, and generally more pleasant to use (but those aren't for everyone either.  Some people can't wear those noise canceling cans, they can give you vertigo in rare instances). I picked the HD 202 for my teenage son, and he couldn't stand them (for the same reasons I can't), which is why I ended up with them.  But I won't use them either.  In the end, I use some cheap over the ear clip on things I found at TJ Max one lucky day.  They are light, you can hear the wife asking you a question, and you can put a quality USB headset over them to talk in L4D2 if necessary.
I bought these pair of headphones because of the 600+ reviews that largely say positive things about the sound quality. I agree with those reviews - the sound is balanced (slightly weighted towards the bass and low frequencies). However, I returned these headphones within a couple weeks of using them because I developed blisters below both my ears - where the headphone rests on the head.I don't have a large head by any standards. However, these headphones are incredibly tight-fitting. The cushioning is just not enough to offset the crushing effect that these headphones have on your ears and head. The cushioning foams are not deep enough and your ear lobes will hit the hard part of the headphone inside. This hard surface usually also has cushions in other brands such as Koss, however, there is none in Sennheiser HD 202s.If you wear headphones for a couple hours in a day, perhaps they might be okay. However, if you are getting the Sennheiser HD 202s for extended wearing (5-6 hours at a stretch), be prepared to face some pressure pain (or blisters like me). I sincerely hope that the Sennheiser folks are seeing these reviews - delivering sound quality is just not enough if you make them so tight that they hurt like hell after a while!Amazon was very gracious about the return and refunded me promptly.
There is more to this product and you need to investigate it before buying. Purchased this and a Canon 50D adapter to shoot using a telescope. I could not get this product to work properly and called a good resource for advice. After an hour of technical discussion we determined it would not function with my system.so it sits in the purchased but does not work pile
Installed it exactly as directions indicate but there was absolutely no change in the picture quality.  I may try hooking it up at the point the cable enters the house and if there is an improvement I'll revise this review but so far it's been a waste of money.
I have Comcast cable in my home.  The cable comes in from the outside and then is split two ways.  The first split feeds my main floor where I have two cable outlets.  The second split feeds my second floor where I have one cable outlet, so 3 cable outlets altogether.  The reception on my second floor and one outlet on first floor have always been sub-par so I purchased the Motorola 484095-001-00 Signal Booster to help. After a few weeks of testing and multiple ways of installing it, it has provided zero improvement in my signal.Some reviewers claim that you MUST install this at the entry point of your home.  I'm not sure where they get that information from, but I tried this way first and no improvement.  I then tried the booster at each cable outlet and it showed no improvement.  I tried many differnet combinations and many different channel tests and the signal was the same regardless.  I even tried moving TVs around to test if it was the TV and no it was not.  I moved VCRs as well.I have ensured that all my cable connections are snug, all the wiring is good.  Now, understand that my picture on the poorer reception outlets is not terrible, it is just lower than what it should be.  The cable booster should improve the picture, but it doesn't.
Maybe mine was defective (I returned it, didn't want to waste time trying to get it checked out).  My signal was pretty good (analog cable), but went thru a splitter, and was slightly degraded on some stations.  With this booster, it was a lot more degraded.  I swapped it with a simple male-to-male barrel connector for testing, and the picture was much, much worse with this booster.
My signal strength went from 86-88 to 87-89.  Not worth the electricity it uses.  And what is up with the RG59 cables?  Anybody who is serious about signal quality will only use RG6.  It is being sent back for a refund.
I bought this product to boost our Internet connection. Description said that it will improve cable modem signal. However, when I connected this device, our Internet connection completely stopped.I tried it a couple of times. Without the device, I can get to the Internet (albeit at an unsatisfactory speed). With the device, no connection at all.So, I returned the product to Amazon.
I was unable to get the device to work.  I am returning it for a competing model.
I'm technically savvy but I couldn't get it to work with my network.  I also brought it in to Best Buy to see if they could get it to work and they couldn't.  From reading reviews there is clearly a problem with some of these units just not working.
These are good enough for what I need in headphones for walking around, but they always break. I mean, I understand that everything will eventually break - but things are only inexpensive if they last a reasonable amount of time. If these cost $15 and you need to buy 4 pairs a year, compared to ones that cost $25 and they last two years, the latter are the less expensive pair.Being cheap, I would prefer if these would just not break so easily - and it isn't that I'm being rough with them - I treat them well, but eventually they die (usually the sound goes out in the left ear).I am no longer going to get these, fool me... 4 times. Doh!
1.  I got these to replace my old / yellow Sony sports headphones (similar design).2.  They sound fine, but as one of the other reviewers noted--> these headphones are very poorly constructed; I broke them within 2 weeks (the weak joint is the plastic part that moves in / out).  I thought, "ok, my fault, I'll be more careful"--> thus I bought another pair--> broke those as well, while just routinely opening them up etc...3.  Since these are to be used by folks doing sports etc... I can't understand why Sony made such a poorly constructed headphone.
Broke when folding gently after one month of running with them.Very uncomfortable for ear, would never buy again.If this is supposed to be for sport use it's a joke.
I've gone through many different sets of headphones as a runner and I'm always looking for some that are comfortable, stay in my ear, and don't break.  I've never found a set that meets all three criteria. These phones have pretty decent sound, but did not stay in my ear very well, especially once I started sweating.  The phones would sit in my ear okay, but if I wanted really good sound I would have to push down on the bud into my eardrum and instantly it would sound twice as good/loud. After I would start to sweat, the buds would gradually get looser and move farther from my ear drum.  On really long runs they would even pop out of my ear completely.In addition to the eardrum fit, I did not like the way they fit over the head.  I would have to adjust the phones and tighten them at least once a mile, and I couldn't wear a cap or head covering in the winter with these as they're too stiff to put anything over. The cord from the phones is pretty bad too, as it twists into itself just slightly and is never truly straight.  Finally, I don't know what the Sweat Guard Mechanism is for because the functionality of these phones drops 50% at least once I started sweating. And like every pair of phones I've had, they went mono and the left phone eventually stopped working, almost surely because it was ruined by sweat.I would have given these phones 2 stars because, despite how cheap they are, they did last me around 200 miles of use, which is more than most phones last me, but I have to give it 1 because they specifically advertise it in a way that makes you think it is "sweat-proof," but I can almost guarantee you if you sweat enough these phones will eventually succumb to it, just like pretty much every sport headphone on the market today.
Broke 3 times in 3 different spots within 3 weeks!  Cheap brittle plastic breaks very easily.  The sound is great, and the waterproof is great, but what good is that if you can't wear them.  I'm not very rough with them either.Do yourself a favor and buy the version that does not fold up.  I had those for years and bought the fold up ones because I lost my non-fold up version.  The non-foldup version has the same sound, very durable, and seem to last forever.
Not the aspect ratio of widescreen. It is not wide enough for your 15&#34; Elitebook.
This privacy protector works so well not even the user can see what they are doing!  That's a slight exaggeration but not by much, it is so dark even with the brightness of my laptop turned all the way up, it is really hard to see through it.  Also, it throws off color quality enormously so if you need to see correct colors, this isn't for you.Another knock against this is that it's not a film that &#34;sticks&#34; to your screen, you have to stick a bunch of small plastic tabs around the edge of your screen and slide the privacy filter down into the space created.  If you are carryign your laptop while closed and it turns even slightly upside down, the filter slides out.I would give this at least 2 stars if not for the price.
I'll keep this short - the actual filter works fantastic. It fits my 17" Macbook Pro perfectly and does exactly what it's supposed to do. Unfortunately, the cheap plastic stick-on tabs that they expect you to mount the filter with are awful - they don't adhere well at all to my screen, and I constantly have to restick/adjust them every time I open/close the laptop.It does what it's supposed to do, but I wouldn't recommend it due to the terrible design of the mounting stickers.A month or two later, and it's in the trash. Tabs are junk, filter doesn't fit newer Dell laptops. Useless and overpriced.
This does not work for Macbook air, 11.6. You see jagged lines on filter surface, makes reading harder for you as well.
The strain relief on the 3.5mm connector is sub-par, which caused mine to lose the left channel to an internal broken wire due to repeated strain.  You should handle it carefully: don't let the cable near the connector bend too much or it will have issues.I've since learned that the cable is also poorly shielded, to the point that it is picking up a local pop music station.  I'm disappointed in Belkin, I used to trust their cables to be strong and reliable; apparently not anymore.Would not buy again, nor recommend to others.  I'm going to replace this with theMediabridge - 3.5mm Male To (2) RCA Stereo Audio Cable - (25 Feet)shortly, as the 12 foot cable will no longer serve my needs.  Plus it was awful anyways.
as far as I can tell this cable is not a belkin branded cable and it caused a buzzing sound in my speakers.
This is a belkin cable and came in the sealed packaging as shown. The cable is of a nice sturdy thickness, and seems well constructed. I got this cable at the end of February 2013. Now in March 2013, not quite a month later, the right channel started to cut out. By adjusting the cable coming out of the mini jack I can get the right channel to come in, but I'm very disappointed that this cable is already failing. I admit I do unplug and plug the cable into different devices, but I really didn't expect to start having signal problems so soon. The cable seemed well constructed but apparently not so well. If you don't mess with the cable you could be alright with it, but if you will be plugging and unplugging it often, be aware that it will probably start to cut out all too soon.
Simply terrible. Out of the box it was all stretchted out and ruined to begin with. As best I could tell it wasn't a return or anything. These are just very cheaply made. And of course I needed it /right then/ so no return possible.
unraveled in 50 days - don't waste your money - it cheaply made.I got what I paid for. Alot of crap
