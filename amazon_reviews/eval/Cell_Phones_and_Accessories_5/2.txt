I am disappointed that the 1A didn't work with my iPad.  That's what I get for buying a cheap adapter.
After a week only one side works
Didn't last very long. Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I shouldn't have expected it to last.
I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time. My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on, it will not charge while powered on.
I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.
I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.
It looked like it was used! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again
The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period.  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it, I've noticed that it doesn't come apart like most vehicle chargers.
WHAT A GREAT PRICE!RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE ...DON'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARD,OR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE ...BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT, AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WASN'T CHARGING. SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER.
It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord........The charger itself working fine up to this point..........Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $19.00
I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet. It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone.
Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the,Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ..... The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well....I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems....I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct!Ugh!
I bought this for the at&t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was very slow in getting this item to me. I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2, but the cut outs was NOT good. The cut out opening was too small for the power button, there was also an extra cut out for no reason. It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars, but bad opening for my phone will be costly.
well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last.  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall.  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything.  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but don't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc.
This charger doesn't work very well. When plugged in, it shows that it is charging, but after ten minutes I'm lucky to get 1% more on my battery. I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower...that's really all it's good for.
The plug fits and it charges my Captivate, it felt rather snug. The "retractable"-ness of this charger is anything but. Plain ol' doesn't work. I literally took it out of the package, and the first time I pulled the cord out - didn't yank, tug, or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it. I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length. The main reason I wanted this was for the "retractability" since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now.
When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half. Lesson learned,cheap things break too quickly.
Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality.
I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150. This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone. I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends. It's nothing fancy, no volume control and no mute, but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone. Price does not determine sound quality. I recommend this product.
The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you.  This is pretty important to me, so I only give it 2 stars.  I have used it extensively with both my cell phone and my cordless phones at home with the same problem.
I don't think this will last very long.  I was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment, but I don't think it would last very long.  Plus, the cord is too short for desktop use.
the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g. not a big fan, just use a credit card instead
Pros- Good tool set if you need to take things apart.Cons- They came in a plastic bag (no case)- They're extremely flimsy plastic that makes me feel like if I use them over 10 times, they're going to break.I don't recommend this at all and would recommend you buy something other than this.
These are all torx drivers, there is no flathead or phillips in this set, which is going back to Amazon today.
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these.
These things were terrible.  The &#34;Boom&#34; would keep pulling the ear but out of my ear and I couldn't keep anything in place. The cord was very flimsy... It was just an all around bad buy.  Wouldn't do it again.
This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban.I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players.
Seems great at first. But sound is kind of shaky, almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact. Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again. It'll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in. Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell. pull on your device too quickly and it'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck.
I would like to say that this is not cheap junk, but it did nothing at all for my cell reception.On the other hand I have an iPhone with AT&T;, so it could be that combination doesn't work with it.It appears it worked for a few people with a different phone, so I am going to be generous and give it 2 stars, taking into account it could have been my unit.;-)
I purchased this for my sisters phone. She continually has calls dropped, so I got her this signal booster, and it hasn't made a bit of difference. I bought these before for my previous cell phones, and they really seemed to help. But apparently not so much anymore.
the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20.  Sony took my address and said they would, but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged!  It's been 3-4 years and it still works.  It went through the washing machine and half the dryer.  It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes-  it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc.  I buy  a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes.  It's been a great little phone.
Great features - except for the phone one.  Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses).  However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one.  If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)
I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon's specs for the T610 phone. T-mobile told me the talk time is 5 hours (300min). Who do you believe? I am tired of liars and money-gobbling b*st*rds!
Considering how old the phones that use this type of battery are, I am not surprised that I received a used battery. I am a little mad at the fact that the product listing said these batteries would be new though. The battery I received holds the charge for about a day, which is the same as my old one.Disappointing indeed.
As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned, the problem is with the connector jack, the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack, which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin. When they are new they work very, very good, excellent sound quality.
This didn't work in my phone. It was rather cheap, I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made!
This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried.  I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used.  I would not recommend this product. I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased!
I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers.  One tried to get it to work, and finally gave up.  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call.  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time...if there is a next time.
Positives: Bluetooth, IR port, VGA Camera, multiple e-mail accounts, speaker phone, more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S. I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives: phone too big; voice recognition worthless, low volume from ear piece, IR port weak so TV remote control programs don't work well, slow menu's and response. Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you (Opera has problems on this phone, but works most of the time). T-Mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few seconds, although Nokia made it adjustable, and T-Mobile won't fix it.
This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer). My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web, you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots, this phone will probably satisfy you. If you need Bluetooth, stay away.
i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it, but what i didn't test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it, EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours, i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment, but damn, i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically, count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c'mon people, us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range, range, range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time, what's the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say, it's for sale on ebay!
Magnetic mounting is a joke.  It is guaranteed to fall over, scratch your roof and generally be a pain in the buttocks.I wish this antenna were offered with a NMO mount.  It would be very nice to mount this securely, and well worth the trouble and effort to achieve a good mechanical and electrical connection to an auto roof.
This didn't do much for me. Unfortunately, it may not be the blame. Ironically, I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world, I'm sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage, location, type of usage, cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together, for a whole home solution, you'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system.
I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as "standard" as one might hope!) However, it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase, so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed, it is a good choice.  Otherwise, I suggest looking at other designs.
This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever, I've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well ----- however, the connection speeds take forever to establish ---- in addition, the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 --- I've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary.....UPDATE: I have also tried the Moto 850 ---- sadly, it is really no better than the 810 --- there are some volume improvements, but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 ---- I recommend the Scala 500
I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK, but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect, ie. no background or wind noise, and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off, when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws.
It's a great deal, so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar, wish i could return that! But this headset, thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone, but no. It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving.
I've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst. The sound quality is low, especially outdoors, and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250. I've used those in the past and found them much better overall, and worth the extra price.
The voice reception with this headset was just ok. Sometimes people on the other side had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving. I also get a tingling sensation around my ear and a mild ache in the outer part of my ear everytime I use it. It may be something to do with  the design of the head set. Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain, and I have to believe them...It's weird though that I get always get a tingling, achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes. So try as I might, I cannot wear it for prolonged periods of time. After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging. I did this as other reviewers had warned against over-charging. However, now the headset just died...after 2 months. I called Motorola and they agreed to replace it. It takes about 10-14 days from the time you send it in to get a new one. I'm waiting for the replacement to come back. Who knows how long this one will last!
This headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not a great deal either.  The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy, long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.  When I compared the two chargers, they were identical.
and i'm fairly disappointed! i bought this little gem at a cingular kiosk in the mall for $80 and i am thinking it's going back before my 30 days are up! in summary, considering bluetooth still has some improvements to make, this is just NOT worth $80, period. even if this device worked flawlessly, it might be worth about $30 at best.here are my gripes:* it says it has a range of about 30 feet. hmmm...not really. i am even using this headset with a motorola phone (V505)and i can get about 20 feet away from it at best before the audio quality goes south. not the biggest deal in the world. even when i am close to the phone however, there can be some interferance ("crackling") and distortion. usually mild though. it seems like my microwave interferes with it (when it's cooking)!* doesn't fit snugly on my ear. rather, it kind of "hangs" there. it doesn't have any kind of mechanism for adjustment, so here's hoping it fits your ear. using this headset while lying down is hard to do; the device doesn't seem to want to stay put.* drops the bluetooth connection every now and again, even when i am at close range.the "good":* looks cool! ;)* battery life seems to be pretty good.* small, lightweighti am going to look into some other options. this simply was a waste of money.
The audio is very soft of this headset.  I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it.  Also, it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone, so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds.
I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room.
Lasted 3 months, lucky I have two(charge one, while using the other), the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use, hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though, but These items need to last the day.
This headset seems to work fine, but the audio quality is nothing to write home about, to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone. They will also hear a lot of background noise. I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset. It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan.
I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s. I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae&#8217;s which needed to be pulled out of the phone.  Since the phone antennae&#8217;s have changed, I haven&#8217;t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them. I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth. The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters.
This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone, I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength. I guess that's the reason why they're selling so cheap. Do not waste your time with this product.
We've had the Sidekick II for about two months.  Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to "press 1 for English", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter "A" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.
Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing, web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go.  You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.
I regret buying this phone, it's really big, and verizon service isn't that great with this phone.  For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1, or will have 1 bar when i'm getting no service.  That said, the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD, the outer LCD is pretty bad.  You can play with the settings. It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of.  The camera is terrible, which is pretty much true with all cell phones though, so that's a non unique gripe. The phone is also moderately fruity, like when you make or recieve calls, the outer LED will start blinking purple, blue, pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl, and the menus are all kind of childish.  That said, when the phone does have some bars, calls never drop and it's pretty easy to set up the phone.  I'm not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones, i recently switched from tmobile, but im sure you can do better than this phone, good luck.
I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away. It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets, I can't say if it is the headset or the phone, but either way, if you buy one of these and have the same problem, make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well, but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I'm talking to them with the headset, and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck!
I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz,bells and whistles, and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced, as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn't, and am returning it.  I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it's no good, I'll probably go with a Jabra, and spend a bit more money.
Set it up, it worked great for a little over 24 hours and the base unit failed to connect to my laptop. Returned and purchased a different item. Didn't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing.  Can't afford to be offline for as long as it will take to get this replaced.To be fair, I have used several Plantronics headsets and they were all great... my all time favorite is now 10+ years old and not compatible with Google Voice (though it does work great with Cisco IP phone). I also have a bluetooth Plantronics Voyager headset for my iPhone and it is also very good.
I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it. The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box, so call them, don't write.While the sound quality of the unit is very, very good, there are other issues with the unit. First, the fit on my particular ear is horrible... always feeling like it was going to fall off. I never trusted it walking through airports as it just didn't feel secure.Second, the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months. The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose, then broke off. I note that others have metioned the same thing. It just wasn't well constructed. Bummer! I've replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics, but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo, I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality.
Let me say up front that I ordered this from Amazon after reading all the glowing reviews, and I've been fairly disappointed by the performance I've experienced.  My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint's LG-PM325.First, the audio quality was not good.  If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.  Pairing was excellent.  The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably, and making or answering calls was straightforward.I've returned mine because of the two problems.
Let me begin this review by stating that a lot of people have used this device quite successfully.  As for me, there were two main problems.  First, I found the sound level to be too low.  While it's easy enough to turn up the volume, the problem lies in the microphone being so close that it causes a major echo for the person on the other end.  The second problem I had was that I was never able to transfer a call from the device to the phone.  I tried to use this model for a couple weeks just to make sure but, after that time, I decided to send it back and keep looking.
I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece, where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end, even landline to landline, there is an annoying whine and some echo, no matter what the setting.  This isn't good enough, I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon.
I could NOT get it charge. Did not sent it back because it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it. I ask for help on this and got no where. But I did order Nokia BL-5C and it works great.
This Bluetooth sucks. Plain and simple... I mean I paid, what, $15 for the thing so wasn't expecting the best but at least working quality. I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $60 but I always lose them. Always! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I wouldn't cry in the corner losing out on a day&#8217;s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my (what is this my 6th) Bluetooth. But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it. Hell, even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks! So yeah just spend the extra cash and go up a few grades because this was a lost cause.
I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710. Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry. The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software. Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710. To bad, the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me. If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it.
My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket. There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling. I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don't know whether its the service or phone. Overall i want to like the phone but i'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it.
I doesn't hold a charge for very long which is to be expected for an inexpensive battery.  You really do get what you pay for, don't you?
They are probably old batteries sitting on a shelf by the time we got them. Not much better than the old ones I was replacing.
I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby (not making calls) before it went dead.  I thought I had a problem with my RAZR V3M so I took it in and was informed that these batteries do not have enough milliamps required for the RAZR.  They replaced it with the correct battery and I have been using that one now for over a year with no problem.
Quality and value of this item are fine, but WHOA, it smells SO BAD!! Just like bug spray! I returned it promptly.
Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all. You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse. Money part needs length to really pack some cash in. Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase.  Id say purchase a cheaper product like this. Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless.  Buyer be aware. Update. I stopped using this. The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it. Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces. Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone.
I bought this for my daughter to use on her vacation cruise. The magnetic clasp erased her room card and credit card. Kind of defeats the purpose of the clutch. It might be ok if you just used your drivers license phone and cash but people don't really carry cash and to have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic.
I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone. However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none. I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone. I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore. I tried it again to make sure it was the cover, and sure enough it did the same thing as before. I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2. So I had to return the case for a refund. It is disappointing because it was a great looking case.
Not a very well made case, thought it would be of better quaility, hard to tell from just looking at it on the site.
This is the 8th headset I have tried. Most of the ones I have purchased work very well with a cell phone, but not so good on a cordless phone. Same with this set... Very comfortable to wear. I can hear those I call really well. Those that I call need to be able to hear me too! The volume on this mic is better than most I have tried, but is still low. If you are talking to clients on the phone all day, this is important. I have a good Panasonic cordless phone and have yet to find a headset to use with it that has a strong volume. Still looking.
I can have this plugged in from Atlanta to Greensboro and the phone isn't much more charged than when I started.  But the phone doesn't die, either.
used for 1 month before it broke - also not 2.1 amps  - both usb slots do not produce enough current for sgs4
I love my Kindle Fire, but I hate the micro plug.when plugging in a charger cord, I find that sometimes it doesn't recognize that the plug is in and sometimes I have to jiggle it a little to get the charging box to turn green to show that it is, in fact, charging. I cannot stand the A/C wall charger that came with the Fire. It is ridiculously short making it very difficult to find a place to charge it safely and I have purchased several of these cords since last Christmas and a majority work for a while and then break or don't work at all. Sometimes it is hit or miss and then sometimes a cord charges and then sometimes it acts up and refuses to charge. I have the same plug on my Samsung Stratosphere and I don't seem to have the same problem.With this cord the part that plugs into the Fire virtually fell apart. I don't care how much you pay for one of these type of cord, they should all work. When I started using it, this cord "appeared" on my visual inspection to be well made, but I guess looks are deceiving. The cord, of course, fell apart after the return date so I'm stuck.I really don't recommend this cord. I realize that it could be just a single defective one,but, of the three other reviews, only one person out of four of us recommended this cord. So just beware.
When I bought these, I thought they'd fast charge a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, but they don't.  They will slow charge.  I have tried multiple cables, including the original Samsung cable which allows for a fast charge, but found this didn't help.  Somewhere I read that they have to be specially configured to fast charge a Samsung device or otherwise they'll charge slowly despite which port of the charger you use.
I had a previous version of this product a few years ago. It lasted for about two year until a capacitor blew out. You could see it through the translucent case. I like the previous version. This one not so much.The AC prongs do not fold in so they are in the way when being used in a lighter outlet or stored in a pocket or computer back.It's larger than the combination of some separate ac only and 12v only chargers I have, so there is no space savings.When connected to my ipad or my razr maxx, the screen keyboard malfunctions. Spurious and random characters are generated when the screen is touched instead of the keys that should be detected. Unplugging the cable immediately stops this problem.I contacted BoxWave and they did send me a return shipping label. I have not gotten around to returning the charger yet. I dont know if this is a design issue or if I just got a bad unit. But the first two issues are reasons I would not recommend these even if the malfunction is just a bad unit.
This case looks *FANTASTIC*, seriously. It's easily one of the classiest, most beautiful cases I've ever owned for a phone. The leather is great, it feels comfortable, it's just a seriously awesome case.The problem is, I want to use it as a basic wallet as well, and it fails miserably at that. The entire case is so tight you can hardly fit your cards in (I only want 3 cards and my drivers license. The fit is so tight you can barely get them in, once you do, the case doesn't close very well over the phone.I guess I could go back to a wallet, but I really didn't want to do that. I wanted to use this as a "pick up my phone and my car keys and go" arrangement. No more fumbling for wallet, but this cannot fit that bill. This case would have been far better off leaving all the extra storage out, and letting it close nicely. Overall, this case is wasted for me, just doesn't cut it, even though I so badly wanted it to.
I used the Motorola H500 before and the sound clarity is not as good as the Jabra BT250v. So I bought this product June 30 to replace my H500. Received it July 11th. The person in the other end of the line noticed that I sounded clearer and louder. Used it while driving to test sound clarity and it passed. My Jabra250v was just used for minutes of light usage (3 hours max in 7 days), but the headphone stopped working August 15. The person on the other line can hear me fine, but I don't hear anything from the headset. I asked Amazon for a refund or replacement, but Al from from customer service emailed me this, "Unfortunately, more than 30 days have passed since you received this item, and we are not able to provide a replacement. Our return policy states that within 30 days of delivery of your order, you may return any merchandise in new condition, with the original packaging and accessories, or any defective merchandise, for a full a refund or replacement. " Fair enough.He gave me a phone number to the Jabra corporation: 619-622-0764&lt;---this number does not work. So I had to go to the Jabra website and ask them for a replacement and or refund. As of August 17 12:54am EST, I have not heard anything from the company.This could be an isolated case. And for a good brand name like Jabra, I hope it is. But it sucks when you get a faulty piece of equipment. I hope you have a better experience with this product than what I have experienced. Just do know that this product is not free from possible defects.
1st month, very good. 2nd month, dropping calls and no one can seem to hear me.  It was like I was not on a wireless bluetooth.  It was bad having to always disconnect this because everyone on the other line could not hear or understand me.  I replaced this after 2 months with the Samsung WEP and have had no problems.  Not worth it.
First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter.  Worked fine, except that the vibrate feature won't work.  Then I exchanged it for another one.  This time the vibrate works, but the call pickup button would not work.  It works for power up/power down.  But I can't pickup any incoming calls.  The button simply wouldn't work for that functionality.  I tried it with few phones and it doesn't work.  I already exchanged the jabra adapter once.  Now I'm sick of exchanging it.  I think jabra has bad quality control.  Someone in the quality control shd be fired!  Everytime you exchange something, you run into a new problem.
I love not having the wire, but the microphone is so close to the earpiece that everyone I talk to with the headset is annoyed and complains about hearing themselves (in echo). This problem can be diminished somewhat by turning the volume down, but then I can't hear the person I'm talking to either (unless I'm in a perfectly silent place). Other than this design flaw, the headset is a nifty gadget with elegant controls, good battery life, etc.
I was very dissapointed with its audio performance. I don't want to write a lot because others have definitely written the positive features in good detail(good microphone, quick connect, good battery life, light-weight etc.), but the usability is very restricted.Here is the bottom line, if you want to take this unit outside of your office/home/any quiet environment, you will NOT be able to hear the other person even if the environment is moderately noisy (this is at unit's highest volume). I was using this in the car, and I can hear faint at best when the road is good, but when you pass through slightly patchy freeway, the other person's voice is completely drowned. The speaker's maximum volume is just completely unacceptable. By the way, this experience was inside a luxury car, not a cardboard car. I am not sure the reason behind this design, could be to improve battery life?I had high expectations. I am returning this unit to Amazon and will look at the Jabra BT500 (read good reviews about it: in-ear position & USB charging).By the way, I used this with my Blackberry 7100g, good syncing and quick connection.
I bought this headset to replace my HS820.  I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off. They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this. The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied.
I like the look of this headset, and I really like the fact that flipping the boom turns it on and off instantly.However, the Motorola HS850 performs much worse than my much older Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset.  Everyone I call indicates that I sound muffled, and callers typically ask me to discontinue the use of the headset.  Also, the earpiece speaker is not that loud, so it is rather hard for me to hear callers when there is background noise (e.g., in the car).I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago.  I am giving it to a friend and ordering a different one (Plantronics Voyager 510?).
I had this bluetooth for a week, then I started having issues.  It would disconnect from my phone on its own and then stopped connecting all together.  In addition, it isn't that comfortable to wear for a long period of time.
Hello, Since I am the tech guy at the homestead, I am not the user but hear everything wrong about something when I get it for my wife (sound familiar guys?) I bought this in spring 2012, she used it for two months and liked it and had no complaints about it, I was her hero! But by June it was dead-o-roonie and I was in the dog house again! Any-hoo I was asked to purchase again. I felt the Motorola name that came along with 900+ reviews was enough to make this a good purchase never mind the price under twenty bux? I know, I know, what do you expect for such a low price point? Alot, something that works for a year or more and it seems so did 900+ other buyers. Well, I am onto the Motorola H730, everyone is abuzzin' about that one also, and I will try it for my ever lovin', and see if I can be her hero again for a few months or more? I am quite sure this unit is out of warranty, but if any of you literature readers know about the warranty of this item. Post it here? Thanks in advance.
This was my first clamshell phone, and I like that aspect of the phone, but that's about it.  It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones (all Nokia bar type) in the same coverage areas.  The biggest issue is definitely the battery.  I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days.  This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE.  I don't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds, but it is extremely frustrating.  Also, I am not thrilled with the intuitiveness (or lack thereof) of the menus, but I am sure I would have become familiar with them in time.  I won't have a chance on this phone since I am looking to return mine ASAP.CONS:POOR Battery LifeWorse reception than previously owned phonesNot comfortable to holdPROS:Looks goodCompact
Loved the idea of moving back to a palm device after my sony p900 died. Constant lockups, requiring the removal of the battery to reboot even after doing a firmware update, made me return this to amazon. Will wait for the new sony.
This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too.4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700, but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I'm sending mine back and getting another H700.
This is my second voyager 510.  The first one I had was great, but the charge wasn't lasting anymore, so I ordered this as a replacement....very disappointed with the clarity of the unit.  Lots of static in the background on my end.  People on other end don't seem to hear it, so I just deal with it.
I don't know if it's just me, but every time I buy a blue-tooth it's only great for a couple of months. Read the reviews and was excited but slowly performance diminished.
I bought this to pair with a Sony Ericsson Walkman phone, and have been disappointed.1) Sound and voice quality are fine, but this thing is way too sensitive to wind.  I can't use it outside if there is any wind current, and even the air currents from my car's AC or heat are too much for it.2) Most disappointingly, the microphone boom cracked in half after about 60 days.  I am working with Plantronics' warranty department, but they need a "date code," which is unreadable without a magnifying glass.  I will update once I have some resolution.3) This device only works for the Ericsson's phone functions, not music, because the Walkman music functions use the "A2DP" Bluetooth protocol, and the 510 is not A2DP compatible.  (Yes, listening to music with just one earpiece could be lame, but I would love to have podcasts on my phone).  For A2DP, you need something like the Jabra 8010 or 8040.4) Contrary to some reviewers, I didn't have any problem using this with glasses.  It's a little heavy, but basically fine.
This was great for the first 2 months.  Month 3, it started dropping calls. By month 4, it was dropping more calls than it was answering.  I replaced it with another bluetooth, because I couldn't take it anymore.  I wouldn't recommend this.  I now have the Samsung WEP and after a few weeks, no problems as of yet.
i bought this one because of the excellent review, however, after pairing it to my Treo 650 and using it for a couple of days, i'm quite disappointed.  The sound quality is ok, sound level is on the low side and some noises from time to time.  i had a Samsung WEP200 too and had better quality than this one, and Samsung WEP200 is about half of the price of this.  then there is the usability issue too, sometimes i hear the phone ringing, and pushed the button to accept the call and it wouldn't connect right away, had to wait several seconds to establish the link, the Samsung WEP200 and another Motorola ear piece i had did not have this problem.
If you wear glasses most of the time like I do, this headset will not be comfortable for you. In fact, I couldn't keep it on without constantly adjusting it. So the sound was not good. I sent it back for a Sony over-the-head headset.
I bought this because of all the positive reviews and was surprised when it was not very good but Plantronics does not support my cell phone the Treo 755P. It would have been nice to know this from the web site prior to purchasing. I love the sound quality of the Jawbone but it does not fit me-and many others.The hunt continues and Plantronics says it does not have any bluetooth headsets for the 755P!Caveat emptor!
This charger worked fine for a while but now it has a bad connection somewhere inside. I have to jiggle the body of it around until a good connection is produced. The problem is not the wall outlet -- this happens in any outlet in any building.
his and the white version of wireless headphone for ipod is being clearanced elsewhere for a good reason. I got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough, which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are. It is only a matter of time. Mine cracked within a week, and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful. Unless you have a really small head (maybe the size of a softball), don't mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service, don't get it. it looks and sounds good otherwise, and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio (a2dp). it's a pity.
I must have called Verizon ten times in four months, nagging them to offer the Treo 650 on their network. I almost deserted them to get the phone, but in mid-June, I finally got my Verizon branded Treo 650. It has not been a great experience.First the positives. It is very cool to have all my contacts, all my appointments and todo items on my phone. While the phone is large by today's cell phone standards, it is a great looking unit and functions well. It is easy to set up email and web access and it is great to be able to stay in touch with the normal too-much-email office when I am traveling.However, it is not all great news. First, I have had a heck of a time keeping the unit synchronized with my office Outlook. I get duplicates by the tons and, worse, deleted contacts. The dupes are somewhat tolerable to deal with, but losing contacts, which slip into my deleted Outlook folder is not acceptable. No one has been able to tell my why this is happening.Second, the reception and volume of the phone are horrible. Where my old Motorola TC30 could get calls in awful reception areas, the Treo is spotty inside my own house. I lose calls in transit and while sitting still. Worse, the volume is very faint. I purchased a software tweak called VolumeCare which slightly amplifies the wimpy sound from the phone, but distorts it as well. About the only acceptable solution is to use a headset and plant that sound right in your ear! Not a convenient or very affordable solution.All-in-all, I'm disappointed in the Treo. It has some nice features, but it is very disappointing as a phone.
It's okay, I think this is gonna fall under the category of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Only had to use it for a day or two because that cellphone broke.
this ear pec is not so good its like a prop from a old movie you no syfy star trak.
Plug this in. Sometimes it connects; sometimes it doesn't.I hear callers just fine, but they ask if I am in the bathroom when I wear this.If I leave it plugged into the earphone jack of my phone, it somehow manages to turn my phone off after a few minutes of non-use.I would send it back, but my total cost was only $3.My phone is an older Motorola v365, and I'm sticking with to my BluetoothPlantronics 510 [Retail Packaging]. Maybe this can be an emergency backup.
I gave up and threw mine away when it would not work correctly on any device. Ear phones on one, Mic on another. Poor Quality. I expected better from Jabra!
I thought that I was buying the right one and it ends up that I did but not the right size plug for the phone.
It will vary by individual but it didn't fit my ear. It was also in a small plastic bag so who knows where it came from. What do you expect for the price which I can't complain about.
Bottom line: can't use because the volume of my voice is too low for people to easily hear.  Bought off of ebay after my c200 cord was cut.  The c200 worked well, but this c250 with the longer "boom" mic extension was not as loud.  Jabra headsets are very comfortable and easy to wear all day.  Reasonably easy to put on with one hand once you get the hang of it.  I am not sure if my problem was unusual, but these corded headsets seem to be hit or miss.  I have had other brands where the sound quality is not very good or too low.I will just reorder another c200 and take my chances with that.
My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones. She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100.Pairing the device was relatively easy, once you followed the written instructions. However, we've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions, and have to run the pair-up process again.When they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don't work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh, it will call and we'll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of "hello-hello? HELLO?" Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected.When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down.More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often, that can cause a problem.Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good.On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.Even though I can't take this headset back, I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone. The BT350 simply doesn't meet any of those standards.
This earpiece was a great idea, but the main issue with it is that it has no noise reduction, and that it begins to crackle too easily when my arm or body part gets in between it and the phone. Some may say that's normal, but NO--there are plenty Motorolas and Sony-Erricsons that have stronger connectivity that don't crackle as easy when obstructed, so don't buy into that line.
I bought it expecting it to be much better than the one I've had for almost two years now. Big disappointment. The static I used to get from the bt250 has not gone away especially when I have my phone in my left pocket of my pants and the headset on my right ear. Also, people tell me my voice sounds remote like I am in a room.This is not acceptable. I am going back to BestBuy to return it. Why pay $120 if there's no added value?!No doubt, it wraps around your ear very snug unlike the Motorola headsets but there's virtually no improvements compared to BT250.And let me guess - the next Jabra model would be BT500v for vibrate. I can tell you now - I ain't buying that one either.I guess it'll be a while before someone comes up with a headset that's not static-y but I'm willing to wait.Roumen.
10 years into the cell phone revolution the phones have gotten smaller, lighter with great features but what's the point when you can't carry on a conversation? I have found Cingular to be by far the worst in terms of dropped calls in the SF Bay Area. I suffered thru AT&T and their conversion to GSM and Cingular is not any better than that service no matter what they promise. Cingular also has very consumer unfriendly 2 yr. contracts that you will be paying on long after that shiny phone has lost its lustre. They are constantly changing their rollover minute plans to screw you out of your minutes. When i downgraded from a higher national plan to a lower national plan they took away all the minutes I aquired in a year. In other words maximize the revenue - minimize the service is their motto.  I could live with this if i could make a decent phone call - i can't believe there are so many dead areas in a place with 13 million people.
The Motorola RAZR V3 is worst cell phone I have ever had.  The only nice feature is the camera and there are a lot of other cell phones with better features that have cameras too.  Also beware of the so-called rebate.  If you don't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it, well go for it but if your time is money, run from this rebate and this phone.  5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool, hip cell phone.  How wrong we all were.  Cingular is fine.  They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us.  3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates.  The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops.  One mistake and you are screwed out of the $150 rebate.Another problem with the phone and it's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look.  All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.I have never written a review before on Amazon or otherwise, but I feel that people should be aware that the cool, hip advertising of the RAZR is not what it is cracked up to be.
I picked up one of these specifically for its ability to retract; it's quite fragile and flimsy, though, and within two days, it had broken and no longer retracts. It's fine as a cable so far, but now it has a heavy middle, which means if I drop it easily as I'm trying to plug it in, and have to go hunting for it between the seats.
This worked for about a week before it stopped staying put when you pulled both ends out. It kept retracting ad then finally just broke. Its a great idea, but this one sucks!
I have used this cable on and off for about a year and a half -- but there were at least six months in the middle there where I had misplaced it and didn't use it at all. It recently went bad -- lost one of the stereo channels. It now connects one channel only.The problem is in the contacts. If I bend the cable near one of the ends I can get the other channel to come in intermittently. Note that I didn't ever fiddle with the ends during normal use. I have only tried the bending game to get the lost channel to come in.If you think the price is worth about 1 year of use, this is the cable you want to get. It certainly is convenient and I like the retractable feature a lot. Just wish it would have lasted longer.
I decided to return this product the moment I took it out of the box. It's cheaply made. My decision was cemented when it stopped working after one day of use.
It lasted me 2 days then it didnt charge I thought it was my battery but no it was the charger
I'm really unimpressed with this headset. Granted, its a pretty old design now (i bought it in 2006) and I imagine there are much better headsets out there.There is way too much static for such a simple, digital device. It is especially bad if I have my phone in the opposite-side pocket as which ear I have the headset in.Certainly you can do better than this by now. Get something with a later bluetooth version.
I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others.  Well, it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for.  Let's consider the following in why I am returning this headset: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use, but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts, I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However, it shouldn't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.Sound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion.  With the speaker resting inside my ear, I didn't have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called.  My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception.  When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 (out of 4), she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel.  Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem, but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset, but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar "Please say a command" from my phone.  However, what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions, but I kept getting "Please say a command".  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing, voice commands, and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work, but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply, this headset isn't for you.Comfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost; however, I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time.  The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear.  It is not removable, and try as I might to adjust it, I could not find a comfortable position.  The ear hook is also fairly rigid.  These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.I have to consider this headset to be a failure.  On the box, it touts "Comfort" and "Ease of Use".  As you can see from my results, it doesn't deliver on either of these.  It's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price.  Unless you have the ear it was modeled after, though, I would not buy it.
Fits my Galaxy Note 3 but just doesn't want to stay on the window...keeps falling off.  Not much good if it keeps falling off.
This would be great product if it lived up to its specs.Pros:1.comfortable2.ease of use3.fantastic sound quality on both ends.Cons:1. Battery doesn't hold a charge2. 12V adapter seems to "cook" the battery.3. has a habit of dropping connection(I think this common to all BT devices)I'm currently on my second "Road Warrior" headset. The first one became extremely hot when charged with the 12V adapter plug & wouldn't hold a charge for over a few hours., I suspect that the truck voltage(14.1V) is too much for this little battery. I haven't tried the auxiliary truck plug on this one as I don't want to fry the battery. The AC power brick has a rated output of 9V so I suspect the 5V difference is what does in the battery. This one I have only used the AC adapter & the battery life is at best abysmal. The info supplied claims a standby life of up to 100 hours & talk time of up to 6 hours. Not even close. Yesterday my unit ran 6 hours standby & 1 hour talk before it had to be recharged. If this unit lived up to it hype I would give it 5 stars, but with its poor battery life I only give it 2. If you can live with the battery issues its a great unit.
The Goose neck is too hard to bend to shape and it doesn't stay put on the windshield very well either. I donated it to a local thrift store because it would have cost more to ship it back than the refund was worth.
Great idea and design, not great execution and materials.It works good, but once mounted, almost impossible to adjust-out the sides with the ratcheting mechanism. You sort of have to tilt it backwards to make the ratchet action work. When mounted, you can't tilt it, so it's a real hassle to open.I have mine set, and I just wedge the phone into it when I want to use it.I primarily use it when driving through New York city, to use my phone as a dash-cam. Eventually I'd like to get video of the people that walk into my car or cyclists that ride into it... It's great for that.It's obvious the plastic or construction material allows it to fall out of tolerance, which means the ratchet action ceases to function. It's a crapshoot when you build a complex mechanism out of parts that break or wear easy, or aren't built to spec in the first place.
It lasted for less than a year and I always had trouble hearing people.  It never sat well on my ear, no matter how I adjusted it.  Luckily, it was less than $20, so no big loss.  I was disappointed because I expected better from Motorola. The volume control was awful. It never seemed to make much of a difference.  I wouldn't recommend it at all.
I bought this for my wife for christmas and i am disapointed in the voice quality.  When she is in the car talking to me on it I can barely hear her because of the car noise and even with her having the radio on low it is still annoying to hear everything in the background.  For the almost $50 price tag i thought it would be better quality since it was the step up from the entry level bluetooth.  I also havent found how to put it on the left ear yet, i feel like i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off.I would recommend spending another $40 and buying the Jawbone bluetooth.  I got one as a present and it works great and fits better on my ear.  I drastically reduces background noise.Overall, I am not impressed by motorola and thought they would make a better bluetooth for this price.
This item did not fit easily on the ear.  Earbud not designed properly.  I would not recommend this product. Also too bulky.
I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City, so it's not a 'counterfeit'.  It pairs well with my Moto Q9C, and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.  I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better.
The H700, some love it, some hate it. Wherever you fall, a lot of people are talking about it.PRO's /  CON'sIt is comfortable and light. / Depending on the size of your face, your cheek may block the microphone resulting in muffled sound.If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.Distance is quoted as  up to 30 feet / Some phone combinations have distance issues if the headset and phone are not on the same side of your body.Pairs well with my Motorola Razr V3 and Cingular 8125. / Other phones and PDA's have problems SO your mileage may vary.The controls are small, multifunction (each button does may things) and are easy to access but hey, they are on the side of your head.Microphone is Very sensitive / People have complained about wind noise, echoes in rooms, and "Who else is in the car with you ?"Headset volume is loud, louder than most / Its adjustable so this is a good thing.The headset lights up in four different colors to show various status (charging, pairing, standby etc) / You can turn off the flashing blue 'I am using a fancy headset dork lamp' but it will come back on after the headset is turned off and on again.A note a caution1. This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market.  Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products.  I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls.  Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints.  Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but few past 10 feet without the call degrading or dropping.SUPPORT3. Motorola gives you 30 days to try and return with refund, However the return shipping is ON YOU.  So with shipping / tracking / insurance expect to spend another $5 even if its their problem. If its longer than 30 days, you are stuck with it.UPDATE 6/1/06Product was returned as defective and received by Motorola 6/15. A new one was to go out 2 day FedEx. 22 Days later I received it today 7/7, NOT NEW, just a refurbished headset. NO charger, manual, case, or  warranty card.UPDATE 11/18/06Died again. Will not pair, make, or answer a call. Motorola will not send a replacement until old one is received.  No free-shipping this time.BOTTOM LINEGoogle "Motorola H700 problems", make an informed decision. If you can, try before you buy.I would give it 5 stars for Style, 3 stars for execution, 2 stars for how well it works, and 1 star for their support policy.
I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700. Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews, it seems that this headset works best with the razr. That being said, it does not work well with the v330. If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone, you get a ton of static. People tell me that I sound muffled when I'm talking to them. My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it.
It's didn't work for me r my phone its as a lot of mess on it I think this seller shouldn't have any more item on the best website I think
This is a replacement for a prior Motorola bluetooth headset of very similar design. I was quite pleased with the old one, until after about 2 years when it just died. That was 2 years of daily service, so not an issue. But this new one has issues holding pairing with a Blackberry 8700G, and has significant voice static unless the Blackberry is on the same side of my body as the headset, and not in the holster. The old one didn't have that problem.On the positive side, the USB mini charger saves me one more power adaptor when traveling, which is a good thing. They should all have that feature.
I love the size, form factor, and usability of this headset.  Incoming sound is good.  Unfortunately, the outgoing sound is a deal breaker.  If there is any background noise, this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice.  The DSP helps a little, but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3).  I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional.  Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic.  I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset, but so far I have not gotten it to work.  I am willing, though, to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound.
I can hear people on it fine but have had nothing but complaints from friends.  I can't use it.
July 2007:Great form factor, mediocre features, weak Mac supportForm:As an exclusive candybar user (Nokia & Sony-Ericsson, both high end and mid range) I was trepidatious of using a slider. In lieu of a decent, nonflip, bluetooth/camera phone w/ Tmobile I went with this phone. Friends and strangers alike say: ooh how pretty. I say ...Pros:1. 1.3 Mp camera2. Bluetooth3. most vivid clear screen I've seen on a cell4. good form factor5. opens & closes very well well (1st edition I had was a little clunky, had a Samsung China sticker on the inside, 2nd edition I had (replaced due to bad mic) doesn't have a manufacturer's tag)6. far better reception inside buildings than my previous SE T610 (w/ Tmo)7. camera has great & funny options such as cartoon bubbles and image overlays which all my friends think are hilarious thereby enhancing the blackmail potential or storytelling function of my phone's camera - good times! This little feature is silly, but makes me smile so much; if all features of the phone made me smile like this, I would have kept this phone.Cons:1. lack of customizability- no "favorites/shortcuts"- soft keys cannot be changed- cannot use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones (on 1st handset (which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem) I could, on 2nd handset, this functionality was gone! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them, whatevs Tmo!)2. lack of functionality- menu inaccessable during calls (cannot text or surf during calls)- no airplane mode- no notes function- poor Mac supprt- - does not work with Mac iSync (although, you can send numbers to phone from Mac Address Book (Menu: Card > Send card) via Bluetooth, which is at least some convenience, but not the convenience of iSync)- - my Mac OS 10.2.8 and OS 10.4.6 computers are unable to use dial up networking via Bluetooth or USB cable (despite the EDGE functionality and the claims of the sweet T-mobile techies who I don't believe)- - Bluetooth (via my Mac) only browses the memory card as far as I can tell, eg, sees pics only in the memory card3. GUI isn't well thought out - menu navigation difficult, sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done (sending a text to multiple people is a major chore), finding files is not intuitive, submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps (compare to the "File" menu on all Windows programs, it's the same because it makes thins easier, Samsung hasn't figured this little design STANDARD out)4. 1.3 Mp camera makes 17-40 kb sized pics ... WTF?!?5. problem with microSD card staying firmly inserted, aftermarket purchased card (necessary for music or multiple pics) pops outI will not buy a Samsung phone again. My phone MUST sync immediately and completely with whatever computer I have whether Mac, Windows, or Linux; currently the one I have is a Mac. Hello: Mac, Samsung, communitcate!! My previous phone, the SE T610, synched its contact list flawlessly to my Mac. The Samsung t809 database file type is currently incompatible with iSync. Don't believe claims on this or other websites saying the t809 sync's with Macs.Every single Samsung product (phones, home entertainment, etc) I have bought in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features. However, each was loaded with glitches. No more Samsung for me!Wish I had gotten a RAZR (free or nearly so with Tmo), held out for a Motorola Capri, or splurged and gotten a fabulous unlocked Nokia (every one I've had has been outstanding).UPDATE as of November 2006:The phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed. After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket, squatting down while painting and standing back up, the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn't apply to cracked screens. Tmo sent me a replacement, but I sent it back because they were going to charge another $150 for this irritation phone.
It looks very sweet.  Awesome screen and speakers.  Some decent hacks for it on howardforums dot com!  It's battery life is almost pathetic though.  It's reception is poor.  The big exposed screen is also prone to scratching, and getting dust/dirt under it.  You also can't use mp3's for ringtones without hacking/cheating it.  Rename mp3 to 3gp, copy to micro-sd, then copy back to phone memory.What really killed the deal for me was the reception though.  Had a Nokia 3650, awsome, even worked ok in my basement, next a Moto V330, barely worked upstairs, just bought 2 of these T809's and they won't even recieve good enough to let me setup my voice mail in my livingroom.  Called T-Mobile support..  They are putting in a request to point an antenna towards my house.  I'm request #2.  I wish they just sold a decent Nokia.  Using the phone outside is going to get old once it starts snowing here in Michigan.Bottom line: If you just want a sweet looking phone this is it.  If you want a usable dependable phone look elsewhere.  This is like the RAZR's.  Form over function.  T-Mobile used to have lots of sweet Nokias, then they went to so-so Motorolas, now they are pushing Samdung and whatever is cheap.  Not a good thing.  -  Joe
Beware!!  I bought an unlocked Razr V3i straight from Motorola, to get the nifty purple color that's offered only on their website.  Bad, bad, bad idea.  About a month after I bought it, the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly, screen going dim, etc.  I mailed it in (the problem later turned out to be the SIM card), and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here!!  I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone, to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot, and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well, that was the first call.  After a week of no return call, I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times, with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back, and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However, the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions, and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.  There's nothing wrong with it, except that it's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range, and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time.  That said, you can't save more than ten or twelve text messages on it, and you can't back up your messages to your MacBookPro.I bought an Iphone a while ago.  I'll probably still use the Motorola for traveling, but if I were you I'd think long and hard about purchasing a product for which it's nearly impossible to redeem the warranty.
I was very disappointed that the head/tip of this cable is too wide to fit through the opening of most shells - while it looks similar in size to a standard OEM/Apple tip, it's not an is about one-quarter of an inch wider and thus doesn't connect to the charge port on the bottom of an iPhone 4.  Very poor design on Belkin's part.
The first battery held a charge for maybe 6 hours. I contacted MyNetDeals and the very same day they sent me another one. I am using that battery but the charge only lasts two days at the most.
I've owned two of these. It is great that it rests against your ear, and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear. The first one I owned, after a month, lost most of its volume. I could not make the volume louder via the volume control; the volume control actually never seemed to work, but at least at first the volume was real good...for about a month. The second one I bought lasted about 9 months, but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work.

After 30 minutes on hold they will now replace the Whole product as ordered and returned #98686H. Would not refund shipping charges.  For those contemplating a replacement make sure they send out the latest headset part # SYN1311B.Remember a company is as the sum of its parts, support 0 stars.
Great interface, but the pen is faulty. I have used the Palm and the pen is easy to use. The pen for the mda doesn't work sometimes and it's operation isn't smooth. The screen isn't very big which is a turn off for such a heavy and bulky tool.The email tool doesn't have an option to set business hours so you have it still downloading mail 24hrs, that wasn't good. i like my business tool silent when I am at home. And it is locked by T-mobile such that you can't install Java applications like Google maps.I returned it, for the weight it should give me the feel of an HP-IPAQ or mini-computer but I didn't get that feel at all.
The MDA, designed and made by Taiwan's HTC, a leader in the Windows Mobile "smart phone" market (they seem to make all the WM phones sold in the U.S.), is really a cool concept.  It has a nice shape, a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape, and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile: Pocket Office, Pocket IE, MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player 10, and tons of free software to download from the web.  Plus, it has wi-fi which works really well.I really wanted to like the MDA, as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook (problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 "Cobalt").  And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year, not two-year, contract (and still gives you a rebate).  Anyway, after a few days I was sorely disappointed.  The problem lay entirely with the MDA's reception.  It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003.  The MDA's antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable.  And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal.  It was frustrating to no end, even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception.  I never got half the speed promised by EDGE, the 2.5G GSM data network.  Very, very disappointing.  Much, much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.Summary: the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning.  It's a dud, thanks partly to HTC's poor antenna design and/or construction and partly to T-Mobile's poor EDGE and GPRS support.  If you can stand a two-year commitment, go with Sprint's PPC-6700, also made by HTC with the same sliding thumbboard design.  I haven't tried the PPC-6700 yet (cuz I'm pretty much broke now), but online reviews are mostly positive.
Bought my cable last year and only used it for a couple of weeks before I decided to replace it with a cable from Nokia.This Eforcity unit is made of cheap-feeling material. Takes a bit to plug into my computer and once it is in, still doesn't work a lot of times. So I had to unplug and go thru the process a few times.Yes the price is low. But overall the item is too unstable.
This cable functions fine (at first), but it probably won't hold up to everyday use.  I've inserted mine maybe 20 times, and one of the spring-loaded contacts just became permanently stuck, making the cable worthless.  Sure it's dirt cheap, which is nice compared to the expensive real Nokia cable, but with what these accessory vendors charge for shipping, I'd recommend ordering several of these at one time from a source with a good deal on multiple items.  I'm now trying to decide whether to do that myself or shell out for the real deal with a real warranty.
I should have paid more attention to the reviews.  I went ahead and ordered these, mostly due to price - nowhere can you find wireless stereo headphones for $35!  There's a reason, though.  After wearing them for only 30 minutes, my ears were very sore.  No way of adjusting them.  Sound is pretty good, but certainly can't overcome the discomfort.  Will be returning for credit.
I came across David Pogue's review of Bluetooth headphones in the New York Times and researched the three sets he mentioned. Compared to the other's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime. I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house. The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile' to operate with the Jabra as a music player. Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i couldn't use the headsets for music was disappointing. As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design. After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC. However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers wouldn't work on either application. The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer. On the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price), comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren't audiophiles. The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up (15 feet seems to be the max)and on a minor note the flashing LED's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device. Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but. What started out as a promising technology- connect all your devices wirelessly - became the usual gobbledygook of support calls and technospeak and incompatible standards that left one frustrated at the technology. I sent mine back to Amazon for a refund and will stick with wires for a while longer.
Looks very cool.  Very convenient charging via USB port.  Not so good sound quality.  Audio has a lot of static tics and pops and that is the only reason I give this 2 stars.  Everything else is great.Pairs quickly with my Nextel i870.I lost my Plantronics 510, so will fall back to this unit until I can find the latest earpiece that has received good reviews.  Other may have a great experience with this earpiece.  Unfortunately, I am not one of them.  Maybe I got a "bad" one.
The sound quality in the car is great.  The callers often complain that they can't understand me despite talking directly into the mic.The thing that makes this unuseable is that it often links to my phone but doesn't actually connect.  I may or may not hear it ringing when I make a call... and, even though I am connected to the device, when the caller answers, we can't hear each other....it isn't really connected.so, this is useless
Though the Platntronics Voyager 510 works quite well, I was terribly disappointed with the accompanying carrying case which cost me an addtional $25! It's simply too small for the headset!
Overall this is a bad phone. The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD, and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool, which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone, you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera, but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips, but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone, but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin, no antenna, sleek designCons: horrible user interface, very few options to change the appearance, many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else. I succumbed to the hype of the Razr, but was burned. If it weren't for Verizon, the phone would be fine.
I first liked this headset when I got it because of the small size and easy fit without an ear hook. They are reasonably loud and easy to use (volume, On/Off & paring). Charging is simple: drop it in its storage charging case and close the lid.But first, it is somewhat tiny and so you either need to wear it continually in your ear (hardly cool) or risk it getting lost in a purse. And because it is so smooth it does not hang in a bluetooth carrying loop that I had on my cellphone case (slips out).The dedicated charging case is also very small and has a dedicated charger with a unique charging tip (does not work with a mini USB connector or most other charging hubs)But the most disappointing failure was that the headset would inexplicably disconnect from my AT&T; Tilt in the middle of a call and the re-pairing would need to be done all over again. When you are driving and expecting a hands-free ride, this is a pretty serious problem.So I am replacing it and hoping that Samsung has addressed these problems with the well-reviewed WEP470.
This is a very small unit & the piece that fits in the ear is rather large.  It is a very uncomfortable fit for my adult female ear.  The over the ear loop must be removed for recharging.  The button controls on the surface and sides of the unit are not difficult to use.I would not recommend this unit for anyone with smallish ears or large fingers.
After putting myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technologythrough our washing machine, I thought I'd purchase a cheap $20 replacement.  The Plantronics Voyager 510 was a little large but I was always satisfied with the voice quality and fit on my ear.  The Samsung WEP200 does not compare in function to the Voyager 510.  I never could get it to attach to my ear and stay there.  Nor was the sound quality very good.  Overall, Samsung makes great LCD TVs and decent printers.  This device, like their Blu-Ray players, is lacking in function and performance.  I returned it to Amazon for a refund and will buy another Voyager 510.
First, the ear clip snapped around the clip that holds it on. Hmm, OK, I'll replace it.EVERY time that I tried to answer a call with that wondrous "one button wonder" I disconnected or worse, couldn't hear it loud enough. for whatever Allen Funt reason, this !#!@?!! thing resets to the lowest audio setting all by itself. It doesn't fit into my ear(s) but sort of hangs over it on that damned cheap earpiece that never held right. Pretty much guaranteed to be a worse distraction while driving than picking up the phone itself: distractingly nonfunctional and some engineer's idea of punking everybody who buys it.This was a replacement for my lost Samsung headset that was a much better product, but gone, darn it. As such, I've relegated THIS absurd farce to a place on a shelf until I can conveniently find a way to extract some measure of revenge on it.
Ok, seriously, who are the group of dolts at Samsung approving the release of a products like this?  Did they take the time to at least put it in their ear?  I'm writing this because they are making newer models, but with zero design improvements.Problem here is not the function or technical aspect, it's the design.  I have no idea who's ear this is designed for, but it's not for humans.  You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring, that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone.  Not even close.The size is appealing, and the storage case charger is great.  It does work well, low noise, and good range.  However, it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge.  But, if you have to balance it in your ear, and keep still, or hold it, it kinda defeats the purpose.  It being so small and falling out ALL the time also leaves you wondering where it went, and who is either sitting or stepping on it.So, the cheap, flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap.  Plus, there is no place to put it.  The headset goes in it's case, but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where, exactly?  Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out.  That must be where mine is, because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.There are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes.  They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear, or maybe to floss your teeth.  Who knows.  They do nothing, and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you don't use any of the included attachments... but it hurts either way.  I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers.  One set were foam-like wraps... useless.  And some type of rubber things that just did not fit.Samsung WEP-301 Bluetooth Headset (Silver)is the newer model, but it is not any different in design.  However, it's so cheap with rebate, it cost less than the freakin' earbud covers I wasted money on.  Therefore, after this appealing review, and you still want to buy this thing, I would go for the newer one.  But, don't say I (we!) didn't warn you!NOTE: If you are ok with putting superglue in your ear to keep it attached, please disregard this review.
this thing isn't comfortable at all...and doesn't stay on my ear worth a darn.It has good connection quality...but I can barely use it.
I have gone through three HS850 Motorola headsets. After the first one expired--largely due to the inability to recharge, brought on by exposure to pockets, etc.--I bought two BLT-04 cases to take care of the replacement headset I got. At first, the case seemed to be a godsend. It fit perfectly and clipped on effortlessly. Then I realized that it also clipped off just as effortlessly. I figured I'd be careful enough and kept the case. While packing boxes for moving, I did not notice that clip slipped off and fell into one of the boxes along with the headset. By the time I realized what happened, all the boxes were packed, sealed and ready to go to storage. It's not as bad as losing the set on a street, but, still, I am unable to use it until boxes get unpacked. Luckily, the price dripped from $80+ for the headset to around $30 and I did not hesitate to get a replacement. But I am not putting it into the case--it's safer in my pocket.
I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset.  It fits the headset very nicely, but..  But, the design of the case does not prevent the  multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed, even though there is a recess in the case cover you'd think would prevent that.  The result is that I'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket, it might be ok, though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button.  If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse, then you should probably reconsider.
This is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my Motorola phone.  The sound quality is as good as other headsets I've used, and people on the other end of a call have told me that my voice is clearer.  However, I'm VERY disappointed with how poor the battery life has been.  I get less than 1 hour of talk time and less than 48 hours of standby time.  I could go over a week with my old Nokia bluetooth headset.
Well, I went ahead and bought this at the reduced price. It was good at first and then other people were having problems hearing me and I was misunderstood because of this headset. Thankfully, it wasn't one of my important calls and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me. I am returning this product because it is just not worth it to me if the other person cannot hear me properly. I do like the design of it and the fact that you get to choose how you place it in your ear. I don't care about it otherwise.
Did not work well with my phone.
This bluetooth was my first and worst. I couldn't hear alot on it and it didn't stay on my ear for nothing. I would stay away.
Item was purchased to replace a Motorola 300 headset. Worked ok but, paired fast. Volume was ok but could have been louder. Biggest drawbacks were callers could barely hear me if I was not using my 'outside' voice which is annoying to others around you. The other complaint is the fit. I still do not understand how Motorola engineers enjoy this design. It feels like it is going to fall off and on occasion does. Item was returned within 30 day policy of where it was purchased. Here is where I am at currently with headsets....this is my review for the cardo scala 700lx that I currently own and am very happy with so far. I feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price.My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.
It fits the phone, but has a crappy, cheap feel to it.  It collects fingerprints and doesn't seem to do anything but add bulk to an already large phone.
This case is ok , but there are certainly better ones out there for cheaper.I ordered this case with high expectation thinking i was going to recieve a brand name product from Boxwave , instead i recieved a generic case with no branding .There are other cases here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing i recieved for less then half the price this one is being sold for.For some reason my comments doesnt get approved im not sure why , just letting you all know my personal experience with this transaction .
I sold my Discovery 650 and upgraded to the 655 because I thought the DSP would cut the noise in the car.  Boy, was I disappointed.  Not only did it sound a lot worse to people on the other end, but it sounded a lot more choppy on my receiving end as well.It stays in my ear fairly well, even without the ear loop -- just the eargel.  BUT...The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket, bag, or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket-clip charger.  If I have it clipped on my pocket, the eargel faces out and unavoidably rotates to its removal position.  When I brush up against anything the eargel flips out.  I've lost two eargels now and it just sits in a drawer.They should have designed a better retention mechanism on the eargel with some kind of positive release mechanism, and/or have the eargel facing back when it's in the clip in a pocket so it won't get torn off.I also hated the force required on the buttons.  I never used the volume controls (always did it from the phone), and I dreaded getting calls because I'd have to MASH the answer button into my head.One more thing -- It's always getting "unpaired" from my Treo 680.  I have to go through the Treo menus to get it to pair again.  To be honest, this may have to do with the Treo more than the headset, but the two do not like each other that well.The Discovery 650 without the DSP had much better audio quality, slightly lighter force on the buttons, but the same problems with eargels getting torn off in my pocket.--- UPDATE ---I called Plantronics tech support and they immediately sent me out new eargels.  So I'm using it again.
The ear piece always pops off when I put the ear hook on.  I had to send the first one back because it wouldn't turn off.  I have the replacement, and still have the ear hook issue, and it doesn't stay in my ear without it.  I'll be buying another bluetooth, but this will do for the time between ordering.
I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!
The sound quality is fine... as long as you keep your phone no further from the earpiece than your shirt pocket. This thing has NO range to it. It's unfortunate because it has an otherwise solid design. The single rocker switch is slick and intuitive. All the design in the world doesn't mean a lick if it just doesn't work.
The  sound  was  great,  but  the headphones  were  poorly  constructed  and they  broke. The  headphones  have a  really  annoying &#34;police like&#34;  blue  light.  The  light  disturbed  others  around me.
I bought the 590's because they're one of the few bluetooth stereo headphones that get overall good reviews, both at Amazon and tech websites like CNET.  I've had mine for about a week.  I want to use them for music listening and Skype calls through my computer.So far I can only get them to work as stereo headphones.  In that respect, they sound very good.However, I'm unable to get them working as a phone headset with my computer.  The problem is the microphone.  When I try Skype's test call, I can hear the lady speak, but Skype cannot hear me speak.On my Windows XP laptop, I can connect the 590's as  'stereo headphones' or as a 'hands free headset with microphone'.  After connecting as a headset, I hear odd beeps about every 5 seconds.  The beep pattern is not described in Plantronics' skimpy User's Manual.I've configured my computer's sound system to use bluetooth for playing and recording audio.  I've tried pressing the 590's Phone and Mute buttons to unmute the microphone, but nothing seems to work.I'll call their support number to try and make the 590's work for Skype calls.  I hope they work out, because they're light and sound great.
Very flimsy, cheap product.  Takes 8 seconds MINIMUM to turn On/Off.  Battery life only a couple days.  I sure expected better from the previous reviews.
I have been a satisfied Virgin Mobile (VM) customer for several years, happily using an Audiovox 8500.  VM uses the SPRINT cellular network which has a strong signal in my area.Lets talk about the SLICE which is made by UTSTARCOM.  I was very much attracted to this thin stylish cell phone.  I am not going to waste any time - what you see is what you get.  It is basically a pretty phone with very good reception, but the outgoing voice quality is below average.  The person on the other end will think you are swallowing water while talking.  Another issue is the cramped key pad.This cell phone reminds me of a pretty girl with the voice of cartoon character.  If you prize fashion over function - go for it.I am switching back to my AUDIOVOX.P.S.  You will feel compelled to purchase additional "wallpaper" for an additional $2, because what comes on the phone as standard fare is ugly!
Picked this up from Radio Shack as a novelty item.  The phone is thin, but the call quality is quite poor.  Virgin Mobile uses Sprint's PCS network, and Sprint is my primary provider (I have a new Sanyo M1 phone), and the call quality difference is huge.  The keypad is also uncomfortable to use, like many ultra-thin phones -- just not designed for normal human beings IMHO.  Finally, VM's prepaid rate is just too high.  Coupled with limited coverage, I'd say VM's service is a bad deal.
This charger, just wouldn't charge... probably it was not chosen well, but at most....could have been used as was anticipated........
I cant say how yours is going to hold up but the one that I purchased did not hold up. The first day , the first time that I put this on my belt and went to sit in my car, it broke. The belt clip shattered into millions of pieces. The only thing that is of use and that is why I at least gave it 2 stars was the case itself. It is of the best that I have seen yet. High quality looks and feel.and the ergonomics are very good too. It just feels good. The problem is, that I wanted a holster with the case and if the clip breaking off is any indication to the rest of the quality on down the road than just get something else.
Thin materiel would not last long, inexpensive looking. Did not look anything like what I seen on the ad, returned item.
Case did not protect the front of the phone and it made the back square instead of rounded fits in holster well but I did not like the feel on the phone I sent it back
I didn't really care for this one. i don't use it that much because it doesn't give much protection for my phone, which is pretty expensive. there are really no *pluses* to having this cover...it was inexpensive and shipped quickly tho...
This thing snapped.  The clip got caught on something and snapped right off.  There was no way to fix it, broken plastic.
Looks good but dont trust your phone in this. My phone fell out the first day in this case. should have a clip on top to keep the phone from sliding out. gave it two stars for looks but functionality........ it sucks.
The holster does not hold my husbands phone. As soon as he puts his phone in the holster it slides right out. This makes him have to clip the case/holster inside his pocket instead of outside....which makes the holster pointless!
I love the fit and feel of this case for my s4.  However, it is not shock as shock absorbing as I need.  I do not feel my phone is protected from even minor drops that inevitably happen with regular use of phones.  This spec quickly and was in original, sealed packaging.
Felt cheaply made. bought a different one to replace it. 2 stars because the kickstand was functional. There are better cases for the money or a little bit more
I bought this because of all the positive 5 star reviews. This case is nice and slim and is cheap. The big problem is it makes using the phone so much harder. A normal press of the buttons does nothing. You have to push really hard. I guess all the 5 star reviews have never used the phone with a case with cut outs.
This case is far from what I expected. The kickstand is awkwardly placed and it doesn't feel very comfortable when holding it. In addition the case is really thin. I wish I never hit the confirm purchase button.
I didn't feel that this was a very sturdy product. It felt very flimsy but I tried it and was afraid to drop phone.
Did NOT fit correctly for my Samsung S4 (AT&T). I guess I got what I paid for. Be careful if you're particular about your case and want it to fit snug on your phone. This case is not a tight fit and is loose on the sides. I gave this case away or else it would've just collected dust in my drawer. I would not recommend this case to anyone!
I thought this item was clear but it had a grey hue. After a few days of use it began to look cheap and dirty. I would not buy this color again.
This case was okay... The rubbed edge is nifty but then the plastic was just thin and the kickstand is just poorly made... not to mention it's very hard to pull the kickstand out.
Shows up totally deformed (top of the case doesn't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked), and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement? I don't want a replacement anymore, I want a functional phone case. Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; kind of thing. The case is pretty inflexible, so when I took the case off, it also pulled off the back of the phone. Not the end of the world, but definitely a crappy case. Would absolutely not recommend.
I bought this case because it was very cheap.  I should have known it was not worth it.  The case fit is too tight.  When I put it on my phone, the lip that goes around the front of the phone was uneven.  No matter how many times I tried to take it off and put it back on again, the lip was just uneven.  This caused my screen protector film to be displaced by this case.  It was much more of a pain than a help.  Get the real Samsung case and save yourself the headache.
