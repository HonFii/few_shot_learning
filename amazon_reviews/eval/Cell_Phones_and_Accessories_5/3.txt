These make using the home button easy. My daughter and I both like them.  I would purchase them again. Well worth the price.
does not have the need amps to charge things like ipads, or hp touchpads. but its super small and compact.
The idea of the design is a sweet idea but it wears off as the paint is over the case and not under a sealant or anything. It has a cool 3D effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off.It is quite pretty though.
It works great  thus  far no issues.  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail
You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge. I'll just buy the Verizon  charger instead
I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks. I can not say where I purchased them. Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made. This one is OK I guess.
Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however, it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not.
First off, the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine.People in other reviews were complaining that the cord was too short-- about 2 or 3 feet-- and that was what I was expecting. Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There's no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung.  Cord length and adapter style may vary as it seems like the seller is not consistent.
I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger. Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger. I am having the same issue with the charger that I ordered for my galaxy note 2. It's a very thin cord, and also very short. Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into...
Be careful when ordering these cases. Not all Galaxy II's are the same. Mine was a Sprint and this one did not fit my pnone. It went into the trash can as it wasnt worth sending back. Otherwise I am sure it's a great case.
I was expecting a bit higher quality product but it is what it is. I've used it for a few months and it definitely helped when I dropped my phone. But at this point, I am not using it anymore due to the quality of the product, although 'good', it could be better and more solid.
A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2.0 cable and you don't need an extra, then you do NOT need this cable. All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2.0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end.There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it. While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount, it's probably okay to purchase one, for as long as, after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2.0 cable.The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP.NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs.
I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable.
I was really impressed by the price and was very excited when it arrived. But it doesn't work like it says it does. At first it charged my phone just fine but then it stopped charging; I waited a day to charge again but it still didn't charge.
cable works fine with my verizon Galaxy S4, it charges and transmit the data fine.However, connector tip(phone side) is too thick, it won't fit if you use aftermarket cases.
It works and is a good value for the price compared to the retail stores. The only negative is that it is just a tad too short.
I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them.  Maybe I'm just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months.  Spend the money and get a good quality one.
Works fine IF you don't move the phone.  If you handle the phone, the plug works its way out within two or three minutes.  This despite a relatively stiff fit.  Note that the cord that came with the phone plugs in smoothly and securely.  That's my general-use cord now; this one is relegated to overnight charging where the phone isn't being used.
It works, that's about all that can be said for it. It charges my Galaxy fine, but cord does not retract. Mine came with a busted spring. Cheap enough I don't care, not worth the shipping to return. It charges, I suppose that's all that matters
Looking at the price, I ordered 2 of these.It served the purpose initially. But in few months one of them stopped working.that's 50% hit rate. Though, I don't what's the life for the other charger.
Initially it is a great charger at a great price. However, I've been through 2 now and they tend to not last very long. For the price though I guess it's still not a bad deal.
The charger works fine.  It was a great value considering how much they cost in stores.  However, it doesn't retract at all.
I like how long the cord is with this changer so that I'm able to reach the night stand and table from where I plug it in at.  However, I'm not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it's own.
Product came really fast, nice long cord, which was great considering factory cord is so short. Worked great til the third day, then I don't know what happened...at the price I didn't expect perfection, and at Sellers defense,I have not contacted them..it could easily be my own fault and I've been so busy...even review is late. (Sorry)
good
This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I'm guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor.
The one plastic wedge broke on first use.  Otherwise, it is about what I expected.  A usable set of tools for phones and some laptops.
The Torx screw drivers work wonderfully and the tweezers work well, but the pry tool is too weak and ineffectual for the project I used them on.I bought this kit to remove the cameras out of my HTC 4G LTE and I didn't have any problems except for removing the small plastic portion on the bottom rear side of the phone.  The pry tool was way too flimsy for the job and I'm not convinced that it would do the trick for any similar function.I'd recommend this kit if you primarily purchased it for the Torx drivers but not if you require the use of the pry tool as well.
I haven't used them all yet, but they aren't as quality as some of my precision tools.  Like the pry tool and tweezers.
Judging from what I've seen in other reviews and what I received there is inconsistency in what is being shipped out.  I received a zip-lock bag containing 12 pieces. (See user uploaded photo that matches the description below)- 6 Torx type drivers, magnetic tip (T4,T5,T6,T7,T8,T10) (Orange handle, with blue cap)- 1 Philips driver, magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 Flat driver, magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 3-point driver, magnetic tip (clear red handle)- 2 tweezers (stainless steel, on blister packs)- 1 pry tool (dark green)I purchased this set to do some work on a Droid X (MB810), and they did the job well enough, except I had to carefully use the T4 instead of a T3 *very* carefully on 12 screws holding the screen assembly together. I'll give it a 3 star rating "It's OK"
i bought these tool to us for repairing my nephews iphone 4 but non of them were the right size, so if you buying them for the iPhone don't buy these
It has a lot of what I need to do basic repairs on a phone but it is bare bones.
Could have been better for the price and wait time. 2 of the drivers are labeled as a 1.5 but are clearly different sizes. Also the wear kinda fast if working with tight screws
Not the best ive purchased but it came with the right size for iphone 4 but the ones with the yellow handles are really just different sizes for a star screw, and none of them fits the iphone 4 star screw. You can always use it for another gadget though.
It's $6 so I don't know if I'm asking too much. The screw drivers work and are slightly magnetized. The prying tool is completely junk and broke before I had even finished my task - a guitar pick is much more durable. The tweezers are also worthless. Get them for the screwdrivers, not for the other tools.
I purchased this battery to replace a water soaked one in an iPhone 4. I don't even know if it is charging or not as the unit won't turn on for me. The shipping is prompt, the packaging great, and the description is accurate.
I'm sure that there is something that says it will not come as pictured, but still I was disappointed.The tools helped me get the job done, but they also did not hold up well. The plastic plying tools bent and broke fairly quickly. I can't say that it wasn't user error, but they seemed very cheap.
Purchased this to remove screws on my Samsung Galaxy SII but even the smallest tool in the set was too large.
not bad,but Too little things inside is incomplete, and the bad use of hexagonal. But it is ok . thanks
Had a mix up with getting the item and slow shipping but it was all resolved in the end so I am satisfied with the purchase
the tools are ok Just not quite what I  expected.  They were, however, better than the ones that came with the screen I ordered.
You get what you pay for. They strip easily. VERY cheaply made. But I only needed them for a one time use and I didn't have to spend a bunch of money so I can't really complain. But if you will need them more than once...spend the money on good tools.
On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off. That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound. However, I returned them because of the poor fit. They would probably work well on some other headsets. If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try.
These are the exact ones that I was looking for but there is one problem.  They are supposed to be clear but they arrived yellowed in the package.  It is obvious that they are new, but they have yellowed and are no longer clear.  I bought these to replace existing ones that I have that have yellowed but not to the extent of these new ones.  I have had the previous ones since 2010.  I will keep as spares but am unhappy with the condition of these EarGels.
Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market.  This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.
Not really worth getting.Except for very limited application this is not an good way to connect a audio device to the car stereo.this item creates a bunch of mechanical noise and in addition the sound quality from the attached device is very poor. It works but is not worth listening to unless one has to.  As limited as the fm transmitters are they have significantly better sound quality.  I'd return this except it would cost more to ship than it is worth.
My moms car couldn't have an upgraded radio (freaking saabs...) but one of the two positions didn't work. Still worked for her though.
Great for the price.  Sound quality is not what it should be, I think, but my kids love it.  I like the idea and am going to buy one for my car, but a different brand to see if there is a difference in sound.
I opened it and didn't see where the springs were.. If anybody can take a pic or describe it I will love u so much. Good product but i was getting the reel error on my tape display in my ford expedition. It makes my blackberry phone sounds great. Dislike the radio so please help me.
I fixed the issues, for the time being.  I turned down the bass on my stereo.  I also made the default volume 75% on my phone.  This is the combination that worked for me.  I also left the casette in.  I figured if there was dust and other stuff in there, then i would have to let it settle.  The burn in period was about 3 days.  Afterwards it was AMAZING, the sound clarity improved so much. So don't give up, try these things. You may need to clear the dust from inside your tape player, I'm sure that may be the cause of many issues.Fix eject issue:[...]
I gave it 3 stars because I was generously sent a bunch of these on only one order.  Otherwise I am not so sure that these work very well.  I have tried on 2 phones and the results have been inconclusive.
This serves the purpose if you need your hands free.  You get what you pay for, but I don't need to use it very often, so it is compatible with my phone and is easy to use--not much you can mess up!  If you need one that you will use a lot, you may want to buy something more advanced, but this is a good backup and was very inexpensive.
Overall, it's a great headset for the price. Pretty amazing actually. You'll need to get a wired converter to convert the 2.5mm to 3.5mm like this one:Headset Adapter 3.5mm to 2.5mm Audio Adapter and Converter (Black) - Non-Retail Packaging. No biggie.But the curved rubber piece is really stiff and hurts my ear after about 30 minutes or less. Sometimes quite painfully.I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two). No one complains they can't hear me or do they need to turn up their volume. Noise cancellation is also pretty good. Not as good as my cheap jawbone, but then people usually complain they can't hear me as well on that one. So, stay away from this if you plan to talk on the phone a while or have larger ears. Small ears may work just fine. Mine are probably about average for males. Otherwise, worth the price.
This is actually a lightweight comfortable phone headset.  The problem with it is that when the phone rings and you go to pick it up, it takes a while to attach to your ear.  Also, the speaker part is covered by some foam that picks up ear wax and gets dirty extremely quickly - not an item you would want to share with someone.  Once you get past these two problems, the sound quality is good, and it is easy to wear.
I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work.Unfortunately it didn't work that well. I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo. Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound, but it didn't do this at all.I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star. I don't have a home phone so I haven't tried it for that.
well, its a easy product, but it is just I hope buy, it arrive on time and the way I waiting but it hurt my ear
Not too sure how to make it stay put, but it seems to work well.  I purchased this headset for my mother and she has not complained about it yet!
Bought this as a gift. Didnt get much feedback from the giftee. But I';m sure its working fine. Price was good, not much else to comment on.
The product is okay but could be better. The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine. I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing.
This phone is amazingly small and light for a camera phone; it even has a flashlight/flash. Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1. The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere. I was with AT&amp;T since they bought out L.A. Cellular. The customer service was great for years, but got so bad I?d wait on hold for hours and couldn?t get through to a person for days.
I don't own this phone. I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710. I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since "downgraded" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are "Out of Service."Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone. Lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life. For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use.
I will not hash over the things that many other wrote in their reviews, but mainly will focus on the problems that I've had with this phone over the course of 1 year that I've had it.1) Battery life is not nearly as good as advertised - lasts about 8 hours - but I admit to be using the phone often and need to swap batteries (have an extra one in the charger) because the wire charger would not charge the phone! (another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet.3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbers under different people's names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings. And it wasn't Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad.5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers.Overall, I don't like this phone at all. Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera.And, judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside), I don't think I want to own another Motorola product. When's the new Treo coming out again...?
The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised.  The trouble is in getting it to stay in place when I move around.  I'm not talking about playing tennis here, I'm talking about driving the car, and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth.  The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.
As you can see by the picture, this device has merely an ear canal insert and the microphone and cord just dangle.  It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've "pulled your ear back" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be, as someone reported, it's way better for wind noise, I haven't tried that.  It comes with a couple fluffy black sponge wind masks for the mike bulb.
I gave this 3 stars because it does what it says, its nothing high end and doesn't promise miracles, but I won't give it 5 stars because simply there's a terrible delay from when my computer comes out of sleep mode and from the time it actually recognizes this hub on the com ports for the PC, on average its about 15 seconds.  So I'll be sitting there waiting to enter my password like an idiot until the hub is finally recognized by the PC.  And its a really good PC, brand new, no problems with USB 2 or USB 3 except where this hub is concerned.
It works OK, although several folks have said that it was hard to hear me.  Not everyone, though, so there could have been other factors.  The thing I like least is that it is hard to put on.  Maybe it is just me.  I'm accustomed to using headsets, but haven't found a quick way to put this on one-handed.
This antenna works well but the mini is better.  The main complaint is the wind whistels through the coil, so it must be set way back on the roof.  No sound from the mini dual band version and just as good reception.Update 5-28-10: Actually, the mini has much better reception
On the positive side the battery life is good.The negatives I'll split into ergonomics, sound and RF performance.Ergonomics: It's secure on my big ears, but as others have mentioned that seal is nothing more than marketing and window dressing. There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a "good" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine.
Item was purchased for spouse.  Was not what he really wanted, but the item does work for the most part.
I have the version designed and manufactured for Dell by Think Outside, Inc.  It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4"x6" and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard, when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a "techie" by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.  It should not only work well but hold up under normal use and parts should be made available and easy to find.-Feb. 21, 2006Update:  I contacted Think Outside Inc. through their website.  They sent me two replacement stands free of charge.  The customer service department was nice and I got the stands within three business days.  Great customer service!-Feb. 24, 2006Another Update:  I am still using the keyboard and it still works great and my replacement stand is holding up and I still have the extra they sent me.  I would purchase this again and I wish sellers like Dell knew to direct customers who experienced the problem I did to Think Outside for replacement parts.  They had excellent customer service unlike Dell (they wanted me to purchase another keyboard).-Sept. 15, 2006
I have had an LG-700 for a few years, and I love it.  But I get complaints from people about the microphone picking up extraneous noises when I am on the phone in a supermarket, or working in the kitchen, so when it started to wear out, I tried this one.  Well....this does have pretty good sound, BUT, the rigid frame for the "yoke" is a problem for this guy with a 17.5" neck.  And the location of the on/off switch is annoying (on the back).  Plus, whereas the LG-700 has 6 buttons, this has 4, and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the needed functions of such a headset.  I often get the "Equalization changed" message when I am trying to get Siri to pop up...very annoying!  On the plus side, it does seem to connect to my iPhone quickly, and the signal seems pretty stable.All in all, it is nice...but misses in a few ways.****************Update:  After 3 weeks, I returned this to Amazon.  The fit was just too annoying.  Thank you Amazon, for your great return policies!
I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone. I already had the LG and was hoping the Motorola would do better but I was let down. It is a great buy if you are only using one cell phone.
It's so so.  Not as comfortable as advertised and hugs your neck which i hate.  Has great sound but  is quite plain. I own an older LG model bigger for guys my size.... Has more control buttons for the different functions compared to the 2 buttons the Motorola has.The off/on button is in a bad place, every time I lay on the bench to lift weights I lay on the button which shuts it off ...Poor design. I wouldn't say not to buy it but a gadget person as myself I prefer the LG so I returned the Motorola and ordered a newer LG model ..
I lost my 2-year-old LG Tone HBS-700 headset and someone else is doubtless enjoying it.The Motorola cables appeared to be more robust than the LG cables and the price point was attractive compared to the newest LG HBS-800, so I decided to take a chance.The good:- price- earbud fit- strong cables- battery life- reception- button function and placement- pairing- telephone functionThe bad:- looks goofy- the band is a tight fit- two-tone cable color may as well be illuminated with a sign that says, "look at me!"The mediocre:- sound quality (richness and frequency response) simply cannot match the LG Tone HBS series- equalizer is not very effective (bright treble but non-existent bass)Summary:This product is inferior to the LG where it counts:  the sound.  For me, that is sufficient reason to warrant return of this product and purchase of the newest and ridiculously expensive LG Tone HBS-800.  I am returning the Motorola this week, but I will delay my purchase of the LG until the price becomes more reasonable.  In the meantime, I'll get by with a wired pair of earbuds.
This bluetooth did not last me a year.  I called Motorola for a replacement.  They sent another model and I've been using it for four years now.
It worked good for a few months.  Gradually, it began loosing its quality. People have trouble hearing now.  I am also getting "static" and cannot use very much.  Works a little better in my cell phone than Skype.  Overall, I do not reccommend it.
When I first received this product it worked well.  After a month and a half it stopped communicating with my cell phone. I called Motorola and they told me it was guaranteed for a year and to send it back to them. The model I bought is no longer sold and they have a new one out now. They told me they will replace the blue tooth. It has been over 3 weeks since I mailed it in and I have yet to hear anything. I am happy with the blue tooth technology. But I am not happy with Motorola. They have never contacted me since I called them about the prolems I was having and have not even taken the time to e-mail be they received my old one (which I know they have by my shipping receipt I got back). My blue tooth may have been a lemon but Motorola's customer service is not up where it should be. I am still waiting for a replacement to come in. In the meantime I am using the free plug-in type I received when I bought my phone.  My advice is Buy a Bluetooth, just be careful who makes it and check out their customer service.
This is my first BT headset. The main reasons I chose this one were low price, small size/weight, and having seen a couple of people use this at work.Pros:The size/weight is so small as to be unnoticeable. I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise, it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent, probably 3+ days, although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can't use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great, sometimes 10 ft causes annoying "I am about to disconnect" noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything, it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing, last-number redial, etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally, the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone, look for something else. There must be headsets out there that provide better sound quality, longer range, and have more intuitive buttons and controls.
Since there is no rubber to "gasket" your ear, noisy environments can make it hard to hear. i.e. in you car.
Problems I've got with this unit:1. Too short range; much shorter than stated 10m;2. Lost signal or lost connection with cellphone more frequently than I imagined;3. When I used this headset to call my friends and T-mobile customer reps, they usually complained that they can barely heard my voice. Maybe the voice collected by the headset is too weak!
I bought this to connect walkman type gadgets to my car stereo.  It worked well at first, but the wiring quickly started having problems.  The sound would cut out and I'd need to mess with the cable to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again.  After 8 months, the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.  Maybe the heat of my car played a role in the breakdown of the cable, but if that's how you're planning on use it, don't be surprised if it starts shorting out on you too.
If you have large hands ( like me ) you will find the keyboard difficult to use. I had particular difficulty with the 5-way directional button. No matter how carefully I used the button I ended up hitting the adjacent buttons too. I also had problems using the camera feature because of it's tiny size. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a bit of a klutz. I was also displeased to find that the unit's limited memory made any real web browsing impossible. Also, there appears to be no Bluetooth compatibility with Macs. It will sync with the use of a data cable ( a separate purchase required ), but I think it's a shame to spend the extra bucks for Bluetooth only to find it is of limited use.What made me decide to return the phone was that I found the signal to be weaker than any other cell I have ever owned. We live in a little valley that compromises the signal of any cell phone, but the A630 couldn't establish a solid connection.It's a great looking device and it feels very well built. The screen is small, though it provides a very sharp image. I strongly expect that a more nimble fingered PC user might find the phone's many features to be tons of fun.
i like camera phones, but i can't believe this phone don't have usb cable to upload pics..i have to pay $.25 for sending each pics..Viewing all camera phones, this one is pretty nice..It's got flash, and it's got 4 different types of resolutions..It zooms in more than i expected..Other than camera, for contact list, it gives you to save #s, pic, ringtones for a person..I think thats good..i guess that's all i'm gonna say..Overall, phone is decent.For other viewers, if you wanna buy this, you should buy it now, and don't wait cause more updated phones will come out soon
Pros:- Price- Ease of pairing- Sound quality (yours and theirs)- Battery lifeCons- Painful for an extended time (10 mins)- Hard to tell if on or off
There isn't much to say here.  For the phone system I have, this was needed to enable the remote functions of the  Plantronics-CS540 Convertible Wireless Headset.  It could be more aesthetically-pleasing, but as I'm sure it's designed for a wide variety of phones that need a remote lifter, I suppose you can't complain.Mounting the unit can be tricky.  You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So, you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you've found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar.
This device takes a signal from a wireless headset like the CS540 and lifts up the receiver from your base phone unit. Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge, in my opinion. Perhaps you've had better results, but I find this thing less than perfect.
This is my first bluetooth device. Read reviews and considered other headsets costing $50 and $100. Based on reviews and value, got this one. Have used it three days.It works well and came with a good set of accessories. My only complaint really is that the tone of voices on my end sounds a bit like a tin can phone. Intelligibility is not a problem, but the sound is a bit disconcerting. Most people I talk to say it sounds fine on the other end, but one complained of the "tunnel sound."But it is a good value. It synched with my T-Mobile Wing right away. I think it dropped a couple of calls, but cannot be certain where the blame lies. I just walked away from the phone and when I came back it reconnected immediately.Other comments: The eyeglasses clip is a great idea but I'll have to modify it to work with my thin wire frames. The ear clip is fine. The supplied neck cord is a good idea, but I'm not using it. The belt clip seems a bit vulnerable as it sticks out pretty far.Mine was missing the full manual (a return?), but the online PDF was easy to find.Overall, I did expect slightly better performance, but am satisfied with the value and general function of this headset.
Compared to Motorola Bluetooth headsets, this Cardo really rocks. It has much better mic and speaker sound quality and volume than Motorola. The Motorola makes me sound like I'm talking on a speakerphone while the Cardo is a bit better in this regard.That said, because the mic is so far away from your mouth, you will still sound very distant and a bit muffled. With this Cardo, callers still complain when I'm in the car or outside on a windy day that there is a lot of background wind noise.I ended up going back to the wired headset that came with my Motorola RAZR phone, which has much better audio quality and is not as cumbersome to setup during a call as a Bluetooth headset.
Ok. I just bought this adapter today for my PDA cellphone.  The product integrates well with everything (My Laptop - sony vaio, cellphone (siemens sx56, my panasonic cordless home phone (although with the panasonic, ppl complain about my voice being faint)).  But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says, that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices, it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better, but not totally gone).But in any case if you don't hear the crackling, it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you, not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all, if you read the manual, this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones, then you're lucky).  It is designed to work primarily for mobile phones only.
I purchased this battery for a premium as it boldly proclaimed &#34;Li-Ion&#34;.  That purchase was before I noted that all of the other, more inexpensive batteries were also Li-Ion types, and also OEM.  My fault for not paying attention.  Be advised there are better prices for this exact item on Amazon, so please keep looking.This having been said, the item was shipped quickly, and arrived so fast that I almost had to duck.  I therefore have no issues with the seller, who is doing a good job.
Overall, an OK headset that, versus the H700, trades better inbound voice quality for less outbound quality. Given its low price, though, it's a great value, though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A-, nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very "floppy" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced "speakerphone" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call. THIS IS FALSE. You must leave the H500 turned on and actively connected to your phone in order to use it, just like any other headset.
This probably isn't being sold any more, but I really enjoyed my time with it.  It lasted me three years!  Compared to the new ones out, this is bulky and sound quality isn't as good.  But the fact that it remained in tact in working condition, especially with a rechargeable battery is remarkable.
This bluetooth is basically ok but the part holding on to your ear is very 'flimsey' and tends to want to fall off if u bend over so u have to keep securing it on your ear, which is quite annoying as I almost lost it a few times not realizing it was no longer on my ear...so it's a huge drawback for me. It seems to work ok otherwise tho sometimes I do have a  sound problem that is not present when I just listen straight from the phone without it...it's sometimes quite garbled. So this product for me though cute, is average in fuction.
The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:)  The H500 works fine with our LG Shine.  Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup.  The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why not 3 stars?  The volume control is hardly palpable.  It is hard to adjust the volume while in use.  Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust.  Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear.  It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear.
The phone is ok. I didn't find any difference between RAZR and the Motorolla V300 I had earlier. All the features are the same.Razr has a big huge color screen, bluetooth enabled and can capture videos. But there is no improvement on any of the calling features.So if you are getting the phone free after the rebates you can buy it, else it is not worth the $200.
I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated.1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the "MORE" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the "audio sweet spot" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? "Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower."4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says "Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.
The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.  Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size.
Bought this phone(Actually the black v3 but the only real difference is video support and additional memory), for $149 from BB, replacing my v551, basically just for the "chic factor". Initally I was very happy and excited with my purchase, but after a couple of weeks the novelty wore off and its shortcomings became apparent. The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random "sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little "M" circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good. And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it, you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye. Kind of hard to explain, except for those of you with the phone. Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551. The third is the camera. I rarely use a phone cam, but the times I needed it, the pictures looked, well...horrible. And last but not least, the reception. The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The v551 actually had better reception. My new LG CE500 actually has MUCH better reception and is generally a much better phone. This phone is a GOOD phone. Nothing more nothing less.
This is my second bluetooth headset so I am able to compare this with my previous one (a Plantronics M2500).  Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.
I bought a different BoxWave Patent Leather Clutch with magnetic closure and was so impressed by it's functionality. BoxWave changed the style to a snap closure and I didn't realize it until I received it.I'm not taking stars away because of my mistake, but by the usual problem I have with snap closures. I have to spend extra time trying to snap it together because it doesn't just close on its own like with a magnet.The case also had marks inside under two of the stitches and shows mark on the patent leather as soon as I run anything slightly against it. I used this case once, maybe twice, had to return to the magnetic BoxWave leather clutch instead.
It's shiny which is pretty but that makes it a fingerprint magnet. Its just okay. I buy a lot of cases for my phones because I like to switch them out a lot. This one is nice for the times when you want a dressier case. For everyday I think I will stick with real leather cases from Zenus. They cost a lot more but they they wear well too IF you buy their real leather cases. The case cover creases if you accidentally run your fingernail along it. It's permanent crease. Its bulky so it protects but makes the phone too big. I used to love BoxWave, but this one is a little disappointing.  Why buy a cheap case for your $650 phone.
The product was OK however the material is somehow cheap looking leather. I am expecting something with more natural feel on it and not the one with shining look.
I LIKED THE CASE VERY MUCH = BUT I NO LONGER HAVE THE PHONE = SO THE NEW BUYER THAT BOUGHT IT FROM ME AND THE CASE.
i like style, wrist band, good close clip, but once put credit cards in its hard to close. phone stays in ok but if dropped phone will pop out.
It's patent so very easy to scratch. However the case is cute. Seems to fit but phone has slid out on multiple occasions out of case.
Looks and feels like plastic. Like the snap instead of a magnet. Looks better in the picture than in person. Holding up great after a couple of weeks. .
Adds too much bulk to my phone, hence I purchased a different case.  Also unlike the pictures on the site, the buttons on your phone will be covered.  The areas on the case where the power button and volume rocker are located are covered by plastic.  Not good in my opinion.  Makes it harder to press those buttons.  Might be preferred by those looking for a good amount of protection for their phone.
This is a regular case, fit, I believe it's not pretty at all but neither bulky and the protection it's intermediate .
I searched online for a case for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II, and decided on this product with it's cool design. It has provided sufficient protection and I especially like the grip-ability on the sides.
I always buy BoxWave cases for my phones, because they are well made, practical, comfortable and good looking. This time I am disappointed, the cuts for camera with flash, S-pen, speaker and microphones are too big and it looks ugly. Plus because the S-pen is in the corner of the phone and the cut for it really big, it doesn't provide good protection at this corner. What if the phone falls on this corner?
Great design and protected my phone really well from droppings. My one year old dropped it all the time and no problem. But the big problem is that it's stained. I don't know why I only put my phone in my purse, not my jeans pockets but it got all blue-ish note
I like the small profile for this charger, but as with all the USB cable chargers I've tried it seems to charge somewhat slowly.  Trying to run the GPS navigation while charging it will still slowly drain the phone.  It seems the dedicated car chargers (with no USB port) seem to charger much faster.
The only thing I did not like about the charger is that only one of the plus is 2.1Amp the other is only one amp is unable to charge any of my devices. I will be looking for a stronger one.
I liked this case a lot until the plastic shell started cracking after owning it for one month. Unfortunately, when you buy it through Amazon, Boxwave would not provide a replacement because I had purchased through Amazon and not directly through them. I liked it a lot but it is now unusable.
I love the case and it came 2 days early but there is some gripes i have. first of all there is a strong chemical smell as if the case was just freshly stained and second I had to remove the back of my galaxy s3 phone in order to get it to fit in the new case. and ive had it and been using it for 3-4 hours now and the smell is all through my house. it makes my throat hurt and im coughing so im going to leave the case outside for a couple of days and see if the smell goes away. I hope it does because i really wanted to use that case.I will update in a few days. if anyone has any suggestions on how to make the smell go away please let me know.update: ok i left the case outside for 24 hours and it seems to be ok now. but i still have to remove the back of my phone for it to fit. my phone is the galaxy s3 SGH-I747
Let's start off with the fact that this is a well made case and fit my Nexus 4 flawlessly. The workmanship was good and after an initial breakin period that lessened the oil seepage and the smell I was very pleased with the feel. I used this for about two months before switching and had almost no wear or other issues. I tend to carry very small wallets and had hoped to use this product to combine the wallet and the phone into one convenient package.But still, it just didn't work out. It was awkward to hold while making phone calls because of the large "spine" on the case and I'm old school in that I actually talk on the phone. And the "wallet" portion wasn't quite up to snuff. By the time I put my driver's license in there (an exceptionally tight fit on the windowed part of the case and I was almost not able to remove it later) and a couple of credit cards it was actually too thick to keep in any pocket comfortably. The "covers" of the case are very thick while they protect the phone and contents, two of them are too much when combined with the thickness of my thin Nexus 4 and a couple of credit cards. I tried keeping it in a hammer pocket in my carpenter's jeans and in some cargo pants, but it was too high to fit well into those pockets.I really like the concept of this thing, but it just didn't do what I hoped it would.
I've used this earpiece as has my wife. We both liked it, when it worked, but after a short drop from the dashboard to the carpeted floor, it stopped working. I also think it's a bit large, in these days of ever smaller bluetooth devices.
I bought this headset at the same time as my Verizon Palm Treo 650.  Pairing was a snap, and it supported the hands free profile.  The call quality was great on both ends (however wind or car A/C caused people on the other end to have lower quality).  I only charged it twice - day one and one week later.  I used it for about a total of one to two hours a day on my commute.There was just one drawback, and it was a deal-breaker for me.  I wear glasses, and the bulk of the headset behind the ear made it very uncomfortable.  I returned the headset today after I had to end my call on the way home after 20 minutes.  If you don't wear glasses, this is an ideal bluetooth headset for the Treo 650.
It works fine. It connects consistently and the sound quality is acceptable but, the battery life is not so good. The stand-by battery life could be a lot better.
First, why so big?I like that the microphone turns the unit off/on but that is it.The ear piece has thin rubber around edge of speaker that eventually pealed off. Doesn't really impact comfort or help with cupping sound into ear so I'm not sure why that is there.The WORST part of this headset and the other 3 Motorola headsets I've had is that they take forever to activate during a call.  When my phone rings and I'm using my Samsung headset my call is picked up almost instantly, when using any of my Motorola headsets there is literally a 2-3 second pause after answering the phone until the headset is picked up.Often by the time my headset picks up people on the other end are already saying, "Hello?  are you there?"I won't buy another Motorola headset, that's for sure.I gave it a 3 because I like the flip on/off & how it fits in my pocket because of that and that it does work.  It just doesn't compete with my Samsung or Plantronics headsets.
Bought this to replace the HS820 simply for the flip-on functionality. After about 2 months of use, I have concluded that with the exception of the flip-on trick, the HS820 is actually a better headset. Mainly due to the volume. The HS820 has MUCH more volume and even seemed to fit on the ear a little better. Not a bad unit at all, but the volume and fitment issues should have been resolved before product release.
As an early adopter of mobile technology, I am always seeking new wireless gadgets to improve my productivity.  So, after a friend reported having good success with the HS850, I acquired one on eBay.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is below expectations and I continue to use my wired headset.My cell phone goes with me everywhere, especially when I drive.  Hence, I have been using wired headset for the past ten years.  The tangling of the headset wire with itself and my mp3 headphones gets rather annoying.  So, I was looking forward to time when the reviews of Bluetooth headsets became positive in the press.When I purchased this model, the information I saw was rather positive, especially about the form factor.  The model is both light and easy to operate.  It intelligently turns on when flipping open the boom.  However, the ring which goes around your ear is just is barely strong enough to keep the headset on.  While it hasn't fallen off, it constantly feels like it might whenever my head is moving.My big complaint with the HS850 is the sound quality. Not only is there a slight hiss, but there is also a slightly noticeable electronic digitization.  I would think by 2006 this problem would be corrected.  It sounds very much like the first generation of digital cell phones.  Because of this, I would recommend considering other models.ProsSmallLightweightConsMediocre sound qualityDoesn't hold tightly enough.
First of all, I love the idea of a cordless headset and I have a Motorola phone so I thought getting a Motorola bluetooth headset would give me the best sound quality. I think that the HS850 is a nice design but has flaws the actual ear piece would do better if it sat just inside the ear (Like an earbud) the way it is now sitting just up against the ear makes it difficult to hear your party. More times than not you have to press it against your ear. I also think that the users voice comes out a bit muffled and people complain that they can't really hear you. Lastly this headset needs improvement it terms of cancelling out wind noise. I look forward to future models addressing these issues. All in All I mostly enjoy this device even with the flaws.
This is a decent Bluetooth headset.static, in general,is tolerable, unlike many of Motorola's other (and pricier) headsets.However, the volume level is far too low.  One has to literally press the headset against one's ear when driving on the freeway.On the bright side, the open/fold of the boom to turn the headset on/off is and innovative feature unique to Motorola headsets (and not all of them, at that).
When it comes to headsets, the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. The fit was a bit loose but not a huge problem. The big issue for me was the muffled sound, both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola H700 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)
Have been using this unit for over a year and for the most part, I like it.Pros: Easy BT connection to my LG VX8300.  Easy to carry in your pocket.  Simple to use. Light. Great range. very good battery life. Like the 'flip open the mike to turn it on' feature.Cons: I have trouble hearing people when there's a lot of ambient noise due to the lack of an earbud that goes in the ear.  For this reason, my next BT headset will definitely be of the 'earbud' design.  Always feels like it's about to fall off, but generally doesn't - still distracting.  A little trouble maintaining a good connection with the phone when my phone is close to my body in my belt holster or pocket (though this could actually be a problem with the phone's BT antenna being in close proximity to my body).  It never has a problem if my phone is sitting on a table even when I'm 20-30 feet away.Overall, a good headset.  But after only a year, I am having trouble getting the charger to connect and the shroud around the ear speaker has come off.
I bought this earpiece a month ago to go with my brand new Nextel i870.  It worked sorta ok but was a bit finiky when used with my phone in my belt holder.  I didnt wear it all the time, just when I was commuting to and from work.  I kept it in my pocket so it would be on standby, in contact with my phone.  Most times, it would connect quickly and function well.  Ocassionally, it would seem to connect, but when I attempted an outgoing call, it would disconnect.I also had trouble hearing the unit while driving.  As I am approaching my mid 50's, my hearing is not as acute as in past years, and the internal noise from the pickup truck (windows up, and AC running) makes hearing the other party on the earpiece difficult.My main problem with this unit is the recharge plug.  I have 3 Nextel/Motorola phones that use this type of plug and have not had any trouble with it.  The plug end has a release button to depress when unplugging.  The catch on my HS850 charger plug was more difficult to release and required much more pressure to release than my other 2 Motorola charger plugs of the same type.  This contributed to undue stress on the socket and eventually the socket pulled loose.  I probably charged it 6-7 times over the month I had it.I intend to replace my HS850 with some other type that has an earpiece that fits in my ear, providing some sound isolation from environmental noises, rather than the lay on this ear type.Be careful unplugging this unit from its charging plug.
I got two of these.  One for my wife and one for me.  I can not tell when she calls me if she is on the phone or using the headset ( maybe that is more a comment on the phone :) ).The voice interface of the phone has more to do with how well this works.  On my wife's phone she has to train each contact she wants to voice dial.  Not very practical.  On my phone it just figures it out but sometimes I am not certain who it has decided to call.  We both end up dialing through the phone and using the headset to talk and answer calls.  (We both have Verizon WM5 PDA phones.)
I bought this bluetooth earpiece with my Sony Ericsson P900 a couple of years ago and it's still going strong. I do not have any problems with it and have used it extensively.  It's great to have some kind of hands-free, wireless device.  This one sits on my ear and is out of the way.After 2 years of use, the silicone part around the earpiece that "seals" the earpiece to your ear has come away from from the plastic.  Not really a big deal, but it is breaking away from normal use.  I've never dropped it or abused it in any way, so I would have expected it to last longer than this.  Performance is still good though.It does sit a little precariously on my ear, it's just a light "wrap" around my ear, so if I lean over too much, there is a danger it can fall off.  Care must be taken when you're wearing it.  And even though it is one of the smaller wireless units, it's still heavy after wearing it for a few hours.  Battery life is good and charging is easy.If buying another one, I would look for one that can sit more securely on my ear, but I would have no problems sticking with this brand.
Do not remember, probably changed phones and may find it in a draw one day. I am sure it came and everything was o.k.
This fit my Verizon V3M Razr, fit on my person comfortably while driving and would be a great gadget if it were not for the HUGE ear bud.  I have large earcanals and this earbud does not even come close to fitting in it.  Rediculous!Most reputable earbud companies (V-Moda, Bose and Shure) have different size earbuds for each individual.  I am disappointed in this product...
Good headset, good sound, Great price. I had another brand I bought at a store for $19 (which I returned) the sound works better on this one. Its sound wasn't as good as this one and the fit was bad. This one has good sound and the fit is better than the other one (although not perfect). I can't complain.
It worked for the small time we needed it. Didn't like the antenna, but hey the phone range and made calls. It had a calculator too!i know..big whoop!
I owned the V300 and found it to be a bit quirky, strange things would happen when ever I charged it, when it was finished all the personal settings would revert back to factory standard. They seemed to have fixed that with this latest version of the phone. My understanding is that they have combined the features from both the v300 and the v 600 to make this phone. I've only had it for 1 week and so far so good I always enjoyed functions such as speaker phone, voice dialing and voice memos, now I get the blue tooth and a much better redesigned key pad along with video clip capabilities. All of this is good news! If I had to pick a down side I would have to say that I'm dissapointed that Motorola decided to make this phone look exactly like the v300. I like what the body of the phone feels like, but a change of color would be better, maybe silver.
Yeah it's a sim card and well my phone doesn't have 3G so I don't really care that it works with 3G because it doesn't matter.I don't know why they want reviews on sim cards. I find SIM cards outdated though, They are massive compared to Micro SD cards and yet they hold next to no information when compared.The only reason SIM cards are good is because they go in GSM phones and if you unlock your phone you can cart it off to another service provider without issue. Especially quad band phones.
When I got my new LG Xenon through Amazon, they sent me a new sim card, too.  I didn't change it out right away as when I put my old sim card in my new phone it worked.  But then, a few weeks later, I tried to add a data feature to my phone from the AT&T; website and I had some problems.  The data feature wouldn't add.  When I called AT&T;, they figured it was because I was still using my old sim card, so I put the new card in at that time and everything worked ok from then on.I'm guessing (and I'm really just guessing here...) that along with other things that the new sim card does, it also somehow allows AT&T; to make sure that the folks that have phones that MUST use a $30 data package GET a $30 data package.  This is totally a guess on my end, but that was the feeling I got from customer service when I called.Made me wonder if a used iPhone would work on the network and if using an old sim card if you would not HAVE to get the data package from AT&T.;  Of course, then you would be limited to connecting to a wireless connection (like a computer) for email and internet, but then not everyone needs email and the internet all the time. But, maybe this would be cheating AT&T;?  If you buy an iPhone used and connect over AT&T;, are you contracted to use the $30 data package no matter what?Anyway, I'm sure I'm missing data here, because this is not very clear, but I thought it was interesting...  The new sim card is working fine now.
The newer Voyager Pro is much, much better but this was a good bluetooth device in it's day. Not as tough as I would have liked though.
This is the first headset that I ever bought that did not come with any instructions I can not load it on my phone
Pros:* I love the fit. Very balanced and hard to lose while working out. A big plus over the Motorola H700 I had before that was always falling off. This is significant because this is a replacement for the H700 I lost jogging in the rain.* Outbound voice quality is reported superior to my old Motorola by my friends.* Incoming sound is as good as the Motorola and actually a bit better when you account for the fit to ear seal.Cons:* Claims of 6 hours of talk time are greatly inflated.  More like 3 right off the charger. This is a problem. Now I need a car charger for it.* Too many buttons and not intuitive. Not responsive sometimes to commands. Sluggish switching.* The ear pieces cost you a certain amount of ambient hearing of your environment. Whatever size you use, it still really cuts down on your hearing of the world around you on that side. Compared to the "floppy" Motorola, this is extreme. The Motorola had no impact on hearing that I would notice.The talk time is my biggest complaint. The rest is just nitpicking.
The Plantronics Voyager 510 is a good bluetooth headset for its current price.  However, depending on how you plan to use it, it could either become a great headset or a nightmare.The first thing you notice out of the box is that it's quite large, both in the size of the battery pack that hangs over your ear and especially the depth of the microphone.  Put another way, it sticks out quite a bit from your cheek rather than laying flat against your face.  This not only can cause some sound quality issues, but also makes it very conspicuous.  So, if you prefer to keep a low profile while working hands-free, this may not be the best one for you.  The size of the piece that hangs over your ear also makes wearing glasses or even a hat an issue.  All that said, the unit is very comfortable provided you don't have anything else hooked over your ear.  It's also easily configured for either ear.Sound quality can be very good, but only in quiet environments.  Even small amounts of wind noise will render the microphone useless.  I've been surprised to have people complain to me that voicemails that I've left have been all broken up, even when I was in what I thought was a quiet place.I've also found that reception will be spotty unless the phone is placed closer than normal to the headset.  For instance, in order to maintain good signal, I typically have to have my phone in my shirt pocket.  But on the plus side, the unit is very easy to set up, with a variety of phones and PDAs immediately connecting to it with no effort.This headset would be ideal for someone who is looking to use it exclusively in an indoor office while working hands-free.  You'd get optimal sound and would be able to connect to all of your devices quickly and easily.  You wouldn't even feel self-conscious about the unit's size.  But for those on the go, its reception and microphone quality are too poor to recommend.PROS*  Excellent battery life means very little downtime for charging*  Simple to set up - instantly compatible with numerous devicesCONS*  Sound quality from the microphone, especially in places with even minimal background noise*  Big, bulky design makes fit difficult, especially with glasses or a hat
This is my 3rd bluetooth headset and my 2nd Plantronics.Plusses: works really well with my phone, even up to 20' away. I've dropped it lots of times and it's holding up nicely. Easily adjusts to either ear. Turns on & off easily.Negatives: People complain they can't hear me on a regular basis (even when there isn't noise around me). Is awful with wind noise. Is much clunkier than my last Plantronics (330). My phone knows it's there but is often very slow to transfer over to the headset.Overall, I am disappointed with the headset - other than the range between it & the phone, it's is not as good as the Plantronics 330.
I've heard great things about this, so I tried it. Everything is great about it, except two things that made me want to return it.First, there is a little bit of crackling once my phone is across my body on my hip, and that is annoying to me because I've had some that never do that. I've noticed that Plantronics and Jabra tend to have this issue regularly with their headsets. The other thing is that it is bulky, and I prefer something a little more pettite.It does have good battery life and noise cancellation. So, it's a matter of preference when it comes to the things I disliked about it!
Definitely a much better headset than the other two Motorola models that I also own -- it is loud, clear and the battery lasts a good two days between stand-by and light/medium use. It is a little larger in size but it is light in weight and comfortable for extended wear (3-4 hours at a time).There is one drawback, the unusual power cord/plug. After only 1-2 months of use, the headset started to not charge properly unless the plug is connected to the bottom of the headset just right.***10/2008***I liked it so much, I bought one for my wife. Unfortunately, hers die within 2 months with very light use. And, I mean 'light' -- it spent most of its life sitting on her nightstand. The light indicator went dark (not turned off) and it wasn't picking up her voice when she speaks into it. We returned it for a replacement and this one appears to be working just fine.
I've used the Plantronics Voyager 510 for a few months and have been quite satisfied with the length of the battery charge, reception, volume, and ability for others to hear me speak clearly.  The size of the headset is large compared to other headsets on the market and this is the only downside to this item.  Other headsets may look "sleek", "chic", or more "cool", but if good earpiece volume and clear transmission of your voice is critical, this is the headpiece for you.  If the size of the headset the goes behind the ear was slightly slimmer, I'd give it a full five stars.  The interchangeable earbuds are somewhat tricky to remove once installed.  That's the only other downside to this unit.  Otherwise, a great headset.  I enjoy mine a great deal.Update to my previous review (August 2010): After using this headset for over two years, I'm still fairly satisfied.  The only problems I've had was one of the earbuds was broken off after I mistakenly put the earpiece in my briefcase with several items the pressed against it.  Fortunately, there are two other earbuds included with the headset and I easily replaced the broken one.  Also, after a period of time, I've noticed the foam cover for the earbuds tends to split at the seam.  If you're purchasing this headset for the first time, it may be worth your money to buy and extra earbud/foam covers set.  Another problem is the headset momentarily disconnecting with my cell phone, then connecting back.  At this time, I don't know whether that is a result of problems with the headset or the phone.  Otherwise, it has served me well and I've yet to have had anyone tell me that my voice was difficult to hear or understand while conversing in a variety of noisy conditions.  Considering how long I've used this headset and it's performance to date, I can still recommend it to potential buyers.Another update to my previous review (September, 2010).  Since my last update, another issue has arisen with this headset.  The rubber material that houses the wiring and is the part that bends over your ear, has cracked in two areas.  One is closer to the top (near the on/off switch), the other is at the end of the rubber "tube" just above the earpiece.  At the latter location, the rubber is literally crumbling to pieces and exposing the wire cord within.  This is a very recent development and seems to be a part of decay based on age.  I realize after 2 1/2 years that no Bluetooth headset will look like new, but if this deterioration keeps up, a significant portion of the wire that runs from the battery to the earpiece/mic will be exposed.  When taking the construction into consideration, there's no way to replace this portion of the headset.  Short of wrapping the rubber in electrical tape (which would only give an unsightly and temporary fix), the only other solution is buying another one.  But, that doesn't make sense since the item is still in perfect working order, has a great earpiece with clear sound, and I've yet to have anyone complain about the quality of my voice through the mic, even when I was in a noisy environment.Final update to two previous updates (September, 2010).  The problem I wrote about in my last update has made me decide to never consider this model again.  The rubber portion that fits over my ear literally crumbled into several pieces two days ago.  Not only did this make the earpiece useless, but the wiring broke off from the circuit board that's in the piece that goes behind your ear.  Long story short, don't buy this model and expect to get several years of use.  If you're lucky and VERY careful in the way you carry, store, & use this item, you'll be lucky to get two years of use out of it.  Otherwise, I can't recommend it since there are so many other models that are equal to or better for less money.  I'll generously give it three stars...was tempted to give it only two, but the boom mic is an asset...noise reduction is better than average...but that's about all.
The technology couldn't be better. Bluetooth conecteivity is simple to establish. The overall physical design is excellent. Though it looks heavy, the unit is a featherweight and fits nicely around the ear. Long-term wearing is comfortable. Audio fidelity is excellent.Where the unit fails badly, though, is the controls. They do not provide enough tactile input. You cannot be certain of where the volume control is or which end of the rocker switch increases or decreases the volume. Since the volume defaults to moderately low setting, this means you are likely to miss the first words of whatever your caller is saying which in turn means a lot of asking "what did you say?".The Call Control button handles at least four different functions. On a phone equipped to handle all four functions, it is easy to mistakenly select a function. For example, on my phone, if I hold the Call Control button a fraction too long, the call is not answered, but the prompt to enter a Voice Speed Dial entry is actuated. No fun when you are trying to answer a call.Plantronics provides three earpiece inserts and it's unlikely that one of them won't provide a comfortable, snug fit.Overall, excellent technology marred by poor ergonomics.Jerry
Item does work well as far as sound quality and setup ease. However ear loop is basically not adjustable at all, consequently making the ear piece itself to constantly work its way out of my ear and feel as if it were just hanging there... After days of pushing ear piece back into my ear canal and hoping the loop would give a bit. i returned it for exactly those reasons... Great sound quality and no one i spoke to claimed to hear any distortion. just didn't fit well with no possible adjusting available...
The sound quality is tops both at the sending and receiving ends. However, the ear hook is on the thick side. This can be a problem for ears that lie close to the head - the earhook pushes the ear away from the head. First, this does create a rather odd looking mismatched pair of ears! Second, it can become uncomfortable after prolonged use. It also poses a problem when wearing eyeglasses - one temple rests on top of the headset ear hook with the other at ear height. This causes the eyeglasses to rest lop-sided. So, buyer beware. The sound quality is great. The comfort issue could be a problem for you.
Works fine. But I'm still not happy. This is my third/fourth Plantronics headset.This one  bought for dual pairing with my LT and my cell phone.(iPhone).It works fine with both.I am subtracting marks for the followinga) Changing charger designs. Third headset, none of the chargers are interchangeable, so I always get the AC charger, but have to buy the car chargerb) For iPhone, this works only for the phone. Music will not work. Now I am looking instead at the Plantronics 855 Stereo Headset - do handle both = phone/music and still do dual pairing with LT
I've went through 3 of these bluetooth headsets in 5 years. When I got my first one it was extremely cheaper than offered now. The only reason I had to get my second one was because my dog chewed it up, then I backed over my second one with my car in the driveway, so I bought the third. Thinking I was still getthing the exact same quality as before I wanted to stick with what I knew. I connected it to multiple bt compatible devices with ease... PS3, iPod Touch, iPhone, Blackberry, etc. All three times I purchased this product it ran no more than $30, but since they've redesigned it the quality has gone down & the price has increased to what you see now. I especially liked the fact that it had three different ear buds to accustom its users, but the part that went around the ear became annoying at times. Pending on what you're doing cut I'd be cleanin & sweating & it wouldn't hold firm. Same thing if I walked outside (Note that I'm in Tx,so it's very humid) the ear piece would come out. Btw, my third one is getting trashed because people can no longer hear me clearly and I only had this one for about 4 months. If you know better than this product stick with it because my 3 star rating is for the 4 years I had the previous version & not this new, redesigned, $126 version. You could absolutely do better elsewhere.Oh yea, after a while of frequent use, it began to split. I may try to show you guys a picture because with Platonics this design is known to do that. Lesson learned...
This is a great headset but for one thing. The voice call feature on my phone quit working when I upgraded from Windows Mobile 5 to 6. I called the phone manufactor, the cell phone company, and the headset company. None know what to do, only it is incompatable with Mobile 6. Mobile 6 does not use voice tags on selected contacts. It changes voice to digital and looks for what you said. It cannot change the voice from this headset to digital. It works great on answering, not calling with voice. It works great with calls that dial out also.So make sure your headset is compatable to Mobile 6 for voice calling. Of course this assumes that your phone can make voice calls.Again, it works with Mobile 5
It wouldn't work if the phone and the Bluetooth were more than ten feet apart.  The pairing was not as bad but many times it would disconnect one line or the other
So we purchased this headset because of all the mostly wonderful raving reviews.  For the first hour when my husband called me it sounded perfect.... I didn't even know that he had it on.  I breathed a sigh of relief.  Then he calls me later on and it is extremely choppy... the next day he is barely discernable and everytime the phone rings, I can't even hear him.We are confused... it sounded perfect and then it went kaput.  He didn't drop it!  The only thing that he can come up with is that he was sweating because we were having a heat wave in NYC and maybe that messed it up.  The sweat; that is!So I called Amazon, they sent me a new one which we will be trying out today.  I even called Plantronics at Amazons' suggestion just to make sure that it wasn't an issue on our end.  The verdict is that their customer service is exceptional!  Very helpful and took the time to understand my concerns.  We reset and resync'ed and still it sounds horrible.  Our phones are the Sprint Samsung Instincts.  Plantronics said that they do not have them on their list and they are still in the beginning testing phase and that may be the issue.So, I gave it 3 stars for the first hours of use.  I am hoping that we truly received a dud and that it isn't a phone compatibility issue or sweat for that matter.  Will update soon!
For a few years I have been with verizon .My last phone was the Motorola e815 .Recently I retired and didn't need all the mins I got on the $39 plan(with taxes came to $44)  pro: I bought the razr v3 on ebay and transfered over to T-Mobile prepaid.the phone works just great and through my Parrot 3200ls handsfree sounds just great.con:When I went to program speed dialing .Boy was I disappointed .First it would only allow 20 voice tags .Then I had to record each individual tag for voice recognition My e815 allowed me to use unlimited voicetags and I didn't have to record my voice on each number,anyones voice would work using any name in my phone book .The Razr is supposed to be an improvement ,which it's not .The Motorola e815 was the best phone I ever owned ,and now Motorola screwed it up .Whats the point of using bluetooth handsfree dialing when you have to scroll down to a name to dial,taking your hands off the wheel  .Wake up Motorola ,Thats stupid .
i feel like i can never have enough of these especially since i lose this cord easily and a lot of people have the same charger so it's good for visitors and whole family.
ok good product you get what you pay for works and is good for the pricee you cant go wrong
i bought the wrong cable- which is my fault.  so sue me.  but don't actually sue me- i can't afford a lawyer.
This is Probly a gr8 cell phone headset but when it cums 2 a work environment & business calls now could hear me! It was pretty comfortable but the earpiece was not as soft as id hoped
IT works fine but it doesn't fits tu well to the ear.
I bought this phone because of its sleek and stylish design. PROS and CONS:CONS: 1. The phone feels fragile and gets smudged easily. I find myself wiping off oils and finger prints constantly. Due to it's price, I would recommend purchasing the extra warranty on the phone from Cingular due to the risk of damaging the phone. 2. I find that in speakerphone mode, the call is almost inaudible while driving on the highway. I wish it could be louder. 3. The menu is complicated. The contacts must be entered as one entry, which is annoying if you have more than one phone number for a contact. 4. The phone doesn't have a setting to disable the roaming function. 5. The phone makes a buzzing sound near electronic devices (TV, computer, radio, etc.).PROS: 1. I have a bluetooth enabled PDA and I can transfer pictures from the PDA to the phone (and vice versa). Perfect for sharing photos or using graphics for wallpaper or picture caller ID 2. Battery life is long. 3. Video function is not that great, but is nice. 4. Audio is also better than a Sanyo 8200. 5. The phone doesn't feel heavy inside the chest pocket. All in all, not a bad phone. This phone is high maintenance and I don't recommend it to someone who have no patience for it's complex menus or minor shortcomings.
I ordered a cell phone from Amazon, the Motorola V3. When I checked my account the next day, a weird message told me that I was not approved, and instructed me to cancel my order. I was puzzled, but did as directed. Later that day, I went and got a great deal on a free phone from my local membership warehouse store.Later in the day, I was checking my e-mail and found one from Amazon. It explains that sometimes cell phone approval is slow and included the following:"Until this is resolved, it is possible that the information in the"Your Account" section of the Amazon site will incorrectly indicate thatthis order requires your attention and may direct you to cancel - pleasedisregard this until we get more information."WHAT???!!!They tell me to cancel the order, knowing that this is incorrect???Well, I followed their screwy directions, and they lost an order and alot of goodwill on my part.Amazon has been successful, they must know what they are doing, but this kind of behavior makes you wonder...To new cell buyers, BEWARE the incorrect message.
This is fine for what I use it for.  It is exactly as described. I plug my phone into my car radio and it works just fine. Plain and simple
I wanted to keep my car free and clear of cables so I purchased a retractable cable to at least keep it more organized. The retractable part works fine but the cable is pretty thin. I hooked it up to my stereo and I could here a lot of static. I then tried a not retractable cable that was pretty thick and the static was gone and the sound was a lot better. You have to sacrifice sound for clutter free cables or go with sound and have wires all over. I stopped using this since I couldn't stand the static. I am not sure if its the cable I got or not but I will stick to the non retractable cable. I'll just have to find a short one since the 3 foot one I have is too long.
This item is not bad but the retractable cord is too short. Otherwise It is easy to carry around and serves its purpose
I bought this in hopes that it would help keep the cord situation under control in my car.  However, after only two short months, the cord shorted out.  I ended up buying a different one.
not sure what issue is here.  but I put one in my wifes BMW 335 Ci convertible and it makes a horrible background noise.  That was not there before.I put in my Buick Enclave and it works flawlessly.Not sure where the interference is coming from.
This is a male to male patch 3.5mm cable - ostensibly to connect anything with an earphone jack to anything with a headphone input.  The reason to buy this is the retracting mechanism, but that mechanism gets tangled sometimes.  You have to pull both ends out evenly (with the center part staying in the middle of the span).  You cannot pull from one side only - it will get tangled and jam.
It rolls up nice but has a hissing sound in the background. In the dead spot between two songs you can hear the hissing. It isnt all that loud but its there. Still works well enough that I didnt want to return it.
It does tear up way too easy. This is my 3rd one. I've tried others and find I go back to it. Problems that have occured: The input jacks bend, short in the cords, and failure to retract as designed. While its a great design, some thing needs to be done so it can stand up to the real world.
Cheap in price and quality. Mine broke after a couple months of use. The sound started going in and out. It was cheap enough I wasn't really upset. Next time I might just buy a couple so I don't have to wait for the replacement to come.
This was used about four times before it stopped working, it was the car side with the issue and other chargers did work in this lighter so really not worth it.
The case loosened over time and slides up on the phone, which makes it hard to hear conversations.  I like the way it looks and protects the phone, but sometime it's not worth having the case on it.  It's okay, but next time I'll get a more flexible case
This earpiece worked well for me.  It had good range and sound quality and the hands free activation was very useful. One huge design flaw as I see it however was the on/off button.  To turn on/off the device you have to hold down the button.  After only a few months of use the button began to malfunction and over time the button totally stopped working. I purchased the device in November and by March the button had stopped working at all.  Since this is the same button that you have to push to answer a call, disconnect a call or activate voice recognition when the button stopped working the device became pretty useless.
It's ok but doesn't have enough range connection with the phone. If I walk a few feet away you get a lot of static. It's only good if you keep the phone right by the headset. It's great when driving in the car but not for walking around the house. I guess my advice is keep your phone in your pocket. All-in-all it's good for the price.
I read the reviews here and ended up buying this bluetooth device. After pairing it up with my phone, I ended up using while my phone was clipped to my belt. I got static, even if I move my phone I get static. I need to have the phone in front of me before I can use this bluetooth and not get static. Other than the static it's a nice bluetooth.
Of the 8 headsets I've tested, this one is about average. The sound quality is slightly muffled. No worse than most of the ones I've tried, but definitely not as good as my favorite, the Plantronics Voyager 510. If you've got a noisy environment, this one probably won't satisfy. I liked the single button function and found it worked great with only a rare glitch when the headset would partially connect to the phone resulting in me being able to hear through the headset but needing to speak through the phone. (Turn off the headset and turn it back on. No need to end the call.) My partner and I both used one of these hard core for over a year in a construction environment until I broke the ear loop on mine and moved on to the 510. Considering what we put them through, I have to say that this unit holds up. I compare headsets by pairing two of them, putting one in each ear and switching between them while on the same call. This lets me and the caller hear the difference. All in all, good price, easy to use, sturdy, and most people won't notice the sound quality.
Never got a chance to try it because you need all the Bluetooth things on your audio devices and TV. I am sure if I know a TV that comes with Bluetooth, so you have to buy the transmiter before you can use it.Anyway, the headphone fit *snugly* on my neck. And it is uncomfortable. So, back in the box and back to Amazon.
Using it with my Blacberry 8310, it works fine, full sterio since the bb handles that.  The only problem,  The T820, does not want always pair. First device I have that does this. It will pair, but forgets to, include the sterio service transport ( kinda of important).  then it works.  The phones fit snugg, but a bit tight.  I have a  Giant head so maybe it is a bit much for me, but they seem durable
A great headset - if used in a quiet environment. At the above price, it's a bit expensive, but an excellent value. It should have come with a USB charger adapter included; instead, this is supposedly available as an add-on accessory, yet can't be found for sale anywhere. My report card:Design: A-, very simple and lightweight design. Buttons are few and usable, after some practice. Comes with 4 different adapters for OEM phone chargers, which is a novel yet cumbersome approach. Includes additional accessories for a more custom fit. Carrying pocket doubles as charging station; headset fits dangerously loosely inside, and the pocket itself doesn't clip securely onto shirt pockets or belts. An aluminum carrying case is provided to keep everything together.Aesthetics: A-, it's a tiny and stylish piece.Build quality: B+, the materials look more solid than they are. Construction is fair.Comfort: A+, the most comfortable and stable headset ever. Multiple "ear gels" aid in attaining a custom fit that is quite secure. An earhook is also provided for added stability, but probably won't be needed.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing or using this headset. Full handsfree functionality is available, but controls differ greatly for different functions and take some learning.Outbound sound quality: B+, callers can hear me great, along with any other noises in the environment. Lack of noise cancellation makes this headset worthless in, for example, a crowded room. No echo whatsoever, though.Inbound sound quality: B, volume is beyond plentiful. Inbound voices are rich in bass but *completely* lack crispness. Frequent static regardless of range or line-of-sight.
I like the "in the ear" approach. It's extremely comfortable. You have several options as far as finding a comfortable fit. It comes with a portable charger, which is a prelude to things to come.I could hear any caller without problems but in noisy environments they couldn't hear me. In a quite environment it worked very well. The battery is terrible. Their listing is "up to 3 hours". There's no way you can get that much talk time out of this. I heard allot of static. I couldn't wear my phone in the holster because of that.I'm a frequent business traveler and it doesn't work well for my needs. However, it does have some positive traits. The main two problems are extraneous noise problem and poor battery life. So if you're not in a loud area or heavy user it's a great headset.
After reading the stellar reviews for the Discovery 640 both on Amazon and Cnet, I bought one and took off for home. After charging it up and attempting sync with my Motorola v360, I found I couldn't get it to work. I re-read the manuals for the 640 and for my v360 to see if it was me. Then I went on the web to see if I had some compatibility issue. It then occurred to me that I might have actually gotten a bad piece of electronics - which is a pretty rare occurrence nowadays. I was able to cross check the Discovery and my phone with a friend's bluetooth headset (Moto HS820 and v600) and found that the Plantronics was the culprit.Bottom line: check before you get too far from the store. Since it is usually a hassle to return items via mail order, i would only buy from a brick and mortar store.Here is a tidbit you might want to know about bluetooth chips (ICs) - they are not always fully tested! I am directly involved in the semiconductor testing industry and have been for many years. Bluetooth chips, and many other relatively low cost consumer semiconductor devices, are NOT fully tested. Instead, the lots of devices are sample tested to statistically insure that a very high percentage are "good." This is in direct contrast to higher value chips, such as Intel, AMD and PPC microprocessors, that are much more fully tested at multiple steps. The low cost nature of bluetooth chips (as well as many mp3, 802.11, etc.) really mandates the sampled test approach. For the most part, we get away with it. In the case of the unit I bought, it was not sufficient. The fact that I got a defective finished headset means that it is unlikely that Plantronics does 100% testing of its finished headset in addition to the known fact that the IC manufacturer they use is unlikely to do 100% testing. Once again, check it before you leave the parking lot.I will try one of these again as soon as they are back in stock and report on it again if I get a functional unit.
Using it with the Nokia N97, the left mount side covers de unlock botton and the right mount side presses the camara botton. After installing an unlock application the issue with the ulock botton got solved. To solve the camara problem some foam material had to be cut out.Update 27.05.2011 - Works great with iPhone 3GS, even in protective leather casing.
I bought this item along with one by Kensington. The Kensington cradle did not accommodate my HTC Rezound cell with the extended battery. I kept both and am using the cradle from this product with the Kensington Mount. IMPORTANT NOTE: The gooseneck tube on this item SEEMS like it is solid and NON adjustable. It IS adjustable. It just takes quite a bit of force to do it, which is good!  The Kensington one also does bend. I  consider this to be quite a bargain.
I keep ordering these because there's nothing better for the price, but eventually, the foam &#34;fingers&#34; that grab the phone will break off from being squeezed.  Just the nature of the beast, I suppose.
Good Item..On Time delivery..Had a bit getting use to plug insert for power cord,  worked it out.Great Price and neat
Bought this as a surprise for my girlfriend, she used my Motorola H800 slider headset & commented how it would be nice to have one so she could talk & not have the hold the phone.  She loves it & it does everything she needs it to do & I saved about $20-$25 off store prices so it was great for both of us.  If you or your girfriend/wife are looking for an inexpensive bluetooth headset go with this one, good little headset at a good price.
The weight is nice and balance on the year is good.  The features are good, but one must remember certain button combinations for extended features (like press two buttons at the same time to mute the microphone).  The battery life is good.  A significant issue is that it picks up surrounding noise better than the person's voice who is taking, which means that it often can't be used.  If you don't drive a very quiet car, like a BMW or Mercedes, then users may complain that they can't hear you and ask you to "pick up the phone."
I purchased this bluetooth as a gift for a family member's Sony Ericsson cell phone.  We had to play around with it at first to get it working properly.  She still has minor issues with the headset, but overall she likes it.We decided not to return the headset because I did pair it with my iPhone 3G, after three attempts, without using the passcode.  I was able to use most features easily, with clear reception.  So the earpiece isn't defective.  The price was to good as well.Buyer beware, and do the research on the pairing capibilities with your electronic device and this bluetooth.
The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:) The H500 works fine with our LG Shine. Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup. The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why 3 stars? The volume control is hardly palpable. It is hard to adjust the volume while in use. Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust. Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear. It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear.
It is easy to use and set up but quickly went out of style. The pink coloring is very feminine and nice and the blue light button is easy to use.
I use this unit with my Palm Treo 700w, which has a pretty lousy BT radio, so that may explain part of the reason why the range is so awful with this headset.  Max range with clear line of sight is about 6 feet, but usually less then 24 inches.  It is barely usable if the phone is on my waist in its holster.  Major disappointment.  My Jabra BT250 is better with the Treo, but not hugely so.My biggest problem with this headset is that people are constantly telling me that they can't hear me.  I have to lift the mic boom away from my cheek and then they will say "Ah! Much better!".  When that is only the case while I stand there like a dork with one hand holding the mic boom away from my cheek and the other hand holding the phone within a foot of my head.  This looks pretty silly walking down an airport terminal, and rather defeats the purpose of having a headset in the first place...I'll say this, though - the H700 performs the feature that I was looking for which was so bad with the Jabra BT250 - it actually stays on my ear.  I have small ear lobes, and the Jabra won't stay put - if I lean down it falls off.  The H700 stays on very well, and you hardly notice it is even there.  Very comfortable!Too bad the mic gets blocked by my cheek, which makes it worthless about 50% of the time.**Update 5/11/2006**- solution to muffled sound problem...I trimmed a tiny piece of adhesive-backed felt (the kind you put under bowls/vases, etc. you will have on your coffee table)and placed it on the little gray bump on the boom, just behind the tiny mic opening. This creates an air gap between the mic opening and your cheek - problem solved!A great headset with pretty good reception and wonderful form factor. 5 stars if they fix the mic hole clearance problem!
I've had my H700 for almost a year now, and not until recently did I learn it was a FAKE!  WOAH!  After reading the PDF on this page about how to spot a fake, I quickly learned the one I picked up on eBay was a fake.However, the headset has worked VERY well.  I compared it to a bluespoon AX7 in-ear headset, and I ended up keeping my fake H700.  Overall, it has been a very good copy, although not the real thing.  Very reliable.  However, I am still disappointed that I did not get the real headset.Is there anything I can do about this?
I switched ot this model from a Jabra 47D.  The Motorola was much easier to disengage from the phone simply by closing it.  Also, the Motorola stays on the ear more securely.  The only drawback that I can see to this model is the sound quality is not as good as the Jabra.
I have a LG CU 500 and the phone did not have a problem in recognizing the cell phone.  However, I have a problem with the mic as it picks up EVERYY sound in the background.  If you are in a quiet room, the phone is great.  However, if you are in a mall or at the check out counter, you hear the background noises better than you hear the person on the phone!
I bought this several days ago, it is easy to use.After 2 days, I can not turn volumn up and the sound is so low and I can not hear it when I am driving (I have a lexus new car, it is quiet). or I did not operate correctly, but I follow the instruction in the manual.Anyone has such experience, please let us know.Thanks,Sumulu
I really wanted this to work.  It's a great design and it's easy to use and set up.  Sound quality listening is great.  Sound quality speaking, for others to hear, was unacceptable.  This could be because of the way it fits me, since this seems to work well for many others.  If you try this out, however, it's very important to check that others actually hear you well, and not, as in my experience, too loudly and with too much low end on the sound quality.  I'm returning it.
When it comes to headsets, the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. I find it easier to use the folding boom to turn it on/off when dropping it in a pocket rather than using a button like on most other models. The big issue for me was the muffled sound, both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola HS850 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)
Love the battery life, look and size, but have found the sound inferior to my  bottom-of-the-line HS 805.  Frequent static.And then the topper--whenever it is on, the blue light on the side blinks.  The instructions say that this stops after five minutes, or that it can be disabled by holding the two volume buttons.  Both are lies.  Maybe some twenty-something year old designer thought it was way cool to walk around with a big blinking LED on the side of your head, but I can't use this in a business setting.  It's going back.
The electronic parts worked fine; it sync'd fine and sounded alright. I just didn't like the way it fit on my ear.  It didn't feel stable or secure. I have the same problem with my headset with a similar ear pattern at work.
I hear lots of static, even before making a call.  I have Motorola H500 too, and that headset has no static with my phone (Verizon LG VX8300).  This H700 has LOTS of static.  Called Motorola tech support, and their best solution is to return and replace it.  As far as usability goes, this a great headset, over the ear is more comfortable than in ear and the fit is perfect - nice and snug.  I'd keep it without any doubt if it wasn't for static noise.  While I hear static, people on the other phone can hear me fine, just as good as when I'm using H500.
However I just did not enjoy the size of this behind the ear unit, found it to be too big. It is a little difficult at first learning how to slip this around your ear but after awhile it works out ok. Please note that you do not get to use your selected ring tone, it automaticly (Motorola hand set) defaults to its standard ring while the blue tooth is actively connected. You can turn the ear piece off then power on to answer in order to keep your fav ring tone. All in all it works very well, sound and loundness were very good. However, I just did not like the size of this unit. It is quite bulky.EDITJust picked up a HS850, now that is more to my liking, however I hope there will be no issues of a broken wire in the flip boom as the reviewer above mentioned.
