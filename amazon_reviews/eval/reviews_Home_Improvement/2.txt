I have two of these clamp lights and another in the desktop lap model which is basically the same with a different base.  One, I use in my bedroom clamped to a shelf next to my bed and pivot it so I can use it as a reading light.  The light is surprisingly bright and pleasing.  However, after a few weeks of use I noticed the light lost brightness.  It was quickly obvious it was the switch.  If I pushed on the switch more in the on position, the light would brighten back up.  A while later, same thing, pushed on the switch or turned it of and on and it's back.  Later, it's down to almost nothing again...Ok, so I drove up to IKEA to return it.  After a 30 minute wait for my number to be called, they graciously gave me a once-a-year store credit because I didn't have my receipt (never imagined I would need one for a $19 light).I bought another and now two weeks later, same problem.  I do have one more and I'm waiting to see if the same problem occurs.  I suspect it might.I might...  might...  drive back up to IKEA and get another.  But if I have one more failure, it's going in the trash.  Or maybe I can find some other lamp cord switch that would work on this tiny gauge wire.IKEA has a problem with the design of the cheap switch.
The stop mechanism is a little hard to tighten, and I question the accuracy.  The length of the bars is only good for short work.  It was a dissapointment after purchaising the saw, which is fantastic, and as a result I had to make my own miter extension and stop.  Buy the saw and save your money on this.
I did not find this useful. I thought they retract for transport and storage but they do not. In order to change the stop to the other side you need to remove the slides. I would return if not for the shipping cost being close to the item value.
The unit worked well for the first two weeks but then suddenly started displaying wildly wrong values (e.g., around 17 degrees when the unit was level).  In contrast to my earlier experience with it when it was working, the calibration button no longer worked to reset the zero - instead the digits just flashed to dashes momentarily.  The first time this happened, I tried physically removing and then returning the battery, and that seemed to cure it.  But today, it happened again, and that step no longer worked, so I'm returning it for a different model.  I'm giving it two stars for working well while it worked, but reliability is important to me, and I don't want to take a chance on a second unit having the same problem in two weeks or even two years.
The product is probably fine as a 100 foot phone cable but I actually bought it for the wire inside.  The wire inside is not 22 AWG solid copper wire as it said in the description.  The wire inside is 22 AWG stranded copper wire.  I needed solid copper wire.
The product is great quality, but does not match the product description below it. I wanted and thought I was going to get a tape that measured in feet/inches on one side and meters/centimeters on the other. This item only measures in feet/inches. Big disappointment.
These suspenders seem to be well made, with fairly heavy material and clips. They probably are good as work suspenders, where appearances aren't important.  But, that's not what I bought them for. I bought them to wear on my normal jeans as everyday wear.  The biggest problem with them is that, as noted in their descriptions, the straps are made of 2 different types of materials. The front straps are not elastic, but some other material and the rear straps are elastic. The colors of the 2 materials are significantly different. The front straps are a much brighter shade of red than the rear straps.  I'd be much happier with them if all of the straps were the elastic material of the rear straps.If you're looking for strictly work suspenders, perhaps these would meet your needs as they are.
No elastic so not what i wanted. maybe i should have read the description better.
I don't like it,because one half is extended part,while the other half not.Will return it. Buy something else instead.thank you.
This problem did not occur with other suspenders I have purchased in the past.  I do not know what was the reason for the difference
&#34;One size didn't fit&#34;  My husband is between sizes and will lose more weight.  Eventually they will fit.  Wish they had worked out.
I read a lot of great review for these suspenders.  I wore them for a few days and they worked well.  Before I knew it, the clasps started coming loose from the pants.  I even attached them to the pants at the belt loop so that it would have more material to grab.  Unfortunately, it still pops loose.  For less than ten dollars, they were ok.  I'm glad I didn't spend more on these.
the quality is not bad but clips are too sharp and cut the jeans. It is not recommended to be used with regular pants and jeans ...
These were not worth the price.  They are very hard and not flexable.  They are very skimpy.  If you buy, make sure you get the next larger size than they say you need.  The straps are not sewn together, so they can come off the slide if you do not watch how you are changing the size of the length
I wasn't expecting it to be &#34;painted silver&#34; I wanted to use it for Ice at my reception, Shabby Chic theme, But i don't know if its safe since it's obvious it was spray painted silver...thought it was Galvanized
I ordered because the description noted that a pitch calculator was on the back.  Not so.  I returned all 10 ordered as this was important to us as a roofing contractor.
buenisimo
I was using these to hold my flashlight in my car, and they broke. Just in the course of usage, not in a car wreck or anything. I was using them to hold the light horizontally, so maybe a vertical position mounted on a wall would work better, but even for that I would rather make something myself than buy these.
These plastic brackets break easily under the weight of the flashlight.  Save your money or this will be a recurring buy.
one of the prongs broke off pretty soon after i mounted it and used the light a few times.it still holds the light so i just left it on the wall.
Not much I can say about them.  I was excited to finally have a place for my maglite in my class B RV, but sadly within the first couple of times that I removed the light while at a campsite, one clip broke.  Having said that, I'm here to buy another set since they are inexpensive enough.Update - after a little more searching, I decided not to go with these again.  I'll spend a few more dollars on these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006NOC8Q6/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&smid;=A30CMYG2VPLUO6
I have mine mounted in my vehicle as well for offroading and it is mounted to the body of the vehicle on the driver side pillar and within 2 weeks one side broke off and I was in the motion of pulling the light out so it was not getting slammed into it or anything.  My father was in the vehicle as I was removing the light to show him and once it broke while I was removing it my dad's first response was, "well that's a crappy clip".  I am going to purchase it once more and maybe see if the second will last longer and if so I will edit my opinion.
very strong grip! but broke!! after 10 flashlight placement! weak plastic....i would not recommend this product for law enforcement..or anyone going too use your flashlight more than once a month!
I'm not sure what it would be good for, but planing wood is not one of those things.  It's just too small.  There's nothing wrong with the build quality, though.
I bought this plane to shave some cabinet doors down (they were only rubbing a bit).  This was hard to use because it was small making it hard to hold and awkward/impossible to apply even force.  A dud for my job.
Very low price with quality to match.  I had to sand down one leg to level the level itself so it would read the same when turned end for end standing on my bench.  I had to file out part of the hanging loop for the same reason to get consistent readings on a line.  The vial is loose and can be rotated in the housing, which changes the readings (or can aid in adjusting the level).  Not dependable.  I bought it because it had the extra markings for drainage slope.
I wish I wouldn't have bought this saw. I would be very willing to spend $50 more in order to get a saw the works well. This one just doesn't have enough power.
Unfortunately my 2 years old son was able to unlock it and was able to the fridge. Didn't solve my problem.
I bought two of these to keep my one year old out of the fridge. It didn't stop her- she just pulled real hard and the adhesive came loose on both of them. None of my other kids tried to get in the fridge but this one is a busy-body! I would expect something that is advertised to help keep children out of things would keeep a one year out of the fridge. The adhesive doesn't work well enough. I was on amazon.com looking for a different one when I noticed this one and thought "I have to say something so noone else will make this mistake." Maybe it would work for a child who is not as determined as mine is but I wouldn't chance it.
I cleaned the surfaces like I was supposed to, stuck this on, and it worked for maybe a week until my 2 year old ripped it off the cupboard and broke a jar of salsa on the floor...
The design of this latch is a nice idea, and the adhesive works very well (per package instructions, we cleaned our stainless steel surface and waited 24 hrs before using), but there are several reasons it is ineffective in our home.--Our freezer is on the top, so even though we installed this latch as high on the fridge door as possible, our 2 yr old can still reach it and study the design.  (Bad news!!)  He can reach it even more easily after he drags a chair across the room so he doesn't have to stand on his tiptoes.--Our little guy needed less than 12 hours (and that's being very generous with the amount of time!) to figure out that all he needed to do was use his chubby little finger to push the latch's button down, and then pull the door open.  It took me more time to decide to tell my hubby that his effort in finding, purchasing and attaching this lock to our fridge was completely pointless.--Once the latch is unbuckled, the end of the strap that's attached to the door itself gets caught between the door's seal and the body of the fridge, preventing the door from sealing.  Not very energy efficient to have the door open!We will be removing this latch and looking for another option to oursmart our 2 year old.  This did come as a pack of two, so I think we will try using the other one on the trash can to keep our beagle from browsing.  Although he and our son work in tandem as partners in crime...!
We purchased these to keep our two year old out of our fridge and freezer. Proud of our effort, within five minutes our two-year old came downstairs with a gallon of milk... I go up to see the fridge open. He then demonstrated again how he pushed up a chair, reached up, pushed the button, and pulled the cable out. Zero protection.However, I did give an extra star for one use. I was able to use it at work to tightly close a fridge that had a broken gasket... So, it wasn't completely worthless.
I bought these latches to keep my toddler from opening his dresser drawers and tossing all his clean clothes on the floor.  Within a week of installing them, my 22-month-old son has figured out how to open them all by himself, without even watching me to see how it's done.  He can open these latches just as easily as I can, which means I have to figure out how to remove the adhesive without damaging the dresser so I can replace these latches with the Safety 1st Adjustable Multi-Purpose Straps, which have successfully kept my two children out of my entertainment center for five years running now.
This worked for one of my children in the past, so I bought another one now that I have a 2 year old who is constantly getting into the fridge.  He ripped it off the sticky part the first day.  I reattached it and it worked for about a week until he figured out how to push the button and unlock it.  Too easy to unlock and doesn't stick well.
As soon as my 2 yr old son seen it He figured it out lol.He just pushes and pushes then it comes undone.
Hard to use and not great quality. I would look elsewhere. The button is not very good on this guy.
I purchased this to put on my bottom drawer freezer. Installation was really easy and it did stick great to the surface. However, my 18 month old figured out how to open it without even watching me use it. Duh...it has a button, which is fascinating to most toddlers.
Like that is was easy to use. Dislike how the adhesive wasn't sticky enough. This lasted about 4 days on our refrigerator.
This worked great as long as I remembered it was there. However, about 50% of the time, I would forget and swing the freezer door shut. The clip would inevitably catch in the door until about the 10th time when it broke. I know it sounds like just user error, but I'm sure I'm not the first. Now I just have a broken clip that is very securely attached to my freezer. Two stars because it still sticks! :/
I got this because my 2 year old kept emptying the fridge making items go bad...At first it worked great.  Then, it started falling off.  The sticky parts stay stuck to the fridge, but the strap falls off the sticky part all the time.  It is easy to use, but since the plastic strap falls off the sticky part, it makes it kinda useless.
I bought 6 of these for my filing cabinet, oven drawer (under the mainoven door), dishwasher and computer door. After 3 months,2 of them arebroken from being shut inside the door repeatedly by the kids or a carelessadult. They snap at the same place, the thinnest plastic part of the latch.I think this should be stronger, but you could say this is my fault. It ISjust plastic after all and we're dealing with kids here. I just wish thispart of the latch was stronger. 2 of the locks, after being properly installedjust popped off out of no where. I pushed them back into place and they seemto be adhered as good as before. Neither of the latches that popped off arepulled very often by the kids. So it seems that they work better with more"use". I can't give these a full bad review because they work. But they needto be improved. I also have not found anything better.
THESE GLOVES WERE NEARLY DESTROYED AFTER THE FIRST USE. USE THE WELLS LAMONT1140 THEY ARE A MUCH BETTER GLOVE.
I always have a problem finding gloves because my hands are so big, but usually, IF I can find a double XL I'm good. These were tighter than most even at that size. I ended up giving them to my buddy. They were well made; just didn't fit.
These are the type gloves I was looking for, except I asked for xxl gloves and they are more like large gloves. I had a heck of a time getting my hands in the glove and they were tigtht. I wish someone would make a glove that would fit my large hands, like a 4xl
I received my filters yesterday, Jan. 4th. The box it came in was not damaged but the Brita box inside was ripped and the filters were not secured. They were loose in the box. I was not happy to see how this Brita filter box was sent. I don't know if they are damaged. I have not used the filters yet. Bonnie
Don't buy it !!!clogged after one month of use. I mean the water flow becomes super slow...Try the one of the same brand but for the usage in a pitcher!
This system has been annoying since we got it. First, we needed to get a special adaptor for our faucet,after we tried for an hour to install it. They were good about sending it quickly, and it worked fairly well for a while. The connection loosens frequently and needs constant re-tightening. The light system worked with the original filter, but has never worked with the replacements we used, even though they were official Brita replacements. The filter light just stayed red the whole time, so we have to guess when to replace it. I've just replaced the filter and now there is no light at all. After we use up the replacement filters we've already purchased, we'll switch to a different system.
I've used this Brita faucet-mounted filter system for several years with few problems, except that the battery that indicates the need for a replacement cartridge had died. Not a big problem, just replace the filter every three months or so. I decided to get a new unit to make it easier, but that didn't turn out well. The first base unit delivered (~7/10) fell off the faucet with only the slightest touch. I returned it to Amazon. The second one was worse, detaching and making a mess if only the water was turned on. The problem appeared to be separation between the Brita-supplied faucet adapter and the Brita base unit. The adapter was a molded plastic piece for an internally-threaded faucet. I returned the second unit for a refund, thanks much Amazon. I can't recommend this unit based on my recent experience. Currently I am using the original unit with the original adapter and current replacement cartridges, cautioning my wife to be verry, verry careful in handling it, and am looking for a substitute unit. I suspect that the Brita-supplied internal thread adapter and Brita base unit thread details are incompatible and hope that Brita will resolve this issue soon.
When I buy this item in a local store and connect it to my faucet there is no dripping/leaking.  These that I purchased through Amazon must be what is referred to as &#34;B&#34; or &#34;C&#34; quality produced, not measuring up to &#34;A&#34; grade quality production because they do drip/leak.  I'm disappointed to find Amazon selling second-hand products for the price of a 1st grade quality item.
Bought these replacement filters since old unit showed time to change (red indicator light). First thing I noticed, these filters were not packaged in normal, manufacture's blister pack. They were &#34;loose&#34; in the box. Past several purchases were in blister pack. After installing and purging,  the indicator light, which should show &#34;green&#34; for a fresh filter, was not illuminated at all.I am wondering if I received NEW, UNUSED filters!
I love the Brita On Tap system and have been using it for years.  My dismay is with the seller -- when the filters arrived they were just knocking around in a box without the packaging that comes with new ones.  The product wasn't advertised as used.
This is a great faucet filter, and is durable and works as advertised.  BUT... replacement filters are sold in a simple, unsecured cardboard box.  No plastic bag, no tamper resistance, etc.  Buying "new" replacement filters is a gamble, since there is no way of knowing if anyone has tampered with, or used the product.  Come on Brita... use some common sense regarding the packaging of a product designed to clean up the water we drink!
I have been buying brita tap filter for years, its a good product and works great. The water tasts better and you can say that it filters all those unwanted minerals by tasting. The one I buy from walmart had good life and better taste but the one from amazon has short life and does not taste the same. I have no clue why. The last one I used died in 3 days (orange light flashing).Conc: Its a good product but I'll buy from some other store tham Amazon.
Directions were suspect at best, did not work for me at all, and overall I kind of watching to smash my head in after trying to use this thing.
I bought this kit in the hopes that the knurled sides of the attachment tool would give my fingers purchase on the tool to set the snaps. Most kits just have a straight rod which can be hard to hold.I found that what I thought was a knurled rod was instead two pieces, a setting rod inside a a knurled sleeve. That's good, I thought. Unfortunately, I found that the sleeve assembly limits the striking depth (the travel) of the setting rod, preventing the setting tool to go down far enough into the snap assembly to firmly set the snap or mushroom the snap post -  the tool bottoms out in the sleeve if the fabric is not thick enough. Also, the business end of the tool is smoothly conical, which though it mushrooms the hollow snap post, it does not allow one to mash or mushroom the post widely enough on regular material -- again, this is probably a function of the tool being designed for thicker fabric or leather. Remember that there are I believe two lengths of snap posts available, a long and a short. Be sure to use the correct length for your application, which may entail some trial and error. Remember you can always drill out any snap you have messed up, but it's a bother.I found that another setting tool of the simple rod type that I purchased with another kit works better for regular snap applications. The setting end is not simply conical, but has a hexagonal cone shape which aids in mushrooming the snap post down.I gave this product two stars because it probably works fine with thick fabric, such as the multilayer corner of a canvas cover, and it's a good idea, but only two stars because it is not a general purpose snap tool.I have come to the conclusion that for serious snap work one should purchase a snap setting tool that looks like a C-clamp and costs about $30.00; however, I am not a serious user, so I'll stay with the one-piece rod and suffer.
Mine came with a smooth, un-knurled holder shaft (the part you hold & use to press the top snap part into position.  Using my old Tandy snap part, (because the supplied backs were too short!) was a challange indeed.  The tool nest (round buck you hammer into) was poorly machined too.  Nothing good to report here...Sorry.This is bare minimum, disappointing product.  They cut corners on the knurling, the snaps, the nest, and should be ashamed!  Hey General, try your own tool out, then tell us how well it works.  (I hate having to leave reviews like this one.)
Per package contains &lt;5% lead - but there's still lead which can cause birth defects.  Also it's not good on light weight fabrics as the snaps are pretty robust.
I used the Fiskars cutter for years and was never very satisfied with it. I recently switched to the Olfa 45mm Ergonomic Rotary Cutter and there is a big difference.This Fiskars cutter has a hard handle so pushing down on it is not comfortable which makes cutting uncomfortable if you're doing it for a long period of time (like cutting pieces for a quilt).One of my biggest complaints about the Fiskars is that it "skips" when you cut. It is not a smooth cut - there will be sections of the fabric that are not cut, even after putting in a brand-new blade. So you have to go over your cut a couple of times to go all the way through the fabric (even with only one piece of fabric). This does not happen with my Olfa cutter.Overall. I think there are much better cutters out there for the same price.
I went to my local Home Depot where i purchased my Sink, Faucet, and Countertop. I also bought 2 extra filters for when they needed changing. Well now i went back to the store and i cant find them anywhere. And it has been hell trying to find them online. Pfister Pfaucet Pfilter. pf**ed.
Bought and returned. Why returned? Looks cheap, had defects in leather, did not like the teeth system or the materials of construction. Would go with Dickies instead.
Suspenders have no elastic making it easy for them to slip over the shoulder. Can be solved by crossing suspenders in the front but this is awkward. Better substitute would be elastic suspenders or &#34;Y&#34;-shaped suspenders.
These suspenders are made of a material very much like the seat belts in a car...no stretch at all.  So at times they fall off the shoulder, at other times they're too tight.  There's no right adjustment.
at first these worked well but after three days of wearing them the latch on the back left will not stay on pantsI have to latch it on belt loop for it to stay on and sometime the loop is not in right place (not all pants are built alike)after examining the latch it seems the latch separated just enough to not let it gripI will order another set but I think it will be another brand.too bad because I like the look and size and everything seems like it would otherwise last a long time
I had been pretty happy with the purchase until the clips became loose, which are not readily adjustable.  The grip seems to be optimized the way it's shipped.  Moving the parts either way makes it worse, or perhaps it's just me.  Anyway, the adjustment is not apparent.  Now it only works on jeans at the belt loops.Suggestions to the manufacturer:1. Improve the clips so that it's easy to tighten the grip.2. Add rubber pads to protect the fabric.3. I would've chosen the beige color if it's offered so the belts wouldn't show through a shirt.
Bought this color for me and the red for my brother after I had had his Levi one-inch red ones for forever.The Levi one-inch suspenders failed when it came to gripping my sweat pants waist band.  Just not big enough.  And that's where these succeed: those bigger clips are adequate to get around sweat pants.But when I tried to adjust these to my height, total disaster.  In fact, I had to go get my brother's Levi suspenders to figure out how to make these work.  Big fail: need stitching to secure the front buckle at the adjuster.  Further fail: the adjuster needs to slide so that you can adjust for your height.  And needs to not slide to keep the suspenders working.  These suspenders rely on friction for both.  Makes it very difficult to adjust and then makes me wonder if they will stay in place once I get them adjusted.  (The Levi ones have a dig in clip to keep them in place and they slide freely otherwise.)As other reviewers have noted, the straps are just nylon straps -- no stretch.  That's good for strength but leaves a lot to be desired for comfort.I think I may eventually get these to work and I still like the wide buckles and straps, but it seems to me that much better suspenders are possible.
Difficult to adjust and way too wide.  The leather on the back of the suspender is too large.  If you are looking for nice looking suspenders that are easy to adjust these are not a good choice.
Description says fits most.  Evidently they mean most thin men under 5' 10&#34;.  Seems like real good quality though just too small.
the front are not elastic so they do not move with you, I would advise you to purchase Cabelas  brand .These suspenders are costly  to return them it places you into  to much lose of funds
I realize this knife is supposed to be small, since after all, it is a pocket knife. However, when I received the knife I was shocked to see that it is TEENY TINY SMALL, a miniature version of what a knife should be (even a pocket knife)! The "checkered fiberglass-filled nylon handle to ensure strength, durability and a non-slip grip" sounds great when they list that in the description, but in reality the handle is a very cheap feeling textured plastic that would possibly be helpful in gripping the knife if you could actually grip the knife with more than 2 fingers. The small size of the knife makes it very difficult to open, maneuver, and hold. I promptly returned the knife I had ordered, it was purchased as a gift for my brother-in-law and I couldn't possibly have given it to him for anything other than a gag gift. I will say that the knife had a very sharp edge when it arrived, I can't say whether it holds the edge or not since I didn't actually use it. All in all, I see that many people have given this knife A+ reviews but I can't understand why. Yes, it is small. Yes, it will easily fit in your pocket without weighing you down. I'm sure there are many everyday uses for this knife, but unless you are buying this for yourself with a specific purpose in mind, then I would stay away from it and find something that is better constructed. I have collected knives for a long time and this knife seems like one of the freebies they will occasionally throw in at the swap meet or something you would find in a clear bin for 99 cents near the cash register...definitely not something that should cost as much as it does or have the Gerber name on it.**I have provided 3 pictures up above (in the actual item description) to show the size of the knife...if it's what you're looking for then great, but if not, I wanted you to be able to see the size before you make the mistake of purchasing it.
I used it to cut some twine and some cheese while camping.  The lock malfunctioned without me knowing it and cut my friend while he was cutting cheese.
This knife is very small and is not of the same quality that gerber holds other knives to. I have a lot of knives, so I know a thing or two about them. About the only thing this knife is good for is opening mail and boxes. It is way to small to do anything else. Had I known how small it was, I would not have purchased it. Since I had it I decided to try and get some use out of it. I found that the blade did not hold an edge very well, and it is not very easy to put an edge back on it. If you are looking for a knife to use occasionally for extremely light duty tasks, you may like this knife, but I would also recommend checking outVictorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife, which will accomplish everything this knife can but also has a couple other tools on it.  The steel used in the Victorinox is better and will resharpen more easily.
A friend had one of the old versions of this. I purchased since I liked his. This one has a cheap plastic part on it and isn't made well at all.
my original was all metal. several friends liked it and wanted to know where to get them so for Christmas I ordered  each of them 1. when they came I found they no longer are all metal , though the blade is the piece that goes against what ever you are trying to square is plastic.
I purchased this along with the Flashlight and accessory kit (Comes with colored lenses and wrist strap) a week ago.  Upon initial reciept of the items I found the quality to be quite good.  The flashlight alone fit well into the holster, although it was a tight fit.  Once I placed the wrist strap and lens protector on the flashlight I was unable to fit the flashlight into the holster at all.I would rate this a 4 if you weren't using accessories, but, it simply doesn't work with even the simplest accessories for the flashlight.
This product secures a 1x2 piece of wood to your bannister with two large zip ties.  The theory is that it creates a plumb surfaced onto which to mount the gate.  It did not seem particularly stable, and, ironically the zip ties scratched up our bannister (the whole point of this purchase was to protect our bannister from the ill effects of having kids).  Anyway, a much safer and secure bannister installation kit isKidco Gate Installation Kitwhich clamps on the bannister.
Small radio fine for me...did the trick for working outside and listening to NPR until the spring broke. I can still use with solar power or an AC adaptor, but miss the winding option. Bought via ebay and mailed in warranty card, only for postal service to return card saying address no longer valid. :-(
Dust/chip collection is always a problem in any shop.  Because I am basically lazy about it and don't want to have to spend all my free time cleaning up after the previous project I am always looking for new ways to improve my own. These hoods, whether from Jet or any one of a hundred other sources are not the answer... at least not completely.  You can do the same thing with some 1/4" plywood, or hardboard and a 6"X 4" (or a 4" X 4") metal duct reducer.I received this hood as part of my Jet table saw.  I did not buy it seperately.  This is nothing but your standard fare, universal dust hood for contractor style saws, and by itself it isn't very efficient. In a couple of minutes of cutting I had saw dust EVERYWHERE!! Only a small percentage of it was actually making it into the dust collection system. Expect to do some modifications if you are truly serious about collecting the saw dust from your saw. More about that later...I suggest you look up the "Dust Monkey" on this site to get an "idea" of what I mean.  I didn't buy one of those either but instead made my own from thin (1/8") hardboard and stovepipe.  YES, don't laugh! I did say "stovepipe."Expect to have to seal as many leaks in your saw as is reasonably possible.  That is: close in the back, but not so much that the trunnion won't tilt freely.  There are several good sites that offer suggestions and pictures. Newwoodworker.com is an excellent resource; Seal any holes where the steel sides of the saw join together, and don't forget the top.  Use hard foam, duct tape, caulk, whatever you need to do; Seal any gaps between the top and the body of the saw.  Mine had lots of them.  I used some semi-flexible packing foam cut into strips and jammed it in there. Then you can get more serious and make collection ramps or modify the dust hood creating a bigger (as big as possible) funnel.I used a 10"x 6"x 6" metal "boot" with a 6" outlet (you could also use a 6"x6"x4" for a one step operation) followed by 6"x 4" stovepipe reducer adapter (all stock stuff and about $15 from your local home center) to connect to standard 4" hose. I cut out the original outlet, then "tabbed" the edges of the new funnel about 1" in, folded the tabs out 90 degrees and used them to caulk, screw and aluminim tape the new "funnel" in place.  Unlike PVC, standard 4" stovepipe is the exact size needed for these connections. It works great, and believe it or not, doesn't look bad either... kind of "industrial", but rather impressive.  Now, the hose connection is just OUTSIDE the saw body instead of underneath and easy to get to. Hey, you can always paint it flat black if you want to.I don't mean to be condescending here for I too am only a couch engineer, but what you are trying to accomplish is to create good vacuum in all the RIGHT places and direct as much of the suction air FROM the blade and back area INTO the funnel and keep it from getting caught up in eddies usually created in the corners inside the saw body, but not to eliminate all of the air drawn in. A cone would probably be ideal but impractical to accomplish inside the saw body. Spend some time with your saw and you will not only have gotten to know it better but in a couple of hours well spent you can have a contractors saw that rivals some of the far more expensive cabinets saws... at least as far as dust collection is concerned.  }:-DI hope this review helps you, and, Good Luck with your dreams.
I have not really had a good experience in using this.My son hasn't either.I really was a good concept though.
I don't know what you folks are doing to screw up the gator grip.  I own a delivery company.  I contract with companies like Williams Sonoma and other furniture stores.  This gator grip is the most essential tools for all my crews.  It has saved me countless hours and since i pay workers hourly time is money.  assembling furniture with this socket is easy.  It has saved tons of space in our already crammed tool boxes.  Every time i use it in a customers house they ask me about it.  All the designers that I work with are amazed by its versatility.  Any size socket that furniture manufacturers use is covered by the gator grip.  As a professional, I fully endorse this tool.  I love it.  I can't say enough how much better this thing has made my life.  Ned Grier, Dliverance LLC moving, delivery and installation.
Having sold tools at Sears for years, I have seen every type of gimicky tool that has carried the Craftsman name.  However, the Gator Grip is one of those tools that I have to shake my head at.It does the job that they show on tv, but that is about it.  It is handy for those weird, around-the-house type projects.  However, don't expect it to hold up if you decide to do a major project.  As you can see from some of these reviews, it is good for small demolistion projects.  Just don't depend on it for everything.Nothing can replace having the actual tool in your toolbox.  A good set of wrenchs, sockets, and screwdrivers will last a person a lifetime!
I thought it would be perfect,I was working on my car unfortunately its weak couldn't handle the pressure on the bolts on the car especially the older bolts.over all it's not worth it unless your doing little stuff inside the house.
My husband purchased this tool thinking it would work on a hex head bolt that was stripped.  It didn't.  It certainly did not live up to the advertisement that it would fit everything.
Gator grip broke after i tried to get locknuts of my car not impressed but i like the company and will be buying more equipment
I wore this beltless system for 2 days, and that was enough. Have to agree with the other reviewer who strongly disliked the bag positioning. They rode way too far behind me, and adjusting the system - major pain!! (tried every conceivable configuration) - doesn't help the problem. You simply can't see the tools you need without having to swing the pouches around in front of you. The whole set up is very cumbersome. Also, wearing this system in warm weather is really uncomfortable.However, I picked up the 3" Ranger belt and a few pouches, snips and drill holsters, and I LOVE this setup. Most comfortable belt I've ever worn, and I've worn a bunch. Gotta' wear one loaded for a day to believe it. Highly recommended.I'm sold on Occidental belts. The beltless system, however, will likely disappoint.
Needed a device to measure height for a team.  Complaints from those being measure that it couldn't be correct.  Compared the device to other measuring tapes and found that if you were 5' 10&#34; it would shave an inch off your height.  Looks like the third part of the telescope drill hole is off and apparently these devices are not inspected for accuracy before being shipped.  By the time I discovered this problem, it was past the time to return it.
I was expecting it to be able to fold down more, difficult to carry around with me&#62; i did send it back without a problem
Feels flimsy and buttons stick. an old tape measure stapled to a stick might be nicer then this. I'm now convinced that extruded aluminum surveying equipment shouldn't bought.
I've made well over a hundred cuts so far and it is still pretty sharp.  This blade leaves more of a burr than any blade I've cut with.  Also, the description say Origin: Japan, but the blade says &#34;made in China&#34;.  I will not be buying another one.  For just a little bit more $ buy a Lenox.
These kind of suck. I bought these to help remove a muzzle device from my AR the rubber did not grip and peeled off in places. I think the diameter of the barrel is too small for these to work well. I'll upgrade my stars if I use them for another application and they work well. Might be better suited for opening jars. On the oplus side they have built in bottle openers, you know so if you are tightening pipes and need to crack open another beer.
This is Gerber's take at creating a CRKT KISS type knife, which is a minimilized folder. They blatantly copy Ed Haligan's design. You would think they could have made it more ergonomic. After a short session of use, one's hand gets extremely fatigued. The blade, which is too small to take advantage of it's half-serrated profile. It gives you the worst of both worlds. The serrations, as well as being possibly some of the least agressive ever, are too small to adequately cut even string. The tiny unserrated part of the blade has no belly, forcing the user to use only the tip, which eventually becomes worn and rounded. The blade is also made of 400 series stainless steel,which is mediocre at best, taking a decent edge quicly but loosing it just as fast. The lock is prone to failing under a heavy grip. It seems that if you want this type of knife, you should get the real thing.
The quantity of light was poor.  It's been a while since I got the lamps, and I can't find the package,  but I think that while the product heading on Amazon says &#34;Lamp for 3-C Cell/D-Cell flashlight,&#34; the actual product said for &#34;3C cell&#34;.  I had a 4 cell flashlight.
I have been through several book lights, I was hoping this would be my last.  It's not.  This light worked great the first couple times I used it, then after about the fifth time, it went wonky.  If the overhead light is on, the booklight doesn't come on; when you turn the overhead light back on, the booklight comes on.  Sometimes, if you rub the light where the bulb is, it will come back on.  Most of the time it doesn't.  Yet another book light for the trash can.
I have a black version of this light that I bought several years ago, and two silver versions that I bought last year.  The older light is a great light and is everything that the advocates say below.  The newer models, however, have what I consider to be a significant problem with the switch.  They often do not turn on right away and, in difference to the experience one user states below, the on-off-on technique does not help.  When the lights do not turn on right away, the only thing to do is wait for up to a minute before they work. Some users may not consider this sporadic delay a problem.  For me, it is the difference between two stars and five.
I've owned this booklight before and it lasted me 2-3 years with moderate use.  The bulb finally gave out (it's advertised to last 10,000 hours) so it was a no-brainer to buy another one.  This time  it stopped working after 2 months of infrequent use.  In the beginning, it seemed the cathode bulb was not as bright as my first one, even with brand new batteries.  Then it would take several minutes to just turn on.  Finally it won't turn on.  Perhaps I got a lemon...so I'm going to return it to Amazon but I'm willing to try getting an exchange.  I'm hoping it will work because it's the best booklight I've ever owned (I've owned the itty bitty light and the lightwedge).
Maybe better for hardback but it's too bulky and heavy for paperbacks if you are holding the book up.  Mighty bright light was smaller and more practical.
The strength and weakness of this reading light is the florescent bulb. It provides for adequate light and good battery life. Although the light is heavy to clip onto a book and nearly inpossible for a magazine, its pivoting light makes it great for reading in bed. Just put the light on your chest and rotate the light to the book. However, the florescent light is a problem to turn on. Move the switch to ON and wait. Sometimes seconds, often minutes, I thought the problem was the switch, but it was my patience. I wasn's used to waiting minutes for the light to go on. And now, it's gone down to half power, even with a power cord. Unfortunately, its no longer bright enough to read by, so I'm looking for a replacement.
I received this today from Amazon, and will be returning it tomorrow.  I tried it out with brand new batteries.  It lit for about 5 seconds, and the light was good.  And then it went out.  I got it on for another 3 seconds.  And then it went out.  And then I tried it with rechargable batteries.  Same problem.  Since I wanted to use it with an adaptor anyway, I drove over to a popular electronics store.  They didn't have the 5-volt adaptor the light specifies.  Not only that, the worker there told me that 5-volt adaptors were no longer being made at all (they had 3, 4.5, and 6 volt, but not 5).  I've looked all over online, and can't track down a 5-volt.  Anyway, since I can't get the thing to stay lit even with batteries, back it goes.  It's a pity, because it is a very nice design otherwise -- far more attractive than the alternative book lights -- but I guess there are still engineering challenges to be met.  (I gave it two stars instead of one because I like the way it was designed, though it really deserves a single star for not working.)
Great little light, but the switch has stopped working already. I have to try at least 5 or 6 times before it will turn on. Very disappointing. I should send it back, but I just had surgery and when it works, I use it. When it starts taking 20 tries or stops turn on altogether, I'll hope I still have my paperwork to send it back.
I just changed the batteries again! Maybe I had faulty batteries...Nope!I agree with others, this book light creates the nicest lighting on my pages..when it is on. My light has a life of it's own. Just as I am getting relaxed, nice and cozy under the covers, right into the characters in my story, it goes out. Just like that! No warning, no rhyme or reason, no particular pattern..except that it happens every time I use it. I tap it, adjust it, switch the batteries around..sometimes that makes the light come back on, sometimes not and I have to quit trying. Nothing I try changes it's poor performance, it will go out again even when it's just sitting on a tabletop with nothing touching it. I had read all the reviews before buying this through Amazon and did see several others mention this particular problem but thought..nawww, won't happen to me, the company must have fixed whatever was awry by now. WRONG!! I gave it a two because when it's on it's great. I don't have high blood pressure but if I keep using this night light, that may change!
I received the Phorm a few years ago as a gift and loved it... for about a week and a half when the batteries started to go.  It has other flaws as well.Other reviewers have said the batteries last longer than 10 hours.  This is true.  Mine lasted about 12 hours.  Still, not long enough.  And if I could've found an A/C adapter for it, I would've been a very happy reader, if not for the other problems I experienced.I noticed a delay between turning it on and the bulb lighting.  I thought changing the batteries would solve the problem, but it didn't.  In fact, it got worse.  Sometimes shaking it and smacking it seemed to help, but half the time, it wouldn't light at all.  Maybe this is a problem with flourescent lights.  I've heard people have had similar trouble with the Zelco flourescent model.  Or maybe I just got a lemon.One reviewer mentioned the clip on this light is very tight and difficult to get onto a hardcover.  True.  But I also found that because it contains four batteries and is relatively heavy, it rips the covers off paperbacks.  With an adapter, perhaps it would work with a paperback.Two stars because when the batteries are fresh, and the bulb actually lights, it casts a wide, soft light directly where it's aimed.  It's sturdy and folds compactly for storage and travel.  And with an A/C adapter, the battery and weight problems can be avoided.
The Phorm does provide an excellent, bright light over a wide area...when it works.  More often than not, however, the light does NOT turn on without fiddling with the on/off switch, the batteries, and/or the lamp head.  And it's not a case of weak batteries--this happens with newly recharged ones and new alkaline batteries, too.  Too bad--it's otherwise a wonderful book light.
I had one of these lights for 10 yrs with no problem but unfortunately stepped on it. So I ordered a new one which very frequently would not turn on. Amazon kindly replaced it but alongwith that continued but less frequent problem, now only half the light goes on every other time. UNfortunatley there company is Japanese so can't communicate with them. Givingup withthis light unfortunatgley.
Despite mixed reviews for the Light Voyager, I decided take a chance. I purchased this book light by putting my faith in (excuse the expression) the 'glowing' reviews. For those who've left five star ratings, I have one word for you: wait. My light also worked like a charm for about the first month. After that, it became flakey. Sometimes, it doesn't work at all: I'll turn the switch and nothing happens. A couple nights later and it's back in action. At other times, the Light Voyager only casts a dim light, as if the bulb is defective. When this happens, it usually lights as expected after a day or two of rest. In regards to this problem, some reviews have suggested patience, assuring that it will eventually reach full brightness. Unlike an oven, a night light shouldn't need to warm-up. These hassles are unrelated to the batteries. The lack of reliability is the key issue as I have no beef with the large size; I accept that it is only to be used on hard cover books or laid on a surface. While some reading lights use unusual batteries, the Light Voyager uses inexpensive and easy to find AA batteries. Also available through Amazon, the Fulcrum 113311-301 Flyweight Travel book light has proved to be a superior replacement. Compared to the Light Voyager, the Flyweight costs less, it is smaller, it is brighter, it weights less, it has two illumination settings and most importantly, it is 100% reliable. If you're going to get Phorm's Light Voyager, make sure that you also purchase a back-up reading light.
This is a quite nice design, better than the flexible neck type. This is the only model I could find that takes rechargeable batteries. It might be even better if it were lighter, but given that it's a battery-powered type taking 4 AA batteries, the only way to make it even smaller is probably a design using AAA batteries(or just 2 AA batteries), which would come as a trade-off. The slightly bulky design actually has an unexpected advantage. The lamp easily stands on a surface by itself without any other support. I actually often place it on the pillow side pointing to my book, rather than clipping on the book. Freedom. It would work like a desk lamp, except it has much more direction light and doesn't bother anyone else. In fact, I almost feel it is a necessary feature for any reading lamp to be able to stand on a surface, because clipping-on works well only with hardcover books, not with soft books.However, what good is a nice design if it's not reliable. Other reviewers are right. The lamp has a problem to reliably turn on. It must be a contact problem. I came to this conclusion after trying many different sets of batteries, all freshly charged. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Yet sometimes it just waits for a long time to turn itself on. Can't use it even if it had a 99% of reliability to switch on, not to even mention a 50% of reliability (or unreliability). A thing as simple as a lamp must be able to be switched on and off 100% of the time, unless it is broken. My reading experience is too valuable a part of my life to bear with this nuisance.
The batteries, if you can believe how dumb this is, are stored in the part of the lever that goes OVER the top of the book.  Which is a very unbalanced experience.  But even worse, the fulcrum joint isn't stiff enough to hold the weight of the batteries so it sinks while you read!!!!!  Horrible.  I'll give it two stars instead of one because it's bright.  Bad product...
This was a great idea, but very poorly designed.  When I received this item I plugged it in and turned it on...  The Turbulance lamp did nothing.  Sure the light changed colors, but where was the turbulance?  After about 10 minutes of waiting, the glitter finally settled enough for me to see what the problem was.  The little spinning paddle that is supposed to stir up the glitter came loose during shipping, and after taking the bottom plate off I discovered there's NO way to fix it.  The bottom plate allows you to change the lightbulb for the turbulance lamp (which is a pain) but there's no way to get into the globe to reattach the paddle.  Stay away from this lamp, and instead go for the 'Fun & Functional Motion Lamp' because it's next to impossible to mess up a "Lava" Light
This product was supposed to come with a blade and includes 2 additional blades but my knife was empty and there were no additional blades.  I'll need to go to the hardware store to see if I can find a blade that fits.
Kind of cheaply made, flimsy. Ok to have on your keychain but doesnt seem very safe, is super tiny, and I needed one for work. Ended up buying a better brand at home depot
I thought this was similar to another companies knife. WRONG. Cheap pot metal. Plastic thumb slide does not slide smooth and will not wear well.
I use this item for stamping discs in jewelry making, and honestly I really don't care for these. My reasons:The letters don't seem to face all the same way on the stamps, it's a hexagonal shape, and the letters don't sit on the hex completely straight, or in one clear direction.The tool seems totally useless...I've tried using it a few times, and it didn't deliver the results that I was hoping for...I wouldn't know if I'm doing it right though, as it didn't come with instructions.My stamps arrived in a red plastic box, and the red color from the box transfers really easily, so don't place in a bag that you actually care about (especially if it's light colored), as it will turn red.Honestly, if I knew what I know about this item I probably would've never purchased it. I've purchased stamps from JB Tool that I like so much better. If you want to purchase on Amazon though, look for stamps that are square, so you can stamp your items with accuracy (as these are on the stamp base straight), the boxes are also smaller (so they take up less space in your drawer), and there are tons of different sizes to choose from, and they're clearly labeled.Not a fan, and wouldn't recommend.
I ordered this item as part of a halloween costume, scheduled to arrive in about a week. It showed up closer to a month later, well past any usefulness. Upon opening, I discovered an unpackaged roll of aged and partially deformed tape buried under several books of advertisements.The only reason this review isn't a 1 is because I haven't had a chance to test the effectiveness of the (yellowed and fraying) tape--I had to pay more money to a different seller to get something usable in time. Extremely late, low quality, and vastly more advertisements than product. I would not buy from this seller again.
I was disappointed with the lack of instructions that came with this set.  It seems like the manufacturer assumes that you have used a kit like this before and you know what you are doing.  It does not say which part is used for cutting a hole and which one is used for snapping the grommet pieces together.  I did my best guess, but the cutting operation simply doesn't work, either due to dull edges on the sharp piece or, again, due to lack of instructions.  A few pictures on step 1-2-3 and how you place the grommet against the tool would have been quite helpful.  The prices is good, but I guess you get what you pay for.
This is a plastic board in a plastic case with plastic attachments. You can't buy other accessories because the suppliers don't exist any longer. I would not buy this again and I don't recommend it to anyone else.
I used this buffer primarily for sharpening/honing edge tools, and did a little buffing of steel and copper.  It worked well for eight months (estimated usage one to two hours per week), and then the bearings in the motor started growling like crazy and the motor quit altogether.  I see in Grizzly's online catalog that Grizzly has discontinued this item.  This is a good decision on Grizzly's part; this buffer isn't up to the standard of other Grizzly tools I've used.
This buffer was smaller then I expected.But most disapointing of all was the fact that it is not made in Tiawan but China.  And it shows.  It obviously is mass produced on a grand scale with very thick sheet metal that is stamped and not forged.  The Base is OK.  The switch is junk.Your buffing wheels will have to be perfectly balanced or the buffer will wobble like crazy.  I tried bolting it down to my bench to no avail.If you get too much rubbing compound on one side of the wheel it will wobble and vibrate like crazy.I have many Grizzly products that are good quality including a 16 inch band saw and a 1x9 belt sander.  These products were made in Tiawan not China.I sent this item back and got charge a restocking fee of 15%.The shipping is NOT free and quickly brings this item up over $100.00
I purchased this to replace a Pollenex I had for many years and was not happy with the water pressure coming out of it. I didn't realize it was a water saver showerhead. I had been looking for something to match the water pressure in my original Pollenex and thought this might be the one.  Otherwise the product seemed fine. I only tried it once and then returned it to the dealer I ordered it from. They were great in processing my return and I will order from them again.
On 1/6/08 I purchased a Chamberlain Wireless alert system with a Receiver.I installed the receiver in my den and the PIR sensor outside about 120ft from the receiver.  The unit worked pretty much as advertised.  It is important to note both this receiver and PIR sensor had 12 inch antennas.On 1/14/09 I ordered three additional PIR sensors.  I installed these units the same distance from the receiver as the original PIR sensor.  None of the three new sensors could communicate with the receiver.  I took the receiver outside and placed it on my lower rear deck.  The distance between the PIR sensors, all four, and the receiver was now less than 100 feet.  Now the receiver worked with all four PIR sensors.  The three new PIR sensors had 6 inch antennas.  I tryed making the three new PIR sensors antennas 12 inches long to see if this would correct the problem.  It did not.  Nothing I tryed would allow the receiver to receive a signal from the three new PIR sensors once the receiver was placed inside my house.  My lower rear deck is accessed via my master bedroom.  Putting the receiver inside my master bedroom, less than 100 feet from the three new PIR sensors, didn't work either.  I've had to leave the receiver in a water proof compartment on my lower rear deck with the antenna exposed to get all four PIR sensors to work.Maybe the 1,200ft range is a miss print and it should read less than120ft.
This product is too limited.  The alert is a very annoying buzz.  The sensors were hard to set and the transmission range was lacking.
The device does not perform as indicated.  Main purpose was to use it as a driveway alarm.  Device was installed following manufactures instructions.  It does not sense a car traveling faster than someone can wall.  If does detect someone walking without a problem.
Well I will tell you the technology behind this is first class, but the point of a flashlight is..............LIGHT.this flashlight has enough light to the ground at your feet.  THATS IT.  VERY VERY DIM, any other light source drownds this and ensures you cant see it on.  BUMMER this is a cool light.
Upon initial inspection I was impressed with this flashlight. It is very sturdy and would probably sustain multiple beatings. Obviously not as heavy duty as a maglight, but for something that is plastic it feels very solid. It would be a great tools for anyone needing a flashlight in an area where water or keeping batteries long term is an issue.That being said, it is not very practical. Shaking the light isn't so bad, but the power you get from it is nowhere near the claims made by the manufacturer. Indeed, you could probably get light out of a full charge for 5-10 mins, but after a minute or so it becomes so dim that you need to shake it again.After a year of use, I have come to the belief that these magnetic induction "shake" lights are a flawed technology. The amount of energy expended is obscene compared to the power gotten out of the light. A simple collapsable hand crank attached to a gearing system would produce tons more energy than this unit with very little effort.I would pass on these type of products and look at battery powered LED flashlights which last a lot longer and use less energy than traditional flashlight bulbs.
The light works as stated and provides usable light for about 5 minutes after being shaken for 3 minutes.  From about 5 min to 45 min, the light is extremely dim.  After 45 min, I found the light output to be unsuitable.  Handy as an emergency light.I went to my local camping store and found the item on sale for about the same price.You should probably go to your local outfitter and get some hands on experience with the light to determine if it meets your needs.I am dissapointed in the LED being used (standard 20 mW probably)as I have found a company, Lumileds, that makes high powered LED's (they use around 250 mW).  Lumileds "star" product is Luxeon.  Lumileds is a heavily leveraged company formed by Agilent and Philips.  You can do the research on their website as to the different configurations: 1, 3, 5 W.  I can only tell you that the battery powered 1-W Luxeon outshines the Shakelight so much that you can not even tell the Shakelight is turned on.Get this Shakelight or probably any other at this time only for novelty and emergency use.
Product requires sustained vigorous shaking (to move the magnet past the coil)that makes it unsuitable for elderly or children.  Without sufficient shaking, light is too dim to be useful.
I bought one of these years ago and have had no problems. However I just bought another one and the safety latch didn't work right out of the packaging. It would keep opening under the spring's pressure. I noticed that the quality of the plastic seems lower than the older pair that I had. I'm not sure if that's the reason for the defective latching mechanism.
I got these funnels but did not have the big square one.... anyway was looking for them to refill ketchup bottles and well the wet products do not go through the funnels to well takes longer then any other method you would use.  But they do work well for dry things
Regardless of you own personal ideas concerning the aesthetic of this product, keep in mind it is harldy an art deco lamp.  Where are the step-backs?  Where are the chevrons?  What are these curvilinear forms that scream art nouveau and the whiplash line?  Don't be fooled, this is not art deco.
Had the this attic ladder for several years before one of the bottom hinges broke.  Sound like several people have had it break as well.  Hope that the replacement they are shipping me takes care of the issue.  Because it worries me that they are sending me something to fix it no questions asked and that it was pulled from their website.Makes me evaluate any design I use in the future. Because all it takes is someone trying to save a few pennies using a cheaper material than what was really needed. The wrong design could fail with tragic results.
I bought this ladder approximately 2 years ago at Lowes and it really worked great until today.  I began taking down the Chrismas deocrations and fortumately went up to turn the light on without a load and when coming down the lst section (closest to the floor) of the ladder broke!!  I am 200# and I wasn't carrying anything.  Werner decided on cutting costs and used pot metal at the section joints and that is what gave. Thankfully I wasn't hurt, but please think about looking at other ladders for your own safety.Finally, I looked to see if I could possibly buy replacement parts to fix it, but the entire ladder is fastened with non-removable pins and no replacement parts are offered.  I will now have to buy a whole new ladder system!!I will probably go with the A2510 this time...keeping my fingers crossed!!
Avoid this product. The blades are fine, but the dispenser is total garbage. Considering what's being dispensed, it is simply dangerous getting the blades out. There's supposed to be pressure from the bottom so you can simply slide a blade out the top, but there isn't. When you push from below the blades move around and it's very cumbersome to get one out.I'll take the loss but I will never buy this product (or any Irwin product) again.
Okay, they're just utility blades and they're fine. What gets me is the dispenser. The blades are oily and it takes serious effort to get a blade out. The oil is there to prevent rusting, I think, and you'd think it would help dispensing, but it doesn't. Your fingers slide on the blade and they jam solid. I had to resort to pliers. Decent blade. Poor dispenser.
I've used a variety blades for my utility knife these rank the lowest.I primarily used for cutting up boxes, tape and packaging material.These blades wore out very fast and rusted easily with moisture exposure.
nearly impossible to get the blades out. the blades are decent, they maintain a sharp point and edge for around 3-5 uses on general materials. if you're just opening packages expect it to last a very long time, but if slicing into plastics or other harder materials it's going to give you 2-3 solid runs before you need to replace it. i can't complain enough about how difficult it is to get the blades out, i have yet to find a trick to get them out with ease.
This little gadget is cute and fun to watch, but the liquid flows so quickly the process ends in less than two minutes and every iteration is more or less the same, with little variance. I recommend sand sculptures much more highly. The flow of the sand can be adjusted to run more quickly or slowly, it forms a different pattern every single time, and when it is done flowing it shows a pretty and unique pattern while it waits to be used again.
I ordered this downspout extension after reading on Amazon's product description page that it "fits either 2" X 3" to 3" X 4" downspouts."  To me, this sounded like a universal fit that might apply to my 2" round downspout, and it was impossible to tell from the accompanying photo whether it would fit a round downspout or not.  Well, it wouldn't, not even close, and the seller is making me pay for the shipping and handling to send it to me ($7.65) plus my cost to ship it back to them.Another problem with this item that didn't become quite clear until I got it is that it's open on the top, which would allow leaves and other debris to accumulate in the trough.  I had been planning to use it under some bushes near a corner of my porch that I rarely visit, and what I really needed was a covered tube to carry water away from my house, something that wouldn't require regular maintenance.
...the downspouts are displaced by wind. The extensions are completely blown off in wind.  If you live in a place where the wind never never blows these are probably great.  For those of us who live in the real world they are pretty much a waste of money.  I would have paid twice as much for a heavier more durable product.  In fact I'm still looking for same.
When it works it's great but it seems that when the temperature approaches or is below freezing it starts generating very frequent false alarms to the point that we have to disable it making it useless.The vendor said it could be the rechargable batteries and sent us replacements but that hasn't helped.  It does seem to happen more on cloudy days so it could be something to do with the solar cell not sufficiently charging the battery.
Design Tech Solar Driveway Monitor and Vehicle Alert #33372It only works sometimes. I have tried all of the possible combinations of things that could possibly make it go off one time and not the next. Used it on the short post they provide, then put it 5 feet high on my post, then put it 3 feet high. Right side of the driveway, left side of the drive way.Sometimes it goes off 15-20 seconds after the car passes by. Once of twice a week it will go off with nothing around it. Says it has long range capability, but I'm afraid to put it past 150 feet ( with direct view ) with the problems it has. Very disappointed with it.
When I opened the new SOG Trident I was instantly put off with the overall quality of the knife. It looks great and the assisted opening function works well but the blade movement and play while the blade was open was far to loose and even worse: when it was closed(the play while the knife is closed causes the blade to scratch its self while in the closed and locked position). The knife needs metal liners to assist with the rigidity of the whole knife. Also the safety switch rattles when the knife blade is closed and can be very annoying. There is'nt a spring to quell the rattles. At a MSRP at $100 you would expect a blade that didnt have so much play in it and a few small refinement issues. My Benchmades have never had this problem. I have had some SOG expiriences and I do like SOG. I think I have gotten a defective product but the company has delivered on past occasions. I trust SOG but not the Trident. If you want a sold knife no matter what give Benchmade a look. Also keep in mind that Benchmade and SOG both have lifetime waranties.
FEGJR is right about it being too sensitive.  You can't keep it in your pocket at all and I always have my keys in my pocket (yes, I clank, but I never have to hunt for them) I do like the compact size though, so I'm giving it one ore star.  I bought this remote as a replacement for a full sized remote that was stolen from my car, which I had accidentally left unlocked.  I decided that locked or not, it is unwise to leave a remote in the car parked in my driveway and thought the smaller size would be smart. If this thing gets to be too much of a pain, I may go back to a full sized remote.
According the the specs, the Extech 380975 is supposed to autorange down to a 10W resolution (+/- 5%) when testing kW on loads &lt;100A. However I'm consistently getting a 90W standby "noise" measurement (0.9kW) on energized circuits with no load. For example, testing the same no load circuit on the "~A" setting, Amps = 0.03 A, but on the "kW/KVA" setting (V and A mode): Volts = 125 V and Amps = 0.9 A. A reading of 0.03A is acceptable as noise; but a reading of 0.9A is just unacceptably high.According to Extech (after 3 followup emails and 29 days):"Our engineering department has confirmed that what you have described is normal for this meter. In fact these are go to be phased out and replaced with a new model that has better low end accuracies. This however is not released yet and there is no date of when it may be available."(1/31/07)As described by another Amazon reviewer for this tool, I was initially attracted to this meter's feature set to price ratio. But what good is a power meter that can't record the difference between zero and 90 W?-End-Use Energy Consultant
It's really NOT like having the sun in a lamp. What was I expecting? Also VERY cheaply made. Broke at the base in a few months.
The replacement cap for the 'lightweight' vaughan hammer is a great idea, However, the hammer is too heavy to be touting itself as a lightweight hammer. I will keep mine to use for demolition and concrete work.
I am a remodeling contractor and often need to have the advantage of sanding drywall without a big mess. This sander does what it is supposed to do: it sands with a relatively small amount of dust escaping. If you use it with a shop vacuum, invest in a filter bag that goes inside the shop vac to make sure the dust doesn't plug the regular filter and then eventually get discharged from the shop vac exhaust port. I use the Shop Vac Vac 'n Vac which has two filters of its own plus the filter bag and I never have a problem. Yes, you do need to duct tape the pole to the hose if you want to keep it there for any length of time. I also bought a second hose, took off the large end, and use it to extend the normal hose so I don't have to move the vacuum as much.That being said, the reason for the low rating on this particular model is because the swivel head breaks off easily. I returned my next-to-the-last one to Menards about 6 months ago because the head broke off and I just discovered that the replacement is also broken. I have probably only sanded 3-4 jobs in that time so I am really disappointed. I have also discovered that Menards isn't carrying it anymore and I don't know if that is because of this problem or something else.If you only have an occasional job to do, it will probably be ok. Just don't expect it to hold up in the long run.
I bought this apron because I was in need of protection of hot liquids and oils around my work place.In the product picture the apron looks to be black or a dark grey which was the color I needed since my apron has to be black with my uniform. Upon getting the apron it was baby blue or a powder blue. Also it was made of a pretty light weight sued leather. I had to dye the apron black, which was a bigger pain in the neck than anyone could imagine and through out the process the materal became even softer and fuzzy. I imagine if someone were just to wash this apron when it got dirty the same thing would happen. I gave this product 2 stars because it would be a good product for someone who's around small hazards that are dry in nature. For a carpenter this apron probably would work well...granted as long as you didn't mind your apron being baby blue. Although if you need an apron to protect you from multipul types of hazards and require another color besides baby blue... you're totally out of luck with this one.
The bracket is too small for I-joists so it is useless to me as-is. A call to the manufacturer for help was not returned.
Maybe our floors are just terrible because using two of these within 2 feet of each other still didn't really quiet the area. Putting appropriately sized wood screws at an angle through the floor joist into the subfloor does just as well.
The order was delivered without issue and returned without issue, so first off Tooltopia was great to deal with, but now the wrenches themselves.  They are nicely made and feel and look sturdy.  The problem lies in the design of the wrenches.  They have a box-end "stop-cap" design.  A steel ring forged onto one side of the box end.  This means a nut cannot pass all the way through the box end of the wrench and you can only engage a nut from one side of the box end.  The design idea is that the wrench can't slip off a fastener being turned if it's being driven up a threaded rod, but it severely limits the wrench usability to me, since I can't flip the wrench over and engage a fastener from the other direction.I ended up returning these wrenches and bought a set of Craftsman reversible wrenches, for almost 2x more money.  I really would have liked to have kept these wrenches as the price was good and the tools look/feel well made, but that cap-stop design was a deal breaker for me.
Tried it on bed sheets, wool dress slacks, shirts, and a static laden jacket. Using the sticky tape rollers works much better and faster. On the sheets, it's faster to get out the vacuum, even if it's just a small area. It works marginally better than using your hands to brush off the hair.
I got this Pet Hair Removal Brush to get the pet hair off of the furniture.  It doesn't work well at all.  The only thing it will actually remove hair from is my cat and I already have several brushes for that task.  Did not need another one.  Very hard to remove hair from it as well.  I would not recommend this brush to take hair off of furniture since it doesn't.
For my golden retriever, it is a bit small and picks up only some hair.  I actually have to recommend the Love Glove, which did a much better job on my dog's hair.
It does nothing for my lab. I guess I will just use it to pick up lint from the furniture. I consider it a waste of money.
Not that amazing, just a rubber brush that worked better for dust on my tv screen than anything else. I honestly haven't used it but once or twice and wasn't really impressed with it removing cat hair
Pros: unlike most incubators, it's not very expensive. easy to assemble. comes with directions. has all the necessary things to hatch a baby chick/quail, but of course you have to know what you're doing.Cons: unfortunately, It didn't work for me. it's a still-air incubator, which means it has no technology so you have to do everything yourself (adjust the temperature and humidity, turn the eggs every day), which I didn't mind doing at all, BUT it also lowers the chance of the babies hatching. (handling the eggs and opening the lid everyday can cause many problems). this type of incubator gives you no way to measure the humidity, which is crucial to the survival of the chicks and I'm pretty sure is what failed, because the directions aren't clear enough to tell you how much water to put in the incubator. all my chicks died in the egg before they could hatch. needless to say it was a really sad experience. So, if you are thinking about hatching eggs/quail, I strongly recommend you buy a forced-air incubator instead (a little more pricey, but much more likely to be actually be successful). hatching eggs should not be this tricky, so just don't get this incubator because it is just very cheaply made and has a low survival rate.
I have installed at least 6 under-counter water filters in my life, and this one was the most problematic.  First off, they ask you to cut your copper water line with a hacksaw.  Excuse me?  This is billed as "easy install".  Most people don't even have vertical copper pipes under their sink - - just flex tubing leading from the hot and cold supply lines.  So you need to install a T fitting, etc.  I won't bore you with all the details, but it took at least 3 trips to the hardware store, plus ordering parts online.  I finally got it installed and the darn thing leaked from one of the quick connect fittings, so Amazon sent me another one.  Now it's working, but I feel uneasy about potential future leaks, especially after reading some of the other horror stories posted here.  So far so good, however.  I upgraded to the level 4 filter, and my water tastes truly delicious.  Let's hope all stays well.
Anything with compression fittings sucks. I spent 2 days fixing leaks from compression fittings, after all the leaks were fixed the filter works OK. Cannot notice a big taste difference, when I replace the filter I will try a D-30 maybe that will make a difference.  Just out of the box I would not recommend this filer.
Why must every company have their own proprietary sizes and parts? This was just different enough to NOT FIT where the previous model went. But as a cheap water filter, it is fine.
The quick-connect fittings are a water leak waiting to happen.  I had a washer water line burst once, that caused water damage to my home.  I don't want a repeat of that experience.  I was misinformed that these quick-connects were replaceable.  They are not replaceable.  I returned the item.
This product is difficult to keep anchored to the wall when changing the filters. I have ripped the assembly out of the wall every time. I have tried up to 200lb. wall anchors and either removing or installing the filter has not worked properly. The included D-20A filter works great with no pressure change and water comes out better tasting and clearer than before. I did upgrade to the D-30A filter and water pressure dropped significantly. Installation is simple and easy the main downfall to this product is the pressure drop and unit being ripped from wall.
Almost gave this product a horrible review. The first one I got the speed control throttle valve would hang up and it ran all the time. Sent it back to Amazon and got replacement that started acting up after a couple of weeks. I attempted to contact  Astro Pneumatic and they did not respond to my request. After trying to correct the problem without results I decided to return this to Amazon also. Waited too long to return it to Amazon apparently and was denied. An employee disassembled to inspect and found the throttle valve was adjustable internally. Adjusted valve and all seems well for now.
I bought this particular meter because I wanted to test the noise levels of my air purifiers. One of them is AHAM tested at 23dB at its lowest setting. I was looking forward to an "under" warning. Instead it read 40dB. The air purifier is rated at 40dB for its medium speed. The meter displayed 52dB at 6 feet. I turned off all noise generation in the room; dead silent. It still read 40dB.
Can't really say much about this product as it didn't work. Followed all instructions and display read 120 db and never moved regardless of how much noise was present. No, the MAX setting was OFF. Product was returned for refund
Sound meter works.But LED screen cuts off top of readout.Holding gentle finger pressure on the screen makes it work, but have to maintain finger pressure.Returning meter.Would give it 5 stars if the LED screen worked properly.
If I didn't already have one of these that works I would have only given it one star since zero is not an option.  This one was dead on arrival so I sent it back for a replacement.  I've noticed others have had these arrive DOA too.  The one that I have that works seems to work ok but I haven't had it very long.I would suggest installing it in a sheltered location as they are not really weather proof and if it gets wet inside it probably won't last long.  The weather proofing in these units is very unusual to say the least and it does not work on mine because the cheap case does not meet the rubber bead on the inside of the opposing case.  I sealed mine with a removable mastic tape to ensure that the internal components stay as dry as possible.
I just returned from a camping trip. It performed as advertized except it underperfromed verses an other LED no battery shake flashlight someone else brought. It did not hold the charge as well. It was twice as expensive, much heavier, and larger. It had a much less focused beam. It requires a lot more work to get useable light. Two quick shakes and the other one worked. The only advantage is this one seems more durable. However both got dropped and both continued to function.
I can't put this together.  Nothing fits and I am waiting for a friend to help since I got him one.
After having read several reviews, I gave this table lamp a shot and had it in my hands within several days. I wasn't too pleased with it to be honest, the amount of light given does not justify it requiring four D-Cell batteries, and the quality simply isn't there.Pros:Durable shade protects the bulb well, particularly in the case the lamp is knocked overShade is designed to spread light evenly from the single bulbDesign/weight of the base make this lamp difficult to knock overCons:Does not provide sufficient light unless used in a relatively small tent/spaceA mere 20 hours of light with 4 D-Cell batteriesCheap constructionIf someone needs a light source that is somewhat durable and cheap then this is a good catch, but I was quick with my decision to return it and ended up purchasing a higher end lamp at a similar price in my local hardware store. It would have been a relatively painless return process had I not been charged a restocking fee, meaning my refund would have been next to nothing if Amazon had charged me for shipping it back (paid out of pocket, a waste).
Once you put batteries in, you can't carry it by the little handle.  It is made of cheap plastic & the handle just falls out.  OK as table lamp in power outage but too flimsy for outdoor use.  Seems bright enough though.
We got this as a test to see if it would be good enough to use in the house during a blackout.  We had a big blackout not long agoThe lamp uses 4 D cell batteries and has a flashlight size bulb. So right from the start you need to know the light is going to be similar to a flashlight experienceAs a test, I tried assembly in a mostly dark room to simulate a blackout condition.  I'm good with my hands and tools, so I know what I'm doingCons:3 piece assembly required, the neck of the lamp only fits 1 way into the base.The electrical alignment connections were a bit tricky.The 4 D sized  batteries fit kinda loose into the base to provide stability.  The battery diagram was worthless for which side was up / down for + / - connections.  I had to struggle with getting good battery connection and good lamp neck electrical connection  and wiggle the loose bulb  before it would workThe volume of light is limited, not enough to read by, I triedI placed this lamp when assembled on a coffee table in the middle of a 150 square foot room.  You could see furniture, but not much elseConclusion:  The lamp assembly was not user friendly, the light rather limited.  Think of it as a oversized nite light for not walking into things in the darkBest uses would be in a smaller, rather enclosed instead of open area like a 3 man tent, or the back of a camper shell
I bought this for a desk that doesn't have a nearby outlet. It doesn't really work for my intended purpose. The light is dim, the dial/switch is flakey, and it goes through batteries pretty fast. That said, I'm keeping it around for power outages. I think it will be really handy and a little more useful than a flashlight.
Too expensive for what you get. Somehow the picture looks much better than the actual product. Brightness of light is NOT adjustable, just on and off. I'll use it and it works for my needs, but I don't really like it.
I assembled the lamp together and got it to light up. Works perfectly fine. Listen to the reviews about tightening the hanging thing with the base properly (with the switch on) and make sure to put the batteries in properly and you should be all okay! Not as bright as I was hoping though... (I am using Energizer alkaline batteries).Update:The thing stopped working in 2 hours. Not battery's fault! (I am a tech savvy person too.) This lamp is junk :/.
Product is OK, it does the job but it took a couple of weeks to get here.  I paid $7.95 for shipping for a $9.95 item with the hope that it would arrive within 3 days.
The strap breaks off of the mask every time I put one on.What good is a mask with no strap ?
Ok I have owned two of these but not at the same time.  I had to buy a second to replace the first one after about two and a half years- A part broke and I liked the look so much I thought I just had bad luck... Now two and a half years later, I am sad to report that something is loose in the wiring and it pops on and off without provocation.  As pretty as it is, it is really cheap construction.
Was a little irritated that it said it was a 3 pack and it only came with 1 drill bit.
I bought this thinking that it would work for trimming pony feet.  Was under-powered and slow compared to an angle grinder with 34 grit paper.  Would love to pass it on to someone else.
This product says it comes with a 1/4" tip, but it actually comes with a 3/8" tip.  Way too large for stained glass work.  It's like doing brain surgery with a chain saw.  Find something that has the right sized tip.
Just as hobbier said, the tip is LARGER than 1/4".It is 3/8" and way too large for the fine jewelry work I wanted to do. Boo!I also ordered a 1/4" replacement which is not here yet....so I'll wait until that tip arrivesto see if it is actually that size or if I have to return all of it.I am returning it and have ordered theHakko Soldering Station, FX-888
The iron worked great for one large glass piece. My husband got it out to do another a year later and now it just lights up,indicating it's getting juice, but there's no heat.
O.K.  I will admit that I've only had this lock for a day, but that's long enough to realize that it's going back to the store.  It does work most of the time, but the problem is that when you're trying to get into your house, "most of the time" isn't good enough.  The main problem is with the bio-id unit itself.  I have to lick my finger in order for it to work right.  With dry fingers it just doesn't work (but to be fair, it seems to work fine for my wife).The second thing wrong with this lock is the crazy number combinations you have to use in order to make it work.  You have to enter an 11 digit number to program the darn thing, which is the exact reverse (in sequence) for the 11 digit number used as the override for when the bio-id doesn't work.  And oh yes, you have to enter a 4-digit number in order to "turn on" the bio-id which is kind of a pain.So overall, if you really need a low cost bio-id lock for your house and this is the least expensive one you can find, then it may work for you, but then again it may not.
The "Little Giant" pump that is supplied with the saw did not work when it was brand new. It is supposed to be able to pump water to 4 feet of head, but could only manage about 1 inch of head, not enough to pump the water from the tray up to the saw blade guard. Instead of purchasing a new pump, I purchased a hose adapter, bushing, and brass nipple at my local home center so that I could connect a garden hose to the 3/8" vinyl tubing. Those three parts along with a garden hose Y connector with flow valves (that I already had) allowed me to supply the saw with a controlled amount of fresh water. Other than the pump problem, I think the saw is pretty good so far. I don't have many hours on it yet, but it cut granite tile for my bathroom with ease. The saw was aligned properly out of the box. While I did wear hearing protection while using the saw, I didn't find it to be excessively loud like some reviewers claimed. I wonder if other peoples' pumps weren't supplying adequate water which makes the blade and saw work much harder. I did notice that the table didn't slide as easily after making many cuts. I had lubricated the slide and wheel with WD-40 before I started, but next time I think I will try giving them a blast after each 5-10 cuts. If MK had supplied a suitable pump with the saw I probably would have given it 4 stars, but after wasting hours trying to get the pump to work, calling both MK and the pump manufacturer to no avail, and spending more of my money at the home center to make the saw usable, two stars seems appropriate.
Well, my stereo fades in and out on every single station no matter how strong the signal is or even if its AM or FM, it is really annoying so I though I woult try this. I hooked it up and there was basically no difference at all. If it helped I didn't notice, it still fades in and out. I had some gift cards so this only cost me like $1.XX and for that price its a good try, but it really didn't do anything so I would keep looking.Good Luck
I cracked open the case to see whats inside of the "noise filter". Its an inductor (LP filter) on the ground wire (ok good) and the antenna signal wire, from your antenna, is NOT connected! You see, its suppose to mount somewhere high on the dash and replace your antenna. Its own antenna, (a little plate on the board I think), replaces your cars.I pulled in better AM stations since that is where I was getting all kinds of noise as expected. But I lost sensitivity on FM where my radio lost weaker FM sooner.I decided to remove it and just go back to check that all my grounding is ok. My car uses a back window strip, has less gain and more induced noise, instead of a pole antenna. I would buy it to improve some AM reception, but you must mount it high under or on the dash for it be effective. Mine came without instructions, it just has some writing on the bottom where a mounting board mentions mounting.
I bought this a couple of days ago as Amazon was having a pretty good price-sale on it.First of all, its heavy... yep, a real beast with good build quality.They were not stinting on the metal when they made this baby!My problems started when I took it back to Europe, just in time I noticed that its only 110v so it cant really be used in Europe without a converter.As its rated at 600 watts these "step converters" are pretty expensive - more than the price of this thing!Nearly everything electronic that I have purchased for the past few years have been 110v - 220v, so the only thing I can think of as to why this was not 110v-220v is that Grizzly stinted on one damn part.It's wayyyy to heavy to post it back and way to expensive to get a converter... so its going to be a heavy paperweight :(Wrote to Grizzly and days later not a peep - they customer support/pre-sales departments suck.
Nice  size light,and stailess is nice,but its outdated leds are weak and tinted bluish.The threads are rough,so it doesnt turn on/off easy.The single led version of this light is much brighter and whiter.Still rough threas,no amount of grease seems to smooth it out,I still need 2 hands to turn it on/off. To bad as its a handome looking light,also runs on AAAA battery,not as common to find,It does offer a long runtime.I feel better choices for the money.
I needed to drill 4 holes on a steel frame, after the first one the drill bit dye.I had to buy another one at my local hardware store
Holy crap, I expected better of Gerber.The design of the knife is so-so. It's difficult to open the blade one handed because the plastic of the grip is too close to the thumb control. When it's open, depressing the latch to close the blade is difficult for similar reasons. The plastic bushing is stiff and doesn't move smoothly.On the knife I received, the blade doesn't stay open because the manufacturing tolerances were so poor that the hold-open lever doesn't even catch the butt of the blade. The place it's supposed to catch is rough and almost looks like someone worked at it with a file to make it catch (but it still doesn't). This is extremely sloppy and any sort of QA at all would have caught this. As it is, there is nothing holding the blade open and it is extremely dangerous. This is one of the most poorly manufactured knives I've ever seen.I only gave it two stars because I'm going to go ahead and fix it myself. It seems to hold a good edge. I wish I hadn't thrown away the packaging.
I have two batteries and after a little over 1 year they both went dead!! I only use for home work and am disappointed that they do not last longer!! Otherwise the tools are excellent equipment.
Im  a Contractor and havent had very good luck with Makita or MIlwaukee 18v batteries.I dont know if they sit on the shelf so long there is not much life left when purchased or they just dont last very long .Maybe they should offer new batteries sent when purchased . Kind of disapointing when spending hundreds of dollars on quality tools .
OK.  I'm the first to admit.  These batteries are not good.  They lose a charge and become useless inside of a year (maybe two).  But I think the problem isn't the batteries themselves.  It's the charger.  Save yourself LOTS of money and buy the Milwaukee 48-59-0260 Multi-Bay Battery Charger.  Amazon sells for CHEAP and they completey recondition the old useless batteries.  It's amazing how well it works.
Milwaukee TOOL is the best. Battery strength is very powerful.  However, the battery charger and its battery is the worst of all.  The battery is dead suddenly without warning.  It is completely dead and does not charge.  I owed two set of Milwaukee combo 18 V and 2 set of cordless Makita drill and 6.5" saw.  Both are excellent.  But I have to say, I like Milwaukee a little bit more.  I am just a home improvement geek not any contractor.  But I did replace 6 batteries within 5 years.  There is a trick that may save your battery.Must follow the following procedure:Charge battery:1.  First, plug the charger power cord to the outlet.2.  Load battery to chargerRemove battery:1.  First, remove battery off charger2.  Unplug power cordBattery will short its circuit if you don't follow this procedure.Second problem is that it is very difficult to remove the battery off the tool.  The battery, which I bought within a year, has some handling improvement.  But it still has a lot more room to improve.I would give them 5 stars if they fix the charger and its handling capability.  It is the most powerful 18v cordless.  I bought the second set because I got a great deal at Home Depot for 1/2 price special.
I have 3 18 volt Ni-cad batteries, 2 of which suddenly would no longer accept a charge. I tried the 9 volt battery trick, didn't work. I then took a 12 volt DC power supply and some alligator clip test leads and hooked up the batteries to this setup for about an hour, this did work, now they would accept a charge. You could do the same thing by substituting your car battery in place of a power supply.I still had a problem with the batteries not holding a strong charge, but by running the battery down by holding the drill chuck by hand, waiting for the battery to cool, and then recharging the battery, I think I have cured them.It seems that the problem is a.)the lack of a conditioning cycle on the original charger, and b.)the 18 volt batteries being more susceptible to charging issues that a conditioning cycle would cure.The new Milwaukee charger for the Li-ion batteries has a conditioning cycle for Ni-cads which could be a easy solution to this problem.I give this product 2 stars because of Milwaukee's failure to man up and address the problem.
I have been a loyal Milwaukee cordless user for many years now, so loyal that I could have been a salesman for their products. A friend bought a 1/2" Makita 14 volt kit and well I was blown away. It has just about as much power as my 18volt and it's lighter and the batteries are far superior. I guess this is why I am writing this review. Milwaukee has gone on and created their 24volt system with a much better battery and just forgotten us 18volt guys and left us with these crappy batteries. The original batteries seemed to be top of the line and now ther're junk. Still cost a lot though. I must have 10 of them in my shop most of which really need to go to the recycler. My suggestion is if your just starting out and want 18volts avoid the Milwaukee as sooner or later you are going to be disappointed.
I too own a Milwaukee bag of tricks. I did buy it second hand. However, I do know why the set was sold. The batteries are the sets downfall. Ironically, I was born, raised, and still live in Milwaukee. Over 30 years in the trades, I still believe in the Milwaukee name, U.S.A. To my Milwaukee and U.S.A. designers, builders, engineers and craftsmen, Let us severe the umbilical ties with outside sources and build American products for our, American brothers and sisters, daily uses. Let us no longer allow ourselves to come up short when it comes to providing quality for our own. Let us set our sights within ourselves. Let us build the best. They will come. I will pay top dollar for an American product. If, however,  an American family reaps those benefits.Milwaukee Tool, bring your products back into the hands of your American Builders. I will probably sell my kit to a foreigner. Just kidding. Maybe I will melt it into a sculpture.....????
While I like the Milwaukee product I detest these batteries. If you use them daily, like I do, you are are lucky to get 6 months out of them. I am constantly ordering new batteries becuase they simply stop charging between 5-7 mos after purchase. I have a Ryobi that I used daily before these for 6 mos and It is now 2 years old and still has the same battery. Had I known the battery stank I would not have purchased the set.
NOT A REAL GOOD COMMERCIAL BATTERY.  ABOUT A YEARS WORTH OF MEDIUM HEAVY USE.  KIND OF AN EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT, BUT THE MILWAUKEE TOOLS ARE GREAT.  HOW DID WE EVER GET ALONG?
I've been unhappy with the lifespan of the 18v Milwaukee batteries.  Compared to my Makita batteries, the Milwaukees last only half as long or less, before they won't take a charge anymore.Too bad, because I really like the 18v Milwaukee circular saw and the 18v Hatchet recip saw.  Rather than purchase new batteries from Milwaukee, I'm going to try having the old ones rebuilt and see if that improves their performance.
This doesn't fit my Makita drill.  No one has any information on what it is for.  The Makita web site has no info either and I am unable to find out where to get the proper belt clips for my Makita tools.  I returned the part but the shipping ended up costing more than the part.
The product looked very nice online, but it is certainly not of top quality. The lamp shade is not made of cloth, but with printed paper. It looks nice enough, but again, overall I was disappointed. I thought this was a unique lamp set, but it seems to be yet another mass manufactured cheap import.
The Item I ordered was for a 2&#34; sink hole.  The configuration of the item I received was for a 1 3/4&#34; sink hole.  The item does not look like the drawing I viewed when I ordered it.  Time has been wasted waiting for this item and Now more time will be wasted waiting again.  I will have to go to the local plumbing supply and pay 10 times the price in order to complete my project.  If this is indeed the item I ordered it is mis-labled as 2&#34; when it is actually 1 3/4&#34;
