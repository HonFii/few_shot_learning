dentist patient pad to communicate is quite useful
this was a b-day present for my little bro and he loved it it works with his style and personality
when i opened that box it was perfect. there where no cracks in the plastic, and it was shiny too.
I love this.  Now I can get rid my early threads and clear up some much needed bookshelves.  The ability to search is quite useful.
I bought this book for the in-depth section on ax smithing and ended up falling in love with the book entirely. The book has sections on many different types of smithing projects and fundamentals essential within the blacksmith shop. The book is pricey, but my-oh-my is it worth it.
Outfriggingstanding! I can not say enough good about this book. Entertaining as well as informative. If you are just starting out in Blacksmithing or want to add to your knowledge base. Find one of these books. The hand drawn  illustrations are very well done and convey the technical information. The book runs in the form of a narrative between a master smith giving instruction to an apprentice. A boon for my collection.
I have read MANY blacksmithing books. I am constantly looking for them as the craft is a passion of mine. This book when it first came seemed thin and basic just by looking at the contents. However, the &#34;interview&#34; style of writing with a master smith really gets at the heart of the topics covered. By having the author and apprentice asking novices questions, many of the fundamentals are fleshed out by the master. This especially becomes true in topics such as forge welding where he explains not only the techniques but the theory behind what your doing. Damascus suddenly doesn't seem impossible after reading this (though supplementary readings are certainly necessary).There are some times when I was a bit confused on the process being employed in a project, but ultimately this is attributed to the fact that this book is NOT for someone looking for a step-by-step project book. This book is for someone wanting to read about the history of blacksmithing is Sweden, learn fundamentals in a master's own words, and gain a larger appreciation for the craft.This is one of the best books I have read on the topic.
As an aspiring blacksmith, i found the information herein fascinating, inspiring, and at some points it was actually an exciting and entertaining read. Easy ten stars, and i can't wait to start using some of the information found here.
This book is very expensive but a good read. I would recommend it to a friend. The photographs are very nice.
This sandpaper leaves a smooth finish on hardwoods and it fits on the Ridgid combination belt and spindle sander.  I couldn't find spindle sandpaper specifically for the Ridgid sander and took a shot on this.  It fits fine.
This stuff is great -- it may be expensive but you will know after your first use why.  It speads easily. It expands as it sets,oozing from the edges of your joint, proving you have 100% coverage. Cleanup is simple and  complete.  The bond is as strong as I've ever seen.
For years I have used white glues for wood projects.  Recently I have begun using the water-proof white glues.  These are almost as good as standard white glues but most leave a lot of white staining on the wood and are often difficult to clean up.  Then the polyurethane glues came along and changed everything.  I have used a whole bottle of each of the major brands.My analysis:1. The technology of a glue that expands rather than contracts is very good.  Some expand more than others.2. Most of the P.U. glues stain the work piece.  Some stain more than others.  Some of the staining goes fairly deep.3. The actual dried hardness of the glue varies between brands.4. The drying time varies greatly between brands.5. The open time is fairly consistent between brands.My conclusion:Gorilla Glue is truly the best of them all.  It has the shortest drying time with the same usable open time.  It does not stain the work piece. It dries to a good sandable hardness.  It expands to fill without overpowering the clamps.Bottom Line:Great product!  Only wish it was more available in Canada.
I have used this in a couple projects, with no complaints at all.  You have 15-30 minutes of working time, which really comes in handy with complicated assembly.It is a very strong glue, and if you have an outdoor project, buy it.
This 49-page paper-back book describes the basics of setting up a dust collection system for a home work shop.  It answered most of the questions I had abut setting up such a system, and I would recommend it for people considering a dust collection system but who are unsure how to set one up.
FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE NEW TO THE WOOD WORKING FIELD, I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY HELPFUL.  IT ANSWERED MANY QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD NEVER EVEN HAVE THOUGHT TO ASK. (I.E. HOW MANY TOOLS CAN BE HOOKED UP AT ONE TIME, AND THE PROPER LENTH OF HOSE TO USE.)  IT HELPED ME IMMENSELY IN SETING UP MY SHOP.  THANKS TOOL CRIB!
If you are planning to purchase a tool rig, plan on buying this. You'll  spend less time adjusting your belt and more time getting work done. It's  comfortable and should work with any tool rig.
Got these over four years ago to use for simple fast joinery making jigs in the shop, storage cabinets, shelves, tool boxes and benches.They still work perfectly.Bits are still sharp, despite being used for thousands of holes in abrasive materials like plywood and MDF.I have not lost any of the parts thanks to the nifty fitted box these come in.Adjustment is easy & fast.I also saved money on screws since I bought large quantities of screws that fit these bits. (mcFeely)Great investment for a dedicated DIY'er, homeowner or woodworking fanatic.
This set is well designed and fabricated. It performs very well.
Don't waste your money on those cheapie Ryobi or Hitachi countersinks available at Home Depot and Lowes. The W.L. Fuller countersinks are the finest available--sharp, durable, and well-made. I am a professional cabinetmaker, and every cabinetmaker in our shop has a set of Fuller countersinks. Nice, clean countersinks everytime.The tapered bits this set comes with can be swapped out with regular drill bits. The tapered bits work well for wood screws, but it seems like few people use wood screws anymore. We use sheet metal/drywall screws exclusively, and find them far superior. Just put regular drill bits in your Fuller countersink set, and you're ready to roll. Save the tapered bits for acrylic and plexiglass, as they won't crack or chip the material like straight bits do.W.L. Fuller sells an unbelievable line of specialty bits and cutting tools, and their quality is top rate on all their tools. It's a shame Amazon only sells the countersinks, but if you need a set, this is the best price out there.Fuller is a family owned and operated business out of Warwick, Rhode Island. At a time when more and more tool manufacturing jobs are being lost to near-slave labor in China, it's great to see some Yankee ingenuity cranking out products that will still be rockin' when all that Chinese junk has been re-recycled back into beer cans.
I've had two sets of these for a long time, replaced bits when needed, this is American tool making like the old days.  Great stuff, top value for your money, keep it here in the USA.
An excellent product!  It is hard to put more of a review than that.  The bits are sharp and durable, and I have found several uses for the bit stops that I don't think were intended.  If you need something to countersink a hole and get it ready for a screw, then you have found a tool that will definately save you time.
To bad Amazon doesn't have big boy sizes (44by anything).  But I found them and bought a pair to see what all the shouting was about!  I agree - another tool.  Here in hot Texas they'll get a lot of use in the winter and early spring.  I really like the knee pads without having a elastic around my leg all day.  Plenty of pockets, and they have plenty of room.  Overall well constructed, and they are most comfortable. Generous on the length too.
Great pair of work pants and the knee pads are a real bonus! Handy features to make the work day go easy. I recommend you buy a pair.
I have owned the original occidental leather belt for 15 years and decided to retire it in favor of occedental's beltless system. I was saddly dissapointed. I ordered the oxy lights awhile ago and found love again!!  I t's laid out just like my old set, but a noticeably lighter, especially in damp conditions. I prefer the firmness of a leather belt over codura when it comes to hanging other tools from the belt. One last note, spring for the extra $ and get the sheep skin lined belt, you will not be dissapointed.
I've been using this belt everyday for months and months and guess what? Not even a loose stitch. Ha! I even bought it used. You get what you pay for.
I love this toolbelt, I've been a carpenter for 18 years and have been using cheap front load aprons for years , I really love this belt tough, durable, plus your get nylon and leather, the best of both worlds!can't say enough about, love it!
This tiny (2/3s the dimensions of a paperback) is a compilation of the most useful engineering, construction and hard science information, figures, conversions and calculations around.  For certain, it doesn't match the detail of the CRC Handbook, but for everyday use, it is unparalleled.Need to know the maximum span of a 2 x 10 spruce-pine-fir joist (grade 1) under a 10lb/square foot dead load?[1]Need to know the density of Mercury?[2]Need to know the area code of Belize City?[3]Need to know the discharge rate for a weir 18 feet wide with a 4 inch head?[4]Need to know the formula for volume of a cone?[5]And it has a metric/english ruler.[1] 16 feet[2] 13.546g/cc[3] 501-2[4] 288 x 18 GPM[5] V = (pi x r x r x h)/3
excellent.
Works as advertised. We used it for cave mapping as a digital laser clino. We tapped a laser to the top of it. The 'hold' button really helped out.
I work in a furniture factory.  Between the Smart Tool and the Bosch Protractor, we measure all angles digitally now.  Quality and precision are way up.  I bet we have 20 of them in the factory now.  Tool and fixture makers, engineers and quality control all use them.  Why be pretty close when you can be right on.
I bought this to use on my 4x4 truck to find some different angles, it works great ;)
I purchased this level module for my significant other who is visually impaired.  With a 10X magnifying glass he was able to tell the bubble was close to the middle with a standard bubble level, but was far from accurate.  It appears that the company has change the design of this level since some of these reviews have been written.  There is no apparent way to attach it to anything.  If you're looking for a torpedo level, this would be it.  If you need a longer level, you could probably tape it to the top of another level or buy a longer one.  It appears to be a quality, well-built level with many features and it is easy to use.  The sound feature is loud and clear and works well for the visually impaired or anyone who has the need to level something without watching it.  We would recommend this to anyone.  Thanks again Amazon for coming through.
I do accessibility surveys for ADA compliance. The Smart tool is the tool of choice for this work. It is accurae, does what I need it to do and is small enought to carry in luggage. All good.  The thing that makes it different from competing brands is the ability to re-calibrate to factory standards on site. Very important when work must be legally defensible. That is difference in price
Great tool. I bought the module because the longer levels have the module permanently attached. The module comes in handy where you cannot get a longer level in and works just about anywhere .I used it to build a 12x40 deck. Compact and easy to use. I also like the percentage feature it has because I grade for a living and it comes in handy for quick calculations. The memory feature is great. It may cost a little more than other levels but it is worth it. Built tough and good quality. I also use it at work to calibrate my electronic cross slope module on my motor grader.
I used this tool when working with the last company I was employed by and it is great. Works even better when you have the magnetic bracket that attaches to it so you can align the sat dish while watching the values on the tool. Unfortunately the company would not ship the bracket to me here in Iraq, so I have to wait until my vacation time in order to pick up the bracket. Bum deal.
The compact design makes this is very good for use on stair treads and other small areas.  We have also used this in the percentage mode to insure compliance with ADA regulations. It has held up well in field conditions. Well worth getting.
The Machlanburg-Duncan 92346 SmartTool Module Only is an excellent, handy tool for determining grades to add or subtract to speed/velocity formulas that require this information.  The module is small so it is easily portable.  If I can avoid all those formula conversions to get % to degrees and vice versa...trust me...I will do it!  This is one of the best tools in my t/c tool chest!
I can highly recommend this product.  It can beused as a stand alone level, or attached to otherlevel aids  eg. wheel alignment brackets via means ofremoving the 2 screws and backing plate to sandwich itbetween whatever bracket you want to use.IT also comes with a protective case.  Amazon servicewas execellent.  Item was dispatched promptly and arrivedbefore expected date.  All round great service.
This is an awesome product and great to use for strike and dip. This will get lots of use and I would recomment it to everyone.
Used this Smarttool to measure sloped parking area degree angles. It works very well, good new tool. Had it shipped in 1 day because of the project.
This thing is GREAT!! It takes a short time to calibrate but after that it is dead on in any position. What a wonderful piece of equipment.
Excellent tool, I use this for everything from carpentry, masonry, automotive repair and fabrication.  Good price and quick delivery, this purchase was just right.
We have a few of these SmartTool Modules.  They are used daily in a manufacturing environment, that is less than friendly.  Two have been in use for nearly a year now and are still doing the job.We are using them mounted in eight-foot magnetic levels, which were also sold by M-D Building Products.  We are very disappointed that the eight-foot level is no longer available.
Fantastic product!  I don't know how I lived without this item.  Great for determining angles quickly and then comparing is fast and easy!
Great little tool and great fun to use. Fits in most 48" levels or can be used by itself. A little bit of trouble to calibrate.
For the most part one doesn't really need 0.1 of a degreee accuracy but personally I love that I can have it. Guess I'm one of those type A types...oh well. This thing is super accurate and has some great features. Now I should tell you M-D is no longer producing the levels for this module to go in (told to me by a distributor who said he's tried everything to get them to start producing them again because of the amount of orders he gets for them) He has only a few non-magnetic M-D made levels left in stock so if you want the levels these go in, better search hard and get them while you can. That said, I do not know if this module will fit in levels made by other manufacturers.
It was what I need and it is graet.very easy to use and very reliable so buy it if u need
I'm a remodeling contractor.  I bought one of these when they first came out.  When mine bit the dust after 10+ years of abuse I immediately without hesitation replaced it.  I wish I could afford to put one in all my levels.
This product is good for those who want to set circles manually with altitude. (You have to a computer/palm with up-to-the minute altitude/azmimuth data to do this.)In my testing when mounted to my dobsonian telescope, the angle of the object is dead-on in a 0.8-degree FOV eyepiece! (+/- 0.1 degree error!!!)Since it's water-resistant and can handle lower temperatures, this can handle observing in tough environments.This is a wonderful product not only for home-improvement products, but astronomy!Mark
I needed to set up machinery in my woodworking shop. I use the Smart Tool to level machinery tables, check blade and fence angles, and even to get my jointers tables co-planar.Since I only bought the module itself, I can tape it to longer straight edges for any length of leveling needs.I attached self-adhesive magnetic card strips to mine and it stays put on my cast iron equipment tables and fences.I'd give it more stars if I could...Sonny EdmondsSaugus, CA
This is a slope indicator for measuring the slope of surfaces. It is accurate and easy to use. I used it to measure the required slope of some ADA handicap ramps that must  not be too steep.
Excellent radio! Shame they quit making them. They are very clear, easy to use, hold charges well and have a reasonable range.
The Sidewinder suspenders' design is the answer for a wide segment of the population of men that have difficulty keeping pants up and not exposing the top portion of their [rear] and suffering undue pressure from "normal", non-elastic suspender design on shoulders causing pain that radiates down... my husband was dubious when I asked him to try a pair for just one day of work - he's up & down milk tank ladders, in & out of his truck countless times plus he bags test boxes then lifts & arranges them in the truck bed...We hitched him up and upon his arrival home that night he stated he was sold... the design works... no shoulder pressure or pain, in fact, he'd forgotten they we even there...After about a week, I noticed that the toothed snaps were eating away the denim waistband, so I made two denim straps... each wraps around my husband's belt and works splendidly plus saves his jeans that extra wear 'n tear...Thank you Bucket Boss!!!
I am one of those potbellied guys that needs a pair of suspenders to keep his britches up. Sidewinders are a great improvement! The design keeps the straps from falling off your shoulders as you move around. They are off to the side so the straps do not rub against your shirt pockets. With the clips on the side, they do not poke into you when you sit in a chair and they do not rip the seat in your truck. This is really a better mouse trap.
I ordered this for my overhead light fixture. It has been working nicely - it fits well, is bright, and does not buzz loudly like some fluorescents. It has lasted a while so far and I have ordered another one for the fixture in a different room. I recommend this bulb.
It is what it is...cheap phone cord. I made two cords from it already and they work fine.
It's a good 100' tape and the price is right. I can't see spending a lot for these because I am hard on them and will usually pull off the end grip because I pull it too hard to get the sag out. It's not very good for stretching air born over a log distance but if you can lay it on a flat surface like a floor or studded wall it works fine. It's also flexible enough to measure curves like a planting area to determine the length of edging needed. I'm happy with it.
I was doubtful the tape measures were really Lufkin at the price paid. It was such a good deal I bought 3. They were real Lufkin tapes with Lufkin great quality. I'm surprised and happy with the purchase.
Man, I like these suspenders.  Are wide enough to not &#34;pinch&#34; shoulders.  Clips are heavy duty and hold very well.  I like the elastic back.  Couldn't be happier.
Used to wear red suspenders in my youth.  Played sports and thighs didn't match waist.  Had to get jeans 4&#34; too big in the waist to fit my legs.  Belt was uncomfortable.30 years later that's not the problem now.Was looking for suspenders that will hold up my jeans with belt and hammer hook and Buck knife and keys all while working around the house and yard.These are solidly made with strong clips and not too much elastic.For the price a great deal.
The suspenders are a great Buy and are high quality and I am very pleased with them. They also are adjustable for a better fit as I am 6-4 and 330 lbs.
We searched everywhere in our town for this type of suspenders.  We couldn't find them so went in on the Internet.  My husband is very happy and satisfied with these suspenders that we ordered.Thank You
I bought a 110c and a 115 model suspenders and can find a difference. Both HD and well made. I bought these as the base for a metal detector harness. I added a strap and buckle across the chest with a eye on each side for the support bungee cord.
I was in a busy restaurant walking down the stairs when my pants fell down.. At that point I decided that was it for belts..I'm a wide guy and I like wide suspenders.. Nothing sissy about these..
Not the little Micky Mouse clips you've seen before. great for when you happen to have a lot of rocks in your pockets or you have 50lbs of slob to hold up! Very well made.
Works better than expected . Got it quick, people are easy to deal with, I would recommend them to my friends.
A belt will only do you so much good but when the waist outflanks the hips it's time for a new strategy.  And suspenders work real good.
well made and looks great, real fashion statement with jeans and a t-shirt.  purchased red and black, great price to!
These red suspenders have gotten an unusual use in my house - keeping the mattress cover on bed. And it's working!!! King size bed and the darn thing is finally staying place. Remember to always think outside the box.
I buy these for my grandfather. He won't wear anything but heavy duty suspenders as they dont 'hold'. He loves these and wears them all the time.
this is not one of those that stretch out. it's fixed. so it hangs. have to adjust and works great. keeps my pants up because i lost weight but dont want to buy more pants. this is great for that.
they work fine are very supportive and there is little room for growh i do like them though and would buy them again
What a great product.  Easy to adjust and good looking on.  I would recomend them to anyone wanting to get sporty  suspenders.
I do believe I already left a  review for these  red suspenders. My husband just loved them. He had a pair but the buckle didn't hold. Since these are a little heavier, hopefully they wil hold up.
These work much better than the thinner ones. You'll look a little like a fireman, but they are very brave people so that's not a bad thing.
These are as heavy duty and well made and should fit large men very well.  My grandfather's mobility is limited and fully elastic suspenders work better for him but these are great for most folks.
Very tough suspenders.  Holds pants up better than suspenders with all elastic straps.  Clasps hold tight to waist band.  Set it & forget it length adjustment: takes some time to adjust, but once length is set, it doesn't move.
Due to mixed reviews I did hesitate to order these suspenders. My husband has been wearing them daily for the past month and a half. He is 5' 11&#34; and average weight. The suspenders fit well. Granted they are a little tricky to adjust, but not impossible. The metal clamps hold on the pants well without damaging them, and we have had no issues with the clamps &#34;falling apart&#34; like other people. We will probably end up ordering at least one more pair as time goes on. I will amend my review if I find that the second set is vastly different in quality.
It took a little adjustment for me, since I'm used to the usual all-elastic types found at the usual places (Wally World, here, etc.) but there's where the difference may be to my advantage. I wear suspenders daily and after a few months the others seem to wear out-stretch, fray, etc. These only have elastic in the back portion. The adjustments are rigid. I had to set them longer since they don't stretch, but once I got the length set, they worked very well. No need to &#34;hitch-up&#34; with these since there's no elastic to stretch. I could learn to like this a LOT!
I got these for holding my jeans up when working  so i didnt have to keep hiking them up every time i had to bend or reach. they are sturdy and work well.  clips hold . not much else to write on suspenders. the key parts function well. I guess on some of the suspenders i got before, the clips were no good. These adjust and hold, what else can there be, it comes in some colors, i got black and blue. Had them for some time as well
After reading various reviews, I don't find any of the faults listed, like elastic only in the back (not a problem) or teeth tearing holes in levis, not a problem yet) in fact could be a little tighter as I have had one slip off so far.  Comfortable, once they are adjusted right, and hold the pants in place, as they should.  Would buy again.
These are superior quality and appearance. The clips are heavy duty and snap down tight. The leather X reinforcement is the natural color and shouldn't stain any clothing. I am 6'2&#34; and they easily adjusted to fit. Have about another 5&#34; left to go. I can't imagine there would be many guys they wouldn't fit.
These suspenders are the best I 've ever had. The elastic portion of the straps are in the back, and the rest of the strap is like a car's seat belt. I use them all day long, and they are very comfortable. Especially while sitting, because the elastic is only in the back, they relax and don't seem to squeeze your shoulders down like the others. What a relief !!!! The clamps are super strong, too. I will never use the others again. These are that comfortable.
I got them to wear at work to hold my apron up and their perfect,and the shipping was sooo fast
I didn't have any experience with work suspenders before. Took a chance on these - they were cheap enough. These are great heavy-duty suspenders with shiny nickel-plated 50-pound clips, not your Father's cheap, thin, tinny suspenders. The straps are wide, strong and the clips are big, beefy and clamp tight. Works great to hold up your fully loaded tool and take a strain off you while you work. Treat yourself. I'm glad I did.
I use these suspenders on my work pants. And they are very comfortable and well made. They are made to last. I would recommend them.
These are great.  Strong buckles, elastic in back but not in front.  I recommend highly.
they are very nice and well made and very sturdy i am impressed with the quality of the suspenders and i like the color
OK I know suspenders aren't the most exciting thing you might want to see coments on.  These type are well made and very effective at holding up your pants, especially when you are carrying a lot of stuff in them.  Use mine for backpacking, fishing and other activities that get you belts and pants overloaded with whatever.  They do a great job, look good, and are the lowest prices I have seen through Amazon.  Worth consideration.
Good quality, quite impressed
Very high quality item. Not too heavy, but enough so that it splits wood well!
I've used this maul professionally as a fireman, and personally for log splitting, and it's never failed.  If it can stand up to venting a roof in one of the world's busiest fire departments, it can handle any home job. ;)
It splits wood like it's supposed to, although it's really meant for splitting wood that is not that large in diameter (definitely 1.5' or less in diameter).  The fiberglass handle is light, ergonomic, and doesn't seem to transfer much of the shock.  Wearing gloves helps too.
This item was a gift to a Lakota Sioux on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation so he could split wood for the elders there. He said it was well made and grateful to receive it.Sue Gartz
I was so happy to find these. They're smallish, which is what I prefer. They're very easy to handle when watering the plants on my balcony.
This product arrived early and looks amazing.  It makes for a really cool gift and one that you can easily personalize.  I will definitely buy more in the future!
I used these pails to make individual mud cakes for a birthday party. They were just the right size for 4 and 5 year olds!
what an I really say about a bucket...hmm...well, they are well made, sturdy, nice bright and shiny galvanized bucket. works good as a cigarette bin.
Great buckets. We bought them for kids to use at our pumpkin patch and they are the only thing that has held up through 2,800 school visitors.
I needed some new buckets, these buckets from Dover Parkersburg looked like they would be exactly what I wanted. They were almost perfect for what I needed, buckets. The manufacturer delivered on time and at the agreed upon price.(39 words)
Purchased two of the Dover Parkersburg 4Qt Metal Water Buckets and really, really like them.  They are used daily for measuring feed for my two horses.  Should give me years of service.
I brought these brushes to apply water based oil stain on wind spinners. These chip brushes does a very well job. Just the right size :)
the items showed up as advertised and on time. I have used this product for some time and always had good results.
I own seven large multitools, a Shrade Tough Tool, a Leatherman Wave and Juice XE6, a Gerber Legend and custom 600, a SOG Powerlock and a Bucktool. I have probably looked at or reviewed most of the other tools and I have have to say that the Shrade has some great features at a great price.Unlike many of the other multitools the Shrade allows one to access most of the tools without opening it. Most multitools require one to unfold the multitool to get to the various tools. The Shrade offers about the most different tools. It includes a scraping blade and an awl. It includes lockable screwdrivers of both types and a saw and knife that lock. It also has many other tools and a large pliers. It feels great in your hand and it does not hurt your hand when squeezing tight on the pliers unlike traditional Leathermans.The disadvantages are that it does not have as many flat screwdriver blades as many other multitools and unlike my Gerbers and Bucktool all tools do not lock.Still after balancing everything, the Shrade has some great features at a great price.
The seller shipped the purchase in a timely fashion and also had it boxed correctly. I had sent them a request on at least two ocassions where I asked for shipping information and they never replied. I needed this because I was using a new courier service. I will say that I would buy from them again and would also recommend them.
I recently bought the Tough Tool after using a Gerber 600 for only 6 months. The quality of the Gerber did not convince me at all (broken screwdriver, chipped wire cutter). After holding the Tough Tool in my hand for the first time, I knew straight away that I found a true &quot;Man`s Tool&quot;.The built quality and the sheer size of the Tough Tool seems to scream :&quot; I am the business !!! &quot;. All implements are full size and are up to the hardest day to day use. I have no doubt that I will use my &quot;Toughie&quot; for many years to come.
Used it to cover cracks on my door to the outdoor storage shed. Cuts easily to fit and stays true to form in the heat.
You know prior to installing this seal we constantly had dust in our garage.  Now we have a great dust seal.  The company we purchased the seal from was prompt in shipping, easy to work with and has always been honest on this and other products.
I was looking for a replacement for my old phone jack & this one is a major upgrade! Only took a couple of minutes to install! Improved my phone & internet greatly!! Highly recommend!
Got this product a few days earlier than expected.  Took me about 35 minutes to install inside and outside.  Working great.
This phone jack gets the job done and is less expensive than those sold locally. A good bargain for someone needing to add an extra jack to their phone lines.
This is the ideal solution when you have more than one article that needs to be plugged in to the same phone plug, such as telephone, fax, modem or an additional telephone.I solved that with this Leviton 832-C0247-W 2-Outlet Phone Plug Adapter. Now I can have 2 telephone sets in my bedroom, one on each side of the bed. I also have 2 telephone sets plugged in the same telephone plug located in the living room, 1 for the living room and another in the dining room.  The third one is in my office, where I have 2 telephones, fax &amp; modem.It comes in a very convenient color (White) so it matches with most home or office furniture and decorations.
These are exactly what I was needing to make a telephone line that was only 12 inches long. You can't buy this length.
I had a bunch of pre-assembled 50' phone cords. During a recent remodeling I ran seven of these cables from each location where I might want to place a wired phone to a central closet where they plug into two of these adapters. Connecting these adapters to each other left 9 jacks  so I have two spares which I have used already during testing. I bought an Ooma VOIP system which give me excellent Internet phone service over new wiring. Canceling my AT&T will pay for everything in two months. These 5 outlet adapters are an excellent inexpensive alternative to the $40-$50 commercial &#34;66 Terminal Blocks&#34; normally used in office wiring that provide similar services. The preassembled cables made thess very practical.
Rather than use a tape measure and measure over 12&#34; and then guesstimate down to get the height, I'd rather just use this. Very accurate and super handy.
It is a good tool that is not sensitive to being in a toolbox or used heavily. It is plastic but very thick.
Our guys use this when they climb on a roof and need visual confirmation of the pitch of a roof.
used to determine slope/pitch for roofs,,,,tool works well.  Not much more can be said, fits in my clip board nicely.
If your into roofing sales, this is a must have tool.  Easy to use, and easy to carry in your back pocket...
Although not as heavy duty as I would have liked, it is easy to read and accurate.  So I am happy that I bought it.  No more guessamating for me!
This is a great little tool, and it's dirt cheap. It would make a great scientific Christmas gift for kids. It's cheap enough to be a stocking stuffer!
It's accurate, functional, and durable. Great value for the price. A good option to buying more expensive brands that function identically.
I've found this tool to be very easy to read and tough.  It's also fairly small so it's easy to carry around.
Simple gauge for checking roof pitches.I do several inspections a day and this fits the bill. Its reliable and priced right!!
I was not able to find this product at Lowe's, Sears, Kmart, Walmart nor Sam's, Home Depot nor Northern Tool and Equiptment (I did not check Kelly's) and probably other places I don't remember now.  I know some of these stores carry it in other cities but this tool was not to be found in Miami.  And it is exactly what I needed.  It measures the slope as a measure of degrees or as rise over run.  I found plenty of protractors or similar devices in degrees.  But I wanted to take a picture that would show rise over run.  As far as I know this is the only tool for that and in Miami, FL, Amazon.com is the easiest way to get it.
This is a very handy product that is very well made.It should last for many uses for years to come.
tHE TOOL WORKS GREAT. IT IS EASY TO FIND ALL THE PITCHES FOR THE ROOFS. tHANK YOU FOR SELLING GREAT PRODUCT.
excelente
Really something that can do the work quickly without doing math on paper. Could't wish for any better tool to do that job.
The 750 is very simple to use and gives you clear and accurate readings for both pitch and slope. It is not the right tool for all slope angle measurements as it may not fit some tight spaces.I would like to have received a case and or protective bag for the device, even if it meant paying a little more for it.
I am an insurance adjuster.  I use this tool of course to measure the pitch of the roofs I inspect.  Very good tool.  Have been extremely please.
i bought this mainly to set the skew on my lnb's before i had to estimate the skew scan a satellite and get nothing but since i started using this i get all transponders on the satellites it's a good tool to have as a handy man
This product arrived quickly. This is a great little too that I use for my job. It measures both degrees of slope and roof pitch. I looked at other similar products that only measure slope, requiring the user to calculate roof pitch. This is made of a durable plastic, is lightweight, and small. Best of all, it is not electronic and therefore cannot malfunction or go &#34;dead&#34;.
Just got this item, its extremely light, fast, small enough to fit into my tool belt and durable enough to take a good fall. I'm completely satisfied with this. :)
C'est un bon appareil, assez pr&eacute;cis pour faire la job de mesurage qu'on lui demande.Une &eacute;toile de plus pour la qualit&eacute;-prix.
The item came bubble wrapped in a padded envelope with no damage.  I have not had to use it yet, but seems to be exactly as ordered.
Amazon got this hard to find item to me very quick.  I'm very happy.  In fact I ordered 2.
Useful for many different tasks. I use it to set angles for a lot of things and when making knives/grinding. Built solid.
Possibly the best tool a hands on craftsman could have in his tool collection.I find this tool better than any i have ever used in over 60 years in the craftsmanship trade.
The price is very low compare to other similar item and this item is a quality item!I'm really happy and I recommand it to everybody
I have recently bought Johnson Level ,were tested on different surfaces and angles show that gives reading an accurate and valid ,generally  amazing level and highly recommend .
I've been using this pitch meter for several weeks now, and I'm very satisfied with its performance.  As an insurance adjuster, I inspect roofs on a daily basis.  This pitch meter is accurate, durable, and compact in size.  I like the fact that I can stick it in my back pocket when I'm not using it.  The scale is easy to read and photograph when necessary.  Its the best pitch meter I have found, and Amazon has the best price for this item.
Okay, do I really LOVE (5 stars) these carpet rollers for painting? No,not in the romantic sense. But carpet does provide something that other rollers do not:a light stippled texture with most common paints and primers (assuming sufficient density). In my situation this is very useful as I live in an older house with smooth plaster walls. This is a very unforgiving surface for any paints with even a modest gloss (i.e.other than flat). Every wall and even ceiling will accumulate nicks, patches, scrapes, etc. over the years. Trying to recover that pure, uniformly smooth surface is going to be a lot of work. But so would texturing the entire surface with "mud" to hide scattered small blemishes. And frankly I don't care much for basic skip texture (the cheapest wall prep) nor fancier options. So a light texture created by the paint itself is a great time saving compromise in my opinion. A couple of coats of thicker primer (e.g., Kilz 2) and a couple of coats of decent finish paint can hide a lot of imperfections when you use a carpet roller. And you'll get even better hiding using an actual texture paint.And yet carpet rollers have become harder to come by. They used to be standard stock in paint stores and big box home improvement chains - not so much any more. Until I found this vendor, I was diligently preserving the ones I had with careful cleaning and reuse. The fact that an Internet search will yield insanely high prices suggests the supply/demand is a bit out of whack; it's a roller cover - even the fanciest should be well under $5 each.I do recommend, with carpet, that you vacuum the rollers before use (not kidding).This removes most of the loose fibers that will otherwise end up on your wall or ceiling.
This is same with photo.Hence I like it.Happy new year~(Mac lite agent is no good in Korea.)
Holds the mag lite nice and firm. Mother in law use to put mag lite on top of book case and it almost fell and split her head open. Now it is secure.
I used these clips to make a license plate mount that attaches to my winch's roller fair lead. These clips fit perfectly and make it easy to pop the license plate on and off. Only downside I would say is that they are plastic! Otherwise they are a great product over all!
Great product with a quick and easy installation. As long as the clips are correctly placed and aligned there should be no worry of breaking them or damaging them. The plastic does feel a bit weak but they are surprisingly very strong little clips.
These brackets have a very tight grip on the flashlight.  Hold it very securely.  I would use them again.  Easy to install.
This mounting bracket worked great for my application, which was providing a secure mount in my Kenworth truck. I recommend this mount.
Great way to hang and /or mount your D battery mags. I use one clip to hang my mag vertically but if your gonna mount your horizontal I would use both clips on it. By brother in law had these mounted in his old pickups cab and the mag never fell out.
They are plastic BUT &#34;strong&#34; plastic it holds the light very tight no slop or falling out you have to pull to get it to release i will order more for my other trucks and tractor I am happy with them pretty well built for plastic.
Put this in my husbands stocking, since his huge D-cell Maglite is always rolling off the shelf... He had it installed in about 3 minutes. It works great and looks cool.
I Love this product because in my off roading vehicle there is no carpet. So having a holder for my flashligh so it dosent roll around is awsome,it holds the light no problem and it was easy to install.I would buy another one if I needed one.
These mounts keep a Maglite secure even when mounted on a bulldozer.  They are well worth the money if you need to mount a Maglite.  I would purchase these again in the future.  Very easy to use and mount.  Very Pleased.
A wonderfully efficient way to store my mag-light for easy consistant storage and access . Get one and be happy.
love these so far have emergency mag lights in 2 closets in house. they seems very strong and are even a bit hard for wife and young son to pop light out so no way light is falling out of these. i recommend. thinking about getting another set to install in vehicle.
I only used one clip and I slide the flashlight from the top down..and it does a decent job holding it in. Using two clamps made it tough pulling it out against the wall.
Used this mounting system for my 3D cell Maglite and worked perfect. Alignment is key to having a proper mount. The clips are tight and hold the Maglite without sliding or movement.
My family no longer has to ask mom, &#34;where is the flashlight?&#34;. They know to is hanging in it's proper location. I bought 3, so know we have one on each floor at all times.
Works great holds the mag light nice and firmly!Mounted in the back of my SUV vertically !Good quality and easy install
The price on these locally is ridiculous; but, the price here is fantastic.Holds my big MagLite over the roughest terrain.
I absolutely loath maglites of all models but I am actually using this to mount 12 gauge shotguns on both a golf cart and my backdoor. It fits around a Mossberg stock very well!
These flashlight mounting brackets were easy to mount and they hold the flashlight very well. Time will tell if the plastic they are made of will hold up, but I'm pleased with them so far.
These are great little brackets.  As long as you have them aligned properly, (thank you S. Pandya) they work great and are strong enough to hold my 6D cell mag. Also make sure you have a good surface to screw them into.  Mollys on sheetrock.
These are great  I have a pair in every room, they are strong and hold the maglite very well easy to install and easy access to your light
These are well made and come with everything you need.I ended up using the two clips to mount two different flash lights. Each of the two  mounts are holding a 4 cell Maglite.I want to buy another set and mount all my Maglite's
I had these installed on the dash of my old SUV - stupid me! Forgot to take them off when I sold the car!  When you drive at night, especially in snowy, blizzard conditions, you don't want to be fumbling for your 4d MagLite when something happens! My Mag Flashlight has come in handy so many times I recommend everyone to have one within hands reach "just in case". For this price, you can't go wrong!! Seen it some stores for almost 4x this price!!
The clips work as expected. I used one clip to mount the MagLite LED 2D Pro. Tight fit but that is good since I have it mounted in my truck and I don't want it falling around.
Made to mount a light to your wall where it's easy to find and use. While I've seen people use both clamps for one light, I use the brackets individually to mount lights in convenient places around my house in case power goes out. Two small screw holes in the wall and simply clip the light into the bracket. I live in snow country and we lose power a few times in the winter. Walking down the basement stairs there's one mounted on the opposite side of the light switch just for that reason. I can grab the light from an extremely easy place and head downstairs to the wood burner. Great little affordable product that makes life easier. Before I bought these a blackout involved fumbling around a drawer or a closet looking for a flashlight in the dark so i could walk into the dark and get heat on. That problem being solved is well worth a couple bucks
If you like what you see, you will like what you get.  A little warning, if your Maglite does not have a rough surface part on the handle be aware that the Maglite my slide around in the brackets.  This can however be solved by placing tiny rubber stickies at the base of the brackets.  I mounted in my jeep and adds some fun rugged dimension to your vehicle.
Not sure why you really need two. Installed in my truck and used numerous times daily for pest control stops. Delivered on time as promised.
These work perfectly!  Very secure fit on my Maglite and extremely easy to install.  I'm glad I found them.
I ordered this and thought there was one in each package, but there were two in each. No big deal, can always use them. Just be aware.
I bought several of these and have mounted them in each bedroom of my house, the kitchen, the entryway, the garage, and the patio.  Each one has a maglite flashlight mounted in it.  Strong, sturdy, keeps the flashlight perfectly mounted and ready to use.  If you mount these in a proper orientation (will depend on your needs/desires/home configuration) you can simple turn the flashlight on and leave it in the brackets and it will provide light for the whole room during a power outage at night.  Great bargain and great product!
This product is great. I mounted my maglite behind my seat. Before, I had it shoved between the seat, which is unappealing and may cause damage to the seat. Easy to mount and hold the flashlite securely.Thanks!
I installed these on the side of my drivers seat. Looks awesome, plus maglites make a great billy club right inside the door.
These flashlight mounting brackets are made of some type of plastic, it must be  Kryptonite because my first set is very old and is still in service, they never wear out. Needed a second set for a different area and I am glad the product hasn't changed.
Used these on the back of a license plate in order to mount it to the roller fairlead on my winch, it works flawlessly! Made from plastic, but well engineered and seem super study. A+++
Brackets work perfectly and do their job well. They hold my d cell maglite tightly and seem to be very well constructed. Great product for a low price.
I bought 6 sets of these because they are awesome! I only use 3 cell mag lights and these are perfect to mount to a wall in the basement in case of a power out you know exactly where your lights are. I have one mounted in my garage as well, and in my jeep to keep my flash light securely in place.
These brackets hold my flashlight in place in my Jeep next to the drivers seat.  Even on rough trails the light has never come loose.  In addition to my Maglite, they hold my large survival knife and seat belt cutter (the loops for a belt go over the clamps before the flashlight goes in) and I've had no issues for over a year.  I bought a second set to mount another 3D Maglite in my camper.  I have the flashlight mounted upright so if I need light in the middle of the night, but don't want to use the 12 volt, I just push the button and light the whole trailer, flashlight in place.  The price had about doubled by the time I bought the second set, but at less than $5.00 they are a bargain.
This is my 3rd set of clips.  I have lights mounted in my garage, on the side of the seat in my Jeep for easy access.  these work great!
These mounting brackets allow you to lift your flashlight off of the mat, to hold itself high, to have a purpose again. These brackets are the &#34;Mickey&#34; Goldmill to your MagLight's Rocky Balboa.
Fits my 4-D cell Maglite beautifully. Mounted it to the floorboard of my car right in front of the driver's seat.
I have four sets of these, three in cars on one in our garage. I was tired of always having to search for my lights which may be under the seat, in the glove box or rolling around under the third row seats. I solved all that with these brackets. I have each mounted horizontally under the steering wheel column just forward of my knees. Once installed, the light is out of the way but instantly accessible.The fourth pair hold a Maglight in a vertical position next to the door in the garage so it is always in a fixed location.Smart solution and installation takes just minutes.
No digging-around necessary any more if you install a pair of these clips on any appropriate surface of your choosing in your vehicle's cabin.  The clips are designed to accomodate Maglite torches, but they fit any light with a similar tube circumference.  Your light will always be literally at-hand once firmly secured in these clips.  They're very easily installed, just be mindful about what you're screwing through and into.  Not for thin plastic surface mounts, it needs to be somewhat more sturdy.
yes great product for wherever you need to keep control of 4-6 cell 'D' type maglite in place great for car truck mounting. nice
These clips are perfect for the jeep mount of a maglight. This holds my 3 cell perfectly above my head. No issues
Even tho I didn't use on a Maglite this bracket worked just fine on the flashliight I did use it for.  Went up easy and holds well; on a boat no less.Dan
I have used these before, but  the price here was great. Mag has figured just the right tension on the clips to hold the flashlight secure, yet make it easy to grab often. I have used these for several years. I have tried others, but these are the best.
I bought this for my 2 D Cell LED Mag Lite and mounted it on the side of my driver's side seat in my '90 Bronco II and it keeps it in there real sturdy and was very easy to install. Debating on getting another one for my passenger's side. Very happy how inexpensive it is as well. Thanks again Amazon.
Handy clips to mount a D sized Mag-light.  I use them in the side saddle of my truck and it keeps the flashlight handy!
I have purchased this product twice now and it is the greatest thing for hanging flashlights in just those places you need one in emergencys. Next to the heater in the basement, in the kitchen pantry, near the garage door, bedroom closets, etc. No more need to try to find the one flashlight you forgot where you left it .. just hang one in each area. Fantastic product.
I didn't even know that this product existed until I ordered a MAGLITE flashlight and this item came up as a suggestion that I might like to purchase. Not sorry I did. Now my heavy flashlight hangs securely right where I want it.
These things do what their designed to do, couldn't be happier with the construction of them. Will purchase again when I find another spot for a MAGLITE.
Holds my maglite very securely in my Jeep, takes a bit of strength to get it out but I'd rather have it tight than loose. So far haven't experienced any problems and I've had it holding for a couple of months now.
worked great in motor home for quick access.. needed to have available on a moments notice.  great idea it was.
Fits the D-Cell Maglite perfectly.  I only used one of the brackets because they are relatively tight and really don't need both for a single light.  Now I have mounting for two lights if need be.
