I found the disk cumbersome to get around and locate exactly what you were looking for. Not sure I'd buy another.
Pretty good but shelves too close for most bottles to fit (height). Nice construction and easy to assemble, just wish it was a little more spread out.
The MD Smart tool is good for determining the grade of a slope where one is considering a road or trail.  It is not very useful as a level or clinometer as it has no way to tell when you are holding it on the specified grade.  For that purpose get an Abney or Clinometer.It is fast and has a hold setting that retains the setting.The on off switch is not protected so it is easy to turn the thing on when you do not want it turned on, thereby burning batteries. Some sort of lock mechanism or a harder to turn on switch would help this situation.Portland Or
My new red suspenders work very well.  Since putting them on, my pants have not fallen down...they really work as advertised.
The price of these Red Rooster suspenders was  reasonable.  I loved them so much I wear them everywhere I go, weather its the Olive Garden or Jim's catfish shack, Walmart or a doctors office.  Let me tell I really stand out as the only man wearing suspenders and bright red at that.  One drawback I've noticed, sometimes they catch hold of projections.
Suspenders were a gift. Person said they didn't have much give to them & were a bit uncomfortable.
I should have paid more attention to the description of the materials.  The suspenders have no elastic/stretch in them. However, the clips are large and make a very secure attachment.
These suspenders are very sturdy. Just what my husband wanted until he put them on and then he couldn't adjust the straps. He tried very hard to adjust the straps because he really liked them but was unsuccessful. I hope that the company can look into this matter.. We received the suspenders in Blue, black & red and unfortunately all three had the same problem. The straps couldn't be adjusted.
these are definitely heavy duty suspenders.  the elastic is in the back.  in the front are 2 stiff straps.  they are a little tricky getting them on. but, they do hold up the pants.
The suspenders are good quality.I should have looked closer at description, as only one side,the back, is flexible, I have never purchased suspenders before and thought the straps were flexible on both sides.
I really liked these at first. The straps are heavy duty, and the suspenders worked well. However within a couple of months of regular use, the clips bent and they would not stay attached to my pants. I have bent them back a couple of times, but the metal keeps getting weaker. For such an otherwise well built product, the clips are cheap and poorly designed. I recommend strongly against buying them.Well I did just look at the price, and for $9 it is probably worth monkeying around with the clips and getting them to work somehow, or perhaps re-placing them with some other system. The straps are good and sturdy and well worth the cheap price.
Pretty cheaply made- looks like it was (poorly and unevenly) spray coated. And the HUGE retail label/sticker on it was so difficult to remove. Luckily I was only using these on the ground, filled with sand and golf balls for a party- but if you have them in closer view, you may want to upgrade to a better product.
These little 4 quart galvanized pails are okay. They are made in Mexico and the quality is fair. The main quality problem is the finish of the zinc dip. There were several runs and other minor issues.We use them for outdoor planters for potted plants so these will work fine.The biggest problem was the two or three large labels stuck to the outside of the buckets. The labels said "Use for intended purpose only." I guess they mean don't wear them on your head as a hat. Don't sit on them and don't cook in them. But the labels were in multiple languages. Okay!Have you ever tried to remove a label off galvanized metal? After pealing, scraping and using Xylene for an hour or two, most of the sticky residue came off. I don't know about you, but I really don't have a couple of hours to remove gummy residue from a $10 bucket. (update: Now I heat the labels with my heat gun, peal them right off and then remove the residue with mineral spirits. Much faster, but I still shouldn't have to do this.)None of this is Amazon's fault. But all companies buying products should insist that any labels be easy to remove. What a pain. The imported items are the worst. China, Mexico, India and other countries apparently only have one type of permanent super sticky glue for labels.Amazon shipped the 5 4qt buckets and 3 2qt buckets that I ordered in two separate shipments. The first one came in a giant box with each of four buckets spaced equi-distance apart. The second shipment came in a small box with the four buckets stacked one inside of the other. Maybe the first batch was shipped by a new employee.These are okay buckets of fair quality and should work as planters after spending considerable labor to remove the sticky goo from the sides.I'm not sure why they didn't put the labels on the bottom of the buckets. That's what they did on the 2qt ones. I guess 4qt pails have all that appealing open space around the middle.
I got this for my husband as part of a gift set I made using it as a beer bucket. My only real complaint was the sticks stuck to the outside of it... I could never fully get them off! i tried but they were stuck and tore and left the gross residue and shredded. Besides that I was great though you get pretty much what you pay for.
This may seem picky, but I can't think of a single reason why the mounting screws for left vs right handles are different. Most of your guests won't even notice, but you will... on the left handle the screws are at the surface of the mounting flange, but on the right handle they are inset so that a dark ring shows around them. I wrote the seller about this before ordering, because the pictures ARE different, but got no reply. Sorry if I sound like a perfectionist.
works fine, didnt realize this one didnt have a magnet so I  ended up gluing the magnet back into the old one and use this as an extra. may add magnets to this one as well
It would work OK but it is very hard to see the numbers or where exactly the arrow is pointing while it is standing..
Functional item however it is fairly poor construction and is priced way too high for what you get. This item is made of plastic and I would stick with a standard more durable one if my job didn't require the specific pitch in a photo. I have had 3 of these (work requires this brand) and the first two the needle kept sticking and wouldn't work after about 6 months of use and the last one seems to be getting sticky already. I wish there was a better product out there.
This level tool does not indicate a true zero degrees on a level surface.  If you need a true level tool buy a bubble level and test it before leaving the store.This Pitch locator is acceptable for my purpose.  I use it when making photographs of paintings where I need the slope angle of the painting to match the slope angle of camera's sensor.  The readings need to be the same and the fact that the tool does give a true zero is not significant in this usage.
I should have gone a little more high tech on this purchase.  The newer laser levelers have come a long way and maybe would have been a better option for me.  This particular one is accurate but the numbers are hard to read and of course the range is limited to what is on the dial, and you have to read it on the dial itself.  The laser ones shoot the pointer out to whever you want - even far away - so that can be a huge convenience especially if you are working with someone else who is doing the hammering.But then again, low tech is sometimes nice because it is very reliable and there are no batteries to fail. You can't really agrue with the price so what the heck.  I have already overanalyzed this to death....
This thing is accurate, not very durable. Later I found better products at my local hardware store for the same price. I thought I was getting a deal...prices on these measuring devices has dropped. Check out your hardware store or Home Depot.
glossy, feels kind of cheap but seems to hold up, would prefer a matte black, great for D-cell maglites, i personally use these brackets in my trucks, you never know when you'll need a flashlight so keeping it handy for safety is good.
After buying these as a replacement for an old pair I had that broke a while ago. I was very skeptical due to the bad reviews. But I was sick of my flashlight not being available at the garage door where I originally placed the clips. So I plunked down my money, re-installed the brackets and now very carefully (knowing how they will break again) put my maglite in place and remove just as carefully. Buyer beware but still a useful tool.
Great bracket, easy to install, perfect for the D-Cell flashlight because it is made especially for it.  The only problem; they break!  I have several flashlights installed around the house for emergencies and ease of use, and I have to replace a bracket at least every 6 months.  It is the natural flexing that caused a break in the same place every time.
Brittle plastic, second set I had to buy. For the money I guess it's okay. They break pretty easy in the winter time.
Sturdy construction.Strong clamps, the metal parts may scratch the body of the flashlight if not carefully pulled.Should be better if made of plastics, to avoid scratches or body injury.
It will do the job but isn't very sturdy for the heavy maglight.  I would find something else, to be honest I find costco flashlights better then the maglight too.  The only good thing about Maglight is you can hit somebody over the head if you need to defend youself.
Good thing these are cheap, because im on my 3rd one. I only use one bracket, so I just bought my second set because theyve all broke. If you use your light a lot....just be carefull pulling your light out.
I bought this and put it on my flashlight  to try it out. When I took it off to install, both the brackets broke. Sadly, the QuickFist clamps don't fit my application. So I just ordered anther set.
My brackets also broke the first time taking light out.  Both at same time.  I'm suspecting the horizontal rib , built into the mold may not be allowing sufficient flex it needs.  I've since bought another set.  This time though, I think I'm going to relieve out some or most of the side rib to allow some give.  I would also agree with another reviewer who stated the importance of making the alignment as straight as possible, that makes good sense.  Regardless MagLite Instrument needs to do some mods of their own.
It's good flashlight, but not is the better led. You can find flashlights with Cree XM-L T6 with more power.
These brackets are great for a person like me who likes to know where the little things in life are all the time -- like a flashlight. I bought two of these, one that's mounted in the laundry room and one on the wall in the garage.Pros: The brackets fit my 4-D and 2-D Mag Lites very well, holds them in place snugly, and gives me a nice looking mount that I can count on. I will never, ever have to worry about the brackets just dropping the flashlight -- but that leads me to the problem:Cons: The hardware. These mounts come with small screws that are trying to be everything to everyone. They're short enough that if you really want to drywall mount you can install a drywall anchor and screw into that, but they're not big enough to support the job they need to do. These clips are strong, and hold the flashlight TIGHT. Needless to say, you have to pull quite hard, or press one hand against the bracket to keep pressure on it while removing the light. I wanted to be able to pull it off with one hand, and tore the top bracket right off the wall with the anchor. A bit of fixing later, I re-installed the brackets with 2 1/2 inch deck screws into a stud and these work like a charm.Bottom line: Buy these if you're looking for a great bracket mount, but pitch the hardware that comes with it. Install into a stud, and you'll be good to go.
Always know where your flashlight is with these handy clips.  Works on most "D" cell flashlights in either the horizontal or vertical position.  One clip is sufficient for a 2-cell flashlight.  I keep one one the wall by the garage door so I always know where the flashlight is.  It would work equally well in a car, truck, boat, or camper.  I am thinking about mounting one on my bike handlebars :)
This product is exactly what the description states.  The clips are not extremely strong, but will get the job done under normal use.  Probably the best option for mounting a maglite to a surface.
I would purchase these again for mounting the flashlight.  The are fairly solid and holds the flashlight well.  I would recommend to anyone.
I bought these to replace one that broke, so now I have an extra for later. They seem to be brittle and break with little use.
I have these all over the place and like them a lot.  Makes it so much easier to keep track of where the flashlights are.  The problem is they are very brittle and easy to break, so be sure you get them installed properly and be careful when inserting or removing the flashlight.  Would have been nice if they would have used a more flexible plastic.  But at this price, just keep a couple extras handy.
This may seem picky, but I can't think of a single reason why the mounting screws for left vs right handles are different.  Most of your guests won't even notice, but you will... on the left handle the screws are at the surface of the mounting flange, but on the right handle they are inset so that a dark ring shows around them.  I wrote the seller about this before ordering, because the pictures ARE different, but got no reply.  Sorry if I sound like a perfectionist
If you have the old style 4 prong phone outlets scattered around your home and want to use newer phones with modular jacks, this is the fastest way to go. Just plug in the modular plug from the new phone into this adapter and then plug the adapter into the old outlet. Simple and easy to make and way over priced. But cheaper than having a phone expert install a newer modular jack where there was an older 4 prong.
I needed this to plane down a door that was not fitting well.  Wasn't strong enough on the surfaces I tried.  I may have just bought the wrong tool for the job.
It's a razor blade on a plane body. I use it to getting 1" board's cross cuts mostly true and then finish with a sander or file, it's not smooth, the blade doesn't seem to want to stay parallel but it's faster than a sander/file and i've got  it to be mostly accurate. buying it again would be a tough decision since there is a dremel attachment that might fit my needs better.
I guess for the price it's okay but I'm surprised Stanley put their name on it.  If you're buying it for balsa wood you'll be happy.
I suspect that this plane works OK (I was able to shave off little slivers from my project).  The problem is, there are no instructions whatsoever.  I've never used a plane in my life, so I had no idea how exactly to adjust it, or really, how exactly to use it.  There's plenty of room on the packaging for simple directions, I wish Stanley would have added them.
This has got to be the smallest plane I've ever used.  It does a good job on cabinet door edges, which is why I bought it, and I'm sure it would be just right for fine shaping of woodcrafts and such. Just don't expect to do any heavy work with it.  And unless you have small hands it'll become uncomfortable to hold onto for very long.  It's good to have around, though, for those quick, small jobs.
Hey it works, but you may be a bit surprised by the size when you actually get a hold of it. It's nice they do make these so small, as there is a need for it.  Used to adjust some doors around the house and didn't want to use a full size. Smaller than I needed to do the job quickly, but worked with more time than I wanted to spend.
I am surprised at how small this is. And it will be very helpful if a long metal stick is provided to drive this tiny plane instead of thumbs!
It is, what it is. A small trim plane with changeable blade. Sturdy, and made by Stanley.I masked off the bottom & sides, took out the blade, and sprayed some yellow paint inside (then put the blade back, obviously) to make it more visible in my tool bag. If it came like that I would give 5 stars.My coworkers are all wicked jealous of my yellow trim plane ;)
While I've used this little plane several times (mostly in fine adjustments to tennons) after each use I have a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.  It is difficult to get the blade dead square.  Also, its difficult to handle doe to the size.  Three stars because the investment is about the same as your morning coffee and bagle.
I like the twist off end.  The 48" level fits in it well.  Its thin plastic so it won't protect against everything but much better than not having any protection at all.  And the price was great.  maybe a thicker plastic would be better but I would buy it again for the price.
It's sandpaper, it's extra fine.  Just go to Lowe's or Home Depot, you'll find cheaper stuff there, that'll do the job just as good if not better...
Three stars only because of the cost.  I bought 15 sheets of assorted sandpaper at a dollar store for a dollar, cut to size and glued them onto the original pads with Tacky Glue.  They last as long or longer than the original grit.  I've not yet reached a limit as to how many times this can be done.
I bought a few of these for different applications: knife drawer, refrigerator, holding a screen to the wall.  This product only worked on the knife drawer.  If you have two smooth, flat surfaces that are almost touching, it'll work fine.  Otherwise, you'll need another product.
bought this to replace one that broke. I have had another pair for a while before they broke. Not sure while this one failed so soon.
I am not sure if I really have enough to say about this product to make a twenty word review. I have only used one of the latches so far. What I did find ( so far at least ) is this--- the adhesive that is supposed to attach the latches is not good enough. I finally used epoxy adhesiveto fasten them in place. Time will tell if they last after continued use.
Until my 16 month-old daughter figured out how to open them.I had one on each drawer in my kitchen, and on my dishwasher door. They worked well for about a month and a half, until I saw my toddler run out of the kitchen holding a dirty butter knife out of the dishwasher. I grabbed it, put it away, and shut and locked the door only to watch her little fingers open the lock and open the dishwasher door again. Back to the drawing board for this Mom!
We put this on to keep our 1 1/2 year old out of the fridge.  It worked great - until we forgot about it and pulled the fridge open.  It will break if an adult uses a small amount of effort.  So now we have it on the fridge...and its broken.
I gave this product 3 stars because some of them seem to last while others do not stick at all :-(  It is frustrating.  I have even tried to super glue the latches onto the areas where needed. The super glue does not even hold them on.  Oh well, I will keep trying to find a better safety latch.
Def is pretty secure, but a clever toddler can eventually figure out how to open it. Our's figured it out within a week or so. Putting it up higher where he couldn't reach helped, but made it awkward for us to open it. Good buy for when the kiddos are still on the small side.
The gloves I purchased seemed to run a small according to gloves I've purchased locally. Hopeful they will stretch so that they will be easier to work in.
The gloves are sold as XXL but they are the same size as the XL Lamont I already have. Going to keep they anyway because I cannot find any gloves bigger.
Call them what you want... they're leather, they're made by Wells Lamont but these are NOT XXL gloves. Fingers are nice and long provided you have the hands of a girl. The width of the glove is the same as their XL. The only difference is the length of the fingers. Still cannot get my gorilla hands in or out of the gloves easily or comfortably.Alas, my search continues.
I have bought Wells Lamont for years.  They make a quality product.  These gloves are well made, but they are too tight on my big paws, I had to go to XXXL gloves to fit me and that took me to another manufacturer.
Nice gloves but the sizing is crazy. x large were too tight and XX large were too big. Won't ever buy gloves on line again.
I don't know what it is with Brita, but my batteries in the faucet die after a year. They also have to send me replacements. I hope they fix this but they haven't in 7 years....
I bought these for work.  4-pack for $75.  First 2 filters were great.  And that took me OUTSIDE THE LIMITS of the money-back guarantee, which is only 30 days.  The 3rd filter was CRAP CRAP CRAP.  It dribbled...it sprayed in all directions...we started to get yelled at by boss for &#34;hanging out in the kitchen&#34; because you had to hold the top of your water bottle against the Brita opening to get any fluid into your bottle, couldnt just turn on tap & actually have it fill.  I threw that one out within a couple weeks.  Put in the last filter - it was great like the others.  Wanted to be reimbursed or replacement for the bad 3rd one.  $75 is ALOT of money & we get cheated out of one.  The seller COMPLETELY IGNORED MY EMAILS.  Then Amazon said I am not eligible for any kind of refund/replacement because I had waited too long.  There was no way I could know that the THIRD FILTER out of 4 was bad - we didnt even try the 3rd filter till months after the purchase!  I am disappointed in this seller - if I do buy the filters this way again, I will NOT use this seller.  3 out of 4 filters OK, so I cant give zero stars for product.  I do feel ZERO stars is fair rating for seller totally blowing me off.
The filters appear to be fine, but the box came without seal and without instructions, despite wording on the outside that instructions were included. Not that it is difficult to replace the filters, but it made me wonder about the exact provenance of this set. I can only hope that it is actually new.
I bought these filters mid-March, and already the little red light is flashing and it's only been 6 1/2 months for the two filters - and they say they should last about 4 months each. We also use in conjunction with the faucet system, a Brita Pitcher, so they should last a LOT longer than 4 months! Going to check on another system...
I've had my Brita tap filter for quite some time, and had a lot of filters on hand, but never had any problem with any of them.  With this package, there must have been a fluke because the first filter I tried to install wouldn't click in properly.  Whenever I turned the filter on, the filter itself popped off and water was spewing everywhere.  I tried the second filter and it worked just fine, so I am returning the defective filter.  I would return both, but I already threw out the old filter, and would have no filter on the faucet.  THe one that's on there works just fine and puts out good, clean, sweet tasting water.  Except for the one defective filter, I'd have given this five stars.
Easily enough to replace.seem to filter like the replaced ones.price is fair.will continue to purchase others.Easily get dirty & sometimes black mold .
The first filter we purchased lasted 3 days and went red. We called the company and they replaced it but we waited almost 8 weeks! The second filter lasted a little over 6 weeks. We just got another and are going to see what the life of this one is before we buy any more. Price thru Amazon is excellent. Performance is &#34;iffy&#34;, it seems to have issues with battery longevity.
i bought these for a friend as a gift. I am not so sure this is a very good system, the filters really expensive and they don't last very long. Your tap water must be toxic to use these. But this won't help the people in up state New York with methane contaminated wells from fracking.
Works as intended, one thing I don't like about the brita faucet version is that our sink is fairly shallow so the water when using the filter mode comes out with a bit of force causing splashing.
This filter is lightweight, so it does not put stress on your faucet head.  The water seems to taste better, and has not killed the hermit crabs, so it must be doing something.The filter read "time to replace", after just six days of use, so we were initially aghast at the expense.  I called Brita, and the company stated that the filter normally lasts for about 100 gallons ("four months") of water, so that something must be wrong with the reading device.  The company sent out a free replacement of the base unit that attaches to the faucet, without any other questions.However, that "estimate" of filter life, is for individuals and never-home-DINKS; not families.  A family, actually using the faucet all day long, will find a filter-life of about four weeks.  Given the convenience, is probably worth the expense.  Hard to say.The instructions say to use only with cold water.  Many of us do not like the taste of freezing cold water, AND we have to heat the water for the hermit crabs, so that is a hassle.  Seems like it might be fine with room-temperature water running through it.Brita just sent us an email - very political in nature, and offensive.  Beware.Weeks later:  Just bought a replacement filter, which was also faulty.  Definitely quality control issues with Brita.  Also - this is a Canadian deal, so when screwing on to your faucet, remember to do the reverse of what is typical for American products.  (Screw this in by turning left.  Loosen by turning right.)
Did not use the filters yet. Hope they are OK. The previous Brita filters do not last very long, need replacements rather often.
We have ordered the Brita on tap replacement Filters twice and each time one of the filters has already indicated that it is ready to change before it is even used.  We love the filter but shouldn't both  filter replaements be usable?  Quality control is not the best.
My first filter that came with the unit was terrible.  At first the taste was excellent, however. it only lasted for 2 to 3 weeks before the tap water taste came back.  The 2nd filter I installed has been much better although I don't feel the length of time Brita says these filters last is anywhere near that result.
We've been using these Brita tap filters for a few years and appreciate the way they filter out the strong mineral taste in our well water.In past purchases these two filters have been individually packaged (guaranteeing freshness and protection) within the carton. In this last package I received (thru amazon), the filters were not individually wrapped, and just rolling around in the carton. I hesitate to use them, wondering if they've been compromised. If this is the packaging for the future, I will probably buy them at local retailers where I can be confident that they are individually sealed, or move the the &#34;Pur&#34; brand filter instead.
We purchased these on Amazon instead of at local retail stores (which cost more). Oddly enough, the light burned out shortly after installation. We contacted Brita and were told the light isn't necessary for the cartridge to function, just to change it in about 4 months.
is that they are either really really old or they are not from Brita direct.  I have ordered 3 of these now and within 45 days, they turn to red.  In this batch, when I opened the first one, the package was filled with carbon and the BRITA filter itself was all covered in gray matter as well.  I cleaned and soaked the filter, but I am not holding out to much hope on this order either.On the plus side, I do love the filtration system itself.  I just wonder if I have to buy a new one everytime now as the filter replacements just are not satisfactory at all.
After using Pur faucet-mounted water filters for years, and having to replace them every year or two due to cracks or leaks, I finally tried Brita.  Much better design!  Easier to replace, no leaks, no cracks, same water quality.  And through Amazon, better price.UPDATE:A year later--no problems so far.  One quirk of the Brita, however, is that when it's in filtering mode the stream of water is quite narrow, and forceful, so it can easily bounce off whatever it's hitting and spray around.  Filling ice cube trays, for example, requires a little practice to actually have the water stay in the compartments instead of spraying everywhere else.  But really, this is nitpicking.  Still prefer it to Pur.  And it also takes up a little less space under the faucet.SECOND UPDATE:After a year and a half, I accidentally broke the unit by shaking the water out of some greens over the sink and hitting it.  Didn't take much, I'm afraid.  But I'm going to replace it with the same unit.  The reviews of the unit itself are filled with angry one-stars complaining the thing pops off the sink, but those are all for FAUCETS THREADED ON THE INSIDE.  Mine is not, and I've never had a problem.  (Some reviews like the Culligan.  I haven't tried it, but it has no indicator telling you when to change filters.  That seems like a significant feature to me--I don't want to have to keep track of when I last replaced it, and be constantly either throwing away filters with use left on them or drinking unfiltered water for some unknown period of time.)THIRD UPDATE:My replacement unit didn't last very long.  Even with a new filter, the indicator light was always red, the water didn't taste filtered, and I suspect the water just wasn't being routed through the filter at all.  I'm going to try the Culligan.
The Brita tap filter is a very good product in the sense that the water loses the chlorine taste and actually gain a smooth feeling, just like fresh mountain water. On the other hand, these filters have a very short lifespan. I changed the system for Pur. So far it looks like it will last longer.
I bought this kit to do some repairs on my boat cover, well they are cheap and did't really work to good, I suppose if you use them on some other type of material they would be fine, the shaft when you try to assemble the snap fastener just kind of compressed instead of spreading out and down thus making the shaft even shorter.
Snaps are for a heavy fabric.  Tried it on a thin fabric and just tore it apart when trying to separate the snaps. After a somewhat labor intensive installation, I was disappointed to ruin the clothing.
I purchased this kit and the 6 snap refill kit for a small project (I needed 10).After getting about five snaps on, I noticed the tool was deforming.  Instead of neatly flaring the insert, it was smashing it.  The more I did, the worse the tool got.I was able to finish the 10 snaps, but I wouldnt use this tool for many more.If you want something you can use over and over, spend more money and get something that can take repeated use.  If, like me, you wanted something cheap that you can use for one project, this kit is for you.  Just don't expect to get more than ~10 snaps out of the tool.
If you're not going to put a lot of clips, it's perfect, but if you are, it's a little bit annoying.
it's a snap. what more did you want me to say? that it changed my life?wow, this gets a little annoying
One of my pet peeves is when basic specifications are missing from product descriptions.Looking elsewhere on the net, I find that these are for 3/8", 1/2", 3/4" and 1" internal diameter applications.
The part of the tool that extends past the black movable piece is long.  In my case, this length prevented me from successfully using the tool to remove a piece of broken pipe.  The end was too long and didn't allow the tool to get far enough inside of the pipe to engage it.
This lathe isn't nearly as bad as the other reviewer says. I've had one for a couple years and have had no such problems. It is typical of the current generation of Chinese made power tools. Quite a bit of functionality for the money, but with some rough edges. This monster (for a home shop) costs less in constant dollars than an old Craftsman metal lathe did and could spin one of those with it's 4 jaw chuck.
They are made in America and that's why I bought them but the quality if just so-so. They work, though!
These are very small. Very, very, very small. I'm 5'11 and pretty skinny and they are WAAAAAY too short.I don't understand how someone who was 6 ft fit into these. i'm assuming they're lying. Because these are just way too small.Other than that well made, nice material.returning them immediately.
As I mentioned in the title, I have very mixed feelings about these suspenders.  In some ways they are the best suspenders I've ever seen.  They aren't what I'd call pretty, though.  They have a super-strong, robust design.  There is no way they would let go of your pants, even if a shark was pulling them off you or something.  I really like that they are only stretchy in the back and I like the adjustment mechanism.  I wouldn't wear them in any circumstance in which people might see them, though.Things I like==============================* The clasps that attach to your pants are hard-core.  Lots of suspenders have plastic parts in there that can break or they have teeth that can mar your pants.  These are just big strong clips.  Very secure.* I like that it attaches in two places in the back.  That mitigates suspender-wedgie.* The straps between the leather connection and the back of your pants stretch, which is good when you sit.  The other strap does not.  That's very nice.  Many suspenders are stretchy the whole way and as a result, they are a lot more susceptible to damage and they never fit right.  Also these suspenders will not snap even if someone tries to snap you.  The front strap is heavy-duty nylon.  It reminds me of a seatbelt, but it's a heavier weave.* The color is profoundly black.  It isn't going to fade.* The wideness of the straps distributes the weight of the pants across your shoulders and enhances comfort.* The tightening mechanism is similar to that of a seatbelt.  It doesn't harm the fabric, it's secure, and it adjusts easily.  So many suspenders have a little clip with teeth that bites into the strap and causes permanent damage if you adjust it a few times.  Very refreshing to use these.Things I don't like=====================* Both straps are too wide to be attractive on my frame.  I'm 5'8&#34; and medium build.  If I were 6'3&#34; lumberjack with a generous belly, these would maybe look good (over work clothes).  Though I would tend to get brown suspenders in that case.* The little metal adjustment things work real well, but they are quite large and draw too much attention.  Maybe if they were black it would better.  They don't have a lot of style.* The weave of the front straps is quite rough.  I would have preferred seatbelt material for sure.Anyway, these are great suspenders in some sense.  Interesting design elements.  Ultimately, I wanted to use them to hold up my suit pants, though, and they aren't really formal or attractive enough to be optimal for that purpose.  At the same time, I really like how well they work and how long I expect them to last.  As long as I keep my suit coat on they are great.  I wouldn't take it off in front of people whose opinions matter, though.I'm not sure exactly who these were marketed to.  They really don't seem formal to me, but they don't seem the right color for work clothes.  I think this company could use some of those design elements to make two different kinds of suspenders (formal and work) that would both be better than this.I'm not returning these, though.  I like them well enough to keep using.
One size fits all doesn't apply here. I am 5'11&#34; and I had to open adjustment all the way and they're still very tight
I didn't realize these were work suspenders, since it didn't say in the title. They aren't for casual wear with dress pants, they are for holding tools and made out of sturdy material. For that purpose, I'm sure they're fine!
I would like clear instructions on how to deal with the clips.  On regular blue jeans band after usage measured in hours they slipped.  Does the belt loop need clipped with double thickness?  Note metal appears solid and strong.  The teeth meet the back plate.  Due to the under bite for the lower jaw, maybe a grip surface or grooves in the lower jaw will resolve the issue.  The jeans maybe sliding out due to the smooth lower surface.
I have worn these for about a month now.  This is mostly a strap system, much like what one uses to cinch down a load.  There are two parts to the straps.  The main (front) straps are simply solid, strong straps.  The back straps (below the crossbar) are made of a stretch fabric.  Thus, there is some &#34;give&#34; in the tension one chooses to apply to the length of the straps one uses.  But, that tension adjustment is not as great in a pair of suspenders that has the stretch fabric through the whole strap.  This means the suspenders are not as comfortable as some with the full stretch fabric system.For the price, I think this is a good pair of suspenders to wear on labor jobs, where one might tend to get paint on the suspenders, or otherwise have spots appear that one would not want to wear for more dressy affairs.  If maximum comfort is your desire, then a higher priced product may work better for you.
Have to return them just not quite long enough. I'm about 6-3 or 6-4.but if thay where to fit. I think thay would prouble out live me? They seem to be made with good strong matial.
Nice style and well made but they didn't fit the person I bought them for. if you have a "big belly......you need longer ones.
These suspenders are VERY heavy duty in both strength and weight. I purchased them for an elderly gentlemen so they may be a bit overkill. However, the price was very reasonable and they will certainly do the job.
Doesn't work for bigger people, like myself and is primarily for holding up a tool belt. Don't buy if you are over 6 feet tall.
Good quality suspenders however the adjustment of the straps is very tedious. After a half hour struggling with it, I finally moved the strap, with some force, however it just slipped out of its ring. Trying to insert it back into the ring was even worse of a struggle.
The suspenders are ok and the material is very good. The color match with everything and  the suspenders are very stronger.
Clips will detach from your belt as easy as any other brand when your load up with nails, tools and other hardware.
The product is ok, but the clips that fasten the suspenders to the trousers have sharp edges with scratch and over time I'm sure would cut into my leather automobile seats.  The price was good, but I had buy a pair locally where I could feel the clamps for sharp edges.
At the longest adjustment they are just barely long enough...not designed for people six feet tall. The grips are poorly designed; they slip up and sometimes come loose. Otherwise, suspenders are suspenders...not much to say about them.
The ad talks about the heavy duty snaps but I have to fold over the waistband of my jeans to get a double thickness for the snaps to grab.  Even at that, occasionally a random one will pop loose.  And I don't have a big gut that these suspenders have fight against.  They were a bargain, but I will try a different brand next time.
These are not stretchy. I could not get used to it, so I'm going back to my old kind. But if you want non-stretchy suspenders, these seem very tough, durable, and all the other things I bought them for. They're just not stretchy.I wanted stretchy. :-(
Buyer beware. The item pictured may NOT be what you get. The pictures on the discription clearly show both the shields covering the compound leverage gears, and the "piano style" locks(not the single plate lock). These features indicate that this should be the NEW model.The older model had the compound leverage gears exposed(vulnerable to being bent if dropped) and the single plate lock which had signifigant play up and down (DO NOT BUY THE OLD MODEL). I emailed amazon and requested someone to CONFIRM it was the new model. I received an email that it WAS, but apon arrival mine had the single plate lock.I didn't return it right away because it did have the compound leverage shields, but I could NOT get over the amount of play in the other tools so I returned it. I plan on ordering the B61-N hoping it has BOTH of the features Im looking for. I still rated it a 3 because it had 1 of the features, and if you can get over the play while the tools are locked you'll be ok. I couldn't but thats just me.Aside from the issues above, I think its a great tool overall. I do see some issues with the covering slowing down the tool deployment, and the fact that ALL tools are inside the tool itself. I did not test the tools much because at that point I had planned to return it, but its a hefty tool which is a good thing. I nice compliment to my Gerber suspension. Please use this as a data point. Thats all. Thank you for reading!
I wanted to replace my Gerber Multi-tool for personal reasons and remembering the SOG with it's compound leverage, decided to go ahead a purchase one.I'm afraid to admit I'm a little disappointed. Yes, it is easily opened with one hand, but it seems that's where the convenience ends. If you want to use any of the assorted tools, it's somewhat labor intensive. First, you have to open the tool cover, select the tool you want, then pull it into the open position.The problem I have stems from the fact that not all of the tools are easily opened individually. Pull one open and several of the others come out too. Depending on what tools come out, you have to be careful when pushing the unneeded tools back so as not to cut yourself. And no, I didn't, but it was close... ;-)I am way less than impressed with the locking mechanism. You have to make a conscious effort to ensure that any given tool is actually locked. Yes, another close call. By contrast, the tools on my Gerber are all easily accessible and are locked into position with (in my opinion) a better locking mechanism. In all it's years of use, I never had a single tool fail to lock automatically nor has the locking mechanism ever failed. Given, too, is the fact the with the Gerber, although it does take two hands to open a tool, I can unlock, put the tool away, retract the pliers and re-holster it single handedly.Now, I honestly bought this truly wanting to like it. To me, in the beginning, the SOG was the Holy Grail of multi-tools. It has no weaknesses in terms of the variety or quality of the tools. The saw is like, 3" of pure wickedness! It's simply their implementation I don't care for.I will get use out of this tool, to be sure. But I'm going to replace my aging Gerber... with another Gerber.Now, a quick word about the seller I went with. Tooltopia. (Website by the same name) I was quite happy with the transaction, and in fact, I will be purchasing my new Gerber from them... um... well, next payday...
When I received this dressing stone, I was reminded of the Stonehenge model from "This Is Spinal Tap" -- it is very small, about the size of a piece of Dentyne chewing gum. The image makes it look like it's the size of a brick and the product details say it's over 5 inches long, but you could hide it under a quarter.I don't know yet if it works for cleaning grinding bits -- I hope I get a chance to try it before I lose it.
This is a good knife. Durable, very sharp, and easy to use, but I didn't know it was gonna be this small. I guess its more my fault, but I was looking for something around 4 inches not one and a half. All around its good. Just know what your buying before you buy it.
It's light, small, compact.Blade stays in place.Good for cutting small things, only small things.
The pic is deceiving, This knife is less than 2&#34; long. Pricey for such a small knife, but a Gerber.  Gave it to my wife for her purse.  Read the measurements before purchase.
Want something to slit open the tape on cartons? This would be a fine pen knife for that. The cracks about it being ideal for hunting (in the Gerber-written promo section) just plain crack me up. Doing what? Field dressing mice?People are marveling that this thing is sharp.  Please don't ever buy a real knife because if you think this little guy comes out of the box "sharp" then you'll risk cutting yourself to ribbons if you ever handle one that actually IS sharp.Some time in the previous century, folder designers first invented the nail nick in blade backs to aid in opening the knife. Then they moved on to thumb studs, holes, funny little sticky out things; and, finally they gave us assisted openers.  Now, I know that this pen knife is almost laughably tiny to need assisted open, but couldn't Gerber move out of the 1800's and at least do the nail nick?  Nah.  I guess all the 5-star folks only open the knife once a month so they don't mind using two hands.Don't get me wrong. This is a better pen knife than those impossible-to-open things that Case et al sell. See ... I'm not all negative.
Nice little Gerber but too small to do much.  Sharpens easily but does not hold edge well.
this gerber knife is very thin and light weight, great everyday knife. the price is right, and holds a good edge.
Great light weight knife to carry around everyday to the office to open envelopes, boxing tape, etc.  Poor quality, but lightweight blade.  Emphasis on lightweight.March 29, 2013 - I have since bought five or six of these for my son and I....we lose them.  Other than getting on an airplane, this is in my pocket all the time.  Don't even notice it because it is light and small.
High quality but very small.  Nice to attach to a key ring.  Not much use for it that I can think of.  Be sure you check the size of it be buying.
These are not the Wells Lamont gloves I wanted.  Granted, the Ace Hardware store did email me that there was a substitution for an Ace-branded pair, and I decided to go for it, but these were not the ones advertised initially, so the ad needs to be changed.
The build quality isn't great, and I don't like that the belt loop is velcro on one end.  Its best quality is the price; If you're concerned about quality I'm sure there are better options out there from other vendors.
The new mini's are longer I guess because my new mini will not fit in the pouch if you want the flap closed, and well..... I'd like the flap to close. Anyways I jerry rigged it and it works. I gave it three stars because they don't let you know there is a difference but I'm sure it works good for what it is intended. Also the belt loop is a velcro strap that makes it handy to remove and apply without having to take off your belt.
The belt loop should be  more securely attached. There is only a single row of stitching to keep it attached. It can use a more robust stitching.The belt loop unattached after only 2 weeks, the stitches ripped apart.
The holster does indeed hold the mini maglite firmly and securely. My complaint is that the whole holster comes off my belt if I try to draw the flashlight with one hand. The back is velcro as well, and is kind of flimsy. It works, don't get me wrong. It just is not made to be a  strong flashlight holster.
vague description stating the product was a baby gate ,but it not a gate it is the gate insertion set. so i ended up ordering the wrong thing.
I used the installation kit so I wouldn't have to drill holes in my the post of my stair rail.  You can buy everything that comes in the kit at your local hardware store, but if you don't feel like wasting the time to go shop for the different pieces, then the kit is an easy solution.
My husband and I got this thinking that we needed to mount our gate to the wall. after fiddling with it for some time, we gave up on mounting it and used the tension bars instead. the product is a little confusing to assemble and the gates, for the most part, do not need to be mounted to the wall to work well.
First of all, the piece of wood is too thin. The screws that came with my gate are too long for the thickness of the wood, and my husband ended up screwing through the block and into the bannister. I suppose it's half my fault because I should have thought of that before buying it, but the gate I purchased (at the same time) to go with the installation kit did not mention the size of the screws, and I didn't think it would be an important issue.  So, if you buy this kit, BE SURE you know how long the screws are that come with your gate.Second, we pulled the zip tie as tightly as we possibly could, yet there is still a bit of movement.  Since we installed it at the bottom of the stairs I'm fine with it as is, but I would be concerned if it was at the top.Lastly, if you purchase this from KidCo, their shipping is terribly slow.
Good quality and sharp, but will not fit into some utility knives (Milwaukee, Gerber small knifes) and will lock in with difficulty in a Besey.Oddly packaged with the blades wrapped in thick paper stock, placed in the box with the sharp edges up. I prefer a dispenser pack to gingerly fishing one blade out of the box of many - all cutting edge up.
These dull faster than I am used to. Original box of 50 from home depot seems to last longer. Not a bad blade, but could last longer.
This product is great in theory- a universal, spring loaded socket wrench. It isn't all that durable though (and its a tool, which should be one of the most durable objects on this Earth). After simply playing around with it, the springs became loose and nearly unusable. Like I said, in theory.
Very handy socket.  Grips any bolt or nut, sure - but it's not very stable (you have to hold the socket straight against the nut) and this socket will also scratch the edges of every bolt you use it on.
For my first Gator Grip project I decided to tighten about a hundred of 5/16"x1.25" bolts to 175 inch-pounds. The bolt heads were damaged, some more than the others, making a regular socket hard to fit; this looked like a perfect Gator Grip application.I am happy to report that the Gator Grip worked as expected. However, about 1/3 way through the job I had my first failure - one of the pins got stuck and wouldn't come out unless I remove the Gator Grip and push the pin through the other side. That pin was getting stuck continuously, and by the time I was done with 96 bolts, several of the Gator Grip pins would have the same problem.Unfortunately, I have to testify that Gator Grip is a somewhat delicate device, and should not be used for anything but for light duty jobs.Update: I got my Gator Grip socket replaced under warranty. The process was fast and easy. Because of that I'd give this product one more star if I could.
I've had mine for several years.  I've been fairly please with it.  I do bear it some suspicion every time I grab it.  The bottom line is that I don't have a lot of confidence with it when I grab it.  Some tools are truly friends -you know dependable, working as advertised -while some are,....well, are suspicious and are they worth in the fold or in the trash heap?It will take some getting use to at first in centering the nut or bolt on the socket.  Also, you must completely cover the nut area with the pins otherwise it could easily slip off, and with the tool being top heavy, it is difficult to do.  I find my fingers firmly attached to the businiess end of the socket to prevent slippage and keeping it on the fastener.  The slippage can result in rounding like in one of my car's oil drain plug.  If you have it secure, it can stand some good torquing but because it is top-heavy, it becomes a learned skill.  For really small nuts or fasteners with small area, it becomes very difficult in keeping the socket engaged unless your are completely on top of it.  Large and tall ones maybe easier.I find it useful if I see that I might fasten scores and scores of nuts and bolts.  I use this to start them and the job can go by quickly with this tool.  After the structure is free standing, go back and torque them properly.I would wait for sales.  IMHO it is worth $10 and would not pay the close to $20 for it.
It might be a fine cutting Blade, for some things. I did not like the way it cut, compared to my original blade that came on my Millwalkie cold cut saw. I think it was a endurance 72 tooth blade.
I purchased this item to help me open up bottles and jars because I have severe arthritis in my hands.  This one doesn't work very well for smaller bottle caps.  Will see about getting another one.  It is great for many things around the house, not just bottle and jar tops.
The straps are not the strongest type.  There is a lot of stretch in them so I rather invest in something with a stronger feeling to it.  It works for easier jobs tho.  Don't expect it to loosen any rusted pipes.
I like them and they do what they're suppose to, but I was little disappoint when the rubber started tearing on the smaller wrench.  I figured these tools would be a bit sturdier, but the smaller wrench in this pack really hasn't held up as well as I expected.Hence the 3 star rating.
Snapped the strap on the small one doing a job that requires less 50 foot pounds torque.  Larger one has worked well although the rubber may slip on some surfaces.  At this price point they work okay for light jobs.
They do their job - however - just as I complained about the larger stronger one, these were no different and upon removing them from their packaging, the black and red plastic sticker fell off. The sticky stuff is there but they refuse to stay on so I trashed the plastic stickers. They work fine without them and they are not needed however if they are going to put them on they should use a stronger glue.
I got this set of wrenches to help me unscrew a device that was bigger than my channel locks.they really didn't work.The problem is that the off end of the strap has no way to &#34;lock off&#34; other than your hand gripping it, and it can slip. very frustrating. all that is needed to make them great is a small friction clip or &#34;buckle&#34;, much like the kind on a web belt, to make them much more effective.on a good note, I got it to work by attaching one wrench to the device, and used a small bit of duct tape wrapped around the handle and rubber bitter end of the &#34;wrench&#34; to hold it in place, then the same with the other.I shouldn't have to modify a tool just to get it to work properly.
I bought these to install some tub and shower fixtures. The ones I received look nothing like the picture (red handles instead of blue, and a bottle cap opener on the end of the handle).  They suited my needs, and allowed me to install some fixtures without scratching the finish. I will say that using a strap wrench is a bit different than a normal wrench. The handles were plastic and I wonder how durable they will prove to be.
The smaller wrench one broke the first time I used it. The larger one is working OK.. I was really only looking for the larger on.
I've never used the CRKT KISS, the knife upon which the ridge was apparently based, so I can't offer any comparison of the two. I bought the ridge to do small tasks, such as opening mail and cardboard boxes, etc. Its small size makes it an appropriate knife for such tasks, as it is light and thin, fitting unobtrusively when clipped in my pocket. It opens smoothly and locks firmly in place. Contrary to reviews complaining about the handle ergonomics, it is quite comfortable in light use. My main problem with the knife is in its single edge design. The single ground edge is supposed to allow the knife to be constructed with a single sided handle, leaving one edge of the blade exposed when it is closed. Rather than sitting on the handle and thereby sealing the edge, my ridge has a small gap between the blade and the handle. This hasn't proven to be a serious problem, as only the tip of the blade poses any sort of a snagging risk. I haven't cut myself or any pockets due to this issue, but only time will tell. I only paid 10 bucks for the knife new on eBay so its worth having for the kind of tasks I need it for.
Good cutter but wanted more width 110mm is less. They should have an option with higher width. Overall a good experince
I purchased a new SOG CrossCut to see how it would compare with my Leatherman Micra.There is no comparison. The SOG is inferior.The scissors became loose within a week of use, and now will not cut warm butter. The overall quality of the SOG CrossCut is mediocre at best in comparison to any Leatherman product.If you are going to use such a mini multitool often, and/or you are considering a larger multitool - avoid SOG. Buy a Leatherman.SOG customer service is a form of torture.Caveat Emptor!
One of the lights burned out the minute I put it in the flashlite!  Afraid to buy any more through the mail.
... I wish I had known that there are LED replacement lamps for MAGLITE's 3-cell C and D flashlights available as well. I found one of them recently at a store, and it works perfectly with my old, heavy-duty MAG flashlight (much brighter and better-quality beam as well).
I bought this after reading the reviews here on Amazon.  I haven't seen my problem mentioned.  Every once in awhile, the light won't go on.  I'll have to wait several seconds (haven't timed it, but it seems like forever) for it to start.  It acts like a balky fluorescent light.  With new batteries, it will light right up, but if that's the problem, the battery life is pretty bad.  I have this problem about every other night.When it works, I like it very much, but I'm wondering if mine is defective.
This light put out a nice, even light when it worked. It rarely worked reliably though. The other posters were very accurate when they said that the light would not come on immediately. Sometimes, it would take 5 mins or more before the fluorescent tube would light. I have had it for about a year now and although the light it produces is the best I have seen for reading in the dark, the light is also the most frustrating I have used. Really, it is the most expensive book light I have ever owned and also the least reliable. Now it  will only light if I position it so that it does not shine on the page. Useless. Steer clear of this one and go for an led model.
Over the last few years, I have bought three of these booklights.  I've bought three not because they break, but because they are faulty from the beginning and I keep hoping they will fix the problem.  I love the light when it is on, but all three that I have bought do not turn on consistently when you flip the switch.  I have all kinds of rituals where I flip the the switch back and forth multiple times, then push on the bulb.  Eventually it turns on (after 3-4 minutes) and is the best book light ever made.  Each year, I figure they must have fixed the glitch or they would no longer be selling, but the one I bought last week is still as unreliable as the others.  If they could make the switch work consistently, this would be the only book light anyone would ever want to buy.  The light it provides is amazing.  Even with the problems described above, this is still my booklight of choice and I have several others that have been given to me over the years that turn on as soon and I flip the switch.  It uses up batteries pretty fast, so buy the electrical adapter that Amazon recommends to save some money.
After reading so many glowing reviews for this light (pardon the pun) and having been generally dissapointed with all the other lights I've tried, I forked over what's a fair amount of money for a reading light and bought the Phorm.  The other reviews are right:  I find the batteries last much longer than other lights and the flourescent bulb itself casts more than enough light by which to read yet doesn't bleed over to the other side of the bed and keep others awake.  I haven't had any trouble with the clip on either hardcovers or paperbacks.The one problem I have is that there seems to be a problem with either the switch or the bulb, because it can take as many as twenty attempts to turn on sometimes.  I understand the delay in lighting (only a second or two because it's flourescent) but not turning on at all makes it kind of useless.  When it works, it's a five-star+ light; when it doesn't, it's very frustrating.
I do a lot of reading & own several book lights including the Light Wedge, Mighty Bright, and Phorm.  The Phorm book light has a unique style and it looks like a great product - unfortunately, it worked for the first 10 minutes I got it and then the light went out.  I changed the batteries, but it still didn't work.  I had to send it back to a service center - it took about 1 1/2 months to get it back.  It works now, but the down side to this light is that you can't adjust the light over the area that you're reading.  My favorite is still the Mighty Bright.
The plus,  Its a great booklight.  It lights up everything I need to see.  The switch is sticky which gets very frustrating.  i never know if it will go on, althought after hitting it or shaking the switch it does go on.
When my son was born I bought this booklight to read while he is asleep. Although i still use it as the light is very white and absolutely nonstrenuous to the eyes, its a struggle to start it. The power wiring seems to be loose and it sometimes takes couple of pattings to on the light.
I like the brightness that has designed which is good for reading at night.  However, I think it is little bit more heavier than I thought when it neeeds 4 AA batteries.  Also, the light sometimes needs to wait for 5 seconds to be on that makes me think that it is out of order.  Just need to be patience.
I purchased the Pivit ladder tool because I needed to put a ladder on a pitched roof to paint an adjacent wall. The cost was about $95 at a Sherwin paint store (NH). I thought it was over priced but it was the only option I had to paint this wall. I also figured it would also come in use later on for the stairs option. So far I have used it for one day on the roof. The product did work with respect to leveling a ladder on a sloped roof. It is not for the faint of heart though. It will work on roof pitches from 1/12 to 7/12 according to the packaging (hidden inside). Unfortunately the stairs option did not work for me. What is not shown on the outside of the product label is what stair dimension it will work on. My stairs are shorter and steeper than this device will handle. The company refers to stairs that don't work with its product as "radical". I tried it on two sets of stairs in my house and it did not fit either. So if you are buying this for the stairs option, try it on your stairs first before you rip the label off the box. Another note on the inside of the label is "Do not use the Pivit Ladder Tool under the foot of a step ladder" and do not use when air temperatures are above 95F. If you paint for a living this may be worth getting. For the home owner it is a specialty tool.
I find it a real convenience to have a little pocket utility knife like this one. One that opens quickly and easily, and can be used for opening packages and countless other little tasks.This particular knife is nice, but it has one really irritating flaw: The blade sometimes jams in such a way that it won't retract all the way; about 1/16" of the blade stays sticking out, and the only way to get it working right is to disassemble the knife and put it back together again. This disassembly requires a screwdriver, so if you're somewhere where a screwdriver isn't handy, you're stuck with a knife that has a bit of razor-sharp blade exposed. Not exactly a threat to life and limb, but definitely a threat to skin and pants-pocket-fabric.I wish theTactix Aluminum mini-knifewould become available on Amazon again. I used that knife for years (until I lost mine) without any problems, and it had a nicer look and feel than this Stanley knife too.
The extra blades inside sometimes prevent the blade from fully retracting. Also, it is a little too small for my hand.

I used it and it did pump water for the first 50 gallons. Then the rubber piston cup tore into pieces. Ordered a real replacement piece that is made of leather. So yeah if it came with a leather cup instead it would have gotten 5 stars.
The 2 pumps I purchased work well. The paint on the pumps is terrible. All I had to do is rub my hands on the pumps and the paint rubbed off. I removed all of that inferior paint from the 2 pumps that I purchased and repainted them with a good quality enamel paint. All is well now. Too bad they could not have done this before they sold them to me!
I really can't rate this hand pump because I have not received it yet. The order page said it was in stock but after the due date passed I sent a question to the seller through Maxhouey (or whatever) and the reply said it stated that it could take up to 6 weeks although I looked at the page again that I saved and I can only see that it states that it is in stock.If it doesn't show up by the 1st of June (6 weeks)then I will really be upset. I will think twice, in the future, about purchasing anything other than DVD's or books from Amazon.
I really wanted to like this. It worked well until the ball bearings started falling out of the casters, only after less than 3 months after I purchased it. I didn't realize the warranty is only for 3 months. I called them when the second caster had ball bearings falling out, (6 months after purchasing). They said there was nothing they could do since it is out of warranty, and this would be considered normal wear & tear. I in no way abused the chair and even tightened the bolts every now and then.How can this be normal wear & tear only after a few months of gentle use?
I wasted a lot of abrasive media (ticks me off) as no instructions came with it (at all).  Worst part is once I got it to where I think it should be, hey it doesn't work all that well (at all).  Northern could test one & print & include instructions (good company I've always had luck with prior anyway); not rocket science (to take care of your customers) to do & considering the amount probably sold from reviews on this.  All aside, I once had a 12v cleaner that I still cannot find to re-purchase that worked (and cheaper to use & buy) so much better.
I bought this one in particular because it had no cheap looking labeling, well it does when it shows up. It says &#34;CHICAGO ELECTRIC&#34;. I could have walked into harbor freight same day and paid $30 less since all these chassis are the same all the way up to shumacher for almost $200. Seems to work ok on the two batteries Ive tested up to 300a.Pete
My better half ordered this for her mom who has a John Deere GT235.  Evidently it was suppose to fit, but it doesn't.  Overall though it seems to be of decent quality, but we've never used it.
This is a well-built spinner. However, it does not fit well on my car (Camry). It would be more appropriate for steering wheels with smaller spokes.
Love the camo print so it doesn't stand out so much in our yard but it didn't take long for the eyelits to rip away. Tarp is still fine so I was going to just replace the eyelits (or whatever they are called) but it just wasn't worth it. Now we just tie the whole thing down because the tarp is fine.
The drafting head is really necessary to this board, but I could not locate it by model number or name, and I was not willing to search through their 4k plus data base.
I just got these as a gift and was a bit surprised at what was included.  I have not had a chance to use them yet since the bar clamps I do have will not fit in these.  The insert area is very small and looks like it will only fit the Bessey TGK series clamps.  The clamps are NOT included as was thought by the gift giver.  You need at least one large clamp and one small clamp as shown in the picture.  Also the Ball and Socket are not attached to each other so it may take a few tries and an extra set of hands to use.
Large, part metal, part plastic.  Inexpensive, not exceptionally well made, but functional with no glaring defects--words synonymous with "Made in China," which this was.  The base swivels 360 degrees if it wasn't clear from the advert.  Light quality is florescent and, as another reviewer put it, "industrial."  Adequate for a workbench.One unfortunate experience was a back order notice of two months after placing the order though Amazon.  In fairness to Grizzly, they did send an email asking if I wanted to cancel, and the order actually arrived about four weeks later, not eight.
I guess this lamp does the job after 6 months. It seems solid enough and no surprises so far. Make sure you look at the dimensions : It is BIG and the light is very "industrial" neon...
Well, I got this becauseI wanted a new guitar and thought building one from scratch would be a cool learning experience.  Well, it was.  But be warned.  It is not a project for the impatient. Let's start by saying that I must admit to being pretty impatient with things, and this project taught me patience- the hard way.  Also, I am not what anyone would confuse with "adept" in the woodcrafting arts.  I won't bore you with details, but here are some highlights:1) I stained the body and then had to apply the spray-on lacquer.  I got spray cans at the local Wal-Mart because I don't have an expensive compressor rig.  The first stuff I used was water-based.  HUGE mistake.  When wet sanding (as described in the directions) I got ugly results.  I ended up having to strip the entire thing back down to the wood, re-stain, and then begin again with a urethane-based product.  Much better.  But did I mention you need to keep the area dust-free?  I had a trash bag, an old shower curtain and ring- that was my "dust-free" environment.  Some dust does manage to get in, but with judicious sanding, I was able to make it as smooth as silk before all was over.2) Once the body was finished, I got the electronics in and the whole thing put together, only to find I'd not soldered something correctly, or that something wasn't making contact.  I took the strings off, and lo and behold, there was a TINY bit of insulation still left on the wire, and it was blocking a solid contact.  A quick resolder and I was back in business.3) But wait, there's more!  The pick guard cutout didn't exactly fit *around* the neck.  A small bit was still stuck under the neck, causing the strings to lay flat against the frets from about the 12th fret on down.  To compensate for this, I took a small allan wrench and jacked up the strings at the bridge.  But there was still some buzzing.  I tweaked the neck by adjusting the truss rod about 1/4 turn towards the treble side of the neck.  This seemed to do the trick.  All I had to do then was test the intonation, which is accomplished by adjusting the screws on the back side of the bridge.  I knew nothing of fixing the intonation on a guitar before I started.  YouTube has some great instructional videos (Gretsch Guitar was fantastic).All in all, it's a kit, people.  Yes, I could just as easily have bought one for the same price, but the deep wood-grain color stain, and the fact that I made it myself and the headstock bears my label, well, that's cool too.  It's only a guitar to practice on, but it looks cool on the wall in my music room.  If you've got the time and like a challenge, then these kits are what they are.  And you'll really learn to appreciate the reasons why companies who make fine guitars charge the prices they do for a decent guitar.  This kit isn't easy for the beginner, but you learn a great deal along the way.
Pollenex DM209CRX Hand Held Shower Head with 4 Settings, White and Chrome FinishI had to update my review after more use and research about this shower head and competing ones on the market.  While I still think this budget shower head is good for certain people, I have to note some more negatives that have come up over the past few months. If I could change the rating, I would now give this hand held showerhead 2 stars.First of all, when I wrote this review, this shower head was hovering in the $11-12 price range.  It had only negative reviews.  I knew this was a budget fixture, but at $12 you could buy two for any extra parts that might break and still be ahead.  So what happened?  Apparently as more sales came in, they started raising the price towards $16-17.  At the $16-17 price range, it starts to make sense to look at the shower heads by WaterpikWaterpik TRS 559 Hand-Held Five Mode Showerhead, Brushed Nickeland DeltaDelta Four-Spray Hand Shower, White #75400WHwhich are both better than this one and sell in the $18-24 range.Second I noted that it was not only the base which was at risk of breakage.  I knew it was made out of cheap plastic and might have a limited life span.Despite being relatively experienced with plumbing and installing this unit carefully, all of the threaded hose connectors have shown lateral (thread direction) cracking.  Now I know why so many people complained of leaks.  Mine still isn't leaking because like I said I installed very carefully.  But I expect these fittings don't have a maximum useful life of more than 2 years.  If you remove the head from the holder to use this as a hand held shower, it will probably not last you more than a year.  So like I said, still a good buy for an extra shower or utility closet when it's around $12, but not so much at $17.The product picture doesn't show you the key piece of this product that has led to most of the criticism. The "base," still the weakest link, connects to your water pipe and has a slot to hold the shower head and a valve to connect the hose. The base is the part that tends to break. Just don't push the head into it when returning it to the base. Simply set it in the base and it will last much longer.Alternatively, you can buy a replacement base made from stronger materials, though that's not a fun option. ** I've had a few asking me where to get this part.  While I haven't been able to find a sku online, I've taken this part to my local plumbing supply place and been offered replacements for $3-$6, depending on materials.The installation for this guy requires a LOT of care. Both the base and the hose connections can be hand tightened. I recommend NOT using wrench to snug the connections unless you are experienced with plumbing.  Novice users will almost always over-tighten. Hand tightening should be enough.  DO NOT over-tighten! This is what causes the hose connectors to crack and leak sooner.As for the adjustable flows, there are really 2 water streams worth using. There are 2 settings that yield pretty similar shower flows, and one that has a direct stream. The last one is quite misty and only useful for steaming.The bottom line is this. If you can be gentle and install this shower carefully, you can easily get 2 years of use out of it. If you have a high traffic shower used by the whole family, you will probably want to move up the food chain.Enjoy!
If you're looking for just an outlet tester, there are plenty that are much less expensive than this.  If you need a reliable way to ground a portable ESD mat, then this may be just what you need.  It does fill that function, which is why I bought it.  But it's still not cheap, considering how simple it is.
This product is not banned in Canada. It's on the shelves of every drug store here. I've been using it for the last couple of years. It works as it promises.At any rate, the formula has been changed recently. Among other alterations, it no longer contains lead acetate. I can't speak to the effectiveness of the new formulation yet.
I have many Bosch tools and use them on job sites so know they can take some serious abuse.  I was disappointed with these "soft" backing pads as they lost adhesion very quickly so that sanding discs would not stick and the pad edges shredded easily.  This was especially true with the new style sanding pads that are very light weight.If you are  doing light sanding or fine finishing you will probably find the soft pads to be fine.I will stick with the Bosch hard pads in future and get many more hours of good use from them.
This was a replacement product for one that did not work.  This one worked, but the instructions were vague as to how to have more than one receiver.  It said you can have more than one, but didn't tell you the specific sequence to add the second sensor.  We received it in a very short time and now that we have it all set up, we are happy with its performance.
The company gladly sent out a new one when I complained but the sensor has a hard time with cars but gets people fine. They said to adjust height and angle. I am still trying.
Been using this product for over three years. Purchased four sets. One went belly up last year.Sensitivity work better on the low setting if facing traffic even from a distance of over 150ft.More sensitive setting cause a lot of false trigger. Distance is limited. Can't seem to find info on the add on for amplifying the sound on the receiver. Mike
I have used this product for 3 years and it has worked great.  2-year battery life and a long transmission range.  I moved the transmitters to a different part of my property after a theft and caught the burglers the next time they came back.I bought a new transmitter (it was the Chamberlain brand) and now my transmitting distance is much less.  I need another one of the non-Chamberlain brand transmitters!
I recently purchased The Reporter Alert System for my driveway. It was easy to install and fairly simple to set up. The only issue I have is that the system doesn't always work. I have two of the extra sensors directed at my driveway but the system only alerts about half the time. Even after adjusting the sensitivity and locations (repeatedly) I cannot get consistent results. It's very frustrating. Overall still I gave this product 3 out of 5 stars because of price and it's simplicity.
Works great for detecting cars.  I'd endorse it as a great product if you have a long driveway and want to know if a car is coming.  Not nearly sensitive enough to detect people though.
They drain pretty quickly. I guess with batteries you get what you pay for. Besides that there's nothing really wrong with them.
It is the best shake light with no batteries I have used, but even after shaking it for a long time it is a very dim light.
First shipment of product was very frustrating, you have to put it together and none of the pieces fit together, wood flecked off easily.  After many phone calls and e-mails we got a replacement. It is very nice and quite functional. As directed we immediately shipped back the unwanted product, and while on vacation still got phone calls looking for it.  So, just make sure you keep up on it if you order this and you need to return it.  Otherwise it's a decent product.
Purchased these for cutting raw hide for my dog. These don't have the oomph for that.  Still looking for a use for them that regular scissors can't do...
This drill index is solidly made but not precision.  Bits can fit in holes up to 2 sizes smaller than the proper hole.  Which was disappointing because that was why I ordered it.  I have a fractional index they made 35 years ago and it is still solid and accurate, so this one should last.  I can't see the nano-type stamped on the bits anymore and was hoping this index would keep them sorted - no such luck.
It's a good vacuum cleaner but they could have done better.  First it came complete with dents, the factory makes no provision for damage prevention. The cord is OK but the clips used to wind it to the cleaner are such that they are difficult to get to and winding the cord is pointless so I just coil it up.  It is top heavy and tends to fall over when all the accessories are in the rear mounted basket. The wheels are cheap plastic and could be bigger.  Most of all, it is poswerful, but the suction is not all that great becasue of the 3" tubing creating a large volume of air that needs to be pushed through.  IF you reduce the size of the accessories it gives better performance but you lose the ability to suck in larger pieces of materials.  I expected better but it works well enough.  BUT, very poor qaulity control in my estimation.  Will go with another brand next time.
I use my unit in a barn with a concrete floor.  Almost every time I pull in it using the hose (hose is terminated high), or pull the vacuum to turn it, it topples over.  One of its troubles is the small wheel that pivots at the front of the vacuum.  The mini wheel jams, gets blocked on small debris and causes the top heavy Shop-Vac to fall over.
After finding bedbugs in my apartment, I immediately ordered one of these mattress protectors and paid the extra $29.50 for express shipping. Well, to make a long story short, the company COMPLETELY messed up my mailing address and my order arrived MANY days late. And not until after I emailed them to find out where my package was did I receive my package which was then overnight shipped to me. They did refund my shipping expense, but not until I contacted them 2Xs by email and once by phone.
I have owned Sun Bean Hot Shots before in my home.  I bought the most recent one to bring in to work.  It works quickly and efficiently, like the other ones I have owned.  However, this particular one leaks water when you pour it in to the top of the machine.  You have to put your cup underneath while the water is heating, or you will have a puddle of water around the machine.  Also, you have to heat a bit more water than you normally would to compensate for the amount that drips out as the machine is working.
Very poor instruction sheet.Quality of the instrument is good for basic leveling, fair for turning rough angles. Horizontal markings make it accurate to +/- 1 degree, larger than that on the veritcal.
I purchased the DW092PK Transit-Level package for the purpose of a profile survey at my local church. When I opened the box and viewed the instrument, I was very impressed with the look and the overall quality and detail given to the instrument design. However, it broke my heart when I could not get it to level. After trying numerous times, I decided to do a little research on the instrument, and later found out that the transit-level version, (DW092), Had To Be Calibrated on a regular bases. I was sad to return it due to this design flaw. If dewalt somehow decides to fix such a flaw, it will become a great competitor in the surveying market.
It's a nice transit but I have followed all the steps to level it and I can't get it to level 360 degrees can anyone tell me a trick
I bought this attic ladder system because I needed something with a 300-lb weight rating and that would be easy for my wife to use.  It's steel with no noisy springs and, from the outside of the box, looks like a great product.  I picked it up at another retailer and spent several hours installing it (by myself, I might add--it's pretty straightforward once you create the required 22 1/2" X 54"  framed opening).Unfortunately, the mechanism immediately started making a noticeable popping sound and the fourth time I pulled it down, it jammed entirely then broke one of the gas-charged cylinders that hold it up.  After another few hours removing it, returning it to the retailer, and re-installing a replacement, one of these same gas struts cracked at the ball joint connecting it to the support frame.I do think the design is nice and it's very easy to use; however, Werner's stellar reputation among craftsmen for their other ladder products obviously does not carry over to this product line.
I did a lot of comparison shopping online for an attic ladder, both for features and for price.  I purchased at Lowe's as they were the cheapest by about 10%. The Werner S2210 met all my spec's and I have been pleased with Werner ladders in the past.The instructions were pretty clear, with only one area that was vague - installing the gas shocks.  There was one technical illustration that was incorrect - a mirror image of actual.  Caution - I am one of many blogs that have had this problem with a mounting stud shearing off.  There are studs that the shocks and extension bars mount to and if you tighten the lock nuts with ANY force they shear right off.  I was aware and really careful and I still sheared one of the four off.  I then had to drill this sheared stud out and replace it will a 5/16 lag bolt with a shoulder surface under the head so the extension bar had a bearing service to swivel on.  That mistake took me 90 minutes to fix.  All total, including having to create a new rough opening in my garage attic ceiling and complete the full installation, it took me about 6 hours.  I installed it myself, and am pretty handy and had the correct tools.  I had to rig up a come-along from my attic trusses to hoist the ladder into place, since I was working by myself.  That and the sheared stud took about 2 out of the 6 hours, which was unplanned.The actual ladder section came slightly racked from the factory.  It opens and closes okay but with some interference while closing.  I can see where the ladder sections and mounts are not truly symmetrical along it's length, and that is from the factory.  When I mounted the ladder frame into my rough opening I measured only a 1/16" off on the diagonals, well within the 1/8" spec.  It still doesn't open and close real smooth. I had hoped that my wife, who is 5 ft. tall, would be able to open and close this ladder but it's not as easy as I would have liked.  It's actually pretty heavy and a little awkward during the lifting and folding of the sections.Time will tell how it performs.  The shocks are an area that I will be watching close.  For the money, it's decent quality.  I might have chosen aluminum instead of steal next time, as it would have been lighter to install and easier to fold and unfold into the opening.  I would recommend to someone, but with caution.
Ladder works as advertised, however, for me, it was not a 1-person installation as I required assistance when lifting the ladder onto the frame (The ladder unit is approximately 65 lbs). Also use caution when tightening the nuts fastening the upper link supports to the stand-off plate. I sheared off one of the stand-off plate bolts. As mentioned earlier, the ladder is heavy and as such can be difficult to maneuver when opening.
Blades stay sharper longer then other razors I have purchased, they rust easily just like similar razor blades but overall I would prefer these for the price and toughness.
Down to my last two blades.  I ordered Stanley for the next try 100 for $11.17 from Amazon.  These blades are ok, They stay sharp for awhile as good as other blades I have had but I haven't tried every blade out there or the premium blades.  Three stars for the dispenser.  I finally found a small flat blade screw driver would push the top blade out if I push on the notch with it. It's ridiculous and I always have to make sure my fingers are no where near where the blade will come out.  I hate the dispenser, it sucks.
