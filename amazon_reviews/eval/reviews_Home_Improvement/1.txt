This product is difficult to attach to some notebooks and laptops.  Mine kept sliping down even when tightened.  The bulb is a flaslight bulb and does not project usable areas.  Get the LED model.  The light arm does not stay in one place and can't be tightened.  Unfortunately I purchased 2 of these lights, one was sent to a friend overseas and I am awaiting their comment.
The material was sturdy and looks like it may last quite a while. However one of the clips that attach it to the waistband of pants is faulty and will not hold the material firmly. It slips off each time I try to use the item. Therefor it just sits there and I cannot use it.
Buckle broke after 10 or 12 uses. I've had a pair of Carharts for years and they still work great.
not satisfactory good looking but no elastic which makes them uncomfortable. Be aware of this fact if this might bother you
Even though I will continue to try and comfortably use the suspenders, they were advertised to be all elastic. They're not. The only elastic is the bottom part of the back.
I wanted elastic suspenders thru out these had elastic only on the back side the fronts are stationary strap material.... very disappointed in description of product.
Back connecting point is too low so straps fall off shoulder. Buckles come loose frequently.
If you're taller than about 6-ft, don't waste your money; these will not fit you. Only the lower back straps are elastic. The over-shoulder and front straps are not elastic and have absolutely no "give.". Incidentally, the lower back straps and the over-shoulder front straps are "generically" navy blue but nowhere close to a color or fabric match. I chose to not waste time returning the item for a few dollars after shipping and instead gave them to charity.
Bought 3 pair.  First one had uneven straps, unfixable, unwearable.  Other two weren't even long enoughto reach from one side to another.  Don't know how anyone could give a good review to this completelydeficient product.
These suspenders are made of vinyl instead of elastic. That's the problem. As I've only worn elastic suspenders before, these were difficult to adjust and basically useless. It takes about five minutes of strapwork to get the suspenders within working distance of holding up your pants, but they'll sag when you sit and then need adjusting when you stand up again. I wore these for three days before giving up and giving them to Goodwill. And I apologize to whomever buys them off the shelf at the thrift store. Worst. Suspenders. Ever.
The bucket does not have leaks.It does have a chrome finish that comes out with the water, turning the water to a gray color!Since I bought it as a water bucket for my dogs, it does not fulfill its purpose.
This stuff is cheap crap which isn't worth your time or money, the stuff is impossible to get straight and takes a nail every 4 inches which still doesn't keep the wrinkles out.  The nails it comes with are too short to to hold without smashing your fingers when you set the nail.  Install was a pain and I ripped it off 2 min later.Do yourself a favor and spend a few dollars more for a quality product.
I returned the Duplex Receptacle because it was much too big.  It was more than twice the size of a previous one I had bought a few years ago. It would have looked overpowering on my baseboard.  I checked online, and they have smaller ones available, and you should carry them. Leviton is a reliable company, but they missed the mark here!  Why such a big one?
Both the ad for this product and the invoice that I received with it state it is a Leviton, Item No.T-6009-I, CO261-001, 5-outlet phone adapter product. It isnt. When I saw the rather 'vanilla'packaging, no Leviton name anywhere and no electrical information on the cabling, I contactedLeviton. I was sent one of this product so I could compare. Leviton wanted to know who the vendorselling equipment claiming it is made by them was and I sent them copies of that material. In theimages you can see one does not look like the other. Additionally, the 'non' Leviton product has amuch longer cable than the authentic one. When Cables Unlimited was contacted about a questionof counterfeit, or mis represented product being sold by them on Amazon, this is what I heard: &#34;Illtake care of you&#34;. &#34;There are a few different models&#34;. &#34;We might have sent the wrong one&#34;. &#34;If theysent a different brand, they may have been out of stock&#34;. &#34;If we dont have it in stock we will giveyou a refund&#34;. &#34;No problem&#34;.Let me add that this item was not found on their site.As to the non-Leviton product, I never opened that bag, however, it has a longer cable (maybe thatis a plus in some uses),. seems made with quality in mind and is a phenomenal value (keepingequal quality in mind) for a third of the cost and including shipping, it was packaged well and receivedquickly (and does that matter?).As to the Leviton product that was opened and tested, two of the lines tested found echos happeningthat were heard on both ends and at different calls and at different times. Not sure why that is happening.Leviton also said they had no interest in getting involved with the authenticity issue involving a third party,.but they were interested in knowing WHO was selling product claiming it was made by them when it wasnt.As to CablesUnlimited, while they refunded the charge amount no one asked me if I STILL neededthe Leviton product, or said we will send you the Leviton product when it is in stock.As to Amazon's policy about such sales, this is not the first time I ordered a product supposedlymanufactured by one company and have received one not. In these instances, the productscontinue to have original identifying information of the manufacturer and were not their product.Amazon feels they cannot police every item sold through its company. They feel issues like, quickdelivery, appropriate packaging, value and the like seem to mitigate receiving product that is PHONY,or KNOCK-OFF. AND there are review communites established displaying attempts at exchangesof opinion, feelings, experiences about products acquired through Amazon.com and what doesthat have to do with the price of oranges. FAKE IS FAKE and Amazon has a responsibility, forits OWN sake, if not the publics, to do exactly what they feel they arent staffed, or budgeted todo and that is assure authenticity of product made available BY THEM, otherwise what value doyou find in shopping with them? I had to spend time and effort to determine if items bought onAmazon were authentic, or not and Amazon did not pay me, or reward me for doing their work.Then there is Amazons return/refund policy. Cables Unlimited returned the charges posted thenext day and with an apology. I have, made purchases of other product and because of theseexperiences, broke the habit of checking with Amazon first. Why bother? We love you Amazon,but unless you can establish appropriate policy to deal with such violations of the public trustBEFORE offering their site and items for sale, you will lose sales and trust of the public you aretrying to serve. I dont care how well an item is packaged, or how quickly it was received, if it isntwhat I ordered in the first place. In some item reviews comments are made that an item fell aparttoo quickly, or didnt work as other such brand name product did and that might be an indicationof a fake, yet Amazon may not investigate those reports, or pull the product and vendor from saleon their site AND reviews for the same product going back years show such comments, yet Amazonstill allows that product and those vendors to continue doing business with you, the public throughAmazon. Perhaps the images are helpful.
Got one and it manage to break itself and come undone and not useable after 33days. Just outside of warranty.Save yourself some trouble and if you need one get it somewhere else besides amazon.
This is a complaint against Amazon, not the product.  I need the three products (totaling over $200) and thought it would be worth the extra $12 for on day shipping.  As soon as I placed the order I found that the important parts of the order would arrive 9 to 14 days later.  The $8 product would arrive in 1 day, and there was no way to change it!  What a rip-off.  I would never have paid for 1-day shipping on a partial shipment.
I included these brackets in the same order as the 3-D cell flashlight. These brackets are way too stiff and one would require to make a significant effort to pull the flashlight out them.The idea is good but the design is poorly tested.
These plastic clips break very easily and are not of the quality you would expect from Maglite, which makes great flashlights.
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GETTING THE SPRING STEEL CLIPS WITH RUBBER COATING, THINK AGAIN.  THESE THINGS ARE SHINY BLACK BRITTLE LOOKING PLASTIC!
Less than a year of ownership and one has broken. The light has been removed/replaced in these holder maybe a dozen times.
I bought one of these several years ago and it broke within a couple of months. A couple of months ago I decided to try again, within 3 weeks it was broken, Never Again.
A most useful product, thanks for the good deal.  Just a thought why not include them in any large Maglite sale.  Just a thought.
I was very dissappointed with this item.  Didn't last a day.  The Streamlight Adjust-a-Clamp is VASTLY superior.  Stainless steel construction and it's CHEAPER too.  My current Streamlight set has been in heavy constant use in my truck for over 15 years.  The rubber has worn off a few times but it STILL HOLDS MY FLASHLIGHT!  Customers who were unhappy with the MAG instrument product should check out the Streamlight clamps.
These brackets hold the flashlight too strongly.  I estimate it takes a pull of 20 pounds or more to get the flashlight out of them, and you might pull the screws out of their mounting if attached to something like a kitchen cabinet before the light comes loose.  An older person, a woman, or a child is not going to be able to get the light, especially using just one hand, a very bad situation if an emergency.Get some kind of tool or broom holder at the home store instead.Thanks.Addendum  July 20Using a piece of wood I wedged the fingers a quarter of an inch further apart and placed them in 225 oven for fifteen minutes.  This greatly reduced the force needed to release the flashlight while still holding it firmly.
I guess these were not intended for use in cold climates. Using with a Maglite 3cell light,between 20 and 40 degrees, about the third time, they broke.
This shirt is a how shall I put this, it doesn't have a true neck size , it has a tab that goes in and out, the cuffs are not French Cuffs, they are Mock French Cuffs, I'm sending it back.
Both my wife and my electrician managed to break a pair of these. Unless you are really careful when setting the light in place, they give away. It's the cheapest of plastics and does not take a beating.
These clips kept my 4 cell mag light handy at the top of the basement stairs for about 10 months. I rarely used that light as I have smaller flashlights stashed around the house. I'm guessing the flashlight was placed in and removed from these clips 5-6 times over the 10 months. The last time I pulled the mag light out of the clips, half of the top clip launched down the stairs with a loud snap. I really like the concept, but the plastic is just too brittle.
These always brake when you try to slide a Mag Light into place.  I called the manufacture and they wouldn't help, nor replace.  I would not recommend.
I bought three sets of these. Broke one side of one clip pulling out the flashlight two days after installing them in my Jeep. I had two more sets so I changed out the broken one.  Same deal when I pulled out the flashlight and broke the other of the first set two weeks later, and replaced it. Considering the price I just chalked it up to poor manufacture. Yesterday I pulled the flashlight out and broke the side off of another one. I will remove these clips from my Jeep and look for something more dependable. I wanted to mount a light in my Jeep, RV, and my truck, but these clips are way too brittle to be dependable. I have one brand new set still in the packaging but I will not be mounting them anywhere. I expect a lot out of my tools and Maglite makes a very high quality, dependable flashlight. I am disappointed to see this quality does not extend to this product. The plastic is too brittle for this use.
The faucet itself isn't so bad.  The problem is that no one makes replacement values or cartridges for this faucet.  In two years when the value begins to leak, you will be force to replace the entire faucet as there are no replacement cartridges available for this unit.There ought to be a law against the sale of such merchandise for which replacement parts are not made.
Everyone's saying the low reviews for this item aren't helpful, but after receiving it I also have no idea what good this item could be for.I have yet to find one thing you can actually "plane" with this item.  It's basically just a firm razor set at a pretty aggressive angle. On a hard surface, how can you possibly get enough force behind something this small to get any sort of functionality you'd expect out of a plane?  Is this designed for balsa wood or something?Have tried both MDF and solid wood with this and in every case the plane either was totally unable to move forward or marred what I was working on with blade marks.  I have tried a variety of adjustments on the blade with not additional success.Hate to say it but unless I am just missing some key on how to use this item, I fail to see any usefulness for it whatsoever.
It is too tiny. The blade is not sharp. It virtually cannot do any job at home and like a toy.
Be sure to read the description and get out your glasses when it arrives--VERY SMALL  I did not read the description I guess-- but might be good to use on a balsa wood model:)
This trimming plane is tiny, and it doesn't work at all. The blade is difficult to get straight and usually cuts to one side or the other. It isn't worth it at any cost.
It's good small to really get a good grip, order the one that's a little bit bigger. I'm a girl so I have smaller hands than a lot of the fellas so if I can't grip it I'm sure you can't either. You can thank me later!
If all you work with is balsa wood, this plane may work for you. The blade is so thin both corners chipped off during the first and only use.
I have purchased this with my prime account, and expecting its arrival in two days, because I planed to finish my carpenter and paint work before I leave for week, but it's still not here, when I check it says it will be 7th ( I bought it 1st), I don't no body like to pay for this kind of speedy shipping.
I should have listened to the other parents reviews. My little one had this figured out in a hour after attaching.
It had a horrible smell. Does not stick well , and leaves residue behind. Luckily I was able to remove the residue without ruining anything. Don't Buy
We bought two of these, one for each of the two fridge doors.  Our two-year-old pulled one off within the first week (so much for the adhesive) and quickly learnt to open the second one, on the freezer door.  Now our ice cream is being raided continually.  Furthermore,  the strap gets in the way of closing the fridge door, so we were actually worse off than we were before we bought this product.
I bought this to act as a safety latch for our chest freezer in the dining room, next to the kids' playroom.  I stuck it on the freezer and it popped off within minutes.
I bought this cuz my 2 year old would get in the fridge and dump stuff all over the floor, well he figured out how to open it less than two minutes, its just a light touch of a button and "WAAALLAAA"  my son would say) ... so therefore its useless he can still get into the fridge, it just slows him down a lil.
Stuck fine but broke after 3 days. The plastic buckle is flimsy. We applied the second and it also broke after a couple days.
Not the right price for this product. I checked the same item with 2 count, in local store for 5$. Beware.
this tired little piece of junk endured a mere 2 days versus the overwhelming might of a 2-year-old. caveat emptor.
I have 6 of these pieces of worthless plastic...none of them stick! Surfaces were cleaned first and they still don't stick. The adhesive pad pulled off the latch and is stuck to my door on the one latch...so I guess that one did, technically, stick. I have visited other websites and more people than not are saying these things are horrible. Buyer beware!
My daughter figured this out in less than a minute. 2 days later the plastic on it broke. Definitely not worth the money.
I was so excited to try this lock on my dishwasher that my 17 month old son just loves to open and mess with. First, the original adhesive wasn't powerful enough. Fine. I tried Gorilla Glue, still wouldn't hold. I roughed up the end to be attached with a razor, thinking that it was the slick surface that made the glue not stick. Well, let's just say that several other adhesive ideas later I finally admitted defeat. Aside from just screwing the darned thing into the appliance, this will NOT hold against a firm tug. This product is junk.
Do not buy these.  The plastic latch snapped only three days after I put it on our dishwasher.  Cheap, thin plastic.  Poorly made.  Not safe.
It does not stick to the fridge. Total loss of money. Won't recommend to anybody.
These are a waste of money.  My 16 month old as already figured them out.  We bought two packages of these.  The first ones didnt stick.
They didn't stick to anything.I could try to give you more information, I guess. I tried the refrigerator - no sticking at all.  I tried a wood door - no sticking at all.Worthless.
We spent $6.00 on this which is cheap but then another $9.00 on shipping and tax. That was the first thing that was annoying seeing as it weighs next to nothing. When we got it we didn't realize you HAVE to have the type of refrigerator that opens on the side. Not in the middle with two doors. We realized as soon as we opened it we couldn't use it and it wouldn't fit. Nothing in the reviews said anything about this. BEWARE if you have a double refrigerator which most people do.
I bought a 2 pack of these locks for a freezer door that has been know to open up just a crack. This has led to some items defrosting prematurely. Figured it be better to spend a few bucks than to keep throwing away food. The first one lasted 1 1/2 months before the adhesive failed, the second one lasted maybe two months before the plastic clip broke. Don't waste your money.
Do not buy these appliance latches; the adhesive on these latches gave way after only three days. Furthermore, my 16 month old can easily pull these latches off their surfaces, thereby defeating their overall purpose. Do yourself a favor and avoid the frustration from this ineffective product. I bought a bunch of these, and none of them stick well enough. In a word, 'junk.'
My husband does a lot of work outdoors with a chainsaw during the winter and needs well fitting gloves for safety as well as warmth which is why I bought what I thought was a better glove.  I was wrong - at first the fit was fine but after an hours wear the fingers of the gloves had shifted and the stitching was at the top of the fingers and rubbed his skin raw.  Not at all what was advertised.
Of the pair of gloves I ordered, one glove is a brand name Wells Lamont, the other is a cheap imitation obviously made in China, different color and quality.
I had to return the pair I received......the color of glove is beige, not cattle rawhide yellow......also, looked like I got one used glove or someone drove over the pair with a forklift in the warehouse......item was restapled to look new.....this pair of gloves has a short gauntlet cuff.. exposes the wrist to barbwire fences and allows hay to get inside fingers and palms.....
Some kind of chemical that was in these gloves burned the skin on my hands and was detrimental to my finger nails. I am not sensitive to most chemicals so this was a new one on me. Be cautious when buying leather from China.
Neither cartridge was wrapped, the packaging was definately &#34;USED&#34; it had instructions, but open, and the insides of the box were obviously previously opened, the light doesn't work with these cartridges, so you never see the &#34;green&#34; turn &#34;red&#34;.  I will not be buying from this buyer again.  I am not &#34;warm and fuzzy&#34; about the trust level.
I have used the brita facet mount filter system for 1 year and changed 3-4 times without any problem. For the time to change a filter, I got this pack about a week before. When I set it up on my brita, the orange light was turned on, instead of green. I tried to wash out for several minutes, but it does not work. There was still orange light. I thought it is better than red light. But, after one week, the light was turning to red. Is the life of the filter just a week? It did not even work at all.
to date I have only used the first one and IT DOES NOT REGISTER WHEN I DRAW WATER  FRON TTHE FILTERED SIDE.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE SO WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THE WATER IS ACTUALLY BEINGFILTERED OVER THE LAST FIVE  DAYS OF FILTERING????????  DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE  WHAT WILL YOU DO TO REPLACE THESE UNITS
very upset, this filter no longer comes in tamper resistant plastic package so i will never buy again, it comes in an unsealed cardboard box (not even a sticker over opening)and it didnt even have the cover on the input and output you see on the bottom it used to have(not even in a sealed baggie), so they look used, dirty and scratched and you have no way of knowing if theyre new since the indicator light dies and always shows red.  I just received two packages of two and they are dirty and scratched and i contacted brita and now i have to send these back to them and theyll replace them, i dont want to deal with amazon because at least coming from the brita factory i know theyre new.  I will switch to another brand that comes sealed since i doubt brita sells directly to people.
This is the second order that I've received that within 2 weeks the filter shows an orange/red light. Not sure if the light is incorrect, or this filter lasts for only 5 bottles. I don't know what it means...do the filters not last long and it is a complete waste of money? Or is the light not accurately showing in the filter. Either way, this is a horrible product because I don't know when to change it, unless it is every 2 weeks after 5 bottle fills.
One of the two filters did not fit - had to throw it away! This is an unacceptable high failure rate
Filters showed up unsealed.  The box wasn't sealed neither was the individual filter.  I am not sure they didn't throw old filters in a box and sent them to me
Replacement filter does not fit the original Brita device causing it to leak substantially.  The original filter (old) fit well, but this filter (new) did not.
I really enjoyed Brita filter and ordered two packs of the replacement filters.But..... all did not work. I tested all of 4 but all show only red/ orange light immediately after the replacement... I never saw green light.Even one of them  spilt out black water. It might contain some dust. All the product has scratches on the surface of them.I don't want to believe they sent used one. Maybe I am unlucky this time. There must be some mistakes.I asked replacement and I'll see what they are going to deliver.
We received this and everything looked great.  We have well water and need a filter and can easily tell when it is ready to replace.  This filter needed replaced within 2 hours.  I buy these from the store regularly and they always last at least a month.  This one was either fake or used and repackaged, hoping the person would not know the difference.
Since the light should turn green eventually on a new filter I have no other option than to believe that they are either defective or that they were sold to me under false pretenses.
both filters were bad..each one caused the redlight to flash on my brita filter system...never again through amazon......very cheap...go for thd pur water filter if buying one
I have used this item for years, and always try to keep them on hand for prompt changing when necessary.
I ordered the wrong ones, and they need to be returned. I think Brita has done away with the product that fit my filter, so I many just buy another brand. I am disappointed that the particular filter I want seems to have disappeared from stores and even on-line.
indicating it is not working properly and not producing filtered water. I'm not sure if this is the fault of brita or amazon.
First one lasted about 6 weeks and got a crack in it, sprayed water all over.  Thought was fluke, replaced 2nd one and 5 weeks into same thing.  Not sure if got deffective box or replacment filters are just not what the original filter is.
The box containing the filters was dirty & water damaged. Inside the filters were scratched & scuffed up. They didn't look new. I'll buy filters locally next time to avoid this situation!
One of the filters was already blinking red when I installed it. After reading the instructions I was hoping it was simply because it needed the 5 minute flush before it started working. That was not the case, whether it's working or not the blinking red light is to indicate that it needs changed so it's useless.Also, the 2nd one worked so I know it's not the whole system. Planning on getting a reverse osmosis filtration system, while Brita seemed less expensive at first having to change a filter every 90 (or so) gallons and irritating things like this I've already spent enough to have bought a nicer set up.Also again, it says it leaves in a &#34;healthy amount of fluoride&#34; which is it's way of saying it can't filter fluoride.The system is decent, the replacement filters are garbage.
I live the Brita filter but one of mine was already used and placed back in the box.The light on the filter part that connects to the sink should be green when first sed.Red means it is time to throw it away.Mine turned red as soon as I connected it.
BEWARE, they'll send you LOOSE Filters not WRAPPED. AMAZON'll refuse to understand the difference between LOOSE and WRAPPED, if you complain they'll send you loose again until you get sick of it.
I must say to save a few bucks from the local hardware store it's not worth the waitfor this product to be delivered. Ordered this product and took over 10 days from order dateand still not here.
Also it is written that after 5 min of cold water flow green light flash will change the red one, nothing have happened after in 20 min. Not worth buying . Too expensive . Paying for two and getting only one.
I read another review on this product but didn't think much of it. It said the filter cause the Brita adapter unit to leaks. I bought 4 of this filter and everyone cause the adapter to leaks. I took the filter off and blow in the inlet side. No air would come out of the outlet side. What I figure is the chemical inside the filter had sat too long and become solid. This restricted the water flow and caused the water to take the lesser resistance and out through the seals. I would not recommend buying this product.
Very disappointed... Changed the replacement faucet on Oct. 26, and less than 2 weeks later the light is turning red!!!! Won't buy Brita any more.
It was broken, pliered off, looks like a returned product, the packaging was stappled around the packing and sent to me, repack?
Didn't work at all for fastening snaps into chenille. It might work with cotton only or another very thin layer, but I didn't try it.
Bought 6 of this same exact brand at Home Depot. Could not get it to work on my jacket!  If you pound too hard you probably are flaring the metal out of place where you can't get it to snap properly (even though it looks great).  But if you pound not hard enough the snaps (male or female) will come apart. It's like a catch 22 situation, you can't win. So if they would have put a warning of some type such as &#34;not for thick&#34; material or &#34;only for thin&#34; material I might have gotten the message and maybe bought just 1 to try it out and not 6.  But I'm taking the 5 unused ones back tomorrow!  Wayne Arthur
WASTED MY MONEY. HARD TO USE AND I CCAN'T USE IT -.- I CAN'T THROW IT AWAY B/C I BOGUHT IT FOR 8 BUCKS AN NOTHING I CAN DO W IT -.-
Used the 3/8 wrench for the first time and it broke. Haven't had a chance to use the others, however I feel like it would be the same scenario.
Faucet has defective cartridge and water leaks under sink until cartridge is replaced.  Takes Price Pfister 7 to 10 days to send you a new one unless you want to pay for over night shipping.
It is possible on a three jaw or four jaw chuck to get the jaws out of order of assembly and change the accuracy of the chuck.  Especially if it is a chuck where one adjustment screw moves all of the jaws at once.  Also if you can't fix the wobble by changing the jaws around you may use a lathe chuck grinder mounted to the cross slide to tru the chuck jaws up.  It is a fairly simple operation if you can borrow the grinder set up.  Hope this helps.  It is common in machine shops to freshen the chuck jaws up occasionally even if they don't cause the stock to wobble.
I did not realize they would have no stretch....they are vinyl or plastic.  I will donate them to goodwill.  Bob
This is a worthless item. I never saw a set of suspenders that does not stretch. I suggest you do not sell this item.Stan Magee
I was hoping to get a pair of suspenders that would work with jeans, yet not be uncomfortable. Unfortunately these were uncomfortable, bulky and just not worth the hassle. They are just sitting in the bottom of my closet unused and forgotten.
Great looking, good fabrication but too short.  I am 5' 8" so was surprised to not be able close them.  If they were too short for me -- how do you think they would fit on you?  Don't buy them.
The complaint about this product is that the suspenders do not stretch.  Therefore they are useless to me.  I cannot recommend buying them.  I went to a brick and mortar store to find suspenders that stretched and that I could wear.  Amazon shouldn't be selling such a product.  It's reputation for quality products will suffer and that should not be.  Even though the price is good, it's no bargain.
One suspender was short - the other was long and they couldn't be adjusted properly.  I will not be ordering these again.
These suspenders have a nice design all except for one feature. They don't stretch. The front 2 straps are non-elastic, so they keep falling off your shoulders, and the rear 2 straps have no adjustability. I like to keep the 'X' up between my shoulder blades, but these one's stay towards your lower back, which makes them falling off your shoulders worse.I would say skip these and look for a pair that's made from elastic, and has an adjustable 'X'.
About 10 months ago I ordered and received a pair of these suspenders. They performed well for about six months but then one side began to stretch. No longer proportional but serviceable, I continued to use them until one of the back clamps would no longer hold. Meanwhile my wife started wearing a pair of my work pants for gardening and needed suspenders for the pants. So I ordered two pair of these.Both  have been working well for about a month.
Just don't buy these suspenders, they are so unconfortable ! No elasticity. They just hurt your shoulders by being not extensible.
Not what I expected at all.. the straps are way too large. I could use them on my dog or something.
Could not fit into these.  They were cut too small, and had no stretch.  I returned this, in the hopes that you could identify the poor quality,, and would stop offering this product.
Product was not for regular use. However I have tried to write Amazon because I wish to order HOLD UP SUSPENDERS..\YOUR PAGE SHOWS CLASSIC SERIES HOLDUP SUSPENDERS X-BACK WITH SILVER NO SLIP....$23.95.Product description says that Amazon sells all HOLDUP AT $19.95. When I tried to place order the price was set at $23.95.WHY THE DIFFERENCE WHEN HOLDUP SAYS AMAZON SELLS ALL FOR $19.95. Why should I pay more??Would like to order but $4.00???
very poor no more
Poor quality!  I am 5'10" and had to let out all the extra strap just to make them fit.  The ends that go into the tightening clip are not secured at all making it easy to slip out.  The yolk in the rear is to low so the straps fall off my shoulders all the time ( very annoying! ).  A lesser problem , the clips sometimes slip off.  Recommend you keep on looking, do not buy.
They may be fine for a skinny person, but most skinny people do not wear suspenders. The short side will stretch, how ever the long side will not stretch. I am 5'8 and 190 lbs, and can not wear the suspenders.
I bought two pairs of these ... I wore one pair for a couple of months and couldn't get used to the stiff (non elastic) upper straps ...Forget it!!! ... They flop off when I'm sitting down, and are VERY uncomfortable to say the least ... I should've returned them, but the trouble isn't worth the effort ... Can't win them all guys ... TEd ...
The video I received wasINCRA LS Positioner Instructional DVDby Incra. I don't think it was a mistake, because the part number on the DVD case matched the part # here VDOV1.Well, you get this with the LS positioner free, no need to order this if you have the LS, and no reason to order this if you don't, so..........
This page mixes 2 knife models and the knife that ships is not the Gerber Ultralight LST pictured.If you want the knife pictured, the title / label to look for in Amazon is "Gerber 46050 Ultralight L.S.T. Fine Edge Knife" (pay attention to the model #46050).This may be a factory issue - The box is labeled 22-06050 Ultralight LST Fine Edge Knife.  However, I can't find a knife with this model number on Gerber's website.  The true Gerber catalog model number for the Ultralight LST Fine Edge is 46050. The knife that shipped inside the 22-06050 box (ordered from this page) was actually a Gerber 06551 E-Z Out Jr Serrated which is similar, but bulkier with a slightly different look and has a belt clip and a serrated (not fine edge) blade.I ended up having to return and apply the credit to / re-order the actual Ultralight L.S.T. Fine Edge Knife (which I like).
This was an unpleasant surprise. It looks cheap and it feels cheap. The blade is coarsely ground and has a slight wobble. The rivets that hold the body together are loose and you can see daylight if you look through back edge. I was going to give it a two, but on second thought, fugeddaboudit.
the lamp itself is clearly marked to take normal based narrow 40watt bulbs. The decription calls for 2 standard 60 watt bulbs.BIG DIFFERENCE. One of the arms was bent and NO light bulb could be inserted.It is pretty.
This seller is advertising the Wells Lamont 5130 work gloves (which are excellant by the way) but what you will receive is a pair of Ace Harware work gloves. But if I am only asked to review the Wells Lamont Gloves, I give them 5 stars. I love these gloves. Too bad Wells Lamont no longer makes them.
Very thin fabric that doesn't hold it's shape. Case uses velcro on the back strap as well as the front flap, which is very noisy, and the case doesn't have the structural rigidity to withstand the force of a hard pull so it gets all bent out of shape when you try to open it. After this waste of money, I went back to the old open-top nylon web case, which has always worked fine even though it doesn't seem as secure. This case isn't going to satisfy you, if you want a heavy duty or high quality holster.
The holster is too short for the maglite AA mini. The flash light fits in the holster but the cover doesn't reach the Velcro and thus doesn't stay shut.
Do yourself a favor.  Measure then go to a hardware store and buy a couple pieces of wood and some screws/anchors for whatever substance you're attaching the gate to.  I kept it (as returning would have cost nearly as much as I would have gotten back), but regret ordering it.
You would think for the price that you would get some decent screws, but I've now broken two different sets of screws. I did as instructed and drilled pilot holes, but for some reason the screw gets so tight in the wood that it just eventually either strips or breaks off. Yep -- that leaves you with a broken screw that you cannot remove. So I went and bought a second one -- same thing.I'm going to the hardware store to get some better screws and try again. What a waste of time and money.
Don't waste your money.  This review is mostly geared to those of you considering buying this kit for mounting a gate on a hollow wall WITH A BASEBOARD. I can't comment on the supplies or instructions for the other segments of the kit.  If you have hollow walls and your stair area doesn't have a baseboard then I don't think you would need this kit at all - just a pair of butterfly togglebolts to securely fasten the brackets of the gate.I purchased this kit thinking I needed it for installing the G20 Kidco Safeway gate in my hollow-walled-baseboarded stairwell.  First of all, it's this teeny tiny box about 1"x2" and about 24" long and it arrived in a ginormous box that was almost bigger than the box that the gate itself arrived in.  Secondly, it contains more than what you need to mount the gate on a hollow wall - so you're paying $10 for an assortment of hardware that you will realy only need 1/3 of since the kit works for mounting on hollow wall, wrought iron, as well as wooden banisters.The worst thing about this kit was that the instructions were beyond terrible - it would have been pretty intuitive to screw these pieces of wood onto the wall to create a flat vertical surface upon which to fit your gate, but I made the mistake of trying to follow the instructions which were beyond confusing, not to mention outright incorrect in one instance.And after all was said and done, the bolt that I was supposed to use for the toggle didn't even fit!  It was a 3/8" toggle and the bolt was blatantly 1/4".  I had to dig through my tool box to find a leftover toggle bolt set and ended up using that instead.  And the screws were pretty cheap too - these ones and the ones from the gate hardware - they stripped very easily.TOTAL waste of money - you are better off getting exactly what you need at the hardware store and it will save you money and hassle and frustration.Here is the content list from the kit (for the purposes of hollow wall mounting):1  33" long pine board (0.5" thick by 2" wide)1  2.5" wood spacer (also 0.5" thick by 2" wide)1  3/16" butterfly toggle1  3.5" machine screw aka "bolt"2  2.5" wood screwsBasically what you want to do is screw the long strip of wood vertically  from the baseboard (at the bottom end of the strip) onto the wall (at the top end) so as to create a single vertical surface on which you will be mounting your gate's brackets.  The spacer goes between the strip and the wall at the top end, just like how the baseboard is between the strip and the wall at the bottom end. Did that make sense?The way I did it was to first drill all the necessary holes - the top of the strip will be bolted to the wall with the spacer in between, so the strip, spacer and wall will all need to be drilled through.  Additionally, the wall needs an extra large hole for the toggle to fit through (1/2" hole for a 3/16" toggle).  At the bottom where the strip simply is being screwed into the baseboard, there was no need for pre-drilling since the wood was not particularly hard and my drill is pretty powerful - here I just used the 2.5" wood screw provided.Then, assemble the toggle bolt assembly in this order: bolt goes through strip, then spacer, then put on the toggle and have it ready to push through the hole in the wall.  Then, screw the lower end of the strip into the baseboard halfway.  Screw in toggle bolt assembly.  Tighten lower screw.  Now you are ready to install your gate brackets.(NOTE: you just want to be mindful of where the brackets need to go for the gate installation so you can place the screws for the strip accordingly - the G20 gate comes with handy templates for marking the bracket positions)I hope this helps - I probably shouldn't be writing it after spending an exhausting evening installing the gate, but I'd rather take the chance and be slightly incoherent than put it off and forget!ALso, I forgot to mention - the kit costs $10 and it ships from a non-amazon merchant so you have to pay shipping, so it is REALLY NOT WORTH IT!  Honestly, a trip to the hardware store, including gas, will be cheaper! And at least then you know you are getting the correct hardware and better quality!
We purchased this kit specifically because the box says no drilling required!  A complete lie!  All that means is no drilling into your banister!  You HAVE to drill a little hard piece of plastic and wood!  And if you try to it's going to ruin your drill bit!  I called the parent company and they alledge that you can drill this in with a manual screwdriver.  Apparently they have no idea what it's like for a small woman to do this!  Do not buy!  Poor false marketing!  Cheaply made product.
save yourself time and money, and get what you need from the hardware store.  i didn't bother with this kit, and am happy with my own mounting job around my iron bannister.  total cost: $2.80.  just double check your measurements to make sure the wood is long enough for the mounting bracketsagree with first review that the screws that they provided with the gate itself are cheap--i had 2 break.  you would think for a $80+ dollar gate they could splurge for some real screws..cheap chinese junk grumble grumble
I purchased 2 of these kits.  We attempted to use the ties first and they broke when attempting to tighten during installation.  Since the ties broke we decided to use the screws and screw the wood into the banister and railing.  The wood screws supplied in the kit broke.  We wound up using wood screws we already had to complete the installation. The materials supplied are of such poor quality, I will be returning one kit.  I would return the other kit but the screw broke and we can't get it out of the banister.  I guess we'll leave that up to whoever buys our house whenever we move next.  Done waste your money.  Go buy a piece of would and make a small block to use as a spacer if needed.
"A profound disappointment."I have owned and used Occidental Leather framer's bags for the last eleven years.  Oxy builds the best framer bags in the business.  When my bags, saws, etc. were stolen this January, I moved over to their Stronghold adjustable belt bags and like them.Wanting to upgrade from my CLC electrician bags, I ordered the 1578 system.  I wore them one day on the job.They were a profound disappointment.Oxy, how could you!  I cannot image how this set of bags got beyond the prototype stage.  It is a well-made bag that is poorly designed.  There are a number of flaws.THE GREAT DESIGN FLAW - THE BAGS RUB YOU RAW...The Oxy framer bags are built like an envelope with turned-in seams on the sides and nothing but the smooth backs to run on your legs all day.  You don't notice the bags when you move.The Pro E bags are built with a great thick welt on the backside, covered with edging that sticks out 0.25" all along the back.  It rubs your legs on every move.THE LESSER FLAWS - TOO SMALL AND NOT ENOUGH POUCHES...Where to put the tools?  I carry a screwdriver with conduit reamer, diagonal cutters, linesman's pliers, two strippers, two screwdrivers, utility knife and flashlight on the right side (plus a few other things). The outside pouches on the Oxy bag are too narrow to take a lineman's pliers.  I can barely fit the dikes in.  The heavy edging acts like a catch to snag the pliers on the draw.  Annoying.  Good bags do not fight the wearer.  They hold the tools securely and release them smoothly.In comparison, my CLC bags have seven pouches on the outside of the tool bag and they are sized to take the usual tools.  They also have the "killer app" - a pouch in the parts bag for your drill or screwdriver.  I love this feature. They also have the Great Design Flaw - but they added rivets and the bottom corners are sharp and jab on each move.  Does the horse feel like this when you apply the spurs?Aside from that, I like them.  Since Oxy has the same flaw - just better built, I put the CLC bags on the Oxy belt with an Oxy suspenders kit.  The backs are currently padded out with Ensolite to provide a smooth surface against the leg - and it seems to work.  The Velcro won't stick, so the pads are lashed in place.What would be Most Excellent?  Oxy Pro E bags built like their Pro Framer bags, with the CLC drill holster and numerous, correctly-sizes pouches.  Problem is, none of the catalog photos show the backs of the bags.  Until you open the box, you don't know how they built that bag.Recommendation:  Avoid!  A profound disappointment.
I would buy this tool if..........1. I did not have to but a socket wrench2. I did not have to buy a a drill adaptor
Overall this was pretty disappointing, but one has to wonder whether some industrial designer could fix its inherent flaws. It's cheaply made and has a lot of slop in it, and sometimes the spring isn't strong enough to pop the pins back into position -- pain in the neck to re-position.It's far too inferior in quality to be used for serious mechanical work, but it might be handy if you were installing a whole bunch of big plant hangers, or something else strangely shaped.The basic idea might be workable, but the actual tool is of the "99-cent tool bin" quality.
I was so disappointed, it would not budge my slightly rusted screw, even with repeated spraying of loosing product.  In fact, it would not even grip a perfectly proportioned screw..not a good buy.
I went all wasted a lot of time driving to town to get a tool to remove some rusted bolts. I asked the girl at the auto parts store if it really worked. She just said that they sell a lot of them. Doesn't work at all on a rusted bolt. I'm taking it back for a refund.
As soon as i got it in, i opened it and proceeded to try it on a bolt on my truck. i didnt even get a half of a twist in before it striped and lost grip. and this was an easily pronounced bolt. i was hoping it would be good enough for automotive use, but i can quickly and easily disagree with this statement.
As other reviewers have noted, the Gator Grip Socket is for very light duty use.  Apply any pressure whatsoever to the ratchet handle and the Gator Grip slips off the bolt head, damaging itself in the process.  I had used mine only 10 minutes before several of the pins were jammed up inside the mechanism, and they haven't functioned properly since.  The idea is clever, but in reality the geometry and physics just don't cooperate for this to be that useful or reliable of a tool.
Used one time put in 1 lag bolt worked ok second lag bolt and pins fell out.used it less than 3 minutes before it went into garbage huge waste of money. pure crap.Used one time put in 1 lag bolt worked ok second lag bolt and pins fell out.used it less than 3 minutes before it went into garbage huge waste of money. pure crap.Used one time put in 1 lag bolt worked ok second lag bolt and pins fell out.used it less than 3 minutes before it went into garbage huge waste of money. pure crap.
The "Gator Grip" broke first time out. The pins inside the socket did not spring back into place. The idea behind the socket is sound, but the quality is lacking. I could not and would not recommend this product.
Gator Grip? more like Gator Slip.  I've tried it on various things in my home and on my car and it have been completely useless.  It does not provide a good "grip" of the nut and just keeps on slipping off and I have to constantly re-adjust it.  It often will grip for about a half of a turn and then it slips off.  Sometimes it takes a while just to make it get a grip of the nut at all....  For $[money amount], I can just buy myself a regular set of sockets and wrench.My recommendation would be don't waste your money and save yourself the frustration of trying to get it to work well.  For all the time you waste getting it to grip and all the re-adjusting, you can find the correct sized socket and take off the nut already (you can probably put it back on and take it off again before you even take off the nut once with the Gator Grip).
We ordered this bag 3 weeks ago. And as yet still have not recieved it. Today I am looking at the reviews and it's probably better that we don't get it. It does not make sense that someone would sell something that is so uncomfortable. The guys that are wearing these work very hard and should not have yet one more thing that is going to give them pain. This makes no sense.
These bags are most uncomfortable things I have ever worn. They do not stay put, they swing around when you reach for your hammer,the bags are to far towards your rear so you are always reaching for things, and the front clasp is uncomfortale no matter what position it is in. They are a terrible set of bags and I am very dissapointed.
When I was looking at strap wrenches, I was going to buy a metal one with fiber reinforced strapping. I read reviews on this, and thought it would work for what I needed it for. I am not a weak guy, but I am not the Incredible Hulk either. I was using these to place a float tube on an airsoft rifle. Anyone familiar with airsoft knows that the guns are not the greatest quality, and are usually made from cast aluminum. The strap on the larger wrench stripped, and would no longer hold the tube after about 4 rotations. The smaller of the two snapped with little effort at all. Complete waste of money. Spend the extra couple bucks and get a good strap wrench. I should have known better...
This this is a piece of crap.  Although I should have known that because the price was too good to be true.  As soon as i used it, it freakin broke. BOTH OF THEM! Dont waste your time. Somethings are worth paying for!
I am not normally one to write bad reviews, but this one was worthy of my time. The rubber strap pulled out on the 3rd use, and I was only taking off faucet aerators. Have not used the larger one yet, and I hope that there was a manufacturer error with just the small one.
Non-marring plastic strap wrenches such as these have a multitude of uses including unscrewing jammed optics, jars, etc.Unfortunately this is one of the plastic products produced in eastern Asia (in this case China) that gives off a foul chemical smell that did not disappear after leaving these wrenches outside on my porch for over a week.  Exactly what chemical compound(s) create this smell is uncertain; mold release agent, unpolymerized monomers, pthlates, mercaptans or ???  Thus the toxicity is uncertain but the only way we as consumers can get the message back to these overseas manufacturers is send it back.  In the long run, this will hopefully better protect the unfortunate workers producing this stuff without the protection of OSHA, the FDA, unions, etc. in countries with minimal legal protection for ordinary people.For further not authoritative web sites, Google  smelly chinese plastic or halt import chemical-emitting plastic china.  This is the same part of the world that has produced toxic toothpaste (diethylene glycol), poisonous pet food (melamine), dangerous drywall (emits sulfide gases which corrode copper coils in air conditioning systems and wiring), etc.  Workers and consumers in these countries do not have the power to fix this.  The best they can do is avoid it (e.g. buy imported infant formula because some of the formula produced in their country contained melamine; Google 2008 Chinese milk scandal).Any possible toxicity aside, the stench is enough to not buy these wrenches.
Got this for a tub faucet repair (per the manufacturer's recommendation).  Just wanted to use it on the large nut connecting the valve to the supply.  Tried to use it and it had a hard time gripping.  When I finally got some grip, I tried to ease into it several times, and on about the third turn the strap snapped.Junk - returning.  Save your money.  Either use a pipe wrench and suck it up that it will scratch the nut, or buck up and get a better strap wrench.  These will waste your time and money.
I'm sure that I will have lost these before I go through two light bulbs that came with the flash light.it is nice to have a c-cell flashlight... these batteries are usually still available during storms/power outages when D's and AA's are cleaned out of the stores
After a couple of weeks it loses its grip of the chalk and it keeps on pushing back into the holder. Very frustrating. Try teaching in front of a class and having to constantly reposition the chalk. Very embarassing.
After reading a glowing review of this blade (in Popular Woodworking?) I could not wait to try it.  After using it on two boards I took it off and threw it away, being glad that I only wasted about $35 on it.  The arbor hole was out of round and scored my saw spindle, the blade was horribly noisy and cuts in plywood were worse than poor.  The chip out and splintering were awful.  I could not get my Forest woodworker II balde back on fast enough.  In my experience this blade was horribly misrepresented by the reviewer.
I bought this carbon monoxide detector specifically because it said it plugged into the wall, and I hate fooling around with changing and testing batteries. It does say it has a "battery backup" - but what they don't tell you is that the darn thing does not work at all unless it has an active battery in it, even if it's plugged into the wall!I set mine up, plugged it in, but it does nothing unless there is a battery installed, and if the battery dies the thing goes on the blink and beeps at you until you replace it, even if plugged in. So what is the point of being able to plug it in if plugging it in does nothing? Mine is currently eating a battery and going on the blink about every three days now, so I will trash it and will not buy any more deceptive products from Kidde.
Why this item got the reviews it did I'll never understand. My light worked briefly, after fiddling with the switch, then never lit up again. In addition, the four batteries make it heavy even with a hardcover book and it is bulky. Back to my quest for the perfect spouse-friendly light.
My original Voyager lasted 6 years if not more.  When I replaced it, they changed the color and the ability to function.  I gave off light for two nights and died.  I should have read the reviews of others before i ordered mine.  they all said it was awful.  Go with the Mighty Bright light.
When ordering, be aware the book light does not include a plug in line and must use batteries only. No one seems to know where you can buy the plug in. Batteries only last 10to 15 hours.Ira NeimarkIranee@verizon.net
I bought this book light for my grand daughter for Christmas, 2004. The product was defective--it simply did not work. That can happen with anything. But after six months of trying to get the company to make it right, I gave up, having received neither a new light nor a refund.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Regardless of any good qualities, if I can't get the light to turn on consistently, it's of no use.  Please see the other reviews about this problem.  There is no on/off pattern to make it come on.Also, it's surprisingly bulky.  I have another 4-AA book light that seems much less bulky.
I had the same light for years and used it daily...and I loved it.  When I broke my old light there was no question what light I wanted again.  I have never been so disapointed in the second generation of a product before.  It should be called "The Sometimes Book Light".  Sometimes it works, most times it doesn't. Sometimes I fight with it to get it to work so that I can use it, most times I give up and use another brand's book light I have had to go and purchase since I bought this one.I would STRONGLY recommend that you Do Not purchase this product.  I am ready to toss it in the trash, but I'm having trouble justifing throwing away something that cost me almost $30.00 that I have been unable to use because it does not do what it is supposed to. (It does work ok as a paper weight, but so does a rock I got for free from my yard). Be smart, do your research, find a different brand to buy. This product will only disappoint you!
This thing worked for THREE days.  Thinking the batteries were gone, I tried the new adapter I bought with it....nothing.  After burning through three Itty Bitty Book Lights, I thought this might actually perform to its reviews.  IT DOES NOT!  Guess my husband will have to endure my reading with the light on since after five years and lots of lost money, I am done with these reading lights--no matter how sleek the design, they just don't work.
Let me add my voice to those who think this is a wonderful light that often does not work.  I have 3 of them and the two newest, the silver ones,  will not turn on reliably.  How this can continue in this product is beyond me.  One person talks in a review about holding the light up to another light to get it started.  I need to use mine when I wake up at night and my wife is asleep.  The point is that I don't want a lot of lights on at that point.  So last night, I wanted to read and the light wouldn't come on.  Now, in the daylight, when I don't need it, it turns on.  A very disappointing product.
I like the design of this product, and the light is perfect for reading in the dark. But non of this matters, because the switch to turn on the light barely works. I have to wiggle it dozens of times, and tap it before the light comes on. If the makers resolved this issue, it would be a top notch product.
Okay.  I have owned two of these, my first book lights.The construction is very good, but the first one died because the switch went out.  The second one died very early with a bad switch - but beyond the time for an Amazon refund.Since then, I have learned that those that are smaller with the "goose neck" are superior for focusing the light - and smaller and easier to use too.  This one is harder to clamp onto the book.Unfortunate that this well constructed light cannot get a good switch.
The power ON/OFF button does not work well.  What good is a light if you can't turn it on???  Sometimes it takes several tries and several seconds before the light decides to turn on.  It should be an immediate response to the command:  ON!  I am very frustrated with this function...or lack there of.  If this feature was fixed the light would be a 5 star hands down.
This unit arrived broken.  I've had another one that didn't last very long.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
It is an excellent light, but unreliable. After approximately 2 months, it stopped working for no particular reason. Previously it had been slow to start at times. My wife is glad it stopped working, because she thought it was too bright
Bought the light as a christmas present.  Was great until the body seperated.  Now I have to find somethng else as it does look like I can return it.
I used it regularly for 2 weeks and the light went out.
I have the black version of this light.Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Regardless of any good qualities, if I can't get the light to turn on consistently, it's of no use.  Please see the other reviews about this problem and avoid this light.Also, it's surprisingly bulky.  I have another 4-AA book light that seems much less bulky.
Very disapointed in this booklight since if I used it 24 hours a day it would have lasted 1800 hours instead of the 10000 hours it guarantees. Since it probably was used a total 200 hours not only disapointing but a waste of money. Have found no resolution with Amazon.Or Phorm since there is no way to contact them.
The reviews looked great, but my experience is one evening of using the Voyager and it was never the same.  The next evening only half the lighting worked which is hardly acceptable.Next night no light at all.I guess I just got a bad one but beware and keep the reciepts to attempt to recover an investment that was advertised as a quality product.
This light worked for all of one day.  I purchased it for travel, used it the first night, and it was dead the next.  I was fooled by all the good reviews - looks like a lot of people got bad ones!
This expensive book light would never completely close (would "pop" open)and ceased to work a few days after received.
After I put battery cover on the light would not turn on. It will only work without the cover.
We were unable to get it to work for longer than a second.  I think there's an issue with the way the batteries are supposed to be installed.
Should have listened to other reviewers. After the third of fourth time opening it now won't close all the way. Cheaply made, plastic.
I have an older, blue plastic version of this item.  I'm moving soon and thought I should get another one for opening all the boxes.  I ordered this metal version thinking it would be sturdier and up for a lot of use.  It feels flimsy and cheap.  The slider that extends the blade gets stuck in either extending or retracting the blade.  The blade doesn't slide smoothly in and out.  And, I really have a hard time believing it's metal.  It feels like plastic.  It doesn't even feel like aluminum.  It seems to weigh about as much as the old plastic one.  Don't know what kind of metal it is.  Save yourself some aggravation (and maybe a few pennies) and buy the plastic model.EDIT: I'm downgrading this review to one star (previously two). The fit of the two sides is so inadequate that whenever I lie it down on the table or in a drawer, the blade disengages (falls off of) the peg that is supposed to push it in and out.  This means that I am constantly unscrewing it to reset the blade before I can use it again.  I really do hate it and will throw it away as soon as I can find the other blue one I have had for many years.  (Currently in process of moving and I know it's somewhere in the house, but has yet to show its face...)
I cut about 15 chords of firewood a year as a byproduct of clearing tree incursion on my ranch and wanted a good portable sharpener.  I returned this item and didn't try it as it requires bits made especially for the saw tune rather than the dremel type bits.  I have found that the dremel type diamond bits are reasonably priced, last a long time, give a good edge and take less metal off the chain, thus the chain last much longer,  If the diamond bits were available for this Item I would probably have kept it. I recommend a 110volt dremel tool,drive it with and inverter if you need portability,  Northern tools gave excellent service, a great company.
I wanted to us it to pump bottled water into a kitchen sink in a cabin.  Thought it would be different however,I was not able to use this pump, it is so hard to pump that it broke the wood it was attached to. I had it adjusted and primed and it still would not work.
This product is made very poorly the inside was very ruff and the rubber was rubbing and ripping till it fliped and wasnt able to pump water. If you want a pump for looks this is it but if you are looking for a pump that works this is not the pump for you.
My axle showed up fron Northern Tools today.The ad says .997 steel. IT HAD 12 MILS OF BLACK PAINT ON IT! I spent almost an hour trying to clean it off, and still can't get it to do thru my BRAND NEW pillow blocks. I used to do alot of business with Northern, what the heck happened to their quality control? I'll probably wind up having to sand it in a lathe...I couldn't be more disgusted!
product arrived with chipped off paint, rusted parts and the predrilled holes were so off that i couldnt fit the bolts thru.
This product does not have enough force to stamp metal.  Maybe it would stamp aluminum foil?  We bought the brass tags to stamp and they were too hard.  This stamp did not even leave a scratch.  We were so disappointed.
The letters are so low profile that it is impossible to make an image, even on cardboard or tinfoil. The seller was very nice about letting me return the product, and I did so, but it cost me more in shipping costs than the price of the metal stamps. I suggested to the seller that they drop this item as it will not make anyone happy and will make them look bad.
First problem, stamps didn't fit in the punch tool. After filing down the stamps they fit, but the punch tool didn't have enough 'oomph' to mark aluminum. Going old school and smacking the stamp by itself with a hammer (tough to hold because the pieces are so small) didn't even produce good markings because the raised letters were shallow and uneven.
You really have to strike hard or several times for the image to be visible.  Doing so usually causes the metal to bow - or you take out a finger, like I did.  Save yourself some pain and trouble and opt for a better set of stamps.
i received this set and the first thing i noticed is the cheap plastic case wont even latch shut, then i tired to use the punch and it would not work at all....the tool was broke! Ive messaged the seller several times and have been told that they are sending me a replacement ....but so far nothing!
I just bought this piece of junk.  It came with a defective gas regulator, at no extra charge.  Repeated attempts to contact the manufacturer, Genstar Technologies Company Inc., for help getting a replacement regulator have been ignored.
My whole house filled with smoke.  The smell was obnoxious and not worth the heat that came out.  Now I have a severe headache from the smell.
This unit was purchased new by my girlfriend. It is similar to other Kerosene space heaters in appearance, but there are SIGNIFICANT quality changes that make THIS heater a poor choice.  I very much doubt those reviewers who say they have used it ten years...I would rather believe the company is writing reviews here on Amazon.After a couple heating seasons...two...the burner wick knob (plastic) strips out and will not raise the wick.  You have to remove the big knob and twist the steel stem with a pliers...vice grip...in order to raise the wick up to ignite and or burn the kerosene. Other models on the market NOT this company have knobs that have not stripped out in ten years now for us...because they use steel inserts in the knob to grip the stem of the control.The wick itself is too tightly installed to make the emergency shut off of any use... I have to manually turn the wick down by the knob stem with a pliers. When I press the emergency shut off, you hear the click, but the wick does not go down by itself.  That makes it a dangerous unit to use.Also... the lighter is designed DIFFERENTLY from other kerosene heater lighters...the arm touches the TOP of the wick...instead of just moving sideways into the body of the wick...MEANING... if the arm does not come down onto the top of the wick (IT DOES NOT)... then even with new batteries, the little glowing arm is too high to touch the wick...meaning you have to use a long arm design portable hand lighter...like for candles and barbecues... to actually light the wick through the little burner door.NOW IF you are WILLING to put up with using pliers to raise the knob by the steel stem and using a hand lighter unit, then this unit appears alright for use.  However,  it would seem this design is intentional to make the need for repurchase of a new kerosene heater imminant.  Especially since my other kerosene heater has the different designs for the knob and the lighter arm...and is still going strong after ten full  seasons of northern use.Kerosene space heaters are great...if you can shell out for the kerosene prices... but not THIS kerosene heater...just keep moving on in your choices...!You're welcome.
I have owned a Dyna Glo heater for ten years, I always found changing the wick difficult to say the least. I purchased a new RMC 95-C6 last year and after 3 uses the wick needed changing so I thought it was simply a bum wick. I took the heater to a certified repair facility in Charlotte and was told there was simply no way to replace the wick. This heater also requires dry burns or a full maintenance check at a Dyna Glo official repair site every two tanks (that is 1 days operation). I called the Mfg. and was told by customer service that I should not purchase another Dyna Gol heater because they have multiple manufacturers building their products and Dyna Glo will not stand behind them. I was told not to purchase another Dyna Glo heater because they didn't trust their own product. I hope that help you avoid this POS.
It took me 2 bits (3/16") to remove SIX LINEAR FEET of 1/4 inch grout. These bits are very effective until they break. I figured maybe I put too much pressure on the first bit, so I took it real easy with the second one, but it broke too.
Our subdivision used these in all the brick mailboxes.  Probably because they were the cheapest piece of garbage they could find.  They are that... garbage.Two problems:1.  The door falls off of the front because it is only held in by what I call &quot;small nipples&quot;.  The mailman just breaks the door off eventually.  He probably has enough to wallpaper a room with them.2.  There are holes in the bottom of the mailbox.  This allows wasps to live in the brick mailbox.
Door breaks off really easy.  Definitely made very cheap.  Builder used them in my subdivision, and many people have had the same problem.  I have to buy a new mailbox now because the door broke off and snow gets in on my mail.  Thanks Steel City.  I would never buy this mailbox again except that it is the only one that fits in the brick structure around my mailbox.  Nothing but junk!
I have had one of these with the drafting head for about 10 years and can say the drafting head is not as easy to use as those on full size drafting boards and probably not a necessity.  But, when you have redundant lines to draw on a given angle, it is nice.I was about to order a second one for home/shop use when I read the comments above and I concur. This borders on bait and switch. Wake up Grizzly, you are better tahn this.  Fix the ad and all will be happy.
"BUYER BEWARE! This company sucks. The product arrived dirty, chipped and scratched. I contacted the company, they arranged return shipping, gave me a refund, charged me for a new unit and then shipped me the same one I sent back!. Now they will not take the unit back!"  October 24, 2008
Maybe the earlier ones were better, but the one I received was poor.  The large lens is nice, but the lights are dim.  The arms were dented and would not extend properly because plain and simple poor fit and assembly.  The clamp was far too small for this lamp and if I had used it I am sure it would have broken.  I explained all this in an email to the distributor requesting a return and still I was charged a restocking fee and shipping both ways.  Bottom line, spend more for something made where quality matters.
My son wanted to have electric guitar. Since he is starting to play, I thought I could get him a entry level. I happned to have Grizzly catalogue and $150 kit looked good. I have been doing woodworking for many years, I didn't see any problem assembling it. With lack of market survery, I ordered one. $15 or so of shipping added on.Arrived as promised. So far so good, but problem started right after I started to assembling it. After all finishing have been done.First, all of pre-cut holes to accept electical part are all off from where they are supposed to be. I have to push pick guard (on there all pick-ups, volume knob etc are attached) against to one side very hard so that I could have barely have back up space for screws to go in.Second, pre-drilled screw holes for neck connection is off too. These hole can not be re-drilled as they are off by half hole. So I have to fill those holes with two part epoxy so that I can make new holes at a correct position.Well, that's fine... it is a kit. Some adjustment could be needed. This is THE my first of anything that comes with not enough screws too... I cann't believe it...Third, the thickness of neck where it meets body was too thick.I have to shave off about 1/8"...And finally, after everything's been done, I started to tune but I can not. As matter of fact, I needed to adjust length of strings to get correct intonation. In the manual, nothing about this at all.I called their help line. And it is not tall free...I've got a person to talk. He did not give me any clue how to do it but he was trying to sell their book on how to adjust string length. He also suggested to go to any guitar shop for this and said it is not a complicated process, and it may cost $10 to do it. !#%^@$!@#@Off the phone, since he said it is not complicated procedure, I searched internet and wound up on a owner's manual of Gibbson electric guitar, where they kindly included how to do intonation. (it was true that it is not that complicated, just two lines of sentence was all I needed to know how to do it...)My final frustration came bit later,... I was strolling around Target store... where they sell if for $150, same guitar but all assembled, finished, no hassle, no shipping...
IT'S TOO LOUD AND PRODUCES A LOW VOLUME OF AIR. MY WOOD STOVE PUTS MORE HEAT OFF WITHOUT IT THAN WITH IT AND LIKE I SAID IT'S TOO LOUD TO HAVE ON AND TRY TO WATCH TV OR LISTEN TO MUSIC IN THE SAME ROOM
Same set is permanently on sale at Sears for $24.99. The head of the ratchet handle is too large, and why do I have to buy a separate set of tools for the through-hole functionality?
I haven't had my Pollenex DM 209CR for a year and last night in the shower the bracket that connects the unit to the shower arm broke off. This is nothing more than cheap stuff. Pay extra and get a Moen.
I had my Pollenex DM 209CR for "almost" 3 months when the bracket that connects the unit to the shower arm cracked, water went spraying in every direction! - cheap plastic! Don't waste your money.
The title pretty-much says it.  It fits into the SkilTwist itself, for which I purhased it, but I can't charge it because as hard as I push it down into the charger the charger-light doesn't go on.
Gives a very unnatural tint to your hair. Friends commented on that, especially in the bright sunlight. So I stopped using it and have just let the grey out. I would not recommend this product.
Yes, this product will color your hair.  Whether it is safe or not is another question entirely.  The product contains lead acetate.  From my research on the web, this ingedient is a known carcinogen, and therefore Grecian Formula has been banned for sale in Canada and the European Union.  I personally used Grecian Formula for over 3 months.  I experienced excruciating and persistent headaches until I made the connection to the use of Grecian Formula as the source of my problem.  If you use this product and experience headaches, STOP USING IMMEDIATELY!
it doesn't work if the sensor is more than 10 feet away from the base. I am returning it!
We have a home business in a separate building and need to be alerted when people arrive. This sensor looked well made and inconspicuous, but it has proven to be ineffective. It seems to only read movement every 3-5 seconds so people/cars can slip by it unannounced. I have tried adjusting the level, but it just doesn't work for me.
This product is junk. You get no where near the range they claim. We could only get it to work from 27 feet away.
I bought this product plus two wireless sensors about a month ago.  Easy to install.  Great Idea. A true piece of crap.  Does not detect automobiles traveling at normal speeds down a driveway. I adjusted sensitivity, height, distance, angles and positions of both sensors.  Total garbage. I threw the items away and will be purchasing something that works.  My recommendation regarding this item is to spend a few more dollars, don't waste your time with cheap, plastic, useless equipment.
I bought this because a friend's daughter had one and she liked it.  I must have been sent a dud because try as I might I couldn't get the system to work.  It kept beeping no matter where it was placed.  On top of that, it's all plastic with a flimsy wire that's supposed to act as a signal - give me a break.  I'd like to know how the unit will continue to work properly after being exposed to icy temperatures and freezing rain - there's no way that the batteries will continue to function. Maybe I should have had it replaced but I didn't.  I'm just glad that I got my money back.
Item arrived as if stuffed in package by a 2 year old. Once assembled could not get receiver to sound alarm even after running through problem instructions. Returning for another unit.
I am returning this replacement sensor today.  It does not have the transmission range of the original sensor, and it will not trigger outside of the sensor test mode -- sensor test button pressed.  Do not waste any of your life on this time vampire.  It does not work.
