I switched my under cabinet lights to these, and they are a bit too dim. They work though, and the price is great!  And the energy savings is twice as much
Item came intact, it's a clever design - all plastic and the whole thing lights up when you turn it on.  Nice little glow and a good value for the price.  No bulb included.
This is a very good blacksmithing book, but IMO it's not worth the $60.  There is quite a bit of teaching in the book & a lot of pictures to help understand.  I would say that my only gripe is the price...worth about half.
Gorilla Glue is GREAT!  It's stronger than the wood itself and as for set-up, it's user friendly--you get a little breathing room for adjustment.  Four stars because it does expand from your joints as it cures--you have to clean up the excess.  It's not a major problem but combined with the price of this stuff it only rates a four in my book.
When it came time to set-up my system in my shop, this book was a big help to me. When it came time to choose the size of tubes and the value of elbows, y-fitting, and length of tube etc. the imfo was very helpful. Now that my shop has grown a bit I need to redisign my shop dust collection system.
I bought my first set 10 years ago and absolutly loved them. Three years ago I bought the exact same bags, but now the belt is a three piece belt instead of a one piece. I was also dissapointed that they cost a little more, but the craftmanship was not as good as the first pair. I still believe that they are the best set of bags on the market.
My boss wanted me to get this to replace the damaged module in his 4' level. With some modifications it did the job. I don't understand why he didn't use it as is, or just get another 4' level. by the time the modules are busted the level normally isn't worth putting a new one in ... my opinion anyhow
I take away a little because the buttons albeit are big and nice, especially if you are wearing gloves, it also turns on easily by itself, so I had to take 0.05 stars away. Accurate, fits in jean pocket, digital read out is easy to photograph. I highly recommend and purchased more for my guys.
Comes in handy for setting the pitch on the props of small aircraft. Also works great for leveling machinery. I would buy again.
I have the 2ft framing version of this level, and I bought this to fit tighter spaces.  It's a great product.  I would have given it 5 stars if it were a little bit smaller.
Seriously, that's about it. As far as I can tell, it's pretty accurate. It works well. I can see the screen in direct sunlight. I do wish they had a little LED light in there so I could see the screen at night if I needed to.The ability to re-calibrate when needed is also pretty great, although the instructions on how to do so are a little bit wonky.
Good quality, it was a replacement for my friend. My son broke his.....so I had to find one like it. And lucky enough I got this
These are DEFINITELY a wide strapped pair of suspenders. Very basic but get the job done. I bought them for snowboarding and they don't disappoint, but have had some issues with them staying on - I think I had them too tight tho and they aren't broken in, so would still recommend
Main straps not elastic; not continous front to back.Does the job. Looks good.Cheaper than Duluth TCGot what I paid for.
These are heavy duty,No elastic ,no stretching.If they dont fit,cause they are short,tey have no give at all.The clips are better quality than average.If you are tall.they wont fit you.
Good quality and fun to wear.  Solid clasps will not slip out, easy to adjust. Bought more of different colors/designs.
I don't cxount myself as to large but lenght of supender had to be let out to almost limit to accomadate
I enjoy these bright red suspenders. They are fun to wear as well as being sturdy! I feel they are a good buy. They do the job!
seems to be well made and very sturdy.
Been a long time since I wore suspenders so it took a bit of time to adjust everything so that it was comfortable. These seem to be good quality so I expect no problems.
I really like these suspenders.  I tried other suspenders which did not meet my needs.  These suspenders have a rugged construction, and they hold my pants up !!
I've had these suspenders for a bit over a month, I think they're wonderful. The 2 inch thickness intimidated me in the beginning but it's in the description, plus they were cheap so I took a chance and don't regret it. Very sturdy, definitely keeps my pants on!
Order a pair of McGuire-Nicholas 112 2&#34; $8.54 and a pair of John Deere 2&#34; Logger $19.00.  Bought them because I was having a lot of back pain.  Dr. said I was having to wear my belt too tight and to try suspenders. My body shape (up-side-down pyramid) (6' - 270 Lbs) required me to pull my belt pretty tight to keep for sliding down for my fat waist to my smaller hips.  Both suspenders reduce reduced the back pain dramatically.  John Deere was twice the price of McGuire but there are some differences.  Both stay attached to the pants well.  The McGuire are stiffer and the back straps are stretchy; the John Deere are much softer and the entire length is stretchy.  Comes down the costs vs comfort.  I wear both but McGuire requires TeeShit under them.
of suspenders they are.  I particularly like the heavy clasps...these were made to last.  They might have saved a little in postage if it had been posted in a heavy envelope instead of a box.
They don't show the label on these in the picture, but it is big ugly and hard to remove.  I bought this because I liked tho look but needed a good buck too.  Its a good enough bucket but has one of those labels that is virtually impossible to get off.
It's a bucket... A little larger than expected. The dimensions listed are a little hard to understand- it includes the handle.
I've had this multi-tool for a little over a week and I've used it for something everyday.  When I was shopping for one of these I looked at several different brands and was most impressed with the Shrade.  I was  especially pleased with the locking mechanism, it is positive and holds  well.  The pliers hold excellently and the handles are comfortable.  The  only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that when you are trying to get a  tool out of the handles, the ones beside it also try to raise out and you  have to put them back in.  A minor point though, especially when it saves  you from having to go get in the toolbox!  Overall an excellent product!
Not the prettiest or strongest shelf bracket around, but easy to use.  Just snap a level line on the wall where you want the bottom of your shelf, locate the studs and screw the long ear through to the studs.  Add a 1x6 of  the appropriate length, screw it to the brackets from below, and you have a  light to medium duty shelf.  I would not store copy paper six reams high on  it, but probably 5 lbs per foot of shelf would never bend it.
It went up well, but you will probably need about twice as many nails as come with it to keep all the wrinkles out of it and achieve a good seal.  It will tear if you really pull on it, but you didn't pay a fortune for it, so don't pull on it that hard!  I did have a couple of really large gaps in my door and had to put a couple of nails behind the seal to hold it up a bit so it didn't fold into that large a gap.  It really does seal well if you're careful with the install.
It would be nice if it had a switch to connect two plugs to same phone line. As it is you have to string wires on the inside of the jack
It is as advertised, small and convenient, it is ok and the color is fine.. works exactly as it should
This is a very inexpensive but very useful meter for measuring a roof's slope in either degrees or rise/run relative to 12 inches. It is so handy that I can't believe that no stores in the Houston area close to me carry it. I am so glad that I was able to get one delivered to my home through Amazon.com. This tool is so easy to use, just place it on the roof and read the slope. You can even take a very good reading from the ground without getting on the roof. Thank you Amazon.
Works fine for the price. I don't have anything more to say but i have more words that are required.
Thanks to Amazon  I've found  a useful tool  to mesure  angle  inclination  and more. And the price  is just  right.
Very easy to use.  I recently put in a new drain pipe and wanted to ensure I maintained proper slope over some very uneven ground,  This tool made it very easy.  I used it in conjunction with a laser and finished the job in no time at all.
Works good, but is a little sensitive when trying to read the roof slope.  Also is light weight.  I glued mine to a 2 foot 1x4 to get better readings of the roof slope, not just the slope of a single shingle (which could be different).
I was tired of having Maglites rolling around in drawers or stood up in cabinets.  I mounted this to the side of the cabinet in our laundry room and purchased another set for the garage.  Now I know exactly where a flashlight is...and can see in an instant if it's missing!
does the job fine it seems,time will tell how it holds up.price is good, except seems like a lot for two pieces of plastic and some screws, but it works and seems there is little competition.
I have a set of these mounting brackets bolted to my garage workbench and  can always count on finding my Maglite flashlight just where I left it -  safe and secure.  The plastic seems a bit fragile, but in the two years  that I have used them, I have never had a failure.  The flashlight securely  snaps into place and is not in danger of falling out.If I were to do it  again, I'd buy a set of these in a minute.  It functions well and does the  job for which it was intended.
Very easy and simple to install. holds the maglite very secure and in the open and concealed.
Installed brackets on a flat piece of board and mounted it on the wall behind a hall door.  Flashlight snaps into place very secure.  I wouldn't want to get too aggressive when snapping flashlight on because brackets are heavy plastic but still could break.  With proper care this mounting system should last perhaps a lifetime.
HOLDS A MAGLITE SECURELY.  NOTE TO THE PENNY PINCHERS:  UNLESS YOU NEED TO HOLD THE FLASHLIGHT VERY TIGHT, LIKE IN A 4WD VEHICLE, YOU CAN USE ONE INSTEAD OF 2.
I was wanting to mount my Malite in my truck so it wasnt rolling around and these mounts work great.
Got this for my husband so his maglite wouldn't roll around in the floor board of the truck. Works perfect and he says it makes for quick access to his lite
I keep my Maglite clipped to the door of my truck.  With two clips, the light would sometimes bounce out, if I closed the door hard.  I bought a second set of the clips, and added a third clip to hold my 5 cell in place.  It has not come out unintentionally since adding the third clip.  When I grab it in a hurry, it still comes out with a solid tug.  It's nice to have the Maglight where it can be reached in a hurry.
Got this pair to hold two 3D maglites, one in each since I mounted them to hold the lights vertically on a wall, lens pointed up. In this position, one bracket seems plenty. These are a great solution to keep the maglites handy for emergency use. The plastic is stiff, and I was afraid of it snapping at first but they have held up for a few months now. They mount easily through two screw holes.
They fit the mag light like a glove.  But the hardware that comes with them is worthless.  Unless you are mounting the holders on a wooden surface, you cannot use the screws provided,  You would think at the price I paid they would include some inserts with the scres to mount the holders on a dry wall.
These were a replacement for a set I had bought years ago and one had broken.I really like these brackets as they allow me to keep my Mag lite flashlight in a conspicuous spot and allow easy removal when needed.My only concern is that they do break after a couple of years.  I'd like to see a softer more flexible plastic used in their construction, thus ensuring a longer lasting product.Of course with the reasonable price I feel they are still a good buy.
Used this to attach a 3-cell 'D' Mag-Lite to my truck's lower dash console, for easy reach.I only used one of the two brackets as a 3-cell light isn't that long and using both would have made it too tight to pull the light from the angle it's at.
Used inside a Jeep TJ to hold maglight. Works as advertised, has held up well. Have to fill in review with more words
These work, and that's all you need to say. Are they fancy? No they aren't but, we're not in a beauty contest. They hold the light firmly and work well. Now if the flashlight fairy (5 year old grandson) would stop running off with my light and put it back where it belongs, I would be happy! I'll mount these higher next time! Mounting screws are in the package. A nice plus.
Some reviewers disparage these clips because they are plastic. I had to look closely at them to make sure they were plastic since they feel very sturdy to me. I attached them to the frame of my futon in a couple of minutes and now feel better knowing that I have a light handy without even having to get out of bed. I plan to get another set, or two, to mount a light near the garage door and maybe even in my SUV.
I got these to hold a &#34;MagLite&#34; that was my Dad's in my truck.  But before I could get them (and install them), the lite disappeared.  I guess it wasn't meant to be.
Product works as advertised, while plastic they are quite solid in construction.  Needed to mount a mag to the garage wall...perfect solution.
I bought these to hold my maglite in place in my FJ Cruiser. They screwed right into the back of the center console, and the light has not budged at all (except for when I have purposely removed it). The clamps are tight, and I have found it is easier to slide the light through them than to try to pull or push them through the clamps.
works great! wish a &#34;cutout&#34; came with it so I could of lined it up easier. but besides that functions great!
Initially purchased one to try it out. Since then I bought 3 more. Nice to know where a flashlight is when you need it. Made of plastic, but quality seems ok.
These are perfect for any D size Maglite.  4 stars because the clips are quite tight to remove, even when both clips are perfectly aligned, then again I guess I wouldn't want my flashlight to fall out!  Mounted on a wall in my kitchen next to the fire extinguisher.
Mounted these on the side of my drivers seat in my truck, worked great. Holds the flash flight securely and within easy reach.
These work great in my truck to hold the flashlight in a secure position, easily accessible but not rolling around under the seat or?Would recommend to anyone needing to organize.
This product worked very well to hold my flashlight in my truck. It was pretty easy to install and was decent quality.
But I plan to use these clips for my Maglite in my Toyota Tacoma. They will fit perfectly on the left side of my drivers seat making accessibility to my Maglite much easier when needed.
Thought they would scratch the maglite, but it works great. Tough little suckers, maglite can be yanked and it still sticks in the wall. Thanks
What can I say, they hold your flashlight so you don't have to.  Easy to attach to a wall, hold the flashlight very secure and I know that it will always be there when I need it.
Hi folks,These clips are great and do exactly what they describe.  It takes a hefty pull to get the flashlight out when using both mounts and that's exactly what you want.  I would warn fellow knuckle draggers like myself, that when the flashlight is removed from it's clips, the clips can be broken with a bit of pressure in the wrong direction.  I'd recommend installing the clips where there isn't a chance of them being rubbed or pushed up against by anything else.I installed my clips near the stickshift of a Jeep Wrangler on the passenger side and I've ended up going through 3 sets in 11 years.  As far as I know, there's nothing else out there that's as cheap or as good so I'll stick with them but wanted to offer up some placement advice.Cheers,NORCALROOTS
Love these for holdling a maglight flashlight on the wall so it is never lost and always accessible.  I usually just need one to hold the flashlight, so the package of two stretches the value for my money.
Now these Brackets are worth the cost . I used them to mount my 4D size Maglight on my crash bar of my Harley . Have not had any issues and I ride all over the place . Just zip tied them on and cliped in flashlight.
I mounted this under my rear seat in my 92 xj.  So far, the plastic hasn't cracked and it holds my 3D maglite perfectly. The brackets are plastic however, and because tension is required to hold the flashlight, I don't expect them to last too long, especially if you remove the maglite often.
that is the best to old the flashlight on the wallwhen not in use ... make a secure placeanjd it always a the same place of storageto bad that item is not made of stanless steel
finally got around to using these up at my cabin retreat.  Used it on a non-Maglite flashlight the was a 3-D cell style and it worked perfectly.  I put it by the door so I had it handy on my way out into the yard.  See how long it will last,  I might order more for home/ auto use.
These flashlight holders work well but could be a little more substantial in build. Light must be taken strait out of the holders. Any sort of angular pull could cause breakage.
Good and sturdy clips. Takes a bit to get used to it and i guess to break them in a little but a good buy.
it took a while to find but worth the wait and will buy again for my next maglite
Very good clips. I mounted them to an underseat storage bin for my Chevy Silerado. Holds my 2D Maglight very well.
Can't find a flashlight when you need one.  Place a flashlight on these brackets in every room and stop searching in the event of a blackout.
Great Idea and I am glad that I found them. Good buy and good buy and good buy and good buy & good bye.
I like these clips. They work great for my needs and I am very pleased with them. I would recommend.
The product arrived very quickly and so far is very useful. Though the mounts are plastic they are very heavy duty.
These are the best...still breakable with normal wear and tear, but not too expensive to replace.
The image shows two mounting brackets holding one Maglite. I purchased 2 Maglite's and use one bracket for each with no problems. I really like having them mounted, no more searching for the light when it's needed.
very securely hold newer maglites; won't fit the older ones though; the handle tube on the older ones is too thick
These door levers are adjustable, and easy to install. They seem to be sturdy and mechanically sound. The best price ANYWHERE!!
This product is very useful if you need alittle extra lenth and don't want to buy a longer cable.  It is an inline connection and easy to use and quality is very satisfactory.  I always have at least two on hand just in case I am doing some reorganizing.  Worth the price and good quality.
except it is loose in the socket.  Perhaps our sockets are old and overused.  It works, but it's loose.  Thanks.
I needed  MODULAR PLUG FOR AN ADAPTERIT WORKSMY MOM HAS AN OLD TELEPHONE SET UPTHIS IS PERFECT
I do not know  which one is wrong... telephone line or my phone Jack... The sound is not clesr not loud as I wish....May be it is not good phone...
Nice and sturdy, really good weight to it.  I just wish the knobs where metal also.  Would definitely recommend this.  Got it extremely quickly.
I bought this faucet 7 years ago from Home Depot to go with my slop sink in the basement.  I mounted it to a 2x4 6 inches above the sink to give me a lot of room under the spout.  It is very easy to hook up and use.  I like it, and was dreading having to find a replacement once the seats wore out.Like another reviewer, I have had problems with the seats wearing out over time.  The first couple of times I took the seat out and sanded the divots out to keep it from leaking.  Over time, this method wore out the seats to the point where they no longer work.  Recently I ordered "Delta Faucet #RP4993 Faucet Repair Kit" from Amazon as a shot in the dark replacement.  For about $2, I got 2 seats and 2 springs.  The installed perfectly, and work just like the originals.
It served its purpose and we were able to get our door trimmed down so that it now closes.  They're not kidding when they describe this plan as small though.  It's much smaller than the width of the door trim so it takes a bit more work than a normal size plane.
I give it only 4 stars only for its size, I don't recall reading its size measurement; on the other hand, it does the job like a big one except than in a small size about 1-1/4 inches wide and three inches long.  I does the job but it takes you more time.
For trimming or finish work this little plane does the job I wanted. Not complicated or cumberson. It does the job I need at a reasonable price. Thanks Stanley and Amazon.
Let's be clear: this is a carpentry tool, not a woodworking tool. Woodworking is what you do to build heirloom-quality furniture. Carpentry is what you do to get your house through another winter. If you want to peel paper-thin shavings from dense hardwood boards to produce a satin-smooth surface, you'll need to break out the Benjamins and get a proper woodworking handplane. This isn't one.However, if you need to knock a hair off that pine siding board you just cut, or trim down a door so it closes all the way, or do any of the other little make-it-fit jobs that crop up in any carpentry project, get one of these. It's really more of a reconfigured box cutter than a plane, and it's about as useful - which is to say, you need one.I just planed down three doors that have been sticking for ages, and it took me all of 30 minutes. Previous efforts with a Stanley Surform plane were frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful, and in any case the Surform takes up about ten times more space than this pocket-sized gem. Just be sure you retract the blade before actually putting it in your pocket.I'm giving it four stars instead of five because it's not very ergonomic. I'd like it to be slightly bigger, and maybe have some kind of lip or cover so my hand isn't constantly pressing on a metal edge. It works fine, but can get a bit uncomfortable after a few minutes of planing.
Ordered this to take care of a door that rubbed. The thing is small, like a toy, so handling it takes some finesse but it got the job done. Nice item to have in the tool box.
After reading some of the other reviews, I didn't expect much out of this plane, but I used it last week to trim a little off of an inset cabinet door, and it did a great job for what it is.  The blade is nice and sharp, worked great for a little tweaking.
Went with the brand name but have not used it on my project yet. I am confident it will do the trick.
Well worth a couple bucks if you use pre-glued edge banding or thin hardwood banding.The body is powder coated and mine had a rough sole; little bit of sandpaper on a flat surface took care of that.  As with all cheap tools, needs sharpening and honing before use, but so far, this has done an excellent job of trimming off banding on some shelves.
I guess I didn't pay close enough attention to the measurements of this plane, but it is very small.  Like easily cups in the palm of your hand small.  That said, it is a very effective tool, and was quick and easy to use.  The only issue I had was finding an appropriate grip for use- again because it is so small. Overall, a very good product. Just know what you are getting...
[...], I found this plane to be just dandy for occasional surface planing, but a bit small for my big mitts.For comparison, I have also used the similar, but larger, Veritas Razor Blade Block Plane # 19P1600 ($21). It is a little bigger (2"W x 5"L x 2"H) than the Stanley (1"W x 3.25"L x 1"H), uses replaceable Rc60 razor blades ($2/pkg.), and, with three different blade positions, is a bit more versatile. Personally, I prefer the larger size & versatility of the Veritas model, but it is not as easy to tuck in your pocket as the Stanley.FYI the razor blade in the Veritas plane can be installed in one of three different positions: (1) at mid-body for surface planing, like the Stanley; (2) at the toe for flush trimming or for use as a knife; and (3) at the heel for smoothing/scraping concave surfaces in thin material.Unfortunately the Razor Blade Plane isn't available at Amazon, but can be seen at Lee Valley Veritas:[...]
This is a very handy little plane. Smaller than I expected but useful for DIY projects. But probably best not to let other people see it to save embarrassment!
This arrived smaller than I expected.  It is about the size of a half-deck of cards.  The blade is sharp and did the trick perfectly.  I used it to narrow down some screen doors.  Due to its size, it can be hard to get a good grip on it.  It is my only reason for the lost star.
I'm a hobbyist and started a scratch build radio control boat project. Its required lots of sanding to get the parts just right. After turning my shop into a practical dust pile I decided to get one of these small planners. Turns out this one is just right. A few minor adjustments and its became one of the most used tools for getting the peices to fit just right. I've read other reviews saying it can handle larger chores and will have to agree. For now, it serves its intended purpose quite well.
light use well
I build model rockets and boost/gliders. Balsa wood is the material. This product was perfect for my requirements, Shaping large balsa wood 27 inch wing-span wings into airfoils. This product does the job perfectly. It does require a little finesse to not dig to deep and shape the wings. I recommend this product for light duty wood shaping.
I've not seen a similarly sized plane at this price point. It's got a throwaway price but you can still sharpen the blade on your sharpening stone.I mainly use it for chamfering the edges of dimensional lumber that I cut with the table saw.Because the mouth is wide I find that it works quite well given the simplistic design. My only complaint is that it can be difficult to align the blade after you adjust the depth.
This is small and handy as others mentioned. Need to adjust manually and properly to get good results.Works great for patch works. May not replace regular size block plane
I bought this to plane down the top of a door so I could use an over-door hanger.  Because I did not want to have to rehang the door, I worked on a ladder.  It took awhile to get the height where I wanted it (took off almost 1/4"), but it did the job and the blade stayed sharp.  I would recommend it for smaller jobs, though.  It would be great for small woodworking projects and crafts.  It is surprisingly small--you can close your hand around it.  It may be difficult to keep a grip on if you have large hands.  It does seem slightly overpriced, considering the size.
This is a very good products and sturdy built to last and protect your level.
Should I start off that both my latches broke this past year?  Or should I start off saying that I bought two latches for our freezer chest to keep the lid shut tight, and that they lasted 10 years and broke on my fifth child?  The durability of these latches are very good and I am about to buy two new ones of this same type, after first trying the junky cheaply constructed refrigerator latches of the Babies R Us brand.  Only buy these "Safety 1st" latches IMHO!
Because of the front handle across my oven door other safety latches I bought didn't fit. This one fits well and has stuck well so far. The packaging says it is NOT for stoves... that is not mentioned online in the listing. that is the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5.I did clean the surface well with rubbing alcohol to make sure no residue of any kind was on the surface. I read some reviews that it didn't stick well for them. The packing label also said to leave it set for 24 hours before use. So I did. It is stuck on strong now. Time will tell if the heat from the oven will effect it.  If so, I will update this review.
I bought two to fix a fridge that has been haunting us for a while. Every time you walk by the fridge the door would be ajar. (Hmm why is it called ajar it's not a place to store you summer honey harvest.) Since putting the locks on the fridge and freezer doors PROBLEM SOLVED.
Works fine as a stop-gap until the toddler understands not to just leave the fridge open when no one it looking ;)  Doesn't stand up to constant use well as it is not the strongest material, but certainly worth the investment for the short-ish time it was needed.
I bought this latch for my upright freezer.  It was easy to install and seems to be working well so far.  I was surprised that this product, &#34;Appliance Latches&#34; really was one latch.
My cat has a bad habit of climbing on the fridge and knocking open the freezer. This makes me freak out. This little device does the trick and keeps the freezer closed. Works like a charm.
Great product for the price. I needed for my daughter who goes through the fridge.. I recommend it.. Cannot beat it for the price.
i finally broke down to but these wonderful locks not only are the cheap but it save hundreds in food that my children would take out of the fridge. The thing is we need to keep them out of the fridge cause it was unsafe and it works like magic.
Product works like it should and deters my toddler from raiding the fridge. He did, by accident, pull off the latch once while it was unfastened, but we quickly stuck it back on and he still hasn't been near the fridge since.
This product was great until a few months after using it. My son figured out how to undo the latch around 20 months. (We used this on our fridge) I am searching for another lock that can withstand abuse from a very tall and hungry toddler!
This is a great deterrant for my curious 18 month old that just learned how to open the dishwasher. It works for what we need it for, but isn't as sticky as other products we've had. Fortunately, all he needs is a deterrant and he goes and finds something else to do.
It's a little difficult to unlatch, but I'm satisfied for the price. This is the second set I've purchased, and would purchase again if necessary. One of the first set melted when it got caught in the oven door. Oops!
I ordered this to keep my 3 1/2 year old son out of the oven. Upon opening the package I saw that it was not suppose to be used on ovens... I did anyway. Works great. I just tape the strap to the wall when the oven is in use... it would melt otherwise. My son has not seen me lock it or unlock it so he hasn't even tried to undo it yet.
I tried several types of toilet locks and these work best for me. The only down side is that the adhesive doesn't stay for more than 3 months on 2 of my 3 toilets. On the newest one (the remodeled bathroom with low flow)I have had the same lock for close to a year. The old (1960s) toilets release the adhesive for some reason. Overall, these are the best, especially considering the price!
The gloves fit well and is comfortable to work with.  Made with think supple leather and should last a while..
My husband was thrilled with the reinforced palm, and his only comment was that he wished the thumb was reinforced as well. He also has particularly large hands and often has difficulty finding gloves that fit despite buying a Xlarge, but these fit perfectly! Will definately buy again!
These my husband can actually get my hands into! While I wish I could find even larger ones these are closer to fitting than what I could find at the big box xtores including the hardware types.
The gloves are comfortable to work with & hold up fairly well. I wish they would strengthen the finger tips, that is the weak point for me.  Be careful when ordering, they come from different suppliers & some are better than others. I ordered (3) pairs at once, the order was split. Got (2) pair right away & the other pair was routed from the mid west, to the west coast (60 miles from my house & then to Delaware before being cancelled.
Nice fit, have 2X large size that was needed for me. These gloves wear well and protect hands from most abuse.
Thick soft leather, but like about all other leather gloves, they are made to fit hands held flat, not doing anything.  I didn't think my hands were weirdly huge, but XXL is barely adequate.
This is a good pair of gloves. I've yet to wear out my first pair after going through a pair every 2 days of other work gloves.
Trying to find XXL work gloves at retail stores is tough!  But not as tough as these bad boys!  I am a long-distance truck driver and can go thru a pair of cheap work gloves in a few weeks.  These fit great, wear great,  look great!Some reviewers are complaining that they aren't large enough.  I don't know what size gloves I wear, but I wear a size 14 shoe and these gloves start out tight, but fit me well after a short break-in period.UPDATE 10/22/13:  My first order is as reviewed above.  I have since placed two more orders--one pair and then two more pairs.  Both orders shipped quickly, and the gloves were of identical size, form, and quality to my first order...but they shipped me light grey gloves on both shipments.  These are work gloves, so color is not important to me.  I deducted one star for not shipping the same color gloves as posted.
i'm middle aged now, last time i turned wood was in high school.  these tools seem alot better than what i used in my old woodshop class.  they have stayed sharp for quite some time.  no problem turning redwood, but the dry cocobolo has been a problem.  i plan to sharpen things tonight.  see you later. demetrious
These work very well so long as you have the Brita System that uses these.  They last 4-6 months, regardless of how much water you run through them.  Also, make sure you follow the directions during installation (run water for 5-10 minutes prior to use).
I have been using this brand for over 5 years now. I decided to buy this two pack on Amazon because the price was right and with free shipping.The replacement filters lasts for about 100 gallons. Eventually I will switch to a different type of filtration system(more efficient and effective). But for now, these work fine.
Brita has been my choice for water filtration for years. I love the taste and no longer have to deal with that chlorine smell.Brita installs easily and lasts a long time.
4 filters value pack - good price! Arrived promptly. Very easy to use. Each filter last 1 month for family of 4 (incl. 2 teenagers!!)
/this was a replacment for my PUR; I actually liked PUR better.  The signaling light on my unit has never worked as advertised.
Brita has been around for many years and have not failed in their portable water filter system. I would recommend it.
I am frustrated that the Brita filters are so overpriced but they seem comparable to other brands of faucet mounted filters.
These worked well, but after further research my husband decided that we switch to another faucet filter which offered better filtering and had a comparable price.
You'd be hard pressed to find these replacement filters elsewhere for a cheaper price.The only issue for me is of recent they don't last very long, but that's probably more the result of the quality of my water rather than any issues with the filter.  I know it works because the water tastes great.
I am so enjoying shopping thru Amazon, I have never experienced so much satisfaction, quality, and reasonable shipping. these water filters are a pain to find in the stores but a couple clicks and they are on there way to my home!
great value for these hard to find filters, i have an older adapter and these are the only ones that work
We have a distinct twang in the tap water of southern California (not in a good way) that is detectable in boiled pasta and becomes even more pronounced when it is used to make coffee.  The on tap Britta filters make the water very drinkable and my coffee delicious.  We have gone through two units and ~12 cartridges in 4+ years.  It is plastic and gets a lot of use so, the base unit breaks every couple of years (like a lot of other things now days). In both units, the indicator light quit working after one cartridge (remained red after changing).  Ignore it as a gimmik to sell the product and change the cartridges every 6 months or so.  Nevertheless, it is a good product that does what it is supposed to do.
This product does not leak like the Pur system is prone to do.  Great product.  Though the LED indicator does not work reliably, I do not care.  I change the filter every 4 months regardless.
I've been using Britta Water Filter system for almost a year and couldn't be happier. Each filter lasts for about 4+ months -- no more plastic water bottles cluttering the counter.
The filter is very easily attached directly to the faucet.  It is also easily switched from filtered to non-filtered for use when filtered water is not needed.  Chnging the filter is simple.  My only complaint is that there is no indicator to remind one to replace the filter cartridge.
I have used Brita filter system before.These filters are good.These filters do not last as long as stated, but the water is great tasting.The price on Amazon for the two pack is very good.
I think the prices are a little high for what they are, althought Amazon was the cheapest. They do a good job, our water has a strong metal flavor which the filter removes. I would recommend them if you have taste or particle issues with your water.
System seems to leak for a lot of people, but works fine for us. Lot less complicated and expensive than other systems.
If you drink water from the tap at home or work, I suggest getting an on tap water filter. It makes a world of difference. I got the new Brita filter which works fine and these replacement filters. They last a long time 3-4 months, which is good.
I want to have fresh filtered water so I switch pitch ones into faucet one. Its good, convenience. I will recommend to my friend.
This item can sell for u to $25 each so this vendor makes a staisfied end user a happy camper by keeping the unit cost competative with bottled water.
This is a very simple replacement filter for the faucet mounted Brita water filter system. Over all this was a simple replacement, but these things would be much better if they came with covers (stainless steel) to match the faucet fixture. All in all not a bad product, though it's also not that easy to know if these things actually filter the water.
Fast service, good product.I am happy, thanks.Jenny P
I just opened the filter and started using it in my dispenser.  It is working well.  There was only one filter in the box though.  I haven't looked  at my order to see if I ordered two or just one.  There was room in the box for two.  The one I replaced was the one that came with the dispenser
Bought these to have on hand.  The Brita on-tap is the best we've found, but the filters are not available everywhere.
We ahve used this product for years and have always been satisfied.  This product will filter out most of those pesky additives which the muicipality puts in your drinking water with out your knowing it. Adds a certain level of assurance knowing that your tap water is filtered at point of use.
I've been using this for some time. and think that they work quite well and make a noticeable difference in the taste of water.
... the water tastes better, I haven't gotten out my microscope yet though .... .. .. .. .. .. ..
works great, last long time. but some are not as powerful as others. had to order online bc rite aid doesn't sell these anymore. good price.
Easy to install, good filtering capacity.  I suppose carbon filters are innocuous.  Until research proves otherwise, we'll use this.  Best price we've found on is the two-pack on Amazon.
This is a product I used to buy at retail stores. I found the pricing is much better online & this seller ships very fast.
Very handy if you can install such a thing on your faucet, which I can't. But it is very useful for my son, and at least as good as the pitcher-type, maybe better.
This filter is reliable and lasts a decent amount of time (several weeks, 1-2 quarts of water/day). Compared to the expensive Pur filter, this one lasts a lot longer, though it's not exactly clear how clean the water gets. Anyway the water tastes fine, and we've been happy and healthy using it so far.
I have used Brita products to filter water for years. I started with the pitcher and then installed the faucet filter. I have used the same unit for 4 years now and gone through plenty of filters. I have very few complaints. The filters are easy to replace. The unit has been, in my experience, durable. I had to replace it once because the light stopped working and customer service took care of it.
Been using the Brita wate filter tap system for a few months. The replacement filters are so expensive! Bought these two online for about the price of one around here.Water tastes so much better with it. The only critique I have is that the filters were not sealed in plastic. I don't know what it is about us humans when it comes to buying things sealed. I want to at least think that what I have is new, clean, sterile, etc... Well I'm writing this review and the un-sealed filter did not kill me... yet.
The Brita On Tap is a good water filter that gets the job done well. But it's easy to use, easy it is to change the filter and (2) how much better the water flow was with a fresh filter.
It may take a little bit longer to fill up your glass using a filter, but it tastes so much better!  I really notice a difference when i brew tea
Works as advertised. Box was a bit of a mess, but i expected that. Only reason i can't give 5 stars is the manual is missing. I already knew they require a 5 minute charging time, but for those new to this or forgot, that might be important. There's should be a manual i'm thinking. But it's minor, but enough to knock it down a star. Dealer should state manual missing, but other then that, good deal!
is good item but for anything has damage ., I think for the price is very good filter system .....  great
The Brita water filtration system is a good alternative to just water from the tap.  Its easy to install and the replacement filters just snap into place.  The town I live in has water that has a high mineral content and tastes strange.  After installing the filter, the water tasted significantly better.
Convenient way to refill my filters, through Amazon. The snap right in, last quite a while, don't seem to make much of a difference in the taste of our water however we have a very clean source. Did you recommend as it cuts down on the complexity of changing under the sink filters.
God Bless America forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
The product works fine. It's handy to order four so I have a replacement at hand whenever I need one.
I've been using this Brita faucet system for over 2 years and saved a ton of money not buying bottled water. The water taste great and has no chlorine odor or taste as it would without using this filter system. The only disappointment was these cartridges didn't come sealed in a wrapper as they do when purchased from my local Home depot or Lowe's center.
This filter makes our yucky city water taste so much better!  And the filter lasted a lot longer than I thought it would.  Our water has a lot of minerals in it and I figured the filter would clog up quickly, but it lasted about three months!These filters are much cheaper than buying bottled water, are much more convenient, and there's less waste.
I have not used this product much.  I would say that it is good to use to check the teeth whereby it is hard to see in certain areas.
If you have to replace a snap, the cost of the kit is worth the one time you might need to do it. Use a heavy mallet for better control and accurate seating, NOT a small hammer with multiple light taps. Practicing on a dummy piece helps, and it comes with plenty of extra pieces.
I almost didn't buy this because of the reviews but went ahead and pulled the trigger.  I pre-drilled some holes in my car mats before placing the snap pieces in them and then i pressed the snaps in with the provided tool and it worked fine.  I did mess up one of the pieces by pressing too hard, but there were enough that it didn't matter.
I've used these to replace snaps that came out on my bike trailer and they work fine except that they are too difficult to unfasten in the aging synthetic fabric and it becomes overstressed.I also like to use them in place of missing buttons on my shorts and that works great.I just use a hammer to set them in place - it's simple and works well for my occasional use.
Made what would have been an expensive repair at the sewing shop a cheap & easy repair I made at home.  (Used it to repair a marine canvas cover.)
I got this to repair a snap on a winter coat and the first snap I installed pulled out because the original hoe in the fabric had been torn, so my wife sewed the hole and I put another snap in and it worked fine, matched the original snaps in size and color, so we were happy. The instructions are sparse, but if you have some experience you shouldn't have a problem, just remember to give the tool a sharp rap with a hammer to get a good solid install.
For the price I don't think you can go wrong. I read the reviews where people had problems, but it worked fine for me. I didn't need to do a lot of snaps, but did do a few of each type. Took my time and everything worked fine. I used it to replace snaps on a boat cover.
Tool work great you just have to make sure you have the right size snaps.
There were some &#34;misfires&#34; because I used too much force when crimping that resulted in the crimp breaking, but I got the hang of it.
One reviewer mentioned that these are American made tools.  This is not the case.  The packaging clearly states "made in Taiwan"That said, these things are fantastic if you have to remove a close pipe nipple in one of these sizes.  (props to the reviewer who took the time to list the sizes, which Amazon couldn't be bothered with)  I'd been trying various methods with a soft brass pipe nipple, but once I put one of these to the task, it screwed right out with no fuss.  The only suggestion I can make is if the nipple is tight, break it loose, then tighten it slightly to get the tool loose, then remove it.  I took one out, and the tool was wedged in so hard, I had to thread it all the way back in to break the tool loose.  After that, it came out easy.I have run across one nipple which seems to be too smooth on the inside bore, and the tool won't bite - yet.  Haven't put too much time into that one since I don't need to get that one out quite yet.There's nothing like the right tool for the job, and if you need to remove a short pipe nipple without chunking it up with a normal wrench, these things are well worth it.  How often will I use them again?  Probably not very soon, but when I do need them, I'll be really glad to have them.
I am very satisfied with this faucet, easy installation, good looking, and the filter feature is easy to use.  The action is crisp, and there is no leaking whatsoever. The spout is long and high, giving lots of clearance  for pots and pans.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is I'vs  only had it for a week.
These suspenders are HEAVY DUTY. They're very thick, and took some time to stretch out enough to wear comfortably. One strap was much tighter feeling than the other.
Not everyone who may buy these is a hundred pounds overweight, McGuire!  Seriously though--these are not likely to malfunction, and you are very likely to notice if you have 'em on with one suspender leg twisted--you'll feel it! That heavy fabric leaves no doubt!But they are sturdy, reasonably pleasant-looking, and do the job.
My husband say they work better then any other suspenders he has had in the past..Well purchase again and will recommend.
My husband does a lot of honeydos and these suspenders are great for holding up the britches with comfort.  Not for a dressy type situation though.  These are heavier and the clamps hang on well for all that bending, lifting, etc.  Also, I don't think you can get any better quality in the more expensive suspenders.
These McGuire Nicholas 115 Suspenders in Black are good suspenders. The only complaint, and it's not a big deal, is the elastic portion on the lower back is not very stretchy. Maybe it will improve over time. I would buy these again.
Ordered this product after paying $10 for a pair at K-Mart. The K-Mart suspenders fell apart after wearing them twice.These however, are built for contractor use. The webbing on the back-to-front is not elastic (stretchable), and because of that, when you bend over, it will slacken, sometimes slipping off the shoulder. However, with some further tightening, the problem is minimized.The webbing in the back (from the REAL leather patch, to the back of the pants) is elastic, giving them more durability. Both front and back webbing fabrics are truly high-quality; thick and very heavy duty.The pant clasps are the most heavy-duty I've even seen in suspenders... you could probably lift a truck with them. Okay, maybe that's overkill, but they are VERY strong, solid, and non-bendable.The only drawback (hence four stars instead of five) are the slide adjusters. They could have had some teeth on them, or a slightly better design. And the stiffness/thickness of the webbing makes them a bit difficult to adjust. However, when I changed how the webbing feeds through the sliders, they're a bit easier to adjust, and hold their position.McGuire Nicholas is known for good quality contractor products - and these follow suit. They're also partially USA-made, which is a big plus to me.After using these constantly since I received them, I can say they're worth EVERY penny, even at twice what I had paid. I'm not the least bit disappointed!
This is an extra heavy duty pair of suspenders. There is no elasticity in the suspender itself, and so it should last a long long time. My only problem is I think my body isn't built right for the suspenders to stay on my shoulders. I still use them and they do a great job. I am a big big person, and they fit me with ample room to spare. I really like them.
Heavy Duty and I expect they'll last me a long time. I might have to get me a red pair. After a few times through the washing machine, the leather becomes stiff and pokes you in the back. Solved that by trimming up those "pokey" bits.
This is really for use with your tool belt, see  Style n Craft 74-052 2-Inch Work Belt in Heavy Top Grain Oiled Leather. Would work great for that stuff. I wish I was young, better looking, and working on getting the skin cancers on my nose and arms. Put on your sunscreen, boys.
This is exactly what I was looking for, and I am well pleased with not only the product, but the complete handling of the transaction, including the time from order to receipt.
I have been trying to find a great heavy duty suspenders for my jeans, I find the older I get, the rounder my belly and the less hips I have to hold up my pants is getting to be real chore. I have several clip on suspenders that are the stretchy elastic type and they seemed to do OK, however more often than not when I would bend over or reach up they would need to be redone or they would lose their grip at the wrong time and my pants would move down.  I purchased these, at first they seemed to small but I figured out a way to make them fit and I am well pleased, I will buy another pair in the future just to have a spare,like I said so far so good.
Works great. Pants dont fall down. Just wish material was stretchable and the suspenders were a bit longer. I almost ran out of &#34;material&#34;
They are well made and sturdy. I wish they had some elasticity that would be more comfortable. The clasps could also be better by rounding all the edges. That said, they are a good buy.
not designed for Saturday night out but provide nenes\cessry lift for everyday use woild recommend purchase its a good deal in quality and function
