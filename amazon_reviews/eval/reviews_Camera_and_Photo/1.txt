I only gave it a one star , because I was told it was available, but now they say two weeks. I always thought if something was available it was on hand. Well back to the store if I want it for Christmas.
This camera is the worst thing ever invented.  The pictures are extremely small and the sticker on the back does not stick.  In order for a picture to develop using the flash, one must take a picture of the subjent when they are at most 2 inches in front of the camera.
It is the worst. I have tried many different things to get it to work but all that shows up is a brown screen. It doesnt take my pictures. I even baught a new set of film and it doesn't work. Does anyone possibly know why?
Not even sure camera works because I'm unable to find any unexpired film to use. So, I wouldn't recommend purchasing one unless film becomes available at some future date.
I liked this camera when I had one. I just ran across it in a box today. But film hasn't been made for it since 2006, and the one cartridge of film I had (from probably 2003) was completely stale. If you buy this camera, don't expect to find film for it. Film on ebay goes for $10/cartridge, and it's all at least 5 years old.Why doesn't Amazon take this kind of stuff down? If you want to buy old junk, go to ebay.
The pictures are too small and exspinsive. Sure it looks cool but it isn't worth the money. I like the polaroid joy cam much more because you can actually see the pictures.
The pictures are about the size of a postage stamp! They should include a big magnifying glass with the camera!
It's a total piece of s*** do not buy. Seriously. Not one picture came out. It doesn't come with film you have to buy it separate. I got mine from for a good deal luckily for $9 but it's regularly $50-100
Shipper was great to work with and quickly refunded my money, but you can't buy film for this anywhere anymore, as it is not being made any longer!
The camera that was sent to me is the next camera.&quot;Polaroid i-zone Translucent Pocket Camera (Phat Blue)&quot;It is very regrettable.
Moro no Brasil Me chamo Virna Leasy e descidi comprar a camera de fotos porque achei  bonita e super barato &eacute; esta ai vou comprar obrigado pelo o saite muito bem colocado e espero uma resposta de vocs sobre a minha compra e todo o proscesso. Bay, Bay.
I gave this item a low rating because the product I received, was not the product advertised and for which I paid $71.72, including tax. The battery was listed as a 3000 MilliAmp-Hr capacity, the battery delivered was a 2200 MilliAmp-Hr capacity. I had passed on the 2200 MilliAmp-Hr battery offered on other websites because I wanted a full capacity battery like the one that came with my camera. I don't know who did the switch, but this is clearly a case of illegal "bait & switch". I had an important project to film (i.e. grandson's wrestling match), so I had to use the battery as soon as I received it. Be aware, what you order may not be what you get.J.koch, HB Ca
To think that I sold my Yashica t4 super for this is truely depressing. When I use this camera, I push the shutter button at just the correct moment only to have the camera hesitate anywhere from 1/2 second - 5 seconds. Sometimes it never does take the photo.  With the zoom extended, the problem worsens.  My friend bought one also and has the identical problem.  I am now online to buy a replacement after only 3 months with this dog. Honestly, its the worst possible camera you could buy. Its a shame to see a once great camera company- Nikon- produce such junk.
In spite of the ED glass lens, which is supposed to render superior colors, this camera is not any good.  It seems unable to focus properly, except for when the infinity focus option is selected.  Also, most shots from a couple of test rolls came out overexposed, even under unchallenging lighting conditions.  Aesthetics and ergonomics are nice.  Controls are intuitive and easy, but what good do they do on a camera that is otherwise useless?  Yes, I know it is not an F4 but my advice is to look elsewhere.  I thought I was going to replace my Olympus Stylus Epic.  No way.
I got this for my wife based on my extensive experience with Nikon's pro gear. It is a complete and unmitigated failure. All shots are over-exposed. Lens is not sharp. Tons of flare in adverse lighting situations. You have to teach yourself to hold the camera steady for a good long time to allow the (slower than molasses in January) autofocus to lock onto the subject.  Once it is done acquiring what it feels is critical focus it renders perfectly out of focus pictures every time. It appears to focus five feet in front of the object. Close up pictures are off center and the parallax adjust in the viewfinder does not adequately compensate. I own a rangefinder camera so I am aware how to use this feature, it just does not yield accurate results on this camera. This camera is a bad train accident. I had no idea that Nikon was capable of such a travesty. It is not clear how some of the early reviews of this product were positive. Either the reviewers had different samples and Nikon changed their production technique (substituting ED glass with coke bottle bottoms) or the reviewers were paid plants for Nikon USA or they lack any redeeming photographic skill. It is interesting that all recent reviews are abysmal. Nikon really dropped the ball here. The camera didn't have to be great to satisfy me; it simply takes horrible pictures and is in every way unacceptable.
I got this camera as a gift after my fuji discovery was stolen last year.  I was expecting my second child and not in the mood to take pictures until she was born 6months later.  Needless to say I should have taken pictures with this camera sooner, because it was too late to return it!  The pictures are horrible!  The camera does not focus fast enough to capture those split second funny faces a newborn makes...  I am very dissappointed in this camera.  All of my pictures are blurry and of nothing significant.  If I could I would return this camera in a heartbeat.  I am now buying a new camera and giving this one to my three year old to "play with".
Bought 2 of these devices.Both just went dead in 7 months...Save your money and look elsewhere.
The charger unit or the batteries (or both) don't work right: I use the batteries one at a time, in rotation to power my Zen MP3 player. Sometimes I put discharged batteries in the charger, plug it in, the light blinks red, then goes off.  Only supposed to show either red (discharged, charging) or green (fully charged.)  This morning 3 batteries show fully charged, I take one out, it is discharged. All these problems happened with a first unit, I returned it to Monster and after they took their sweet time, got a replacement which works just as erratically. Monster's stuff looks good, but it is the last time I am going to buy their brand.
I was very disappointed in this battery.  It will not hold a charge for any length of time.  I have bought off brand batteries before and decided to give this one a try since the Sony battery is so expensive.  In this case it would have been better to spend the extra money for the Sony.
I have purchased this camera and it stop of working after 3 months, (I wrote The first review on amazon for this camera) I have lost my money :(
I am sure the product sent  me would have worked fine but the Amazon advert did not differentiate between the different models of the Canon 420 flashgun so i got the wrong one.I found the manufacturer actually was based in my home town [why did I order from NY :-( ] and he happily swapped the item  for the correct model free of charge.The correct one works perfectly and I am surprised a simple piece of plastic can improve things so well.10 out of 10 for the product 1 out of ten for the misleading advert on amazon.
Make sure you are buying this for the 420EX because it does not work for the 430EX!
The price for this item, which is molded plastic, is exorbitant. However, I still went ahead with the purchase because of  favorable reviews. Unfortunately, however, it does not hold/grip/etc. to the end of the Canon 420EX Speedlite; rather, it slides off. For this price, I am not going to make do by taping it on or heating it and allowing it to cool on the flash unit.
When I put it on the flash it stuck and when I tried to take it off, the flash broke
Bought this last November for my sb-800 and didn't try to use it until too late to send it back. It's simply garbage. I tried to put it on the flash and it didn't fit well enough to stay on. It would stay for a few minutes then pop off. Tried to push it on a little harder and it split on one of teh corner but even then still wouldn't stay on. Save yourself the trouble of a return and don't buy this. I can't believe others have rated it highly. Did they actually try to use it? Guess the word is mostly true on buying cheap stuff... you get what you pay for. In this case its a little off though in that I paid money and got nothing of value.Why does a reputable camera dealer even sell this?
Do not purchase the Sto-Fen SB5 for the Nikon Speedflash, it does not fit properly like the factory model.  THe Sto-Fen SB5 may scratch the sides of your speedflash trying to install and uninstall the diffuser.  Also new Nikon Speedflash should include a new Omni-Bouce Diffuser.
I received this unit for Christmas along with a Sunpak 383 flash.  So far I have not been able to use it because the black gizmo that holds the filter won't slide onto the flash unit.  The plastic is too thick to fit into the groove in the flash.  Hopefully, my husband will be able to cure this problem in the shop--however, a unit that was supposed to fit the flash should fit it when received.
Can't even be fitted to a Nikon D200 body. Any lens collar will also likely not be able to fit this. The RC2 system is just not made for serious photo gear.
I ordered the right lens cap cover and they sent the wrong one. An email to them went unanswered. It's my last time on that site.
Purchased from Adorama. No lens. Just the fitting. No focus. No work. Can't get off the FD lens. Stuck. Not worth any price. This particular product is malicious. Will now have to take the FD lens to a camera shop to see if they can get it off without harming the lens. We've tried everything we can think of.
It doesn't conform to FD spec. Very difficult to put on and almost can't get off my FD lens.After carefully examination, I found the problem. It is missing a small hole in the adptor. I need to drill a small hole to make it work. Which hole? Look at an original FD rear cap, you will know.Now I can put it on and take it off easily. But...it is not tight enough when use on any FD lens. Making it useless. It doesn't conform to FD spec. Period.A piece of crap from India.
The product I ordered was not what I got. They sent me a cheaper product.I tried to contact customer service they only wanted to pass the buck and tell me maybe I bought it from somewhere else. &lt;h1>Save your money, don't buy from Adorama!!!!&lt;/h1>
Wouldn't it be great if you could use Canon FD lenses (cameras that use film) with a Canon digital EOS?  That's what this adapter promises, but fails miserably.  Not even a poor loose fitting.  Put it together and the lens falls off!  Do not buy this item!
This adapter DOES allow you to attach an FD lens on an EOS body. But it's like putting a door knob on a door that won't open.  Made in India, the construction is sloppy.  It does fit on the EOS body well, but the FD lens attached will rattle as though it will fall off.  Without any built-in correction lens, it will not allow anything close to infinity focus.  Unless you want to do sloppy "macro" work, avoid this product.  Why would someone go through the trouble to machine a piece of metal to be so useless?
This is a terrible adapter to buy for the Canon 7D.Since it has no glass inside of it, it's IMPOSSIBLE to get anything close to infinity focus. Only things up close will gain focus so basically it's just good as a sloppy Macro lens for the canon 7D.Honestly, I was deceived by the picture as it looked like a solid adapter, but most definitely not.DO NOT BUY for the smaller sensors.
I own a number of Domke products.  This product was garbage and mislabeled.First, the foam is not sewn into the walls of the compartment.  It arrived with foam missing and some folded into itself and there is no padding on the bottom of the compartment.  Next, the product was actually 3" larger than specified making it impossible for me to use.  On this aspect, it is possible the item was labeled incorrectly.  Finally, it was missing dividers.I find it hard to believe this is a Domke product.  The quality is simply not consistent with my past experience.
This is huge and if it worked it would be awesome.. do not know if it is a fluke or what but I will never know.
When I first got this cable release I was quite pleased. It seemed to work perfectly for my application. Unforrtunately now that I have used it for the past year I cannot recommend this product.The problem is the metal used at the thread end of the cable (i.e., where the cable attaches to the cameera) is too "soft". The result is that the threads became stripped rendering the cable useless. If the attachment were made of better quality this would be a useful item but if you plan to use the cable for many years this is a waste of money.
The description says that it fits the V9000, but it does not. Now I am out $4+ on a $7 product to send it back.
I was so excited to find this product because all the pics I take of my dog and cat turn out with big green demon eyes.  When I recieved this product it looked old, the cardboard package was yellowed, but I didn't care as long as it worked.  I took the marker out and it was bone dry.  Basically I paid $7 for a dried out marker.  I tried to contact Adorama through Amazon and through their website. I never got a response or a refund.  This is an unacceptable way to do business.
First off,I ordered this based on the photo posted with this. Notice how it shows 2 brushes and the top one seems to be wide. I ordered it to scan medium format negatives and transparencies.The brush I received was no bigger than a cosmetics sample brush(smaller than a tube of lipstick) and does not do the job on big negatives. By the time you brush off one side,the dust has flown back to the other side.A total waste of time and money for this particular item.
Yes, the light is good, but the battery is a piece of junk.  I have tried to get by with this set for a few years, but I've finally decided to pitch it. I use it for wedding receptions, and I'm lucky if I get 15 minutes before the light dies out.
The wrong item was sent. The received was Maxell 4.7GB  16x  120min.The order was 4.7GB  4x  120min
My DVD can only read and write at a speed no higher than 8X.Amazon's image showed an 8X. But the product delivered wasa 16X. It's very frustrating to return items after waitinga week or more. Find a way of verifying the technical specificationsbefore ordering.
Yes, Olympus prices their silica gel to the moon.  I have found packets of it packed with many products and will use these rather than spend the money for the Olympus product.Before I reuse a packet I regenerate it in a *prewarmed* oven set to 250F.  Small packets should be fully dry in two hours.  Just be sure to prewarm the oven so the packet is not overheated. Overheating could harm the packet itself.
Buyer beware! These items are outdated. A closer look reveals the item shown to be dated 2008. The item I received was of a different brand AND it is marked Best if installed by 2011. Doh! Pay peanuts; get monkeys!
I bought it for my nephew for his third birthday. I didnt want to spend $80 on a polaroid.This camera has never worked from day one and the only reason I gave it one star was because he usesand pretends to take pictures. Spend the extra money if you want real pictures.
Bought this thinking it included film. It did not and film is not available. Well I did find some at $85 a pop.
I ordered this camera and the film that was paired with it by Amazon.com. I wanted it for a 70th birthday party--to make a fun guest book. And, I ordered 9 film cartridges. This camera came without instructions and the film that I received (from a different vendor) did not fit--but there is nothing with the camera that would provide specifications for the film. So, I am stuck with a camera and no film. Don't buy this unless you can get the film with it, from the same vendor, and they guarantee the film fits. This was a very expensive ordeal.
I just picked up this camera few days ago from Wall-Mart, got home too excited to start shooting pictures. Opsssssss Polaroid is too cheap to have a at least a sample film included.Fine I went again to Wall-Mart to buy films for the camera, so I got the i-zone film, and got home too excited to try it out Oppppppsssssssss, the film fits perfectly fine, but it does not work with this camera, so waited another week before I make my run again to Wall-Mart. So I was looking to get i-zone 200. But believe it or not, I didn't find the i-zone 200 films there. So you would find the camera to buy but there are no films to get this piece of junk to work!Finally at Amazon, I found the 200 films but they are non-sticky ones, I believe Amazon does not have them either. So it isn't a problem of Amazon or Wall-Mart, it is a problem of Polaroid of not knowing how to launch a new product.I just came to realize how Polaroid succeeded in making a nice new product, but failed miserably in distributing the most essential thing which are the films to have their camera working.
CHEAPLY MADE. PICTURES WERE HORRIBLE..BARELY VISIBLE ONCE DEVELOPED. FILM IS A STICKY MESS TO DEAL WITH..& TO TOP IT ALL OFF ...DIFFICULT INSTRUCTIONS.! DO URSELF A FAVOR & DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS  . SORRY POLAROID FOLKS... THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT I THINK Polaroid SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF.
my izone camera isnt what i thought it would be, the pictures just havent come out good at all. the slightest move will ruin the picture. its ok for kids to play with but for a 20 year olds point of veiw they stink.
I recieved a package today. When I opened I found a computer keyboard. The invoice was from Atlantic Network technology. After doing a little reseach I realized it was supposed to be the digital camera I ordered from Amazon. Puzzled on how they could mistake a keyboard for a camera, I figured a quick email would set things straight, since I have never had any problems dealing with Amazon or its other sellers. Two emails from ANT support later I was fustrated, they insisted I ordered the keyboard, because the product number from Amazon matched the keyboard (which they don't even sell on Amazon) So I searched them out on the web and found a phone number. There is really no customer support via phone, so I spoke to a internet order rep. She was quite rude, and laughed at me when I told her I had expected a digital camera. "for "17.54?" she said, I told her the Amazon page prices the item at 129.99 on sale for 17.54, I dont make up the prices. She went on to tell me they sell millions of these things and this has NEVER happened, read their feedback.. it HAS happened. She also told me it must be a part for the camera for that price. Can anyone else here tell me it's a part and not a camera for sell on this page? After ending our phone call, in which she assured me customer service would be right on it, I am still waiting for a response. I have a very bad feeling about this purchase, and feel I am going to be out my money on this one. I will update this review when action is taken, but wanted to forewarn any other shoppers before they make this purchase. I only hope Amazon will have my back if ANTOnline tries to put the screw to me.
First it didnt show up and when it did it worked for a month then started messing up would only say welcome then stopped working
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--This price is for an Energizer 321 (SR616SW) battery, which is a very small (watch sized) battery.  This battery does not replace the Konica Minolta NP-700 battery, and does not fit the Dimage X50.  This Product is incorrectly labeled.  Again, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.On a more positive note, batteries.com (the company who you will actually be receiving the product from) shipped very fast, and was very cooperative and polite in the return process.
Shame on me, I ordered this product without reading the reviews. I was looking for a pack of stronger ties, and sorely disappointed when the item arrived.I didn't return it. It's not worth the effort. Hopefully I would learn a lesson.
You must excercise due dilegence before purchasing this item.While video capture and display to a pocket pc are quite good.. The neuros forums are full of posts concerning the lack of audio.THAT'S NO SOUND! Not a problem if all you watch is silent movies!Neuros support says it now ships a new CD with the product that addresses the problem, but if you get an earlier unit without the corrective CD, good luck finding the G.726 audio codec you will need to get mono sound out of the unit and on to your PDA.Also be aware of the volume problems with the record function.  You will need to set the volume to maximum to get useful audio.Additonally, playback on a TV is very poor, and sound is mono.Again, make sure you have an updated CD or check your vendors return policy.Addendum:  I just received word from Neuros customer support that they will send a cd to owners affected by the problems at no cost. I have ordered one from them and will update this review if the problem is resolved.
The battery charger and batteries are functional.  The camera case, however, is practically useless.  The camera barely fits in it, especially with the neck strap.  There is no room for extra batteries and the case does not have its own neck strap, only a belt loop.  Definitely a disappointment and not recommended for the Canon S2IS.
I got this camera as a birthday present yesterday.  I took a few pictures yesterday, and was a bit dismayed at how blurry they can be unless you are absolutely motionless.  I'm used to digital cameras, as I use them at work and this was a replacement for my 6 year old, 1MP camera.Well today I went to use it, and it would not turn on.  I changed the batteries twice, but no go.  I called Kodak, and they told me I could mail it to their repair facility and in a few weeks they'd either send me back my repaired camera or send me a refurbished model of their choice.That totally sucks.  Worst customer service ever.  Crappiest camera I've ever used.
Even though this thing was made for cellphones and use with other stuff, it does not pair with cell phones as stereo headphones!  It just works as a headset, even then the mic is horrible,but will not connect with my fusic no matter how much I try.  it's only okay for use with computers and mp3 players.
These things sound AWFUL.  I am a professional live sound and studio engineer and these headphones cannot reproduce anything above 2kHz or below 400 Hz, meaning they have no treble and no bass; they are all midrange.  Perhaps this would be good for phone conversations (although your home telephone probably has better high frequency response), but it is God Awful for music.  I wouldn't recommend these things to my worst enemy.
Three gripes:1) It broke after 2 weeks. The left channel doesn't transmit. It is a transmitter issue, as I've tried replacing the cable.2) The tech support / warranty response was non-existent. I emailed the support contact on the web site and no response. Emailed them again and still no response.3) Major issue for me, but likely not for most people -- there is a delay in the signal broadcast. I wanted to use these headphones to play my guitar, but I hear the sound coming through at a 1 second delay, so it is impossible to play real time.
Save Your Money these don't work like they say, A piece of junk!!
Although this only costs ten dollars less than the Canon version, you would think it ought to be sold for far less. I was absolutely shocked at how cheaply made this is. I just opened it up and it already feels as though it is going to fall apart. I am deeply disappointed in this product.
I would expect a Canon 5D accessory to be made better than this.  Then, on its maiden voyage during the 4th of July fireworks, the stupid piece of snot (POS) didn't work.  Thinking maybe I had to put a battery in it or something, I tried to open the case.  That was impossible, and so now it's in the trash.  I'll have to pay more now to get the cable release that actually works, even if it gets bad reviews on its quality too.  I can't figure out how it could be compatible with the 5D and then not function.
I received this pen for Christmas (a week ago) and it is already broken. The actual flash drive has only been used once and is still functioning, but the pen part broke before I used the drive the first time. It is made of cheap plastic and has cracked up the side near the pocket clip. Now the whole top of the pen falls off exposing the electronics of the flash drive.This item is a neat idea, but I would wait and puchase one made of better materials. This may be why PNY doesn't make them anymore.
This adapter did not fit the electrical socket - plastic on the edges prevented the adapter from plugging into the socket.
Be careful!If you buy more than one of this product, they charge you $4.99 shipping and handling for every single one separately.The product is supposedly $1.10. But if you need 10 of these, they charge you $49.90 shipping & handling. Oh, by the way, all 10 will come in the same box, because all 10 show under the same shipment at checkout. But they will still charge you $49.90 for shipping and handling.At first, I couldn't decide whether this was plain "retarded" or whether it was another invention of a marketing genius to milk customers. Since it is on Amazon, I will go with "retarded" for now.If the 10 pieces come in 10 separate boxes, it is even more retarded!!!
My polarizer ended up being a Bower, not Sakar.  That did not really matter as much as the spots that appeared when shooting RAW.  These spots arent noticable until you see the pictures, but they show up as small circular discolorations especially noticable against light backgrounds.  I suspect the filter is dirty (I know its not a lens problem).  Anyway, It can probably be cleaned, but they should have sent the correct, Clean polarizer.  Its a cheap piece of glass and you get what you pay for.  You are better off with just about any other option
This product may look cool in advertisement, but it is not very practical for SRL cameras.  I have Nikon D70, and it DOES NOT hold very well.  It can not grab on anything with D70.  It doesn't even held straight up my D70.  My D70 almost broke when it fell off a rock top.  Even it was placed on a flat part of rock top.  It works OK on my very small Canon digital elph.  DO NOT recommend it to use with SRL camera.
Fitted with the UltraFit sling, which I used for hiking. I thought this would be good so when I needed to take a long exposure shot I could easily attach it to my tripod without removing the sling. I attached it to my camera then attached the sling. While hiking along a ledge the Joby came unscrewed from the camera, which almost fell over the ledge! Cannot trust this it to stay attached to the camera so I got rid of it.
I purchased this item thinking that it would work with the Gorillapod Focus with Ballhead.  It didn't. Apparently, this item only works with another model of Gorillapod.
I bought one in a local brick & mortar store.  The plate or "shoe" that attaches to the camera would not release from the tripod -- it took me 20 minutes to free my camera from it (the screw head is under the plate and inaccessible when attached to the tripod).I took it back to the store, where the friendly clerk offered to exchange it with another model from the shelf.  We opened the package before I went home, and it had the exact same defect:  the "detachable" plate or "shoe" would not detach from the tripod.So she gave me my money back and is shipping both back to the manufacturer as defective.Fail.
I purchased this product and have contacted the vendor and no response. The thing does not work.
You get what you pay for, but in this case it wasn't even what was paid for.  VERY cheap camera that is hard to focus and frame a subject.  Purchased it for my daughter for her first camera nad it was worthless in teaching her anything about photography.
I when online to order a charger for my Nikon S550 digiatl camera.  Instead I was sent a camera charger that had nothing to do with nikon.  Now I stuck with a charger I cant use.  Be careful with ordering this charger!!!!!
Not worth the cheap price.  It worked once and then promptly broke.  By higher quality, don't waste time with this one.
I did not realise it but this is a VERY old timey nintendo.  It came without any connections so I could not charge the battery.  It is so old I cannot find any new connection cables.  I bought a new Nintendo at Best Buy.
i bought this item used and the screen is all scratched up can barely see what game is playing.  i dont recommend buying second hand products unless photos which represent the actual discription and condition of the products are shown.
I received this as a Christmas gift.  It sure seems like a neat idea to give someone, but I'll never know because I have a Mac.  Really odd that the company does not support a Mac compatible download to fix this (oversight). I only hope my sister likes it:(
The software for this device is awful.  The manufacturer really needs to get on the ball and resolve these issues.  The installation program keeps looking for drivers that are not on my system.  I found several missing files by searching the internet but it was an excessive amount of work.  The program still does not function correctly and causes our computer to crash.  My wife is in tears, this was a Christmas gift from her sister.
I received this camcorder as a gift and the picture was very grainy I did read all the instructions and troubleshooting charts, called customer support and was unable to rectify the problem, the problem was there if I was recording or not it showed up on the display in the viewfinder and the television, customer support answered quickly gave me nine settings to adjust and try but no matter what it wasn't going to clear up the grainy picture I spent three or four hours troubleshooting this problem so I returned it to Amazon for a refund
I bought and returned this product within a week.  I was excited to have the hard drive/DVD combo capability, but I guess the technology was too good to be true.  The features were easy to use, but the video and sound quality was just awful.  You absolutely cannot film indoors in ANY lighting.  I tried full and dim light, and the picture was too grainy to even make out a face. Outdoors it performed better, but who takes all their video outdoors? Also, with active kids, it didn't catch a good stable image of them in either natural or indoor lighting.  I was really disappointed as I wanted this type of video camera for a long time.  I'm hoping they can improve the technology in the future.  I had read other reviews about the poor performance of this camera after I returned it... I guess I should have read up a little better before purchase!
I got this camera because of the features and because of how well the DZHS300A version did in Consumer Reports.  I thought, well, this is one nice camera.  Well, when I got it, it must have ben broke.  I used it for ten minutes inside, and there were all these grainy red pixels floating around the LCD.  To make things worse, they also transferred to the video, so nothing you filmed could be watched.  It was absolutely horrible.  I returned it, and right now am waiting to see how helpful Amazon is at refunding my money.  Let's hope that they are more helpful than this camera.
I actually tried twice to like this camcorder, both times after only a weekend's worth of use, it would not power on.  Thankfully Amazon accepts replacement/returns...glad I bought it here.  Anyway, the first one I ran by the Hitachi repair shop, and they told me I was blowing fuses. I thought it a fluke, perhaps not, as the replacement did the identical thing.  Hitachi would not work with me, so I am shopping for something different, probably Sony.
We owned this camcorder for a few months and it quit working. This is the 2nd Hitachi we have bought that has quit for no reason. DO NOT BUY Hitachi ever!!
I'm a Mac user and had been used to transferring from my friend's camera into my Mac using IMovieHD and IDVD.  Not being savvy about this format, I had no idea that I was buying something that wouldn't work with my Mac.  The software that comes with this is really strange.  I took the camera with me to Niagara Falls.  The zoom really brings objects in, but the shake is terrible.  Also, it seemed like I was constantly running out of battery time.  When I got home and tried to download into my Mac programs, I was very disappointed to find that I couldn't do it.  I was able to copy from the hard drive onto a disc in my DVD recorder, but after reading the confusing instructions that came with the camera, I gave up on trying to do any editing.  I have no idea how to get this into a program so that I can edit and add music, etc.  Overall, I rarely use this camera.  I'm really sorry I bought it and feel dumb for not returning it immediately.
Can't transfer from hard drive to mini disk.  Can't play any kind of mini disk to any kind of dvd player.  bad combination technology.  must be too early in the game.  better off going with good quality hdd camera only.
Do not buy as a gift - we missed filming a 'once in a lifetime event' because camera arrived broken.
After reading the reviews on this product, I thought it would be great to have on my trip to Maui. What a disappointment! This camcorder is very hard to use and even harder to play back on anything except on the camcorder. It will not play on my DVD player, nor will it play back on my computer. Instead of .avi movies, it has some sort of weird format and it was a total waste of money. I did take it to Maui and used it twice but lost the ability to view memorable events that I thought would record. I used the mini-disks that came with the product so I know that was not the issue. I do not recommend this item to anyone. The software won't even read the recorded events and if my Canon Powershot S80 didn't have video capabilities, I would not have any videos at all of my trip. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF JUNK and go to Best Buy or another name store to buy your next camcorder where they can help you use it. If I wouldn't have bought it online, I would be returning it immediately. So I am just chalking it up to a total loss and sticking it away where I don't even have to look at it again. Once more, do not buy this piece of junk if you want video memories that you actually can play back. And, yes, I did read the manual.... several times as a matter of fact. That was no help either.
We purchased this product for review after finding the DXG 5.0MP Ultra-Slim totally unacceptable. The challenge was to find a flash video camera small enough and rugged enough to carry for action videos in skateboarding or snow boarding.Merchandising and advertising promises we found misleading and false. The camera saves the video files in a non-standard file format, even though advertised as MPEG, and they would not transfer to the computer. Oddly enough, there was an ad included in the box for a program which would transfer to the computer if we paid another $99. The box and sales information promised Mac compatibility, but later we found it applied ONLY to the still photos -- 2MP at best, also unacceptable.Calling the Panasonic tech support took some effort and after some time they admitted it does not produce standard MPEG files and recommended we return it. (Which also turned out to be a nightmare!)We cannot recommend this camera.DTG Magazine
I have a water soaked paperweight.  I was looking for another WP cam .. and floated (ahem) back/forth between the Black and Red one.  Decided on Black.  WRONG... the exact same camera in Red is Waterproof ..the Black "Weatherproof".  Which means - what appears to be the same - is Not.  An expensive lesson I hope you do not repeat.  I already have the Sanyo Xacti and a Flip Ultra w/WP housing that work great, so I'll just eat crow and move on...

I got this because it was on (bundle) sale. Bad idea. The picture quality is awful. It is only acceptable if used outdoors in broad day light. My phone and camera have better video quality.
I just returned from Machu Pichhu, the trip of a lifetime where downloaded my photos daily with the Digital Foci's battery fully charged.  The problem with the unit is that it turns off at 30 sec. and if you're not alert (not multi-tasking) it will turn off before you have confirmation that all photos have been copied. I once downloaded my photos twice and although it indicated 100% copied, there was an entire day of photos missing.Avoid this product unless you don't mind losing photos.Customer service did answer some questions in regard to my loss and why it happened, however, I followed these suggested procedures while downloading and I still lost photos.  They also indicated that their new model does not automatically shut off if the copy is not 100% - seems that feedback on the new unit is also negative.
I had to send it back - it didn't work (fully charged).  I'm currently awaiting a replacement which, I hope, will work as it's supposed to!
I took the review of Karen Williams to heart before purchasing this camera.  Knowing that my Canon would not charge the battery using this adapter, I was looking at the adapter as a cost-effective approach to taking pictures when near an outlet.  That way, indoor holiday pictures won't place a drain on the batteries.  BUT, the picture taking aspect of the camera will not work without good batteries.  I discovered that when I got the low battery warning.  Even though the camera was plugged in, it would not take a picture when the batteries finally died.  The only thing I could do with dead batteries and the camera plugged in was view pictures already taken or do a download.Learn from our mistakes --- Just because the adapter fits your camera, that doesn't mean that it can do what you want it to do with your camera (e.g., charge batteries or take pictures).  Knowing now that I can only use the adapter to view or download pictures, considering the price of the adapter and shipping against how little battery drain there is to download pictures, it would have been more cost effective not to buy the product and work off the batteries only.
I'm a beginner, and this was of no use.  This is a complete waste of time and money unless you are from a cave and have never seen a camera (of any kind) before.  D-U-M-B !  Buy something else.
I tried to play on my Mac book and it was rejected, I thought it was the Mac so I tried a different DVD player and the same thing happened. I got a lemon!
Nikon, the most famous of optic makers, has done everyone a disservice with this one. It is so boring!!! The photographer reminds me of Ben Stein! It had a great potential, but it lacks everything! Do not waste your money
I work in the photo industry and was testing out pens to see which ones worked to sign on photo books as guest books.  Tested tons of pens and found that this one did not work at all for writing on photographic prints (luster/satin finish) or on press-prints.  The ink sat on top of the page, beaded, bled and completely smeared off even after given time to dry.On a related note, another ProMaster pen worked better than all the other pens I tested, it was the ProMaster Archival Marking Pen.  It worked equally well on both real photographic prints and a press-printed image.  Dried right away and no smearing, bleeding or transfer, and a nice bold line with smooth action.  I will be recommending that one to anyone using a photo-book or press-book as a guest signature book.
Too bad you can't rate something zero stars. I bought this at the local hardware store, along with four AA batteries. It worked just fine, for a couple of months. Now it is completely dead, no green charge light comes on. I am down to my last four charged batteries for my wireless keyboard and I am off to buy another charger. Rest assured, it won't be this one again.
I bought and tried out the following product; I-LEVEL WEBCAM WITH HEAD SET MAC BY GEAR HEAD. This unit is supposed to function by USB plug and go. No drivers required or available. No download occurred I plugged in the USB to my Mac Mini. I tried to use it with Skype. Skype didn't recognize the unit. The camera did at one point, display my image on my screen. There was no audio input or output with speakers or headset. I took the unit to a mac technician at Geek Squad, Best-Buy, El Centro,CA for set up. They tried the unit and determined it was not compatible with MAC, even though the product is named Webcam for Mac.. I bought a Rocketfish webcam that works perfectly, in both audio and video. Gear Head technical support is just a limited menu access that does not address any of the problems I encountered. This product was a total waste for me.
Unfortunatley if you own a Canon HG10 you will not be able to use this burner unless you have an AVCHD player. The SD camcorders have the option when downconverting to create in standard dvd format. The only other way to convert the files is on a PC.
I too am struggling with the whole writing/editing issue with my HF200. I feel there are a couple different options. Either A) Buy an extremely expensive computer that's capable of handling 1080 footage, B) Try and edit all of your movies in the little viewfinder (have fun with that) and don't have the option to utilize any editing software whatsoever, or C) interface with your DVD-RW using the component cables.I mean, let's face it. If you're filming 1080 at 24mbps, eventually you need to buy a computer that can handle it. But, until then, this could be a viable option.
I bought the DW-100 burner to go with our Canon HF-10 HD flash based camcorder.  I'm not so disappointed with the performance of the burner itself, but rather the misleading description by Canon of what this thing actually is.  According to Canon's website, "...DW-100 allows you to connect to a Canon VIXIA HG10, VIXIA HF10, and VIXIA HF100 as well as the FS11, FS10 and FS100 camcorders to download video and burn AVCHD or Standard Definition DVDs."  This is not exactly the truth.  As it turns out, the ability to burn Standard Definition DVD's is dependant on the camera's ability to record in Standard Definition (and vice versa).  For example, Standard Definition is not a recording option with the HF-10, and thus I am unable to burn Standard Definition DVDs.This issue leads me to the whole point of me buying this burner.  I wanted to have the ability to create Standard Definition DVD's on-the-fly (i.e., encode DVD mpeg-2 from source AVCHD) so I could share videos with those friends and family that don't yet have blu-ray playback technologies in their homes (including ourselves at this point in time).  Unfortunately there is NO on-the-fly conversion from AVCHD to mpeg-2 at all.So I'm stuck with a $200 stand-alone DW-100 burner that isn't really anything more than what I already had in my desktop PC, which I bought for $30 about 2 years ago.  So be informed as to exactly what you are buying.  This unit will not burn Standard Definition DVDs when coupled with the HF-10 as the description implies.
This burner creates an AVCHD-formatted disc from a DVD-R or DVD-R(DL) blank DVD.  You have to have a Blu-Ray player to play this disc, and one that specifically can handle AVCHD-formatted discs.The software you get with your camcorder (ImageMixer) also easily creates an AVCHD-formatted disc from a DVD-R or DVD-R(DL) blank DVD.If you have a computer with a writable DVD drive (and don't mind using it), then you absolutely do NOT need this burner.  You only need this burner if you don't want to run ImageMixer to create AVCHD-formatted discs.Better idea (IMHO) is to use your computer to burn DVD's and use the money saved to buy a Blu-Ray player.
I am returning this unit to Amazon.  When connected to my Canon FS-100 camcorder, the USB connect icon on the camera flashes continuously, indicating failure to sync.  Following the included directions, I turned both units off and on several times without effect.
I (like most people) was lured to this product based simply on price.  Well, thank goodness my iPod was under warrantee because the darn thing fried my iPod.  I plan on purchasing an OEM charger and other OEM products from here on out!  No more aftermarkets for me!  (FYI:  Had my Nano NOT been under warrantee it would have cost me $129 to fix my 3rd gen iPod.)
Im glad my ipod didnt get fried like that other guy's but this did not work at all. I plugged my ipod into it and it didnt even charger it! The box even says for iphone. They are trying to sell this as a product for ipod and its not not! Do not buy this if you intend on using it for your ipod.
I have an Ipod Nano and needed a wall charger.  So to save a few bucks, instead of buying it directly from Apple, I bought this one.  Although the charger seems to fit into the Nano, it does not work.  WASTE OF MONEY!!  DO NOT BUY!!
I ordered the six iPod/IPhone wall chargers on 12/12/2009. Instead they sent me six car chargers. I emailed them informing them of the mistake in the order when I came back from vacation. They sent me one wall charger and a label to send back the six car chargers. Since then I've emailed them twice, but they do not reply to my emails. They also charged around $17.95 to ship me the wrong chargers that cost them around $5 to mail. Needless to say, I'm not happy doing business with them.The item itself is worthy of several stars. The service is negative stars!
I was dissapointed in this product. From the first time I tried it the battery never stayed in the charger. It would pop out, loose contact, and not charge. I have to tape it in in order for it to charge. It costs to much and is to much of a bother to send it back so I guess I'm stuck with it. Dissapointing.
Insert battery. Pop. Insert battery. Pop. Insert battery. Pop. And so on.Maybe if I can find something to wedge in there to keep the battery in to actually charge, I'll review how it actually works...
The battery and charger came quickly.  Unfortunately the battery nor the charger worked.  Also, to confirm the problem -tried the battery and would not work in the camera charger we already had that came with our camera and the battery we aleady had that came with our camera did not work in the charger they sent.  Emailed situation and requested return instructions and never heard from them.  My husband also believes the items were used due to existing scratches on the items.  I would not purchase anything from this vendor again.
I made a purchase from eforcity and they sent the wrong items.I emailed several times requesting the correct items...they neveronce responded.I will NEVER buy from these people again and my advise, neither shouldanyone else.
I would like to give a review on this product but for some reason I still have not received this order placed on 5/11/2009 it is now 07/14/2009. This is not acceptable. When I contacted the company I was reassured that the order was sent out, however since I did not receive it another would be sent to me as a "courtesy". I have emailed both Eforcity and Amazon.com repeatedly to cancel this order and issue me a full refund to include shipping and handling costs as fulfillment expectations have not been meet in over 60 days and counting. This is really frustating as I have used Amazon.com for many years for a variety of purchases and have never experienced any problems with products or issues with shipping. This is the first and LAST time I will have any dealings with Eforcity. Just want my money back folks. I don't think I am asking too much!
After losing my charger for my Canon I was excited to get a new one and be able to take photos again.  Sadly the item I received doesn't work.  I'm pretty sure it charged the battery the first time I plugged it in, but since then, nothing.  The power lights illuminate when I plug it in, so I know that it's receiving power from the outlet (I also tried multiple outlets, just in case), but it doesn't charge anything.From the reviews it sounds like I just got a defective device, but I cannot recommend something that fails to do the one job it was meant for.
SIMA International Travel Adapter: I was traveling in Italy and France and could not get this item to work properly. I had to just use another single adapter I had.  I had purchased this item because of the surge protector, but in the end I had to just take my chances charging my computer on the adapter without it and was fine.  Again, I could not get this adapter to light up signaling I was getting a connection.  Maybe I had a malfunctioning item but wouldn't recommend right now.
I purchased it when it first was available and it worked.  Months later I went to use it on a vacation and it worked for a day or so then stopped working ie gave an error message that it wasn't working with the current settings.  I hadn't changed anything and I haven't been able to get it to work again.  From doing an internet search, it appears that the connector inside the camera has became loose as I can't get the GPS connector to seat into the camera the way it did in the beginning.  Very disappointed as the concept idea is a great one.  At the time the GPS unit was about $250 so you can imagine how disgusted I am.  IT's likely a design flaw as if one carries one's camera around your neck while hiking, I could imagine bumping into the connector and possibly causing it to jar loose.
Like other people, my unit broke and I am unable to get it repaired or to get a reply from their support department.  I actually did get one reply from their support, but when I asked a clarifying question I got no response, which leaves me 1 month into ownership of this somewhat expensive accessory which I bought specifically for a two month trip to Asia and it is now completely useless.After considering my options, I think getting a GPS data logger to use with software is a better option.  For one, it will work with other camera models.  I had thought about switching my Nikon out for another camera, but that meant giving up the GPS data provided by this Macsense device.If you do plan to go with an on-camera GPS, I would advise against this device.  It has some design flaws, and it is clearly not made to withstand actual field use.
When it worked, it was just great.  But it stopped working after about 3 months during my second field trip.  One of the internal data wire was broken which is really rare.  Unlike most electronic product has 1 year warranty, this product does not have any warranty.  So buying it at your own risk.I may use my camera with the GPS unit every two months.  The first one broke in about 3 months in my second trip.  Thanks Amazon to replace it for me.  The current one is broken again after a year and half.  The idea of this unit is just great.  But the quality is so bad and seems that it was produced in the 9th world country.
Eco Trends Technology Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries are, quite frankly, worthless.I bought a set of 4 AA batteries for use in a camera.  To keep track of the rechargeablebatteries in groups of four, I like to purchase different brands/colors/markings.Delkin Power... no problem,Lenmar... no problem,EcoTrends - big problem... after charging, the four batteries ran myCanon just under 4 minutes, (Change batteries warning, then the camera shut off).  Don'tbother with this product.  These "go green" batteries are going to the trash.
This product is junk!  I ordered on expecting to order at least 3 more but found out that the product is complete junk.I highly recommend getting the LTS IR LED instead google "LTIR50".  I have used this other product and it is 10 times better than the one offered here for about the same price.I received the first LED and I was only able to get it to light up twice by shaking it many many times.  I tried for about 2 hours to get it to light up properly and no luck.  So I contacted the seller via email and let them know and he informed me it had to be in low light conditions (less than 10 lux) to light up.  I politely let him know that I was fully aware of this requirement.Then he quickly agreed to ship me another light.  After receiving the second light I immediately noticed that something was wrong when I looked in the light and I saw a whole bunch of debris inside of the light.  So I first plugged it in to see if it worked, and it did not.  Then I opened the light and quickly noticed that a capacitor blew.  I have pictures of it blown but I can't post pictures to this review.Long story short, I contacted YY Trade to let them know the second light was also broken and they said it I was doing something wrong because they tested it.  So I sent both back to them completely broken with disconnected wires and they continued to say they tested it when they got it back and they worked which is impossible with disconnected wires and blown fuses.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
Worked awesome for about 1wk, now the IR light just flashes. Ive attempted to contact the seller through amazon and had no responce.
the light did not work at all. took it apart and bypassed the light sensoronce i was able to energize the led the amount of light put out in the infrared was almost negligiblethis is truly a piece of chinese junki wonder why they bother making this stuff altogether
YY Trade Inc was notified this item arrived without all led's functioning.  They requested picture. Picture sent.  No response.  Sent another E-Mail.  Company never responded back, never sent another item.  The company has had plenty of time to respond.  I guess they figure that as long as some of the lights work, good enough.  Do not buy from this company.  They will not back up defective products.
I have many IR lights, this one sucks. I get better light from a flashlight IR illuminator. Get the other one sold here...
I tried this with multiple network surveillance cameras and also a video cam. It did nothing and made no difference.Also, they will only refund the item price. Which means, I am out a wasted $20 for roundtrip shipping for this cheap piece of junk.Since this company will not tell you either way in advance for sure if this device will work for you, I think they should share this cost .  Also, they barely speak English, so tech phone calls are out of the question.You get what you pay for. Stay away.
we ordered this because it had this listed as working with the camera we bought.  its far to small for the camera.
I am certain the product is fine, however I leave for vacation tomorrow morning bright and early and UPS is late on delivery (....again....) I will be fine, but really wanted to try this out!  bummed that I paid for fast delivery and did not get it in time!
I bought this to photograph jewelry on and while it looked great, it didn't work! And here's why: its so reflective it's like a mirror!! Even shooting inside a light box with a black background this darn thing reflected EVERYTHING. It also collected lint as if its secret identity is a lint roller. I was shooting the entire time in a relatively lint free zone yet somehow it attracted dust like crazy!! And the tiniest piece of dust reflects on it!!I spent more time photoshopping the dust and reflections out then I did shooting. In the end, I wasn't pleased with a single shot using this and went back to using black sand.I had to return this since it was as bad as trying to photograph on a mirror.
Don't know how to describe an item never received.  Ordered it on Dec.15th and today is Jan. 18th
Battery case literally fell apart: the battery contacts were loose and rattling around, and the picture quality is marginal at best.
unit would not play a self-made audio dvd properly by the volume changing to high and low on each track, although I tested that same audio dvd on my pc and dvd player hooked up to my tv and it played perfect. when I returned this defective unit back, I was told there was nothing wrong with the unit and I was charged a 20% restocking charge and I paid for the shipping back to the seller. what a ripoff !!! I will never purchase anything from this seller again !!! otherwise, the unit worked fine.New NAXA NX-244 Portable DVD/CD/MP3 Player Boombox AM FM Stereo Radio w/Cassette Recorder and Remote
I don't know if it is broken (I bought it used) or if it just sucks, but my speech is so garbled no one can understand me. I called myself and left myself a message using the headset - there is a horrible scratchy noise in the background. Useless as a headset. This had reasonable reviews, so perhaps it is broken.
I received this item, it had a beautiful picture but no sound.I returned it and received another one, again no sound.
Basic controls: means if you've never used a Canon before but decided to buy a semi-pro camera you might be interested in this DVD. If you're familiar with Canon, like I was, don't waste your money. The information is super obvious and doesn't cover 1/2 of the info available in the user's manual. It wasn't a lot of money to purchase this DVD, but you could use your money towards something far more helpful.
Don't buy this battery.  It does not recharge.  I put this in my 650Z on the Kodak dock and nothing.  Don't waste your money.  Come on Amazon, check out your sellers stuff.
These are fantastic lights - when they work.  For us, that was probably all of three light photo-shoots.I bought them as a gift for my fiance (a professional photographer) in January 2012.  Immediately had to return them because one of the heads was broken.  The return was relatively simple, but it was still disappointing and frustrating to buy a nice product and have it immediately broken out of the box.  Now 7 months later on the replaced set, ANOTHER HEAD IS BROKEN!  And this is with very minimal use during that entire period (most shoots were outdoors away from a power source, and we don't have a portable battery just yet).  Worse, we found out it was broken when we went to shoot a wedding party last night.For the price, I expected so much more - such as a product that doesn't fail - TWICE, even.  Very Disappointed!  And we can't return it through Amazon anymore.  We have to go through Profoto's warranty process.  Honestly, I just want to send them back and get a full refund.
I find the Blue Crane series of photography videos to be professionally produced and very informative as well as interesting to watch. I don't know what the heck is the story with this one. It is just awful. Dull narration that switches between a male narrator and a female narrator both of whom are dull as paint. And the male narrator keeps saying "don't worry..." when he introduces a new concept, as if the viewer is a neurotic idiot. Furthermore, they take forever to get to the point, which is to illustrate the various features of the flash units and how to use them.  Slow, dull and irritating, this video is one of Blue Cranes few duds.
I cannot imagine anyone for whom this DVD would be appropriate. Essentially it is a woman voice-over artist reading what seems like the Speedlite manual, at a rapid rate I might add, and a lot of studio equipment. So if you are already a pro, this entire DVD is redundant and unnecessary, and if you are a beginner, it is well over your head. There are lots of free video tutorial on the Canon website. Save your money.
This video does a nice job of teaching the basic concepts of lighting. That's all. It does nothing for explaining how to use the flash (unless, you are using two or three flashes in tandem in a studio). Read about lighting on the 'net and save the $20.They also continually show the 580, which has different controls and a different LCD.This is the first thing that I have ever returned to Amazon.
This DVD is not good. The major step by step example they have in this DVD are inside of the studio WITH a lot of special equipment that regular household WON'T have. They do NOT teach you how to use the flash in regular daily using bases. The concept they teach is SIMPLE! They do NOT teach you real technic on the 2nd curtin shot, or some other special shots. They only teach you how to use PROFESSIONAL SETTING on stupid simple shot. If you are wondering how to use your SPEEDLITE in your house, on your cat, dog, children, or anything that won't hold still and move constainly, this DVD teach you NOTHING! You can not apply anything this DVD teach you unless you own those equipments like extra stand, special tripod for reflacting board... If you do not have the equipment I mentioned, this DVD can not help you. You also need to have a flash light extented core... if you do not have it, forget about this DVD...I think this DVD sucks!The real educational DVD should teach you how to use ONE SINGLE 580EXII or 430EXII and your DSLR WITHOUT any other aditional accessories to shot picture well in live situation. NOT studio shot, NOT with all type of expensive professional accessories that people usually do not own.I think they should have change the title to "Apply SPEEDLITE to Studio Shot", this title is more likely explain what this DVD really is.
We bought this camera last summer - it worked for about a month before the lens cover stopped working properly.  We paid to ship it to the JVC Service Center in Texas, who informed us that the repair would be $500, as they wanted to 'fix' other things, such as the optical block, prism assembly, and barriar unit.  Apparently a bit of sand had gotten inside the unit (we live in CA).  We got the camera back, it worked once before the optical unit started to produce white noise video only.  JVC now had us ship it to a third party service center, who refused to look at it unless we paid an up front fee, which JVC would not cover.  We're cutting our losses, but recommend that buyers beware of this camera (very fragile), and JVC in general for the lack of good customer service.
I have a AT&T account and the sim card does not work with this device period. I called AT&T to see if they could do something at their end in order to make this device work. No such luck. Whenever I use my sim card on my various phones they all work so the problem is not about unlocking or making an adjustment at AT&T so it can be recognized by their network. I am still trying to find out if the same problem exists at other carriers.
Althought these devices are quad band GSM and thus are touted as "universal," they are not compatible with AT&T's 3G network. Some of the more scrupulous vendors inform you of this limitation albeit in small print.
Came broken-have to hold it in the computer to download. Fortunately don't need it unless I forget to put card in camera.
You will not be able to put into print what I am thinking about this item at the moment. *&?*#@*%$. I received it as a birthday gift in August. No one should ever receive something like this as a birthday gift. Life is frustrating enough on its' own! Oh and now they want me to rate the item. Just so the opinion will be accepted I will give it a '1'. But, trust me, there is no number low enough for this item.
You don't expect much from a lens add-on at this price, and this lens doesn't even deliver that. Very soft with my Coolpix. After trying it out a couple of times, I left it at home.
I bought this item-NPS200WH, and the Amazon page at the time of purchase called it out as an "OUTDOOR Remote" in the title, and under "Technical Details", and the correct OUTDOOR part # NPS200WH was specified under "Product Details". Unfortunately the vendor shipped a NRS200WH, "Indoor Remote", Note the NRS instead of the correct NPS in the part #.[...]Someone has now changed the basic top view Amazon page for the product so that the "Technical Details" page now states it is an "Indoor Remote", even though it still specifies the "Outdoor Remote" part # NPS200WH, and the page title still says it is an "Outdoor Remote" (I submitted a product detail change changing the tech detail to "Outdoor to match the part #, it will be interesting whether the title or the part #s change).Sorry, nice try. Unfortunately, this confusion is not confined to the vendor I purchased from, all the vendors who sell the product at the lower prices seem to think the P vs R makes no difference. I think one or two of the higher priced vendors might actually be selling an Outdoor NPS200WH, but I'd be careful ordering this item; I couldn't find much in the way of any way to contact vendors to verify just which part # they will ship.
I purchased my H23 from a company called satellite 4 u on ebay. No where on my paperwork did I see that I was leasing this box. Never did Direct Tv tell me that I was leasing the box until a year later when they told me I still had a box that belonged to them. They were told that I had brought the box but they claim it is their's it seems to me that they need to be taken to court for this, if I had known I was leasing a directv box I wouldn't have made the purchase in the first place.
I thought this item was bigger and more useful,it is to compact for my needs althoght the price is right
If you need a case for your Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3, keep looking. If you need a case for a really small digital camera, this would work, but there is no build quality (one of the zipper tabs fell off as I was taking it out of the package).Product description says: This item will fit all digital camera that are no thicker than 2" or wider than 5". Realistically, you could get something more like 2-2 1/2" high by 4-4 1/4" wide by 1-1 1/4" deep inside this case (these measurements are taken with the case laying on it's back). If you want to fit anything besides a camera in the case, good luck! As far as the "belt clip" goes, it's just a flimsy carabiner that hooks through an equally flimsy nylon loop. This would be a good case to keep in a large cargo pants pocket, or in a purse or fanny/backpack pocket, but securing it to a belt or exterior strap is out of the question.
Stay clear of  this unit. The speed ring is flimsy;the spot weld breaks with the slightest pressure. I've had to have it welded twice. The tightening knob on the l-bracket jams and makes it totally unusable.
Basically a useless paperweight now. For some reason, after 3 uses, it died. I hadn't gotten a chance to use it very often, but on the 3rd try (after only printing 3 other pictures before), it's died.
The quality of the prints from this product is not worth the price.  All images came out with inconsistent colors and streaks.  Thought this would make a great xmas gift but after testing was proven wrong.
Picture quality is terrible.  All pictures had a blue tint.  I thought that the size of the printer, and the size of the pictures, combined with the portability of the printer would make it worth dealing with a little less quality, but I was mistaken.  The pictures were not even tolerable.
The printer's battery life leaves me wishing I had purchased a larger plug-in device with better quality print capability, since it prints only a few photos on what I believed to be a full charge. If anyone knows of a good replacement battery, please let me know.
Flip does not make it easy to create a dvd that will play on a stamdard dvd player.  Every way I've created one, including their own software, will only play on PC's.  So now they want people to spend additional dollars for a product to play the videos on tv?  I love my flip ultra camcorder, but am very disappointed that I can't copy the videos onto dvd's and remove them from my PC.
I purchased this product hoping to be able to share the videos on my PC in one room with my big screen in another room, same floor, less than 30 feet away, wood construction home and nothing large and metallic in the way. Reading the press and the marketing on this product one would conclude that what I wanted to do was a reasonable thing to be accomplished by the Flip Share TV. Oops. the wireless network USB key has barely enough power output to reach line of sight 20 feet with consistent video streaming. I mean I put it on a notebook, sat in the same room and it could barely maintain signal between the units...shame on Flip/Cisco!! Well try and talk to tech support and they say moronic things like "it is impossible to tell what could be happening based on the type of construction in your home..." etc. and then have the gall to ask if this support answer was helpful! Pathetic! If you are offering a wireless...the key here is WIRELESS!!!...you should have enough power output to actually BE wireless. Sitting with a notebook, 5 feet from the TV is simply stupid and a poor excuse for WIRELESS. Oh wait it gets better...I purchased a wireless extender hoping that I could obtain the WAP encryption code in order to simply boost the pathetic signal and guess what...nope, the WAP is proprietary and therefore not available. But "I hope this answer was helpful"!!! No you idiots, this is not a helpful answer. Tell me how I can overcome this poor excuse of a wireless product so I do not have to return it.Bottom line is this...buy someone else's product and NOT Flip. They have image stabilization and god willing their tech support actually has graduated from some sort of technical school AND had some people skills. This is company that does not deserve to be in business when there are so many other options out there. Do not buy this product. (by the way, we like the video unit and use it all the time but it is the support...or lack thereof for image stabilization...and their supporting technology that completely sucks.
I purchased this item as a gift for a technically challenged family member who was also receiving a Flip UltraHD as a gift.  The goal was to move them from the tape camcorder world to the digital world without heavy reliance on PC knowledge.  This seemed like the logical answer as Flip has executed the download to PC with 'one-click' simplicity and I figured Flipshare TV would offer that same 'one-click' ease to TV viewing.  I was wrong!Installation: Everything was setup and installed within 5-10 minutes.  Software loaded to my PC with ease, autoloading from the USB Key.  One complaint about the TV module setup is that they only provide the RCA cables which have at best a mediocre clarity for that type of implementation.  They probably figured they could cheap out hear since most people would opt for the HDMI interface...considering their newer camcorders record in HD.  If that's the idea...then include the HDMI cable!Connectivity:  This was the huge bummer.  I expected this to work like my local home network where I could have my PC in one room and the TV in another room.  But it tells you right in the instructions to keep the USB Key and TV module unobstructed, and away from large metal objects (such as flat screen TVs) and other wireless devices...are you kidding me!  So they're basically saying dont plan on using this unless you have all modern electronics in your house in another room...real practical!  I was able to finally get the wireless connection working by moving the TV module within 10 feet of the USB key...it might be wireless...but what's the point at that range!Ease of use:  Once I finally got it working the software was easy to use and you could flip through your movies with ease.  I didnt get so far as using the channels as I decided to return this product.Summary:  Cisco (owners of Pure Digital...makers of Flip products) should be ashamed for letting this "wireless" product go out the door.  You're a networking company!
The item is too small but the description stated Large Digital Camera Bag.I did return the item and get a different camera bag from other store.
I couldn't find USB streaming. Tried all possible options in menu. There's no hint of USB streaming in attached software, and also no hint in the manual ([...]). Returning this item, unless someone explains me how to do USB streaming with this camera.Quality and form factor would've made an excellent webcam out of it, and that's why I bought it - because USB streaming was advertised.
Worst I ever purchased, not even 1 of the 5 worked. The battery in every one is dead, not charging. Must be attached to PC to work. Should get a zero star rating.
Bought this based on the positive reviews, unfortunately I should've checked around.  Many of them do not hold a charge, it's a common problem.  Have to return this as it only works when it's plugged into a USB port.  Pictures are fine, just doesn't work unless plugged into a computer.
It loaded the pictures and looks lovely as long as it is plugged in. It will not hold a charge and work when it isn't. Very disappointing. I would not recommend.
False.... My Samsung NV10 battery is at least a qtr inch too small.  No other part was compatible as well.
Totally misleading. It says it is compatible with the powershot s110 which is absolutely not correct. I needed a replacement charger and paid for overnight shipping because my son is being born. I got the charger and it doesn't work. Not only am I out of the cost of the charger, I am out the $30 I paid for Saturday shipping. This company doesn't deserve to be a reseller on Amazon I am going toile sure everyone knows about them. P
I'm sure it is comfy for big cameras, but if you have a small camera, do not buy this. Although it said it would fit my Panasonic Lumix FH20 in the description, it absolutely does not.
I bought two of these units and both units failed after they were used once. The little plastic tab that holds the battery while charging snapped off on both. The tab is too flimsy and does not stand up to use. In both instances it was the tab on the right side of the battery/ The units can still be used by putting a rubber band around the battery while it is being charged, but I would recommend you spend a little more and buy one of the competing units.
Shipping was fast and efficient but the item was defective and did not work. I did not use it right when I got it because I had enough battery charge to the camera.
This thing is crap. Ive used lots dvr's but this unit is the worst by far. Crashes in IE all the time. Cannot replay all cams at once. NO SUPPORT.
i bought this to save some money but this little guy doesnt really work... just buy the more expensive one ;(
I purchased this remote specifically for my husband's Cannon. I was sent something different that doesn't work very well. It works, but does not have a delay. If I had been sent the correct item, I might be able to properly review the product.
This item does not work but it is too much trouble to send it back.  I will just throw it away.
This product did not even work in my Wii Fit board. The board would not turn on at all with this battery pack. I would not suggest.
Didn't work.. It would charge up fine and it would fit into the battery port. But it needed to be slightly moved around to connect to the board. That doesn't work for something that you're stepping on and moving constantly. The battery would turn off on the board constantly and it would just be a big mess. I went back to using AA's in about 15 minutes.
Don't buy it. It does not work at all. I don't recommend anybody to buy it at all. It does not fit the balance board, and if you push it the clip breaks.
There is another reviewer that also stated this product does not work.  It doesn't work and I do not believe it is even compatible to the WI Fit Board.The other positive reviews can't be real.  I wish reviewers actually had to have a history of purchasing a product so these bogus reviews wouldn't exist.
The info was bad the batteries did not fit the camera listed. Then it cost me shipping both was for a problem that was not mine. I should not have been charged and shipping charges. Why am I screwed over for there problem?
Do not think you are buying this camera as picture shows. There is no lens sold with this camera and no power supply. Call whom ever you are buying this through and have them email you confirmation that you will be receiving a lens and supply with the price you are paying. Or prepare to be screwed. PLC center did it to me. I also checked with some other company named elistinka.com and they were going to do the same thing. No mention about not coming with lens pr power!!!
I bought this camera, as I was in a hurry at a local Walmart. Since Sanyo was a Japanese company and it was cheap, I felt it is okay to buy it. I was not looking to do high end photography with this camera. After using it for a few times, noticed that the parts are not strongly put together. Any rough use, they will break. The images are whitened out. The CCD sensor is of poor quality. For the same cost, I could have got one of those Pentax or Samsung cameras. If had shelled out $50 more, I could have got a Nikon coolpix S3000. The Pentax and Nikon would have given me better images and are well built. But they did not have those cameras at the store. Thinking of returning it, but not sure what the local store policy is.
Poor quality still photos, very sensitive to 'camera shake' resulting in blurred images.  Fairly good in video mode.  Short battery life.  10 second timer did not work and the battery on mine stopped taking a charge after one use.
While the light I received is good enough, it's not the one pictured. Handle configuration and switch are completely different. Could have paid less for the light I received.
I got the black rapid double as a gift. My review is after using this product after 14 portrait sessions and 3 weddings over a 2 month period. And for the record---I tightened the lock and screws on the carabiners before every shoot out of paranoia. All I can say is-- I will NEVER be able to trust this product and must warn anyone who is even considering this product. This equipment is not only intended for the obvious--- which is ease and accessibility of 2 cameras-- but it is also intended to support and protect your equipment from falling to the ground which could entail harsh surfaces... like concrete, aslphalt, or marble floors if it fails.1--- To preface---First impressions--- if you do decide to wear the straps other than the holster/vest like setup--- you will find yourself entangled like a small animal in a trap... slowly strangling and asphyxiating yourself depending on the weight of your camera and lens. For me-- 70-200 and 85 1.2 are my favorite lenses; therefore, I was lacking adequate amounts of oxygen for most of my sessions... which could have lead to the next bullet point as to why I cannot vouch for this product.2--- My 5D mark III and 70-200 IS II slammed onto concrete during a wedding-- right before the ceremony as I was switching between cameras. I'm not sure how it happened but--- my guess is the carabiner unlatched somehow and my gear endured a violent encounter with the ground rendering my equipment useless for the rest of the wedding. My second shooter literally said his balls sucked back into his body after he saw my camera smash into the ground in slow motion. If I had testicles-- I'm sure the same would've happened... instead, my ovaries and I had internal tantrums while my clients stared at me with their jaws gaping to the ground-- and I tried to remain calm after the initial shock wore off and panic ensued.I definitely know I'm not the only photographer this has happened to. So... instead of just complaining about it--- I have a suggestion. Off the bat-- when I first got this strap system---I noticed that the twist-lock mechanism on these carabiners were unreliable... yet I ignored my gut feeling and used it anyway. As a rock climber-- I am more inclined to not trust this type of locking mechanism with my life because it is easy and quite possible for ropes, straps, gear, and general movement to easily untwist the lock and cause human beings to plummet to the ground.... Or in my case---expensive camera equipment. For climbing----I personally only use carabiners with this type of locking mechanism: [...] --- these require a twisting lock, but these also have a pressure sensitive button, a locking sleeve, and a contoured gate that requires intention and slightly more precision in order to unlatch. I would recommend that Black Rapid consider moving towards this type of lock-design in order to prevent future malfunctions.I would also recommend that they compensate me for product failure... and while we're at it-- royalties on research and product development ;) but really. I want my money back.
The rubber gasket that sits between the bracket and the screen comes off very quickly and easily. This item, like all of Zacutos products, is extremely overpriced.
I wanted an inexpensive, basic Flip-style camcorder as a backup for my old Flip cam and the Coby Snapp 3001 seemed like a good choice. For about $30 (plus another $15 for an SD card), the price was right. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera was very poor. The lens cover came off as I was peeling the protective cellophane off, and the tripod mount connector broke off the first time I mounted it on a tripod.The video quality was fine, and the camera was very easy to use, but even though my needs are fairly basic this camera was not sufficient. It was the first item I ever purchased from Amazon that I had to return.I settled on aKodak PlayFull HD Video Camera - BlueSilverwith which I've been very pleased. It's only a little more expensive, provides great video and audio quality, and is simple to use. An excellent Flip-style camcorder.
I bought for my son to take on a class trip.  I fully charged it and it would not work.  Wpound up buying him a better one the night before the trip.  Glad I tested it out first.  I threw it away out of frustration.
I purchased this for my children to use as the cost was appealing. They got to use it one time. We turned it on again and it won't work at all. I changed batteries and still nothing. Very sorry I spent the money.
Ripp off awful dead battery rotten customer servicebe ware of these old batteries I give up on these guys agh
The packaging for this product is terrible. The sign sticks so badly to the sign, the paint sticks to the surface making the sign useless. I kept the decals because they were OK, and I already had one order replaced. I wanted the decals right away I didn't have time to wait for a third replacement. I would certainly not recommend that anyone order this product unless the company can figure out how to get it to the consumer without being ruined.
I was expecting something more realistic looking to scare off possible intruders.  I threw these out.  A good buy, but worthless to me.
Don't waste your money. This doesn't charge either type of battery. It's not what it is pictured like on amazon. It' similar, but the indicator and charger don't work. I would definately not recommend this to anyone. Just buy rechargables, and a regular battery recharger. Simple.
broke before i used it leg broke off when  closing need to  tell owner not to try to close with leg out .
I have not used the 1050mAh battery and travel charger at this time and will be put in use on my vacation.
My unit was dead on arrival. It will not turn on at all. Since this is fulfilled by Amazon but not sold by Amazon there is no option for replacement and now I get to return it and pay more to replace it since the price has gone up in the meantime.
Really bad for video quality looks terrible, the inside memory is not working anymore, the photos looks nice but if you move around the frame you see black screen.
It came broken, the tech was very helpful but when i went to order another one, the price went up by 40 dollars to 179 dollars.
Would not display my pictures in the order I placed them on the memory card, I even named them numercially and made sure the shuffle option was off. The remote control didn't work either. Huge waste of money
This thing arrived smashed from the inside out.  I dont know if the inner workings are that fragile, but this does not ship well.
