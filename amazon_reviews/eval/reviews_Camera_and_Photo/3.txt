The i-zone is good for parties and various places on the go but I wouldn't rate it too highly because the photo size is so small. I know the idea is the create tiny little keepsakes but it means that it just isn't big enough to look at properly. The other disadvantage is the sticky film isn't very sticky at all, which defeats the purpose of that.
This is fun to use because you can stick it on a magnet to put in on the fridge or just about anywhere you like.  However, the film is costly.  It's better to buy the films 4 in a pack because it's less cost.
I was really excited when i got my I-zone in the mail, But i thought it came with film- big dissapointment. make sure you have the film ready when it comes, cause now im broke and sad :(
It may have been the film that I purchased with this that didn't work but that pictures never came out right. I wish I would've just purchased a regular polaroid instant camera.
I went to  my local kmart or walmart or one of those mart stores :). My friend puchased this fine looking camera in silver (not the purple I wanted her to get) and were excited to find that it came with six pics free,they werent the best of quality but they are the kind of pictures you take of friends at random moments and look back on years later and smile. We'll we took six random pictures of each other and we went back to get some more film. she didnt have that much money and we were sad to see the huge prices for a small amount of film but we bought some anyway ,using up her remaining dollars.For some reason she was still very satisfied with her camera even though it had ripped her off to an extent.It does have some good sides: it comes in some great colors, Taking the pictures is very fun,it is small and has a wrist cord,and you can take double exposures. To take a double exposure you take a picture and dont tke the film out then take a picture of sometihng else.I enjoyed taking a picture of a person in one facial expresion the take a picture in the same position with a differnt expression.Quite fun
This was the model with the "rose" icon. So the first version they made. Still works fine and the optics are excellent
Canon's 28-105 lens is nice.  It borders on great, but doesn't quite make it.  First, the good stuff.  Optically, the lens performs well.  It is sharp, and maintains contrast well, particularly when used with a hood.  The full-time-manual USM focusing is perhaps the best feature of the lens, which allows the user to manually adjust the focusing without having to flip a switch.  The lens does have an autofocus/manual focus switch for completley disabling autofocus, though.  The zoom range is convenient for general use.  Now, let's talk about some of the drawbacks.  The aperture range (f3.5 to f4.5) is somewhat limiting for lower-light photography, and for portraiture when you want to throw the background out of focus.  The lens does exhibit barrel distortion.  The body construction doesn't feel quite as sturdy as some of Canon's other lenses.  Overall, the lens is a pretty good compromise of quality, price, focal range, performance, and optics.
I recommend this camera for kids and for young teenagers - with some reservations. The pictures are not great, but the kids will have great fun.  At $19.99 the price is not an issue. Where Polaroid makes money is on the  sticky back film. It can get expensive to buy the film real soon. This is  the main reason for the three stars. Should Polaroid come up with a cheaper  film I will be happy to revise my rating.
Just so you know, the BP522 battery can be used for the entire ZR series from ZR20 up to ZR90.  (I checked the Canon website to verify.).  An extended battery is definitely needed because the one provided with the camcorder has such as short battery life.  But you can buy a generic battery made by Energizer (ER-C590) for $60-70 at the typical home electronics stores (i.e. Circuit City and Best Buy).  You can also go online and find 2.5 hour batteries for as low as $35.99.  Can't say whether they last as long as this one, but my Energizer did last for about 3 years with intermittent use (filming my kids...you know how that goes...lots of taping for the 1st year and then less and less as time goes on...).
Overall an average camera. I would expect more from a trusted name like Nikon. At times, photos come out over-exposed. Generally, images are sharp and clear. Camera is light-weight and very easy to operate. Camera must be held still to get the sharpest photos. Sometimes daylight shots come out grainy. A good camera if your expectations are not too high.
Product was not as described but they made up for the issue as best and swiftly as they could. Person I dealt with was friendly and did not make it more of an hassle or inconvenient than it already was. Great customer service!!!!
The main thing I liked about this grip is that it uses AA batteries. I haven't done a real test but my Duracell DX1500 NiMH 1.2V rechargeable batteries seem to work fine. But like I said, I haven't used it out on the field yet so they may be a total failure. I like how cheap and available AA batteries are but if you aren't shooting film enough to constitute the $30 price tag (what I got it off Amazon for), then it may be a better choice to stick w/ the CR2 lithiums.I wanted to give this a 3.5 star rating and round up to a 4 but decided to keep it at 3 because it doesn't have the exposure buttons/wheel on it which is kind of annoying. I mean, that's the whole point of a grip is to be able to shoot portrait more comfortably. So you have to set the exposure where you want it and then just be happy that you have a button there. God forbid you accidentally leave it on and bump it on something...oh no, wasted frame!
Just doesn't fit terribly tightly in my Vivitar flash and tends to rattle around, which makes it sound cheap.
I use this with a Vivitar 285.  The diffusion is excellent, but it is a little clumsy to get on and off the flash.  It is held by a couple of tabs that don't fit all that well.  (I also have a Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce for a Pentax flash that slips over the entire head and it goes on and off very easily.)  It kills shadows and spreads the light very well.  Since it spreads the light so much, it also drops the flash brightness quite a bit (as expected).
This type of product is really a must have.  I bought it for my speedlight 430ex.  The only problem is that it is made to fit several types of flashes and as such it is held on by pressure.  This means it will fall off very easily if brushed against something.  Other than that it does exactly what it is made to do.  Makes portraits so much warmer.  No more glaring flash assisted shots especially when bouncing off of a surface.  I would have liked to have been able to try this before I bought it.  I might have looked further for one that fit a little better.  But perhaps this is as good as it gets.
Diffusers like this one work well when the lens barrel/hood extends well in front of the flash -- I bought this one to use with Canon G series and a 420EX, and was disappointed to discover that the combination was unusable --  the direct light from the diffuser strikes the lens and ruins every shot.
Frankly, any of the cheaper knock-offs are probably better deals.  It's just a piece of translucent plastic and as long as it fits it will do about the same as any other.  Don't agonize over quality, just buy a lower-priced equivalent and tuck it away in your camera bag for the rare occasion where it will come in handy to soften the light a little.
I bought this with my Digital Rebel package because it seemed like a wise investment.  Also, I read a couple reviews elsewhere that recommended it.However, I have found that I generally don't need it because the 420EX is so intelligent.  Given that the 420EX gauges the scene and adjusts itself accordingly, to decrease the amount of flash further may underexpose the shot.The Omni-Bounce is handy if you need a really soft light, especially close-up.  (The underexposing issue seems more significant as distance gets greater.)  So, it can be useful for portraits, shooting something reflective or for fill-flash.The other problem I have is the price; $16.95 for a simple piece of plastic is rather absurd, really.  A quarter the price would be more fitting.
It fit to tight to my Sunpak 433D. It requires a hard push to install it in the rail of the flash, and I have to use the screw driver to take it out.
Just received mine today.  I immediately noticed what some others have pointed out... The retaining clip is an extremely tight fit. So tight I worried that it might pry open the top of the flash as I tried to slide it in place.  I stopped midway through sliding it on and decided not to use it.  It also adds some bulk to my already large sunpack 383.  So instead, I simply double wrapped a large rubber band around the top of the flash.  With the rubber band in place, the omni-bounce sits comfortably on the flash without the need for the tight/bulky clip.  The rubber band holds it in place nicely and it is very easy to install/remove.  I expected a little better than this considering I am paying $10 for 2 small pieces of plastic.  Luckily, there are simple workarounds for this.
This clamp is advertized as coming with a short stud.  Mine arrived with no stud.  I am unhappy about that.
It works ok. You have to brush a lot to remove dust and still leaves quite a few dust sprinkles.. I'm not sure if there really is a good anti dust solution out there.
The product I received did not look like the picture.It does work, and I had no problem getting it on and off the camera or my old lenses-- but be GENTLE!As stated in other reviews, it will not infinity focus. This wasn't a big problem for me, as I was mostly enjoying being able to use my macro lens again, but it was a bit irritating. If you need infinity focus, of course don't buy this!If, like me, you are considering this just to play around with those old lenses, go for it! If you are expecting to get pro grade awesome photos out of it, you probably won't without a lot of work.
I wish there is slightly more elasticity to the material so when an object is wrapped certain area doesn't pop up or have their corners sticking out.It does a good job for protection, color and texture is satisfactory as well.  The 15 in is a bit more useful than the 11 inch wraps in my application.
Buy large size or you'd better use a camera case that fits well. ok product but not very excited about the quality.
I wish I could just ask questions directly about this item, it would make it much easier to know what they are selling. It's hard to purchase an item like this when they do not let you know what modification to the Metz SCA 3202 they are selling.The picture makes one think this may be the very first modification "M", which was produced in 11/00. They have six other modifications after that, M2 through M7. The M5 modification on 04/06 made it compatible with cameras like the 45 CL-4 & 76 MZ-5, and others, the last modification in 12/08 M7 made modifications for the some Panasonic models. If this is really the first version M, then it is old. It will probably work with your camera, except for certain functions that I am unaware of.They really need to be more specific about this item!
I used these same standard trays years ago in my darkroom.  They are decent quality and will do the job.  There is no problem with quality of the trays or delivery from Adorama.The issue is the color of the trays.  I am trying to set up a simple darkroom since my eight year old is getting interested in photography.  I thought she would learn photo processing more easily using different color trays.  That is the only reason I ordered the set rather than individual trays.  The set has three red trays.  This is no set! It is just three of the same color.  If you want different colors, apparently you need to order each separately.
This is a nice case, but it is LARGE. Don't believe the 8 1/2" dimension. It's almost twice that.
I was planning a trip to Europe and thought this monopod support might be a good option that would allow me to leave my tripod behind.  I have a Manfrotto carbon fiber monopod, so I hoped to travel very light.  I envisioned leaning the monopod with pictured support bracket against a hand rail, or perhaps a wall to steady my camera.  Although very well constructed, as is the case with most Manfrotto products, I was disappointed that this product really isn't capable of supporting anything but the smallest of cameras.  It simply wouldn't support my digital SLR with lens attached.  The ball head is very small and not capable of supporting much weight.  I think this product would work very well with a smaller camera, like the Canon G11 that I also own, but is inadequate for larger cameras. I returned this product and took my tripod along on my trip.
It's okay for someone filming skateboarding, but I wouldn't go any further with it than that, especially with the LEDs in the market today. The battery is heavy and can be annoying to lug around. The bulbs blow easily and an auto shut off charger is a must to not overcharge these batteries. I give it a 3 of 5..
My other review i spoke of my UW casing. used it once but the rubber of casing broke so no casing no use for sillica gel.the one time i did use it..... great job.
Actually I have a Casio camera and the underwater case and could not find anywhere spare parts (silica) for my case, so I found the Olympus one, which fits well to the Casio case. The only issue is that this is a quite expensive product. It is just silica, which comes from free in most products and Adorama has charged it as it was gold.
I bought this spike set to fit a recently purchased 190XPROB.  It turns out that Manfrotto manufactured 2 different tripod sizes under the 190 series label.  While this product description states it fits all 190 series tripods, it actually only applies to those manufactured prior to September 2004 and prior to a certain serial number.The newer spike set is then 190SPK2N.  I would really just recommend that you measure the last leg section to make sure the spike set fits.  It will either be 19mm (older) or 16mm (newer).  Check Manfrotto's website for more specifics.
I was concerned about the range since the distance from the gate to the house is about 250 feet.  It works just fine at that distance.  It's easy to set up and it has very few false alarms - mine gets the full sun on the sensor at mid afternoon and that makes it chime.  My problem has been reliability:  the first system worked fine for about 10 days and then the receiver went dead.  I called the company and they sent me another one right away.  The second receiver did everything except chime! so I sent that one back too.  The third receiver arrived and it has been working perfectly for the last 6 days - I'm worried, we'll see.  I would not buy another one.Update:  It's been three months and the system continues to work well.  I just replaced the battery on the sensor after three months of use - I think 4 batteries a year is going to be my additional expense for this and I find it reasonable.Second update:  It's been a year, the system continues to work very well and  I've only used two batteries for the year.Third update:  It's been over three years now and the system has worked without a glitch.  It's using two batteries per year.
First attempt to install module failed because there was not enough information notifiying you that it need to be on the same 115v phase leg of a split 220v leg. Lucky I read reviews on product and saw the feedback from another reviewer. You can just install the module anywhere you want then move the remote transmitter/controller  around til it works(same branch phase) or if you have the electrical equipment to trace it out.
It's a good quality product, but i just don't use it any more. Probably used it only one time.Intended to protect my camera when I place my camera in my messenger bag, but my 5D with grip is just too big to throw in my side bag.Can't really bring my large camera out without bringing a dedicated camera bag. the smaller version on a standard low range slr should be fine though and may get more use out of it.
The straps work fine but they are not black. Service was quick and price is good. But not black straps as asked for.
No great bargin here...pictures can be deceiving. These are light weight straps that are good for wires or small items only. There are no buckles on the end it's just a cut out from the same material. They are thin and at 8" long so they don't hold much.I was hoping for something much stronger (and bigger...I should have gotten the tape measure out) but they'll work for something.
Camera case is much much smaller than I expected and unattractive but functional. No problems with the batteries or charger so far.
This was my first digital camera.  At the time, the price was great!  I have used it over and over.  My main complaint is the viewing window is too small.  In the future I would choose a camera with a much larger window.
This camera makes clear pictures and is easy to use. However I cannot recommend it because of the annoying long shutter lag. It is ok for stationary or posed pictures but not for action shots. It is almost impossible to get a decent picture of an active child or pet.
The headset works great playing music from my MP3 player, however the microphone for the cell phone is less than great. Many people that I have talked to while using the headset state that they cannot hear me clearly.
I LIKE MY PURCHASE;IT WAS PRICED RIGHT.RECEIVED THE ITEM ON TIME.BUT,I AM NOT SURE IF THESE BATTERIES HAVE ANY WARRANTY.IF SO WHAT DOES THE WARRANTY COVER FOR AND VALID TILL WHEN?
Great looking case and well made.  With a jigsaw puzzle-like interior, it will probably hold any kind of memory disc on the market, but it will only hold two of them - - total.  For its size, I would expect more.  After discovering its limited capacity, I discarded it in favor of a less expensive and less bulky alternative that would hold four discs.  Unless you only need two spare cards, and don't mind the bulk, don't waste your money.
This little Sandisk case is handy and inexpensive, but I like the Gepe card safes. They're more secure and they close tighter. I'm a professional photographer, and I've tried them all.
If you don't carry this around, then you should have no problem with this. I like the looks but hate opening it to find the cards loose.
This product will do your job, but it doesn't have the quality. Anyways, its a lot cheaper than the other Samsonite alternatives, and you don't really need superb quality for such a simple job anyway.
This is a pretty awesome product except that my mounting clip doesn't provide a secure fit to my T1i!  It doesn't screw on securely to the camera, allowing the camera to rotate freely on the mount -- totally defeating the purpose of the tripod.  I'll have to add a washer in between the screw and the mount or use painter's tape like another reviewer mentioned.  Disappointing.
This is my second garilla pod I bought it because I wanted to use a second camera in odd locations using the pod. My first one I boughtwas rated at just over 7 pounds and worked great for my 7d with smaller lenses on it and worked great for my xsi with any of my lenses.This one however can only hold my XSI with a 50mm or 35mm lens on it. I tried with my EF 17-40 f/4L and I did a not want to hold itwhere I wanted it at all. I was going to return it but now my parents took it and I will be buying the heavier rated pod again.all and all if you have a light DLSR or point and shoot camera you were thinking about getting this for, it will meet all expectations.They are great for travel nice and small, all around I love them as a go anywhere  tripod.
For the most part, this is a great tripod.  I particularly like that I can bend it to fit in an inconveniently-shaped spot in my camera bag.  The removable mount is also nice -- I generally keep it on my camera all the time, so I can just snap it onto the tripod when I need it.It gets only 3 stars, though, for being unable to hold my camera sideways (ie. portrait orientation).  The joint between the mount and the central ball needs to be much, much stronger.  This isn't a heavy camera -- one of the lighter dSLRs with a prime lens -- which makes me wonder what the "SLR" designation is supposed to indicate.  Maybe I should have gotten the Zoom version, but I'm not willing to spend $50 to find out.
I bought this item for a trip we were going on, but the trip has been postponed.  I have not had the opportunity to truly test or use this item.  I have played with it for a few minutes only to see if it is at all what I wanted, it appears to be and I think I will be happy with it.  I do not feel I can judge it until further use.  I do not think I will be disappointed though.
Note that this clip only fits the GP2....I have a GP3 and a GP1 that it won't fit.It would be much better to fit all models!
For long exposures you really need a traditional tripod and not this.  The flex in the legs means that you'll have movement for a heavy SLR ( I have a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi).  With that said, it's very well made and the tripod is useful for other duty and also is a great handhold.  I recommend their lighter model (or even this one) for lighter point and shoots on long exposures but heavy cameras do not stay stable for long enough on this.  Still a useful part of your kit however.
This would only be good for the smallest of SLRs.  Its a little big for point n' shoots but thats what it works best with.
This item would have benefited with a swivel mount for the camera. This would have made it much easier to level the camera.
The Gorillapod for Digital SLR cameras can't support a medium-sized SLR with a hotshoe flash attached.  I was disappointed to discover that even with some creative positioning of the legs, it just wouldn't stay up, and nearly dropped my camera on the ground.If you have a medium-sized DSLR with a hotshoe flash, you may want to get the next size up of the Gorillapod.
Pros:very light and portablesupports P&S;'s easily; will work with a light DSLR and small zoom if the angle is not too extremeWill allow perspectives unavailable/unattainable with conventional tripods and mini fixed leg tripodsCons:legs are kinda fiddly, you'll have to adjust the legs many times because as you move the camera to compose the shot the legs will loosen.Make sure your legs are FIRMLY wrapped around SMOOTH objects, O/W the whole rig may SLOWLY rotate or slipOVERALL:reasonably priced camera accessory which will do things you can't O/W do; small, flexible and light enough to carry along in a large pocket or jammed into a crowded bag
I have a Nikon D5000, which I sometimes use with the kit lens (18-55mm) or a 55-200mm zoom lens. This tripod is adequate to support the camera on a level surface, perhaps even a soft, level surface such as grass. It does feel somewhat flimsy in doing so, however; I need to ensure it's really holding otherwise it will start to slowly bend at the legs. Also, don't expect this tripod to properly hold a D5000-sized camera if you want to wrap the legs around something: the camera is too heavy for this. One time I was wrapping the legs around a wooden post and I accidentally snapped one of the balls from its joint. I was able to snap it back together, but it was somewhat dissapointing. Needless to say, I did not risk my D5000...Overall, I would NOT recommend this tripod for a DSRL, even the D5000 which is a smaller, lighter DSLR.To give the manufacturer, Joby, some credit their website does state that the maximum recommended weight of the camera for this tripod is 800 Grams, and recommends the Gorillapod SLR-Zoom for the D5000, which supports up to 3 Kg (6.6 Lbs) according the website.
I love having a flash clip for gorillapod.  Gorillapod allows me to hang my flash from tree branches or lamp posts to get lighting angles I couldn't otherwise get without toting a very large light stand.  However, this clip does not secure the flash very well.  You will need extra support for your lights to keep them in place at unusual angles.
I have a finepix HS10(which is a prosumer) and it weighs around 636 grms(batteries not included). I bought this tripod for my camera because the ad says that it loads till 800 grms. And it does!! The only problem is that when you have your camera mounted, it is kind of difficult to manoueuvre the tripod. It looks like the tripod didnt have 100% stability. I recommend using the tripod first, I mean, put it in the position you want, and then mount your camera. I still think it doesn't offer good stability, though.
Over-all, I like this product, and it's working well for me, immediately.However, I take these product evaluations seriously, so there are some things a prospective buyer should know:It may be a tad "ambitious" to name this the "SLR" version.Personally, I would not use this on an SLR, unless you have a really light and cheap one.Do yourself a favor, if you want this kind of tripod, and plan to use it on an SLR, get the next model up.  The "SLR ZOOM",whether you're using a long lens or not.This one is appropriate for a "point-n-shoot".  Very sturdy for that application.I'm using it mainly with a Samsung TL500 which is a pretty heavy compact cam at close to 400g (just under a pound).I wouldn't trust it with anything heavier.It has one obvious problem, so lets get that out of the way.I was amazed that the quick-mount plate is a loose and sloppy fit.At the premium price Joby asks for it's product, I expect better.The whole POINT of a tripod is to hold the camera firm and steady.A wobbly mount plate is unforgivable.  It guarantees that the cam will wiggle.On the bright side, you just wrap the mount plate with a bit of blue "Painter's tape" to take up the slack, and it's good to go.But one shouldn't have to do that.(Painter's tape is the best stuff in the universe,  I am never without it.)Now for the good part:It's very light, trim, and sturdy if used with light cam, and extremely versatile.I'm not sure how long it's going to survive, (all plastic) but at least for now, it can really grab quite well onto things,which gives me a lot more freedom, and lets me work FAST.  I like that.But here's a tip...To help get steadier shots with long exposures (expecially on wobbly mount plates) if you don't have a remote or cable release, use the "timer" option.Most cams have 2 second and 10 second self timer options.  That's what the 2-second option is for.  Just pressing the shutter button is enough tovibrate the camera.  Two seconds gives it time to calm down.  Try it.  You're images will come out sharp as a tack.Scoring this was diffiult.(AMAZON: we need HALF-point options please!)I must knock off a full point for the loose mount plate. That's only fair.Secondly, I'm really feeling obligated to bang another 1/2 point off for the price.I appreciate design innovation, and Joby came to market with a good idea.  But honestly, the item is over-priced by more than double, given the quality.Mind you, I still recommend this product because of it's unique versatility.Just be aware of it's issues, and it should work well for you.-Berk
This model claims to be able to hold up an SLR, and I would debate what SLR they are discussing. I own a Konica Minolta 5d, and the G-Pod will not hold it up on a flat table. I have a little more luck on railings and branches, but the grip is not confience building.On the other hand, this thing is awesome when holding my Olympus C-5050 rangefinder camera and other slightly lighter cameras. Finally, I have been able to use it to help stabilize my SLR when I have other items to help make it safe, but it is just not robust.
This Gorillapod should be able to hold the weight of a Nikon D90 with 18-105mm lens...but it doesn't!  The camera will slowly tip over in a matter of seconds.  And although the bubble level is a great idea, the threads don't align with the camera, so the level is not at the back where it should be.  The level is basically useless when it's off to the side where you can't see it!In general I love Gorillapods...I have a little one for my point-and-shoot which does its job perfectly!  So if you have a lighter camera and don't need the bubble level, I'd still recommend a Gorillapod.
This is a great product. Make sure you go by the model recommendations on the joby website. I had a Canon A 620 and the basic Gorillapod cannot take the weight of this heavy camera (even though its not an SLR), so I had to go for the gorrilapod SLR. Works great, can be easily wound around any support. I also tried to use it on a fixed support on a small cement mound near the Eifell tower and works well that way too. Make sure you wrap the legs around real tight. I would recommend this product.
Good but not durable.  I bought one of these gorillapods a little over 18 months ago, for use on a vacation. It was quite handy and seemed to perform as intended however, don't bother with this version if you use a long lens. The legs are very unstable with a "front" weighted camera.  It works ok with a standard (50mm) lens on your SLR, just be sure to put one leg forward, under the lens.  I have used this very little in the past 6-8 months but noticed that one of the legs has lost it's ability to stay in place. It has lost the friction necessary to keep it upright and slides out from under the camera (SLR only).  The solution from Joby was to glue this joint in place, which is a nice band-aid but I was really hoping that this tripod was going to be more robust for the cost.  If your out of the warrnty period, which appears to be one year, you're out of luck, out of a triod, and out your money.I did notice that its a little difficult to get the camera exactly level. It seems that the force required to overcome the friction to level it, allows you to overcorrect in the opposite direction forcing more correction back the other way. You end up with a compromise that you will need to fix your image in a photo editing tool.Make sure you have a coin available to mount this on your camera, you won't get it secured with your finger nail. The gray section on the top with the stud you see in the picture seperates from the base and mounts to the bottom of your camera. The black "button" in the front just under the gray pad, with Joby on it is the release mechanism.
This photo keychain has a sleek design and nice user interface.  The software is so-so - easy to navigate, but very limited photo-editing capability.  My main criticism is the screen resolution is terrible.  It's very grainy, like the first digital camera I bought in 1996.  With today's amazing advances in miniaturization of memory and displays, this device should have crystal-clear photos, not blurry ones.All-in-all, ALMOST a terrific product, and still a good product if you don't mind the grainy display.
I purchased 4 of these units for my wife and children. They arrived promptly and all worked. The concept is great, and I feel the $50 price is ok. I give this product less than 5 stars because of the cumbersome software included, which is necessary to load the digital pictures onto the unit itself. In addition, the resolution, while barely adequate, is much less than I expected. I haven't been able to find any specs as to the number of pixels. I'll guess 160 x 160.Tips for best use of this software:Any disconnect of the keychain device before, during and after downloading will immediately kill the program, so be sure to save your working pictures at regular intervals.Save your work before downloading, as the program will clear the working buffers without giving you the opportunity to save it --- a problem if you want to retain your edits.The resolution of this display is extremely small, so use their software to crop as much out of the picture as you can before saving it to the work area. The cropping forces the same width to length constraints regardless of the size of the cropping. Portrait-oriented images require the most creative use of the crop tool.The brightness and contrast change options are adequate, but I recommend that you do as much as possible with your camera's post-processing software before using the Brookstone supplied software.
well this is a really  neat gift idea..however I tried to add a few pics to it before i gave it to my sister for xmas, & I downloaded the CD...well then when i connected the keychain it said "could not connect. sO i Called brookstone, who does not have any tech support,  and they told me the only time you should use the CD was if you have anything less than XP...well I have XP. this whole thing is just not user friendly...so if anyone has any IDEA how to use this thig will you PLEASE let me know??? thanks much !
The camcorder itself works very well for my purposes, but it took some work to learn how to edit files on my PC. The software that comes with the camcorder seems to be of very poor quality. The files will not open in Windows Movie Maker, but after some work I was able to open them with Adobe Premiere Elements.
This camcorder isn't all that bad.  Video quality is average.  Video looks decent on a regular tv, but not so good on a high-res widescreen, even though the camcorder can be set on 16:9.  The only aspect of it that I think is excellent is the audio quality.  I'm not very experienced with digital camcorders but I think I could've gotten something better for the money.  Some other camcorders, like Panasonic, can double as a web cam also, which would be nice.
The picture quality is good, and the camcorder is easy to use. There are challenges, however, when using a DVD-RW in obtaining synch'ed sound/picture and direct capturing audio with picture to a Mac (PC compatibility seems fine). This model also does NOT have an external microphone jack (there is such a jack on the DZ-HS303A model). The internal mic audio quality is good, but not satisfactory for more sophisticated needs.
At full sun light and highest res. setting, the color is vibrant (red is a bit over saturated); at low light the video quality is horrible.  Accept under bright light, it was much worse than my 10+ years old Sony.  For some reason, I kept forgeting to turn the dial to off position - drained the battery.I returned the camera for something better.
Received this unit today and compared with Elura 100 on tape, low light seemed poor by comparison. I'm sure HD and DVD features good for transfer from camera to PC, but without good picture quality, these features are useless. Overall very disappointed. Returning unit via prescribed return process.
Reliable and good feature but brook in less than a year; I bought the camera at the end of 2007; and the inside transistor got burn, according to the warranty Tech, but it's fixable..... maybe I had a bad apple??
PROS+ Insane zoom (1200x digital) Who needs binoculars when you have THIS?+ Hybrid storage feature (Built in 8GB HDD, Mini DVD, SD card) &lt;-- Makes things very flexible.+ Pretty Small and Attractive design+ Dubbing from HDD to Mini DVD!+ Records in Stereo+ Inexpensive!CONS- The auto focus will freak out if you zoom too much or if it's dark and then you pass a bright light source. I don't recommend for night recording because of this. But during the day it's almost perfect.- If you lose the software, you are pretty much screwed because the only way to access your data in the correct format is to purchase the software or pirate the software. If you just drag and drop you will have to convert .vro to mpeg2 (which is a nuisance and silly) but none the less a free and legal work around...- It records in Mpeg2. Outdated much?- You can't dub without having the battery ADAPTER attached. It just won't let you. I lost mine...- The battery Life is laughable (though it may be because my battery is getting worn).CONCLUSIONIt is the best starter digital camcorder anyone can buy. Hence "Starter". I recommend this to anyone who is looking for their first camcorder or for someone who wants a cheap way to record a road trip or vacation. Which is what I did and it does it job. Except at night in the city. Extreme dark + Extreme light is as confusing to the auto focus as a badger is to algebra. I know I've already said that once, but I just want everyone to understand where it lacks. There's no reason to rate this any less than 3 (average) stars because it really is a decent camera.
Found this product to be very handy.  Although the video resolution is below my expection, it's good enough for viewing in my computer.
Were I to market a lovely high tech product, I should write instructions user-friendly to those unfamiliar with multiple cords, ports, and so on.
I bought the camera. I like its dimensions, easy usage and taking videoclips on a SD memory card. I have just a very big problem. The included software doesnt work properly. My computer is able to show the camera and card either. Unfortunatelly the motionSD studio software always sais that "there is nothing recorder, however a clips have been taken...
So far, the main complaint that I have is that there is no lens cap.  I cant imagine Panasonic did not come up with this.  This is a small one, easy to carry around, which probably is the reason it is getting a lot of smudges on the lens all the time.
I bought my Sony GPS in Kyoto while visiting Japan. My wish was to both use it for tagging my photos with position, and at the same time get an overview where I went to which time. The problem I experienced was that it is a bit inaccurate, especially while walking in the city with tall buildings, in parks with trees or being in a car, train or airplane (keeping it against the windows). That means that it gave me a hard time while I was staying in Japan, because I was just in these kind of environments. My pictures got offset from where they actually were taken and there were big "jumps" in my trails. I suspect that the GPS does not have the HW it takes.For the SW application I can't say whether it is good or not, as it was all in japanese. So in case it would be brilliant, I've rated this product as 3. Else I would not hesitate to rate it as a 2.ChR
Lens are fine, but the filters don't fit any of the attachements.  It's like they are a different thread.
A good way to save photos BUT you must be vigilant when downloading.  Make sure that you check immediately upon completion of the download to make sure ALL the photos were downloaded.  I neglected to do this and lost many many photos!  The unit shuts off after a mere 30 seconds, so you have to watch the download and immediately upon seeing the 100% indicator, hold the "Enter" button to make sure all the images were in fact downloaded. If you neglect to do this, the 30 sec. shut off will kick in and you'll not be able to make sure all the images were downloaded. The 30 second automatic shut off creates havoc.  There does not seem to be any way to go back to the #of files and folders once you've shut the Digital Foci off, you can only access the available space at that point.
I had to replace the trolling motor transducer for my X24 because the cable kept getting caught in the trolling motor bracket and got cut.  The cable is made up of wires so fine as to make repairing the old cable almost out of the question.The transducer works just fine as long as you protect the cable.
It works, but the voltage is barely able to power the camera.  I wish it was better than it is, but it does work..
This lens hood PH-RBA52 will not fit the DA 18-55mm WR lens that comes with either the Pentax K7 or the Pentax K-5.
Compliments the Nikon DVD for the D5000. Very inexpensive and worth keeping in camera bag for reviewing tips.
Was hoping that this dvd has more help in it. Didnt learn much from it, as a personal whos is learning about their digital it gave me no help. waste of money.
This DVD gives a good overview of some of the features that a digital SLR camera offers, and seems to be directed a those of us who have been using point-and-shoot cameras.  It does a pretty good job of introducing P&S users to the most basic options that are available in an SLR, but it's only an introduction.  I watched it once and may watch it again, but I'm finding that I get more information from several books that do the same thing in much greater detail.  The DVD is probably as good a way as any to get started, but it won't take you very far. For that, you'll need a good book aimed at the beginning digital SLR user.
Decent value. Large tripod quite flimsy. Charger has no auto off feature. If you forget and charge > 24 hours you can fry your batteries
Really does not like when I use my portable phone and in the kitchen it hates the microwave.  But for the money it is ok and does what I want of it.
THe wrap itself is actually durable, but the area to insert the iphone is not well made at all.  The little slit ripped as soon as I put the phone in.  Worse than that, the sides where the see-thru plastic meets the silicone gel wrap is glued.  The phone actually touches the glue and the glue stays on the phone.  I was less than pleased upon seeing that.  The glue has a tough time coming off as well.  Maybe mine was defective, but I don't know.  Still it's the best for the money.
The installation instructions are a joke.  There are no good online guides and breaking your dash costs way to much money to make it worth it.  Just plan on spending another $100 or so having it installed and see if it is worth it.
Wish it would burn video at the highest setting, I don't like this limitation but it does work well, I just cannot take my "high quality" videos which was one reason I purchased the camera I have. I hope they can update the software one of these days, I would then give it 5 stars.
I should have get Sony HD Cam and Sony version of this!!! I was expecting something like Sony, that support regular burning of STANDARD DEFINITION DVD. No recording support of DVD+R/RW DL!!! Dual Layer DVD-R is too expensive than DL DVD+R.Sony was the one who first released a recorder like this! CANON SHOULD HAVE MADE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT AND MAKE THIS A BETTER PRODUCT!!!UPDATE! My advice is save yourself some money and trouble by buying a DVD recorder/player with HD upconverter and you'll be more happy!Too bad I have an HG10 camcorder and I can't share a Standard DVD to family back in the Philippines with this recorder.This is a great if you only want to share AVCHD DVD!
I do not have this DVD burner yet. I am very interested in this burner. However, there is no any customer write his review until now. Canon does not give a detail description of performance  of its playback function. It is not available to download its user's manual from Canon. I do NOT know how to playback the DVD created by this burner. Does it playback immediately after we insert the DVD like common DVD player? Or, we have to wait this DVD burner to transfer back all files from the DVD back to the camcorder before we can see any video on the HDTV? I am very appreciate if someone can answer my question.
This Canon DW-100 DVD burner works great for AVCHD & SD/DVD formats, but it doesn't work with the R/DL (extra capacity) discs. I'm only able to utilize DVD-R discs, so this product is guilty of false advertisment. I've attempted to contact Canon Tech support (serveral times), but I recieve no response what-so-ever. Be cafeful when ordering any electronics via the Internet!
Works well, but AVCHD discs will not play on all bluray players but I know how to convert the disks so they will play on all Bluray machines.
I bought this burner thinking that I'd never have to use a computer to burn DVDs. However this burner doesn't give you the option between AVCHD DVDs and SD DVDs, so I still have to use the computer to make SD DVDs. It also can't use DVD+R or DVD+RW discs. That was a nasty surprise after I spent a bunch of money for a 25 pack of dual layer discs.
This device is not really useful. It burns the DVD in .mts format instead of converting them to a useful format for watching on TV or PC. In my opinion it is useless. The same files can be downloaded from the camera to a PC where they can then be converted to a format more useful like .avi or .mp4. This is probably the reason why it is now heavily discounted by Canon.
I have a Canon Vixia HF20 camcorder with 32g internal hard drive and a SD card slot.  Before I new what I was doing, I recorded family videos on the 32g hard drive in the highest recording format (MXP).  It turns out this device does not handle the MXP format giving a message "Operation Canceled" without further explanation. Apparently there is no way to burn these MXP videos to disc without going through some software and the computer.  I have a MacBook and had to upgrade to iLife09 to recognize it. I still haven't spent the time to transfer the videos yet. IT IS so SLOW.But if you record in the next highest format (FXP) you can use the DW-100 to burn to DVDs.  And it's easy. Select your scenes in playback mode on the camcorder, plug in the DW-100 via USB cable, insert a blank DVD, hit play. And guess what?  You automatically record your selected scenes (or all the scenes on your SD card) to a regular $0.10 DVD that turns into AVCHD, a BluRay equivalent disc (only readable by BluRay compatible players or computers)! In other words you can NOT get a regular DVD out of this that you can give to grandma to pop into her DVD player UNLESS you record in the lower quality formatsApparently, Canon has fixed this glitch on newer model camcorders but there is currently NO FIX for this model or earlier models.  They don't acknowledge that it is a "defect", just claim it is an added feature for the new models of camcorder. To upgrade my camcorder to the new model, they would charge me an extra $800!!!  Just to get regular DVD's out of my HD camcorder! I said no way!I also tried a SONY VRD-MC6 Multi-Function DVD Recorder from Best Buy that they told me would work BUT again fooled:The Sony only burn HD from Sony camcorders!  Not even the SD cards from my Canon camcorder can be read.  The only connection allowed between my Canon camcorder and the Sony DVD recorder is a yellow RCA video cable!  and it burns regular DVD's in terrible (VHS tape) quality from HD recordings in my camcorder!  Unless that is acceptable to you, don't waste your money on the Sony.  Probably smarter to lower the recording format on the Canon camcorder to XP, SP or LP format to get regular DVDs out of the DW-100.  The higher formats XP+, HXP, and FXP will only produce AVCHD discs which can only be read on BluRay equivalent players (and I am not sure that all of them can do it either).  But you can not get the MXP format onto DVDs!It should have been corrected by Canon from the beginning.  Either get a firmware fix for the older camcorders or upgrade the DW-100's.  And they should warn the Canon customers that MXP format is too hard to transfer from.  (In all fairness, there are now inserts in the DW-100 box that give vague warnings to that effect but it was too late for me.)  And the camcorder just says "Operation Canceled" -- I thought the camcorder was broken until I called Canon tech support.  And now I have a hundred hours of family video in MXP format I can not easily copy to DVD. Ugh!
I bought this camcorder almost 2 years ago and never really got a chance to use it (tag still on it) I have been playing around with it and for the heck of it I switched the AV out (which is displaying on the TV) to a different Sony DVD standard def camera (the DCR-DVD405) WOW! the 405 puts the image quality of the 810 to shame! Seriously what a difference. The 810 is grainy and the color is bad. On the Upside however is the internal memory, the memory stick and the DVD options which will keep it recording for hours and hours if plugged into AC power. So ... depending on the most important qualities required it could be good - I haven't yet tried it outside during the day to see how much extra light will help the image. If a dramatic improvement that would be a big bonus but for indoors be prepared to supply a lot of light.
We purchased this device about two years ago.  The main problem we have is range.  I have one in a metal barn and as long as the barn door is open, I get the signal, however it is broken and mostly hard to understand.  This may be the way we use it, but it still is imperfect.  It will cut out and you must hold the button down for a few seconds before you start talking.  You must hold the button down a few seconds after you stop talking.  If you release the button too soon, it will loose part of the conversation.On the whole it did not work for us.  I don't think it was the product, but the distance and the metal building are a problem.  I would say the best range is no more than 100 feet, between units.David
The particular charger I received only is good for charging only.  I could not not charge and use my iphone at the same time.  Seems that the charger interfers with the user functionality of the phone.  Only after I unplug the charger can I resume normally function of the phone.
It's ok for the price, but more than once I thought this was charging my phone and it wasn't.  Tricky to plug in so it charges.  Pay more to get a better one.
This charger is fine for actually charging the battery, but beware of you want to use your phone while charging.  On several occasions, the screen mis-read my finger swipes and caused me to 'touch' buttons that I was nowhere near.  I nearly dialed the phone by accident at 1am.  When it happens, I have to unplug/replug my phone into the charger to clear the problem.  I have a white charger from another company that has this problem even worse.  So, be aware that this is certainly not an 'official' iPhone charger and that you're not paying a lot for it.
Works okay except you have to work it out a bit. The battery does not stay in the charger cradle so I have to hold it down with a rubber band. With this said, charging takes time. It probably also explains why the battery does not hold long....it probably was not fully charged.
The battery is compatible but doesn't seem to last as long as the OEM, but that is to be expected.  The charger is quite frustrating though.  It does charge, BUT I have to wedge the battery into the charger.  Otherwise it pops right out.  It's almost as if the charger did not allow enough of a rise to hold it down.  I have actually ended up taping the battery into the charger.  I'm sure this is a fire hazzard.  :-(
Bought this item and I recived it super fast I like it alot because it alo came with a car charger and that's a big help.
I bought this charger for my camera but I really ordered the wrong one. It did charge some but I had to hold the battery down by hand. I did get an extra battery with it so that was worth the ten dollars I spent. I will say it is a good charger just  my mistake that I got it. I did find one on Amazon that does work so I am happy.
Interesting product but no longer support the updated battery for new drills. Be even better if they kept updating for current products
I bought this about 20 months ago, and have put it to some serious use since then. I shoot a D300, and wrap the cable under my lens and then back to the top, with the cable sticking out of the left side of the hot-shoe mount in order to take out some of the slack. Here are my thoughts:Pros:-Price-When it works, it works well. I've got relatively accurate readings everywhere I've gone-Battery drain isn't too bad (assuming you get it shut off properly)-A vast improvement over the stand-alone GPS logger I used to have that required matching photos to locations by time stamp w/ 3rd party softwareCons:-Cable is a bit irritating (it's long, and it sticks out at awkward angles that may make it prone to breaking)-There is no good place for the GPS box to sit except on the hotshoe, which makes the camera difficult to stuff in my bag, and also prevents me from using a flash-It's hard to tell when it's on or off. There is a tiny red light underneath the plastic, which is hard to see when you are outside-Because it's hard to tell if it's on / off, there have been a number of times where it's drained my battery-Can take a long time to locate / find a signal, even if I haven't traveled far since my last "lock"-The on / off button isn't super easy to use. You can't visually / physically tell if it is on, as it is a push-button that is in the same position whether on or off (you have to push it, look for the tiny dim red light, and push it again if it doesn't come on after a few seconds)-Sometimes I've found it difficult to get a good connection with the cameraI'll probably stick with this since I've bought it, but another (also pricey, but very compact) option beyond Nikon's GPS is Red Hen's bluetooth GPS
It works, in that it supplies GPS data to the EXIF so I can see where I was on Flickr, for instance.Construction - not so great. The cord was forever getting caught on things and about the 3rd day the cheap flash mount ripped out and I lost it. So now I have it tapped to my camera strap. Ugly, but it works.You must remember to turn it off or it will drain your battery.
This is the third CMVision device I have purchased. This somewhat works on my deck, but has a very narrow beam and at 25-35 feet distance, covers only a small area, compared to the field of view of the camera. It is also quite large (perhaps bulky) compared to the IR56 and IR03 that I also purchased. The housing might be weatherproof, but it has a lot more potential points of entry for moisture and rain. While I cannot say it can illuminate out to 150 feet, it is much, much brighter than the IR56.  So, if a large device does not bother you, this is more powerful that the IR56. Note: inside of 20 feet, it might be too bright. Finally, if I do install this device, it will need an additional support, since the bracket to mount to a structure is very flimsy.
Not a flood, a definite spotlight. 150 feet is a big stretch, more like 40-50. I put a thin white plastic over the lens and thatmade it a flood but with about 25 foot range. Worked for me but not exactly useful as is unless one wants a spotlight.
Its real cute. It would be very good for journaling and to print out pictures as you travel in order to give away prints to your subjects.It's not a piece of equipment designed to make serious photos, but it could be useful. I plan to take it to Mexico with a group of students. The students will all be required to do journaling and documentation of their service project to plant copal trees in Oaxaca, Mexico.I hope that Polaroid keeps working on this. There's a niche here that was evacuated when polaroid stopped making instant film. Instant prints are categorically different from instant digital images. And prints may be the only things that truly survive in the future. I don't see the future (or the present) having much respect for the past. Nobody seems very worried about the wholesale loss of digital images to the obsolescence of the technology required to access it.
Product itself is fine, it's just a simple neoprene sleeve - but it is listed in several locations on Amazon asbeing of a suitable size and fit for the new Polaroid Z2300 camera.  It is not.  You can cram the camera in sinceneoprene will stretch, but it still leaves about a 1/2 inch gap where the camera is not covered - and it certainly isn'ta simple on and off.
works all right. Snaps on and off easy enough. the folding bottom is cool at first, but kinda gets in the way when folded away from phone for docking. The rubber hinge also yellows in a couple months. Get an otter box
Stopped using it after a week... product simply felt "cheap" on the nice & polished iPhone. I have a white iPhone and the white on this case didn't even match the white backing on the iPhone - not really noticeable but it was annoying to me.
this case is ok, but looked a bit cheap. It hid the real beauty of the iPhone. I returned it two weeks ago and am still waiting for my refund.
I originally saw this case at a Apple store and liked the fact that it is extremely form-fitting -- it offers some shock protection, while not hugely adding to the size of the incredibly  elegant iPhone 3G.I have a white iPhone and decided to go with a white case.The case is great, but I would definitely get a black one next time around.  The rear "hinge" (that allows you to flip the bottom of the case back so you can use a dock) and the top power button are made of a flexible rubbery plastic, unlike the main body which is glossy hard plastic.These two areas -- after only a couple of weeks of use -- have become very noticeably discolored with normal wear-and-tear and finger dirt.Think this would not be an issue with the black case.So, in summary, it's a great case if you are looking for something very form-fitting that won't add a lot of bulk. But get black, not white.
Last year I decided it was time to put away my monster 10 lb 30-year old Bogen tripod and pick up a few lighter ones for traveling.  Knowing how light the new tripods were I also picked up a couple of the Vanguard SB-100 stone bags to help weigh them down on windy days.  I actually don't put rocks in these bags, instead I usually put additional lenses and remotes in the bag to keep them close at hand.  Compared to another stone bag that I own, the Trek-Tech Cammock), the SB-100 isn't as deep and doesn't have a flat bottom that I've really enjoyed with the Trek-Tech bag.  The Vanguard SB-100 is also made of a less flexible material making a bit thicker, and clumsier to keep tucked between the legs of the tripod when the tripod is folded.If the purpose of getting one is for throwing rocks in it to weigh down your tripod and camera then the SB-100 will satisfy, but if you're like me and would rather use it as a way to keep an extra lens or a few accessories nearby while you're shooting (extra batteries,memory card, etc.) then you should consider the Trek-Tech Cammock.
I loved the case and so excited about the camera case but the batteries don't stay charged long enough.The battery charge was not as great as I thought it would be.
Got the slider for a great price , it was listed as new , but in reality it was either  a demo one or a display item , cause it shows some wear at the bottom .
This is an argument against proprietary connectors. The original cable was too inflexible and the iPod too light to easily position it well relative to the player. Eventually the connection failed. I had it soldered once and finally replaced it. $10 would be a fair expensive price, but what to do? It is a versatile and useful mini-component system and I'm glad to have it working again.
This boom box is easy to operate. The worst thing about it is CDs are treated like DVDs as far as battery life goes. I played an MP3 CD and it made the screen turn on which drained the battery life to only a few hours. Also after about 2 or 3 hours of playing the disc the boom box would shut itself down. The radio tuner worked wonderful and didn't seem to use as much juice. This was purchased for the beach and the speakers are rather weak and had to be turned all the way up. The bass boost is a joke and only made the sound horrible. It is kind of heavy to tote around. The remote worked good. I wish there was a separate DVD and CD option. The AUX option worked well. All in all this product does what it says it will do. Not extraordinary, but not too horrible overall. I was satisfied, but not impressed. It is worth the money though.
The screen seemed very dark watching DVDs when I got it but was watching foreign Kung Fu movies and thought that was the problem. I stood up and low and behold I could see much better looking down on the screen. For the price and what it does I think it's OK but it is necessary on mine to tilt the screen down to see better. Also when playing DVDs I had the volume near full just to hear it but not the radio.
So the video is pretty good, but WAY to basic for folks who will be buying the 5D.
It is good quality and the right size.  It has a thing to put your belt through(how many women wear belts all the time and how many men want a plum camera case?) I was disappointed it doesn't have a strap as that would have been more convenient and could have been added.  I like it except for that.
I read a lot of reviews about this camcorder on other sites, and it really seemed as though people were overly zealous about promoting the item, so I wanted to give something that I thought was a more realistic review of the item.After purchasing this camcorder through Amazon.com back in November 2009, I found the same item being sold for much cheaper at other online stores (I bought it for just over $200 and have now seen it for as low as $175).The camcorder I originally purchased was to have 60 frames per second (fps) with a still picture capture at 8.0 mega pixels. What was delivered has 30 fps and 12.0 mega pixels. I purchased the camcorder specifically for its motion picture capabilities, not still captures. I am a little disappointed.The camera has a function called stabilizer, though it does not work with recordings higher than 720p leaving 1080p recordings very unstable and shaky, something that, in my mind, destroys the value of recording at 1080p especially while zooming in at any increment.Lighting is has either a white tint or a somewhat yellowish tint depending on the setting.After recording a 1080p clip I have played it back through a 1080p television though it was only recognized as being 1080i (I haven't run it through my computer yet, which by all means should support it, unless it's really just not supported at all).At 1080p the picture is very clear while recording through the LCD screen, though remember I have only seen it at 1080i on an external screen, which was still a pretty clear picture aside from the jerkiness.I have yet to test all of the camera's functions but so far it has fallen short of indicated expectations from advertisers. Another downside of the camcorder and camera functions is that at the lowest end of the zoom, it seems as though the picture is still zoomed in and should go back further.This is my first camcorder and next time I purchase one I will expect to spend around $400 to $600 on a higher quality item and more than likely go to a store to play around with it.Though this camera is as I expected: difficult at times and has some flaws here and there, like my wife, I have decided that I am going to keep it anyway and enjoy it for what it is. =o)
I find the video uneven.  The content flow is not smooth and consistent nor is the production itself (including out-of-focus shots).  There are many places where the narration and the images are perfectly matched and crystal clear, but there are places where they are not. It almost feels as if they shot the video, saw the gaps in it, and tried to shore it up with added narration, B-roll and text supers.  As others have noted, it spends quite a bit of time on general lighting concepts (perhaps half of the video) - which may be very useful to some but off-putting to others.  Bottom-line:  chances are you'll play back a few sections repeatedly to figure out what's going on . . . or, ironically, simply go to the manual for clarification.
I agree w/another reviewer, the title is misleading. 98% of the time they are using additional equipment, light stands, multiple flashes, reflectors, filters, etc. while in a studio setting. It was a helpful DVD on lighting but didn't teach me much about my flash and how to properly use it by itself and in various conditions. Its basically, "heres a model in our studio. Ok, now shes on a beach but we still have our reflectors. Heres some still life back in the studio." The first 20min is a lighting primer before blowing through the flash's buttons w/o a thorough explanation on each one. They went through certain things far too quickly and spent more time than necessary on other subjects. For example, I didn't need to see multiple times how to change a setting through the camera's menu or on the flash itself. They do give demos but they weren't sufficient enough for me and the flash was never used stand-alone other than to show you that it gives horrible pictures by itself. If this DVD taught me one thing, its that I need to buy more equipment.A more accurate title would have been "Using your Canon flash in a studio setting" or "Unlocking your flash's potential" because obviously to get into lighting and really take advantage of the versatility of a Speedlight, you must buy additional equipment and take the flash off the camera. The flash is just one of the tools they use to get the pictures they want and it happens to be a Canon 430/580EX. You would not let your friend borrow your flash one day and hand them this DVD along with it, thinking it will teach them how to use it because it won't. They'll just sit there thinking, "oh, thats nice but I don't have any of those things..." and "hey, could you slow down when you go over the controls, what they do and how I should use them? More comparison photos would also be nice."As for production values, well, it's fairly drab presentation and I'd have appreciated voice overs while showing them taking pictures instead of having to stare at the guy talk, constantly switching his eyes from the camera to nearby cue cards. You look at him seemingly for 1/3 of the DVD. The rest of the time is spent in the studio or looking at the back of the flash and it's buttons. So is it worth the coin ? Ehhh, its decent and helpful information on LIGHTING but you're able to find this sort of information for free online at various lighting/strobist enthusiast sites. Its not a complete waste of money but this DVD could certainly use a new name.
I was worried that I was missing out on some critical info but it is rather basic and nothing you can't figure out by reading the standard manual and trying things.
First let me start by saying I wanted to give this 3 1/2 stars as it is a solid video with lots of good information.  I have both this volume and the first for the 5D Mk.II and I thought the first video was a really good introduction to the basic controls of the camera and how the controls affected different aspects of one's images.  The 5D has a lot of menu choices though and the more advanced features simply wouldn't fit in the first video as well.I assumed, logically, that the advanced features of the camera would be explained more in depth in this second video and that the video would take its time covering these options for the duration of the entire video.  Essentially I expected both volumes to serve as a video version of a camera specific user's guide.  What the second volume is in reality is 50% exploration of some of the 5D and 50D camera advanced settings and 50% discussion of non-camera specific photography/lighting/and image processing topics.  One section of the video, for example, spends a good deal of time covering color profile settings in image processing software and the importance of managing color for a consistent image across different mediums.  Another spends a lot of time demonstrating the use of gels on a flash or a light box to create different lighting effects.  It seemed like about half of the video was a variety of non-camera specific topics such as this, and the sections that did deal specifically with specific camera settings were often glanced over quite quickly (though not all).  There is still a good bit of content in the custom functions that were never looked at.Now, as I said, the content is good content but covering color profiles as much as they did, as an example, was not what I expected in this video.  If I wanted to learn that, I'd have gotten a book or video on that topic.  If I'd wanted to learn lighting techniques, I'd have gotten a book or video on that topic.  If I'd wanted an overview on processing raw, etc. etc.  I don't mind them taking a minute or two to explain one of these topics generally to provide context for an explanation of one of the camera's settings or features, but a 15 to 20 minute digression on color management seemed inappropriate for a video that I felt should have focused specifically on advanced topics specific to the 5D and 50D.  If you're looking for a video to get acquainted with your 5D or 50D, then by all means get the first volume of this set specific to your camera.  If you're looking for a good and deep exploration of the advanced features of your camera that goes beyond the first video, then be aware that this second volume might leave you, like it did me, a bit disappointed and wanting more content specific to your camera and less depth of coverage of non-camera specific photography and image processing concepts.
This is a good video, however I think the instructor is not what I consider to be a great instructor.  Moves to quickly, (talks too fast).It is still worth watching as I have not found a better video at this time.
Too much of a fish bowl affect with the photos. After playing around with it for a few months, it sits in a drawer now.. Not worth the bother. I'm gotten a better camera so that helps a lot more.
Camera seems durable and rugged and is pretty easy to use.  Picture quality seems grainy even in good light.
I've had DirecTV HD for about 27 months now.  All was fine for almost two years... then I started getting pixilation and intermittent audio.  I checked sisgnal strength and saw that all transponders were read with almost all responding with a strength of 90... a couple came in at 86 or 87... well within the paramaters stated by DirecTV. Then I could not get a response when I tried to change channels or show the viewer's guide... or for that matter when I tried to turn off the receiver!  I called them to ask that they replace the receiver.  Told them that I believed the problem was spceifically with the hard drive since I couldn't even operate the console from the console buttons!  They said they would send out a new one with a tech.  Well, they sent the tech out.  All he did was replace the cable between the satellite dish and the receiver, and checked antenna alighment. This was around noon a week ago.  That night the problems returned... Why keep the service when it doesn't work during the time we watch HDTV most?  By the way... you will never own the receivers!  You are only purchasing a lease!  The equipment MUST be returned when you cancel!!!  Ownership resides with DirecTVApril 4th, 2010 updateFineally I got a qualified tech out. Admitted the hard drive was bad (I knew that before I even called direcTv the first time). He replaced the entire receiver and now no more pixelation, or audio dropouts. All is well.  I just wish they would have listened to me the first time they sent a "tech" out
Okay, so first of all, when I got this receiver, I was under the impression that the programming (besides Pay-per-view) would be viewed in full 1080P HD. But the highest it gives is 1080I because no channels currently offer 1080P for whatever reason.Sometimes when you first turn on the receiver, it is slow responding to commands. Still, it's much, much, much, much better viewing even 1080I on my Samsung 1080P LCD television than in standard def. Hopefully one day channels will offer full 1080P HD.
false advertising, unless you read very closly and all the fine print.After we purchased this (or at least we thought we purchased) we found out that it is a least through direct tv.  after all, we paid good money for this, and we found out we don't own it.  very disappionted.
Very strong and well thought off, great for beginners. Downside its a little small so don't expect everything to fit.
This wireless shutter release works well, but has a slightly confusing method of shutter release. In the camera "bulb" mode, if the release button on the remote is held for four seconds and then released, the shutter will operate exactly in sync with the remote. In other words, when the remote release is pressed, the shutter will open and then close when the remote is released. However, when in "bulb" mode and the exposure is for more that four seconds, the remote release has to be pushed a second time to  close the shutter. In other words, instead of push to open shutter, release to close shutter, with exposures over four seconds, one has to push the release, wait four seconds or more, release the remote button and then to close the shutter, push the remote button again. This has caused me to over expose some shots. Other than this, the control works fine. Have not checked the range.
Does not fit camera, Neck Strap is too wide to fit into Camera Strap Holes.Description of attachment (fits X Size of camera holes) was not given, and I could not verify fit without dimension or actual strap to verify.
The PoGo is not going to replace any of the printers I own, but it will be something fun to give as a gift to teens, tweens and anyone who likes to make cards or scrapbooks. After using my PoGo printer for several months, these are my impressions.The Good:+This is a CUTE, little printer! Kids, teens and young adults will love it.+The Polaroid Zink media 30 Pack Photo Paper for Polaroid Pogo Cameras and Printers that is used by the Polaroid PoGo Instant Digital Mobile Printer (Black) comes in one size: 2x3" and loads easily into the device. NOTE: The Zink Smart Sheet (blue) must be loaded with the paper to allow the printer to work. The photos have a peel away back that allows the photos to be easily glued to any applicable surface, making them great for scrapbooking use.+This device does not use ink, thus there are no cartridges to replace, and the photos come out of the printer 'dry', so no need to wait to touch them.+The size of this printer makes it ultra portable. About 4x6" and 1" thick... maybe 2 pounds?The Bad:-The print quality is 'fair', but not good. Of course the source has something to do with it. Uploaded photos from my camera phone were grainy, but they were also low resolution images. Photos printed from my Canon camera were much sharper, but all suffered from a bit of washout with poor color saturation especially regarding the blue hues. If you remember the instant Polaroid cameras, you'll not be surprised, however you will wish for better. Again, no ink technology may just have this as a limitation, and perhaps the next generation of this type of printer will be better?-The media (photo) size is limited to 2x3". No other sizes are available and none would fit in this printer. The size is akin to your driver's license or a credit card, so don't expect to be framing these photos! The media is also fairly expensive; $10 or so for 30 prints.-Bluetooth connectivity was a bit of a problem. While my Nokia 5300 XpressMusic Black Phone (T-Mobile, Phone Only, No Service) was listed on the Polaroid website as being compatible for the purposes of transferring files via bluetooth, and the Nokia did recognize the Polaroid PoGo after a search and putting in the passcode, I could never print using the bluetooth connection. "No Connection" errors occurred repeatedly, so I had to switch to the usb connection (cord not included) to do a transfer from my phone to the printer.-Battery life is poor. The manual says charge for 2.5 hours prior to use. I charged it for 8 hours and got 8 photos before it stopped producing. I turned the PoGo on and off, and then was able to print 2 more. The printer had some juice left, but not much and I think you'd be lucky to get 12-15 photos printed per charge.-Print speed was not terrible, but slowed as the battery was used up. The first two came out in 35-40 seconds with the final two printing in over a minute each.Conclusion:I will give these as 'novelty' gifts to my friends and family, thanking my lucky stars I never bought one at full price when I first saw them a year ago! I have no doubt they'll enjoy them initially, but I doubt very much that most people will find this item has longterm durability or usefulness.Also note that with this package deal, the photo shows 3 (30) packs of Zink paper, but the description indicates you'll get 3 (10) packs. 1 (10) pack of Zink paper comes with the unit when it is sold alone.Compare prices between this package and purchasing a PoGo separately and a package ofPolaroid ZINK Photo Paper - 30 sheetsto see what your best purchase price would be on the day you decide to buy.
Save your money and buy something else that you would get more use from.  This isn't a necessary flip accessory.  We sent it back after trying it just once.  Not quite what we thought it was or was capable of doing.
Bought for a client that did not know if it was worth doing. They wanted to visually record an overnight run of an lab experiment. Set it up on a camera tripod in front of lab bench and plugged into local Lan port. Camera was easy to setup using supplied software. Installed camera recording software on a local PC(XP Pro SP3)and presto. Instant overnight recording. With just the exit sign above the door and a few instrument LEDs and indicators on in the room night vision was excellent. Lab crew was able to easily see video recorded overnight. Cheap camera body. Would not use it in an enviroment where it may be banged up or exposed to extreme conditions. For occasional use or just for Gee whiz kicks it fits the bill. Customer ended up keeping it (as a backup after purchasing a professional Lan cam.) for overnight monitoring of Lab projects. Note: Audio was useless. Was unintellegible but was not needed in this application anyway.
I've just received my JVC MS110. I was looking at the MS120 about 6 weeks ago, but saw this newer version was coming out, so I pre-ordered it for $229. At the time the MS120 was selling on Amazon for $209. Before I received the MS110 (but after it shipped) Amazon was selling the MS110 for $207, and the MS120 for $260!I did some research on them before I bought, but unfortunately missed the following differences:1. The MS110 doesn't take still pictures.2. It doesn't have the MS120's filter threads, needed to add a wide-angle lens.3. Unlike the MS120, it doesn't close the lens protector when you close the LCD to shut off the camera. You have to locate and move a lever on the side. A small point, yes, but its seems like they had to go out the their way to remove this feature.Pros-It has a great 45x(or more)zoom lens.-It comes with time-lapse recording and a motion detection-record feature.-Low-light capability is good. Whatever you can see in dim light it can record.-Using an SD card, it has a rapid start-up to catch those sudden photo opportunities.-Lightweight at 7.6oz, including battery (weighed on my postal scale).Cons-The previously mentioned "missing" features.-The slowest time lapse setting is still pretty fast, with each minute zipping by in 2 seconds.-It is too small for its side-strap configuration. This makes it difficult to hold easily, my hand is in awkward positions and cramps-up trying to curve my fingers over the top.-The video played back on my HDTV looked terrible. It looked better played back on a computer, using either the supplied software or Windows (Vista) Media Player. Still, using the "ultrafine" setting, the computer playback was not as good as watching old standard TV. More like watching a VHS tape, for those who remember VHS. Comparing the monitor image to the camera LCD, there was only slightly more detail noticable on my 20" screen than I could make out on the small LCD.-Outdoors on a sunny day the LCD washes out, even with brightness set on max. You will still get a vague image to help you point your camera, but no real detail until you play it back.The reason I gave it three stars is because it was relatively cheap and, as they say, you get what you pay for. I'm thinking I might trade this in for an HD model.
I needed a camcorder to tape a college lecture while  I was not there, so I had to set the camera at the back of the room in order to capture the entire blackboard/overhead projector screen.  After a week of use, I realize this camera isn't sufficient for this use.Pros:It has a great zoom, at the farthest zoom, it does a decent job of stabilization.  Decent in low light situations, you can film in a dark room with only a flashlight  BUT:Cons:The super low lux isn't enough to film what is on a blackboard in a medium sized classroom, when there is a medium amount of light and the overhead projector is on.  The overhead projector screen is white to the camera with only a few details(contrast between bright screen and surrounding blackboar is too much for this camera).  Also, without zooming in, it is hard to distinguish the works on the blackboard, it is Standard Definition after all.  On the maximum setting, when you play it on your laptop, it is a grainy, and the resolution leaves you wanting more.Conclusion:  I decided to return this camera and spend about a hundred bucks more and buy the sanyo vpc-fh1a  which is HD.
The major drawbacks of this camera are that the autofocus often misses the focus in closeups, motion sometimes creates black stripe intermediate lines (like photographing a non-interlaced TV screen), the color is not particularly vibrant, and any camera motion makes for marked blurring.  So if you do a lot of hand-held, on-the-march shooting, your results will be disappointing.  Fixed shooting is pretty good; tripod is best and is essential for distance zooming.  Whites-out brights like ocean and sky momentarily and can be "contrasty."  Simple operation and can be fit into a jeans front pocket if necessary and will tell you if you are trying to shoot with the lens cover closed (but on your own if your finger is in the frame).  Would I recommend or buy it again?  Even though $120 pricetag is hard to resist and good for what you get, probably not.
it was what you should expect, but the wrinkles are very hard to get out, tried drier, then iron, then washer and drier, and then iron some more... lots of deep harsh wrinkles, but otherwise is just fine
I don't know how long the batteries last I have just recd it....probably will take me some time to know how it works
I only give 3 star because the honey comb was bend and has dent. So far the BD really work well...use it already with 5 models photoshoot and was very happy of the result..both me and the models.Not sure yet if i really need to paint it white...may be not.
Honey come was damaged in shipping, Dish slightly bent. I hate returning things it still works great so I keep it an use it. Happy with the price you get what you pay for...
Product has a great picture and easy to use. I says it works with windows7 software which was the reason I cose this one, there are many on the market. It worked on my computer the first time I hooked it up. Now it just says the software is not compatible. My daughter has windows xp on her computer so I put the photos I want on a flash drive and take it to her computer.
This item could be better. its cool that i can take pictures without touching the camera. but it is very slow and has a very short range which seems alot shorter than advertised. its a cool product but it takes too long to snap a picture for my taste and it doesnt always work. you also have to be pointing the remote right at the camera so say you wanted to take a picture with your friend, in the picture you will see you pointing at the camera
....but it doesn't keep a charge for very long. Does save on batteries though. I'd recommend it as long as you know what to expect.
I got this to work with my 24-105 l series lens on my 7D. There is slight vignetting when zoomed out to the 24 end but the hood has greater coverage than the standard hood for this lens from canon. It is lighter and flimsier than canons version and does not have a non-glare surface on the inside but it does reverse on the lens for storing. Not bad for the price.
The product is what it is listed to be but can't tell if it has improved the life of my camera or not at this point.
I am a photographer and have 3 cameras I use during events (weddings, company parties, etc.) Sometimes it's a bit cumbersome having all the cameras hanging off my shoulders or neck, not including the fact that the 5dM2s are quite heavy with their primes. Thought it would be a good idea to purchase this for dual camera action but was disappointed. Used it once at a wedding last year and find it to be a bit lame. Haven't used it again- it's laying in the corner of my photography room collecting dust. Might be a good idea to just post it on craigslist to sell since I have no further interest or use for it.  Have been using my trusty sunbounce/sunsniper, the hand grip thing, and the belt slinger for three cameras usage and it's still fine. However, I am always on the lookout for something more efficient...
Hopefully it does the job.  The adhesive stickers are too small to be seen from a distance, maybe a medium sized sticker would be better.
The main sign is well made and good size. The decalshowever are very small...need to be a bit larger forthe windows to be read well but still a good package.Thanks for carrying amazon.com
I've had 2 of the smaller ones start to curl up on the corner. But just a very little. They are noticeable and no break ins so far.
It is a good camera, but consumes a lot of battery. If you purchase, make sure you have rechargeable batteries for high consumption
The Trigger Stick operates as advertised. It deploys fast, if you squeeze the trigger it drops fast and can make noise when it hits the ground. Just takes some getting used to. It seems sturdy enough so I think it will last.
I ordered this a while back and did receive it promptly. I use it for my sony alpha nex-5n, and soon my minolta x-700 also. While there is plenty of room to fit both cameras and the lenses, I really don't like the dividers. Since they are held in place by velcro, they sometimes will come undone, compromising my cameras. My only advice is to do plenty of research before buying a camera bag.Pros : lightweight, plenty of room for cameras and lenses, easy to useCons : generic velcro, thin materials, not padded enough
Nikon lens is good but the product does not come with usa manufacturer's warranty as claimed by the product description. I am assuming it is a grey market product as my lens did not come even with the original nikon box. It came with a brown box packaging. On contacting the seller I was told that is how they get the product from Nikon. If you are particular about having a usa warranty product then apparently this might not be the one for you.
The 55-200mm lens came as avertised EXCEPT both the Amazon site and the seller site advertised this item by Nikon as having a 4-5 year warrenty. When I opened the box the only thing that came with the lens was some instructions in about 25 different languages and NO WARRENTY. It didn't even come in a Nikon box, just a brown shipping box. This, in my mind, is false advertising. While I have ordered other items from both Amazon and the seller of this item and the items have been as advertised, I am disappointed that both businesses would sell a product in this manner. I would say that if you plan on ordering from any company and they tell you the item comes with a warrenty that you contact the seller first before you buy and determine that they actually provide a warrenty.
I was very pleased with the picture produced by this product.  It so beats out my 7" frame from another vendor.I ran across two problems, one of which caused me to return the product.The first problem, which may not be a problem for others, is that it was tricky to navigate the menus and select the pictures or desired viewing functions.  There are buttons on the picture frame, but they are on the back, so unless you use braille stickers, you won't know which one you are pressing.  The buttons are virtually useless.  But it has a remote control, so no need to press the buttons.  However, navigation even with a remote control is trickier than it should be.  I like the touch screen models from Pandigital.  A touch screen interface is SO much easier than buttons on the side or back of the frame or a remote control.Still, I was pleased enough with the picture that I could get over having to monkey with the navigation system.  I'm confident that I would figure it out eventually.  What caused me to return the products is that it is VERY easy to destroy the internal memory.  There is a warning in the manual that tells you NOT to unplug it from your computer while the connection is busy doing something.  I didn't do that.  I was copying pictures from my SD card when there was a brief power brownout.  That did it.  The internal memory was blown and didn't even show up as a menu option anymore.  It's too easy to permanently lose the internal memory.
We bought this to replace a 10" viewsonic picture frame that had put in good service for us over three years but stopped working.  The pluses for this unit are the large screen size and the faster response from the remote control.  setup is relatively easy--i plugged in a usb drive with all our photos, plugged in the unit to the wall, and it was working 2 mins from the box.  the minus--a big one--is that the screen looks a bit washed out and the color balance is off.  Perfectly functional for low quality presentation but not much better than that.
It's a picture frame..  can't say much more about it.  I don't really like digital frames,  but needed it for a marketing display at work.The frame was easy to disassemble for that purpose,  and it operates well  in a confined space without generating much heat.The audio decoder sounds very bad,  I strongly recommend never trying to use this to play media files if you care at all about sound quality.  I tried numerous formats,  all sounded terrible when plugged into the headphone jack.
Internal memory went out while we were setting it up. Called company & they said they would replace it or send a 4 gb memory card.Does have a good image. Written operating instructions lacking.
I've had my frame for almost a year and I have to say that this is a pretty nice frame overall. I love the easy set up, motion detection and the fact that it uses the actual 2.0 usb as well as SD. I will definately consider getting a few more for my home but these are the only issues i've had with it so far:Video: Getting videos to play through any digital picture frame can be a huge challenge and this frame doesn't do a whole lot to lessen the struggle but the NIX website actually tries. If you want to play video be prepared to learn a little about about video resoltion and conversion.SlideShow: The &#34;randomness&#34; of the multi-picture slideshow is random but NOT smart. I have 300+ photos on my usb drive and many times I see the same picture displayed 2x and even 3x. Also, it would be nice if the multi-picture slideshow could start off with multiple photos instead of one, then building up to a full frame.
I was very excited to get this frame and be able to use it to market our school at educational fairs. Unfortunately the frame was damaged and therefore unuseable. The plus to that: I was able to return the frame for a full refund with no hassle. The down side: this frame is temporarily out of stock at the parent company and there is not time frame of when it will be available again. Bummer! The three stars are for the service given, not rating the frame itself.
Overall an Ok frame, the image quality is decent (although not spectacular in my opinion if you compare it with a quality computer monitor; but it was the first frame I ever used)There are a couple missing features that made this frame a no-go for me:1. Limited choices for ordering pictures. I loaded hundreds of images on the SD card, and they all got mixed up in some unknown way on the card. There is no option to order by shooting date. The only option in the manual is to rename the pictures in the format 1000, 1001, etc.  For large collections, you would need to search for a 3rd party tool to do it automatically.2. When you turn off the frame, and turn it on later, the playback will resume from the first picture, not where you stopped it.  Again, for large collections, you would want the option to continue watching from where you left off.3. For pictures in sub-folders, I was unable to display the thumbnail index to select specific photos to view.
I received this frame on 12/04/2011 and it was shipped back to Amazon for a refund 2-3 days later.Apparently, I must have received a defective frame. There were problems immediately during initial setup. The frame only responded inconsistently when buttons were activated on the remote control; the screen would often hang and become unresponsive.I was never able to call up the main setup screen as mentioned in the extremely cursory and inadequate instructions provided with the frame itself.I also have a 15" OPTEKA digital frame (purchased here on Amazon.com in August 2009) that has been running 24/7 for more than 2 years. It has never had any problems whatsoever, operates smooth as silk - no remote control problems at all.In the meantime, I have decided against acquiring a second 15" digital frame in the foreseeable future and will simply wait until even larger frames (e.g., 20" models) become available at a more reasonable price.In light of my own personal poor experience with this apparently defective product, I think that a neutral rating of 3 stars is more than fair.This frame may work for many people, but it certainly didn't work for me!
Well. I've not used it underwater yet.  But the video I have taken as a test does not look as good as the old Viewpoint I was replacing it with.  We will see, so far I've not got much to say.  The pics I took weren't all that great either.  But it did arrive promptly and it was a good price.
Please see the sillicon valley peripherals web page before buying.Camera is rated to 12 meters or about 40 feet.[...]
Do not purchase you will be disappointed that you have no s action picturesWe went on expensive snorkel tour and got no photos
This unit is pretty cheap from top to bottom. The extensions are held in place by friction so it can't be locked down.  The head itself where you mount the camera feels very fragile.  I'll use it carefully with a cell phone or light, cheap camera, but I would've trust it to a larger unit.  On the plus site it cost 8.00 and shipped free with prime.TL:DR. Does what the package says, but I don't anticipate it will last very long.
As others have said, the head will move if used for anything but stationary or light movement. I can walk around without any problem, running will cause the camera (GoPro) to flop to the side.
I bought it for snowboarding and snorkeling action shots with a GoPro3.It does not hold the weight very well, with the arm extended all the way it rotates of folds over.I've never gotten it wet but from the looks of the metal used, it seems like it would rust easily.For my smaller Canon elph SD1400 it holds up fine, but I would not use the Canon as an action cam.To get stills over crowds and sneaky close ups at museums and zoos it works good with Canon.If the Canon were even slightly larger I don't think it would work.
Find it somewhat awkward to use and minimally useful. a . . . . . . . . .  .
Since most cell phones and point and shoots only have the LCD on the other side, then how are you to know how well you are in the picture or not. Well, in China, they have the same thing that they've rigged up a mirror on the other side so you can see the LCD and see where you are in the shot. This should be fairly easy to do with some wire and a small piece of light mirror. Or you must hold the camera close to you to guess where you are at. It serves a nice purpose if you know where you are in the cameras eye so it is a useful device-just beware of how far away you use it and see if you can hook up a mirror or an external uSB monitor.
I have not used it yet but is seems ok. The end adjustment can not be tightened so I hope the built in tension works fine.
It doesnt seem like it will last long, I bought it for a GOPRO and it sems lik ethe go pro is to heavy for it. We will see.
If you plan to use this with the gopro, don't buy the product. Otherwise it is a good reliable, extension pole!
The &#34;pro&#34; for me is that it holds the camera really steady and it is long enough. The &#34;con&#34; is that it is too heavy to carry around.
A telescoping monopod is almost essential for GoPro owners, and after seeing the price of this particular one, I decided to give it a try as my first, entry level monopod. I regret placing greater value on price and not product quality.Pros:1) acceptable telescoping size - expands to 37&#34; and collapses to 8&#34;. I feel that's a pretty good range, again, considering the price.2) incredibly useful - offers an entirely new range of camera angle possibilitiesCons:1) loose - both the degree of laxity as well as the thumb screw to attach to your camera were far too loose for my uses. Even when walking with the pole fully expanded, my small GoPro would cause the hinge near the camera to collapse on a regular basis.2) easily rusts - I used this in a humid place for about a week (4-5 hours per day), and the pole ended up rusting at any point where metal meets metal. It actually added a bit of resistance to the previously mentioned looseness, however it also caused significant damage to the monopod, and makes me aprehensive to stick a $400 camera on the end of it.3) wrist strap broken from minimal use - the wrist strap broke off of my wrist after I accidentally dropped my camera; exactly defeating the purpose of the strap in the first place.4) not much range of motion - the hinge is advertised as a ball head, but it's not a true ball head. It can only move in one direction, allowing only 180 degrees of variation in angle.All in all, I would advise searching for another alternative to this monopod, ESPECIALLY if you're only considering this product due to its price. After making this purchase, I greatly wish I would have placed more value on the quality of the monopod, instead of the price, because this is truly one of the most useful tools for a GoPro user. If you plan on only using this a couple of times, then this may work for you, as long as you're ready for a headache or two during its use.
my main complaints is that it came a week later than the estimated arrival date. that was very disappointing. next up the battery doesnt always charge unless you get it in there just right. aside from that, for the price it does the job. its worth trying out.
Ok, if you want to save money, this product is for you. It does the job. But don't tell me it's made well. It looks cheap, especially the European adapter.
its ok it fits perfect on my panasonic vdr d210 but it would fall off if you dont screw it on write
Work's OK !
You get what you pay for. I keep in my car for time when I will need to photograph damage to the car. Image quality is exactly what one would expect from a low cost 2.1 MP camera.
I could not see the subject of the photo because the viewer in the back is too dim.  I had to GUESS where the subject was instead.
Found the range bag to be ALOT smaller than I intended. Maybe large enough for a medium size pistol. Defiantly not the range bag you want if you have more than one pistol.
Good bag with lots of compartments. Would have gave it more stars if the molle straps that are attached to the back of the bag fit correctly on my maxpedition pack. Voodoo should just put webbing not the full stale or do the spacing right! It's 1 inch not 1 1/2 inches!
I was hoping to use this as an ammunition bag for the shooting range, but it is just not large enough.
This item is NOT compatible with the Nikon D800. I ordered this item after reading that it would work on the 800, but my bad.  Still find it astounding that Nikon made such an important function for high resolution photography so difficult with the release of this camera.  And don't get me started on the proprietary raw format...Anyway, the remote looks good and solid, so I'd give it 4 stars for build, but have no way to test it on the D800
While the product behaves as avertice ones I got it to work. The transmitter button is flimsy and got stock more.
I bought 2 shutters.One of them didn't work in bulb mode.It's a shame because the delivery was very fast, but I am in Guatemala and I get too expensive to send the product back to claim the warranty.
It work but with some tweaking on the orientation of the transmitter. Also lot of dangling weight attached to the camera.
