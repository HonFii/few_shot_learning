I use to own one of these cameras when it was originally on the market, and it was so much fun. I missed it so much, I had to replace it with this one.These cameras are great for children or parties!I have it a 4 of 5 stars because the camera is pretty basic.  Turn knob to turn on, push button hard to take photo and pull out print.Have fun!*Note-any film purchased for these cameras, are going to be expired.  They no longer make the film.
The Polaroid i-zone is the same camera despite the surface color:  the newer silver edition just looks sleeker than the older green, blue, and red versions.  I've found the i-zone to be a good icebreaker at parties:  they're fun to use and their novelty generates interest with other people.  The mini i-zone Polaroids (no bigger than 2"x 2") develop out from the camera right away, just like regular Polaroids; so you can immediately share them with friends and family.  In low-light conditions, when the camera flash is necessary, the i-zone can only photograph well no further than 1-2 feet away.  For treasured photographic memories, this definitely isn't the camera to use:  the photographic quality isn't the greatest.  Also, the film (which also comes in sticker form) is pretty expensive.  On the other hand, the i-zone is designed to use two regular "AA" sized batteries, not expensive camera batteries.  For fun purposes, the i-zone is a great camera.  Kids, teens, and adults that are kids at heart would like this item.
I bought the I-Zone digital combo camera.  It takes both digital pictures and the small sticky ones.  The pictures from the regular camera function are small (but you knew that from reading the box...) and surprisingly sharp.  The colors are really bright and realistic!  I can't give it 5 stars, though, because the CD that comes with it was defective.  When I called Polaroid, they said that a lot of these cameras got shipped out with defective CD's.  However, I give Polaroid 5 stars for quickly and courteously handling the problem by offering to send a new CD right out to me.  Hope they follow through!
I like the I-Zone camera a lot- it's small, lightweight, and really fun to use because the pictures are so creative and (with the sticky film) you can put them anywhere. Also, when you take the picture, you can set the camera  for indoors, outside- cloudy, or outside- sunny and it automatically  adjusts the flash. I took off one star for a few things. One, like everyone  else said, the flash button is pretty loose. Two, I don't like having a  border on the picture- you can only trim it so much. And finally, Polaroid  doesn't make a case for it,  which is kind of a pain. But otherwise it's a  great camera and I'd recommend it!
I've been told by others who've used it for the purpose, overseas, that the little photos produced by these cameras are a wonderful and much-appreciated gift that produces a LOT of excitement in the kids in India and elsewhere who are in so much need that they're begging from tourists, but who are often being abused and exploited in order to make money for others.  This is a gift for THEM; sometimes they'll have no other photo of themselves other than what you just took for them to keep for themselves or give to someone who cares about them.  What a great idea ... I'm buying one for my upcoming trip.  Something of lasting value; better than candy or money.
I must admit this is a very novel idea. I love my camera (I got the clear blue one, I forgot the fancy name). Anyways here are the problems.  1) The on/off/flash wheel is very loose. On many occasions I have had it turn on to the ready flash mode and a few hours later my batteries were gone. This is a real concern as anything will turn them on, even the shuffling of your clothes while it's sitting in your drawer. 2) The pictures are very small so take this into account. If you take a picture with a dozen people, they all come out to be the size of dots. 3) Take pictures REALLY up close not far away. Good luck making out someone on stage at a concert.If used correctly, you will love this camera. Enjoy it but don't expect anything special out of a $20 camera.
No big promises here other than this will add enjoyment to trips, vacations, big dinners, etc -- it is portable candy. It is also a good to have around the house in the way that it is good to have a roll of electrical tape -- it comes in handy for doing odd jobs like a kid's class project that reqs pictures, etc. The film is about $8 for 12 exp -- a little less than a buck a print. Even if you factor in the cost of printing regular film this still has a premium, but it isn't too bad, you get the pictures instantly. All the negatives are only negatives if you use this like a traditional camera. The purpose here is fun.Pluses: - Light, easy to bring anywhere; Instant film; Cheap; Good for kids (no worries)Negs: - Prints are small (large postage stamp); No negatives (one print only), very 'of the moment'
If you're into instant gratification and love the quaintness of small-sized photobooth pictures, then the I-zone camera will thrill you.One of the coolest things about the pictures it produces is that they're quite flattering - not in terms of color but in the way that it makes folks with big, fat heads (like myself) appear smaller and less, well, chipmunk-faced. Yes, it sheds pounds off your face. And another advantage that the I-zone camera's pictures offer is its durability - they're much thicker and harder to bend than photobooth pictures.The secret to taking good I-zone pictures is to take close-ups. You basically want the person whose picture you're taking to fill the entire area of your view finder. A good rule to follow is not to take a photo more than an arms length away from the subject. This also makes it possible for one of the people in the photo to easily take the picture (serving as both subject and photographer).I only have one major complaint about the camera ... While the cameras are small enough to easily tote around in a purse or bag, the on-switch controlling the flash wasn't created securely enough to remain in the off position. This has resulted in many wasted AA batteries after being knocked about in my purse. Funny how AA batteries are never available at home when you need them ...
I'd give the Izone camera 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the flash button is very loose and turns on in my bag all the time, thus, draining out the batteries.  Polaroid needs to redevelop the Flash button  to stop doing that.  Other than that, the camera is really cute!  It is a  serious conversation piece in any social situation.  If you want to meet  people and are shy, go out with a Lime Green Izone!  People will flock to  you like you wouldn't believe.  But that's not why I bring my Izone out  with me.  I love the pictures it takes!  Try and aim really close to your  subject and you won't go wrong.  The pics develop fast, and the border on  the sticky film is all different colors!  Be creative!  Stick the pics  around the house, on your computer, on your letters to friends, on  notebooks, etc.  All my friends have an Izone!
This is a good camera for beginners, and kids, the stickey film isnt that incredibly stickey, but it works. It is a fun camera to have. (^=
I purchased the camera as a gift to my sister and she loved it - it was a load of fun. There are 2 things to be careful of, however. First, the film is expensive. Not all film is &quot;sticky&quot; film and you pay a lot for the 12 exposures you get. Second, the sticky part of the film needs to be improved...it will stick to clothing and other items, but it just doesn't feel like it will...hard to describe. To the touch, the bond does not feel strong. But its a lot of fun.
I RECENTLY PURCHASED AN I-ZONE CAMERA FOR A BACHALORETTE PARTY IN TENNESEE. IT WAS FUN TAKING  PHOTOS AND STICKING THEM IN A SCRAPBOOK AS THE WEEKEND PROGRESSED.THE BRIDE TO BE LOVED IT!  THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT  WHEN YOU THROW THE CAMERA INTO YOUR PURSE IT TURNS ON AND THE BATTERY DIES.  I TRIED TO BUY A CASE BUT NO LUCK.POLAROID SAYS THEY WILL MAKE ONE SOON.BUT  OTHER THAN THAT IT IS LOTS OF FUN.
This is a good but not great camera. Its a fun camera, but not one that I would use often.
The I ZONE Pocket Polaroid Camera is small, portable, fun, and easy to use. I only gave it 4 stars because the film is expensive and the flash button turns on too easily, which drains batteries. It's fun because you can instantly develop your small, sticky pictures and put them anywhere (notebooks, letters, your wall, birthday cards), or you can make an album and decorate it. The pictures are surprisingly good quality, even though they're so small. It's also great for kids because they can use it themselves and invent cool projects. Altogether this is a great camera, you'll get hours of fun out of it.
I got this as a gift, and I think it's great, because it's so easy, and you can buy film for it with sticky or non-stick backs. The only bad part is that even if I aim at a certain thing, the picture always takes the main  focus and puts it in the corner. No matter if I center it or not. And the  film is a bit pricey but it's a great way to take pictures without a lot of  hassle. It's still recomended.
So you love capturing the moment, in any way possible, you love new technology, and funky groovy stuff that that is just so damn kewl?! Then this is for you! Izone is a pretty good size, and comes with a little bag, great for easy access and protection when carrying it with you. Really small pics, EXCELLENT for personalising wallets, folders (great for us school kiddies!), diaries, books, albums, fridges (??!!!), practically anywhere! It's not for scenery taking at all, really just people in their general situations, and taking kwik pics of friends and fam, and totally new people! Great to give to friends too to remember the moment! It goes off!The only problem would be easy accessablility for the film, it's not that easy to get, but if you buy alot in one go, excellent! definently worth it!
This camera is light, VERY easy to use, fun, and SO VERY convenient if you don't like waiting for the photo shop to develope your pictures, and great when you like capturing lots of nice moments between friends, family, and pets.  It takes awesome pictures inside AND outside. And you can pick your own cool color, and pick your own funky design you want of the paper the picture comes out on. It is SOOOOOOOO easy to use.  And the picture developes fast.  But......and I hate to use that word, there was one tiny flaw that kind of disappointed me, the fact that the pictures are smaller than what they advertise them to be, they're not super duper tiny, but they are pretty small, so it makes the faces of the people hard to make out if your not RIGHT UP in their face taking the picture. But other than that, the sticky film takes good pic's and is fun to stick everywhere around you.  But the film is kinda pricey for only 12 photo's per package, but I personally think its worth it, so I recomend buying one.
The sleek and compact size is totally awesome for those &quot;I wish I had my camera&quot; moments. The only dissappointment was that sometimes the pics don't come out, like they will have an exposed streak in them. This only happened to me 2 times out of a whole bunch of rolls of film, and the other let down was the film is OUTRAGOUSLY EXPENSIVE!! It comes to almost a dollar a picture!!! i was like OOOMMMMGGG!
This camera is SO awesome. My friend got one and then I did. I'm glad she suggested it to me. It's so fun. Just shoot it and... VOILA... the picture coes right out of the camera! It is so fun to play around with. The only egative thing about it is the film costs a LOT and you only get so many film sticks. Other than that, this is a really cool product. I would DEFINETLY add this to my wish list.
I've read that this lens is the same optically as the newer version II, so I looked around on ebay and picked one up for only $95 wooohooo!!  The lens is a lot of fun.  It's almost always on my 6D (I know, I know, it's a $1900 dollar camera, why bother with this p.o.s.?)  Well, it's got everything one would need to take great shots in good light (now with 6D getting good results at iso 12800, in bad light light too): lighting quick USM, insta-manual overide, great focal length range, and decent aperture (I almost always shoot Av @ 5.6 anyway)It's sharp!  The colors are good (no CA, but low contrast which is very simple to correct in adobe raw)  At 5.6 it's approaching L quality and at f8 it's there.  So why break your back lugging some big huge L monster around when this works perfect?  If you're like me then when you need some low DOF artsy-fartsy shots, you'll whip out your 50mm 1.8, 85 1.8, or 100 2.0 and be a hundred times better than the L monster zooms anyway.On top of all this, the newer full frames correct for CA and fall off in camera, which is the reason I bought this in the first place.  Looks great, saves the back and the back pocket.Edit October 2013:I took away one star just because the handling is so bad.  The manual focus mechanism is basically unusable.
I often buy this as a gift, especially for the 8-12 year old group.  It's easy to use and the pictures aren't bad - they're about 1 X 1 1/2 inches and have the same fuzzy flattering quality of the regular size Polaroids.  The film isn't cheap, though, and after the kids run through the  measly 5 picture roll that's included, Mom and Dad or older kids with allowances get to shell out close to [price] for another 3-roll pack (12 pictures each).  But it is fun and kids of all ages love it.
These things are addictive, and I already have a digital camera!  I'd give it 5 stars but the film is a little expensive considering how small the pictures are (but note it is NOT $5/picture ... - more like $0.60/picture).  Also, the adhesive is very light weight.  I guess it's good if you want to remove it from things but I was expecting something stronger.
This is a whimsical little Polaroid instant camera that would make a great gift to bring to a (Christmas?) party. It's also great for the kids' annual school yearbook signing ceremony. At twenty bucks, it's cheap enough to not worry about its long term utility, and its major drawback, the price of film (about fifty cents a shot for a postage stamp pic), will be the recipient's problem, not yours.
As advertised on TV and true to the original, the Polaroid I-Zone is instant fun and simple to use.Even better, the plastic camera is fairly  inexpensive (about $20) and really cool looking (think: VW Bug meets the  iMac).  Image quality and exposure are surprising good for a tiny plastic  lens.  In addition, the I-Zone comes with a built-in flash.The  caveats:1. The film is expensive (about $5/shot!) which really adds up  after awhile. 2. The prints are really really small (postage stamp size).  3. No negatives, so forget about making re-prints. 4. It leaks (somewhat)  caustic goo on you.All told, think of it as a toy and give it a whirl.  For $20, you can't lose.
Now it's not the type of camera you'd take on family vacations! It's perfect for children/teenagers who like to take pictures of friends etc. The film is pricy but $20 isn't bad for the camera. The &quot;prints&quot; are tiny. You have to get semi-personal with the person you're taking the picture of, meaning to get a good size headshot...you'd have to get pretty close. The flash is a bit overpowering, but if you just take it as a toy, then you won't be too disappointed.
The camera is great for kids!  Easy and fun to use.  The camera should come with more detailed instructions on peeling the back off of the film to get it to stick.  We've gone through roll and haven't figured it out yet.  It is a fun camera for the price.
You would like this if you are into taking pictures that are really small and can be stuck places. This would be the camera for you if you're into that kind of thing. It's even better if you enjoy the color red. But the film is a little expensive.
My friends and I love to use this camera when we go out on the town. Its lightweight, and its easy for us to trade the stickers, no more fighting  over copies! And the different colors help us keep our cameras straight! I  love to decorate my house and car with the pics of my friends all dressed  up and ready to go out. It is affordable enough that if we were to lose  them (cross your fingers..) it would be okay to replace. I highly recommend  it to anyone who loves spontaneous shots, and is Highly Fashionably! Buy  one to match all your outfits.
This is a cool little camera, but it's a good thing it comes with an intro pack of film..out of the 6 that I took, only 3 came out because I didn't pull the film out right away. The instructions don't really say this, they just have illustrations, it would be nice if polaroid had specified this. If you're ordering off of amazon, definitely pick up some film, you'll need it.
This is a very, very fun camera, it takes really cute pictures and looks great also. The pictures are surprisingly good concidering they are only a little bit larger than a stamp. The only complaint I have is that the camera takes a picture of more than what you see through the veiw finder, it takes a little getting used to.
This is a really durable camera. i've dropped it about a billion times, and it still works as well as ever! The focus isn't all that great, and the pix aren't SUPER high quality, but considering the price... but the pix are absolutely adorable. the size is so cute. i definitely recommend this camera!
It's ok but i wish the film was cheaper and it had a tiny bit bigger piture.
I love my ZR45MC, but it really requires this extended battery.The battery that came with my ZR45MC is woefully inadequate for anything but a handful of brief cameo shots.  Also, the charge doesn't hold for any extended period of time.  You may pull out your ZR to catch a great moment in time only to find that the battery has discharged while idle in the camera bag.  Not using the LCD does help the situation quite a bit.This extended battery makes a good primary battery and seems to go more than twice as long as the normal one.  Also, you can then use the original as a backup (as long as you refresh it's charge occassionally :-) ).
I charge it up and it works.  I've had it for a few years and I'm still using it.  The capacity is much greater than the stock battery.  It fits well, and although it is rather heavy, it doesn't fall off of the camera.
It is surely a rare day when I buy a product that does exactly what I want and lives up to what the company says it can do.Batteries fully charged in three hours, THE ABSOLUTE Winner hands down for staying power, my Toshiba digital would eat any other rechargeable, but with the Monster it lasts thru frame after frame, even with flash.(out performs projected #of frames). These people have made a friend for life!
These are very good batteries and I like the charger because it is compact and quick (3 hrs).  However, I just learned that Monster just released the ULTRA 2000 POWER PACK which are 2000mAh batteries!  4 Power Pack (4 batteries + charger) is retailing for fifty bucks and 4 batteries are retailing for thirty bucks.
After reading the reviews, just bought the charger. The first charge took about 3 hours, then the led turned green. I accidentally disconnected the power, when I plug it again, the led turns orange, and start charging again. Will this hurt the battery?
After purchasing an Olympus D-40 after a disastrous time with multiple Sony camera's I learned that rechargeable batteries are a must.  I purchased these when I bought the Olympus, not wanting to wait for Maha batteries from a separate mail order.  I have not regretted buying these batteries at all.  My father after trying Radioshack, Rayovac, Maxell and Maha bought the Monster Cable charger and well the rest is history.
I doubt that digital cameras will replace film. Now is the time to buy used SLRs and this is a great one. The body is sturdy and well built and just fits well in your hand. The buttons and digital screen work well, but pushing buttons in combination etc is a little annoying to me. I personally am partial to the knobs on the some of the older canon SLRs. The metering works well as does the autofocus although my experience has been that the autofocus on my older Canon Elan IIe is a little bit faster and just as accurate, perhaps because of the infrared autofocus assist light. Also, the electronic automatic focus point selection seems to work better on my older Elan IIe than on this camera, but the Eos 3 has a lot more focus points and I almost always wear glasses which makes it more difficult for the computer.For those not familiar with the Canon selection wheels on the back of the camera and on the right front, it is a wonderful design and has been continued on this camera. My only gripe is that I really dont like the little compartment that you have to open up on the right side of the body in order to access certain controls. A minor issue though. I highly recommend this camera, and along with it, get yourself the cheap Canon 50mm prime lens and you will be off taking great pictures in no time.
Ordered this battery for my camera.  When it arrived, I put it in the camera and plugged in the charger.  Darn...a flashing light which indicates there's a problem with the new battery...ugg.  Called Amazon and explained I had ordered this so I could take a digital picture that was due Tues and I had received a bad battery..  It's now Sat and no batteries available locally.  No problem.  Amazon immediately shipped out a new replacement battery which I received TUESDAY...lol.  Held my breath, put it in the camera, plugged the charger in, and there was what I was looking for...a nice steady green light.  It charged in hours and I had time to do what I needed to do.After a few hours of charging it says I have 100 hours of use on this new battery.  I suspect this is going to be a nice one.  If there's any problems I'll come back and update but I don't expect a problem at all.
It is in very good condition.  I have enjoyed taking photos with it and look forward to taking many many more memorable shots with it.
The Rebel Ti is replacing the Rebel 2000 and has a couple features that make it a little better.1) The lens mount is metal instead of plastic. This makes the camera a little better made, and should last longer than the cheap plastic mounts as this area takes a lot of wear from changing lenses etc.2) The pop-up flash sits higher. This reduces the chance of red eye because the angle between the flash and the lens is greater.3) Faster continuous shooting speed at 2.5 frames per second, and faster AF (AutoFocus)One strange feature is that the lens is "backwards" compared to other cameras. You turn to the left to zoom in and to the right to zoom out instead of vice versa, so this may take a little getting used to if you have shot with other SLR cameras.All in all a decent camera for the entry level user.
After 12 years of other interests, I decided to get back into one of my favorite hobbies - photography.  I was looking for an intermediate SLR that could be both fully auto and as manual as I would like.  AND not be too expensive....  The Canon Rebel TI fit the order perfectly.I am very impressed with the features packed into this small, light camera.  While, I have had to work and practice a little to understand all the features, I have found the camera to be very sophisticated and capable.  I can also point and shoot at those times I just don't want to think about the details.  Either way, I have gotten great photos in outdoor scenery, family photos, and the kid's sports.My only concern with the camera was the electronic view finder.  There are seven focusing zones each shown with a red light in a box.  I found the red light in the top and bottom boxes have a halo around them as if the light is being reflected or diffused.  I had the camera replaced (great service by Amazon!) and had the same issue.  I have looked at the same camera in other stores and see it in all of them.  No one really seems to know why the problem exists, but it does not seem to impact my photo's.  I do not think this is a reason to NOT buy the camera.All in all, I'm very pleased with the camera and received 2 Honorable Mentions in a photo contest I entered 3 weeks after purchase.
I purchased this camera 1 1/2 years ago under the advise of my sister, who is a professional photographer, and I LOVE IT!  It is so easy to use, no other can compare.  Beautiful photos outdoors but flash is a bit harsh indoors (lots of shadow and overexposed skin tones, even at a distance) I will admit that I don't use the manual modes (only the different modes of automatic) so I am certain there are ways to balance the light of an automatic flash, but I take TONS of photos of my 3 kids with this camera for their scrapbooks and I am rarely disappointed.  Excellent for a mom/dad to get great shots of the family.  I am currently looking into a digital camera to complement this one, but this Canon is sticking with me as my primary/predictable sidekick.
This camera is very light and has the ability to let you use manual or automatic modes and learn how to take pictures.  I would recomend getting the Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens for this camera and a replacement zoom lens (one with a wider maximum aperature) as the lens that coms with the kit is not the best but still takes decent pictures.
An excellent camera for the money.  I'm a fan of 35mm over digital, so finding a good camera is always a problem.  I've shot about ten rolls already, all turning out superb.  The flash is a nice feature.  The only downside I found was the manual was on CD.  I prefer paper manuals for quicker reference.  That's the only reason it lost one star.
I've only have my Canon Ti for a week and I've already developed and purchased additional film (B&W;).  I was instantly impressed and amazed at the quality of pictures that I, as an amateur (and first-time camera owner) could produce.  The color, sharpness, and realism portrayed in the film, along the light-weight, durable, and attractive camera body makes it a popular model, with no shock.I did a lot of personal research on modern day SLR 35mm cameras before I made my purchase and my eyes were instantly fixated on this model.  The only reason that I did not give this camera a full 5-star review is that this is not the best camera on the market.  Dispite the excellent monetary value, depth of use (a 60-page manual included!), and film quality that is produced, this camera is not the best out there, and obviously lacks digital properties.  However, being a college student, and having a film camera in mind, this was the best choice for me; I'm a proud new Canon owner, I don't regret my purchase in the slightest, and I can't wait to take more pictures.All I personally recommend is: look for a better deal through Amazon's private dealers or on eBay, read the instruction manual, don't be intimidated, and have fun...this camera takes great pics, good shooting.~S
This is a great accessory for my Canon EOS Rebel 35mm camera.  It allows the camera to be run on standard AA cells, instead of the 3V lithium batteries it usually takes.  That translates into about $5 worth of alkaline cells, as compared to about $16 worth of lithium cells.In addition, this provides an extra grip for the camera, especially useful when taking portrait-oriented shots.  An extra shutter-release button on the unit places that function in a more convenient location when the camera is held on-end, and there is a switch to turn off the second shutter-release to prevent accidental activation in other positions.  All in all, the unit is well thought out, and functions in every way as intended.The only thing I wish is that the construction were metal, rather than plastic.  With careful handling the unit is durable enough, but the &#34;stalk&#34; that inserts into the camera's battery compartment is a vulnerable point, and if the unit is dropped, I expect that's the part that would likely break.  That would be a sorry event, because I have found this to be a very useful accessory, and it's always on one or another of my cameras.
I love the adapter saving me from having to buy the mega expensive CR2 batteries my EOS T2 uses. However I thought I could use rechargeable batteries with this adapter. As most NiMH and NiCAD rechargeables are 1.2V (versus alkaline being 1.5v) I am guessing the 4 rechargeables was only giving 4.8v versus the 2 CR2's giving 6 volts ... not enough to power the camera.
I am very happy with the product. I still use film and I needed something to help my shutter stay open for those night shots. In various weather, I used about 20 or more rolls out of this. Many of the pictures were night shots, with "bulb" or 30 second shutter settings. I also used....rechargeable batteries that should have been fully charged before putting them in. So, I highly recommend this battery pack if you use 35mm.It works well with my tripod, no complaints. It may appear bulky but I don't really care about that. I think it is easier to hold now anyways. My only advice is that you should use alkaline batteries. If you want to save money, use some rechargeable's (they're back on the market again!).It is worth every penny.
This product is great, not only is it a Canon, but it is built very robustly and replaces those horrendously expensive cr-2 batteries that last less then a few shoots with 4x AA batteries that just keep on shooting with no power drainage. This also adds some nice weight to my K2. Only draw back is that there is no exposure dial on the vertical grips shutter release.
Battery grips have become a widely used accessory for those who use their SLR regularly.  They typically add a grip to make vertical shooting easier and a expanded battery department to allow for longer sessions without battery changes.  This grip in particular takes inexpensive and widely available AA batteries (4), which will save money quickly over the $12 or so a pair of the batteries that these cameras take on their own.  Rechargable batteries work fine in the grip.  Also included is an additional shutter release to go with the new vertical grip.  I'd love to have seen a tripod socket in line with the lens and perhaps a sensor for Canon's remote shutter release, which isn't built into many bodies (if it has a shutter release button, all that would be needed is a cheap IR sensor).  All in all, it's an inexpensive way to add value to your camera, save money on batteries, and simply look cooler.
Very good and helpful device. Adds quite a bit of bulk and weight. I would recommend you use it when you can't get ahold of the smaller batteries, or you are going on a trip. Vertical shutter release comes in very handy. It comes down to this, if you want more battery life you have to accept more bulk in your camera. Even with the battery pack my rebel k2 still weighs less than most digitals I have tried out.
Fits well and does a good job of diffusing my camera mounted Bower flash.  Lost the original one I bought, so I bought a replacement.
but thats kind of preferable in most camera gear. You don't want things slipping around now do you. Good buy for the money
I like the fact that it doesn't need velcro to attach it to the flash head (older models had to be attached that way).
You attach this to a Vivitar 285HV on "the inside", and it works well, much better than direct flash.
This is a simple device, and can seem pricey for a one-piece shaped chunk of plastic. However, it can really make a great improvement in flash photography.  As a portable flash 'helper' it's great, and diffuses and softens the output from the flash pretty nicely.  As the distance to the subject increases, you'll rapidly get less light from the flash with this device attached, so for full-body shots at 70mm or so you may want to remove it, or at least try several flash options (which is probably good advice in general).  With the flash pointed straight up and this diffuser attached, you may get more direct light on a fairly close subject than without it.All in all, it was a worthwhile purchase that expands my options for flash photography.
Fits my Speed light and seems to work okay. There really isn't much you can say about it except it fits and works!!!
This is very nice add on. It's helping to make your picture looking nicer while using flash gun. The light is diffused and picture are really gaining by using Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce.
This flash diffuser is a great little product, a very simple device, in fact you could probably make one yourself, but for only twenty bucks it's worth it.  I've been shooting lots of flash pictures where the subjects face burned out when I got in close.  With the Omni-Bounce it definitely softens the quality of the light and reduces the harsh highlights.  It's not always 100% percent effective, and it reduces the effective flash to subject distance, but does make a BIG difference.  I like the overall softening of the light quality in any case.  I recommend it.
bought it for my Canon 420EX, snug fitting on the top of the flash, and will not fit if left on the flash in the stock Canon flash bag. Other than that a definite add to your gear list, makes the flash alot less harsh especially in close range, provide a nice glow. it obviously reduces max range of flash, but makes for better composition especially on people.HTH
It works fine and you can get great colors of your photos. The photo will have a smooth definition a brilliant colors. First you can take some pictures and adjust the flash for proper illumination and there you have it.
Simple, cheap, easy to use and works well. I also bought the gold tinted version, which has produced some very nice portrait shots.
The item is as advertised. Fits my flash perfectly and it works really well.
The diffuser for this Sunpak works very well but is slightly too opaque.  As stated from another user, if you need full power, you might want to take off the diffuser and bounce off a white wall.  Right now, I keep things simple and either use an index card and rubber band w/the flash facing straight up or slightly forward or I'll spend a Dollar and buy a plastic bottle of alcohol and cut off the bottom and use that as a diffuser.  It works nicely and is dirt cheap.
I've needed something to diffuse lighting with many flash based shots and this does a good job. The but for me is placing the item on the flash. It was a bit tight. Getting it off, on the other hand was quite a dilemna. Took almost 5 minutes to slide it off without dropping the flash itself. Don't know why it's so tight. I use the Sunpak 383. Would have given it a 5 if not for the stress in putting it on and taking it off.
This clamp is a nice alternative to using a tripod.  When a tripod is simply too cumbersome to carry, this clamp provides excellent versatility when combined with a nice ball head.  Just connect the tripod ball head to the clamp using the adapter, and you'll have a perfect mount for your camera.  I specifically bought this for a sailing trip, and found it very useful for mounting on a stainless steel rail or stanchion.  I've also used it on a picnic bench, railing on a staircase, a branch, the back of a chair, and even a door.  The clamp is VERY sturdy, very high quality, and can securely hold a camera or other equipment without any worries.  I use a Canon DSLR with a big Canon USM 24-70 lens and this product holds the weight just fine.  This is exactly the kind of quality you can expect from Manfrotto.  This adds lots of versatility in a small package.  Another must-have in any photographer's camera bag.Helpful hint:  I purchased an extra ball head to use exclusively with this clamp, the Manfrotto 496RC2 Ball Head with Quick Release Replaces Manfrotto 486RC2, and it pairs up perfectly in weight and balance, and allows me to leave my regular ball head mounted on the tripod.Update:  I noticed another reviewer said their clamp didn't come with the the stud, but mine certainly did.  His seems to be unfortunately missing, but it DOES come with one.
I gave it a 4 only because it is a little large. For photographer it is fine. I am using it on a display to hold a webcam in front of my products.Clamps to almost anything, and stays there.I use it with Manfrotto 237HD Heavy-Duty Flex Arm - excellent combo.enjoy-
It seems to be quite versatile.  However, if it will work for what I want it for still remains to be seen.  I am going on a photo safari to Africa in a few weeks.  I bought it with the idea that I might be able to clamp a camera on a Safari Vehicle cross bar with the use of a ball head tripod mount.Even if it doesn't work for that I am sure I can find several other used for it.
I have owned this clamp for two years now.  It is not something that I use everyday but when it is needed it is very handy.  It is a very heavy duty clamp.  This is not a lite weight clamp.  And it will definitely clamp on tight so you need to be careful and not over-tighten and damage what you have it attached to.  I have used it with a dslr and also with a gopro camera.  My main complaint would be the weight but it is solid.  Very minor compliant.  A good accessory to have.
A much needed replacement. I lost the original somewhere so, my tripod was useless. The grip is actually much better than the original one.
I purchased this plate as an additional plate for my camera gear to use with an existing tripod.  I do prefer the older design with the cork rather than the new black synthetic anti-slip pad, but thats more for asthetic reasons.  Functionally, I'm not sure there is a difference.It works just as well as my original cork based plate in my Bogen/Manfrotto tripod head, so theres nothing more to say.
This 1/4" to 3/8" adapter works.  It is well made.  I'm using this on my old (late 1970's) but excellent tripod that only has 1/4-20 hardware. And I needed something to fit my Kirk BH-3 ballhead to tripod. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the flange could be larger diameter to give more support. Highly recommended.
These feet are a good solution for a problem that shouldn't have existed, I bought a Manfrotto carbon fiber tripod not expecting that it would come with plastic feet that slide on (and off). After losing one of the feet at the beach, these replacement feet solved the problem. They are firmly attached and IMHO should have been standard on a $400 tripod.
Very nice and nicely made, just thought it came with the holder too!
It was great to find a cap that fits a specific model for my professional camera (for which I had previously mislocated the lid).
I bought this item to remove fine specks of dust and filaments off my sensor, and it worked well. It was a bit difficult to clean thought, however, as stated, AVOID touchig the tip with your bare fingers, the sticky part is ultrasensitive and will pick up your skin oils.All in all, this is a handy tool to have if you clean your own SLR sensor.
I wish I had this the last time I was taking photos of my friends wedding. Didn't realize there was a spec till I was already reviewing the shots at the end of downloading hundreds of photos.Apparently I had a dust on the sensor of my Canon 20D, and it just wouldn't come off. Tried using a blow-kit that I had, didn't work. Got this, and it came right off without harming the sensor.Very easy to handle, espeically if you have large hands like my own. Just be gentle when applying pressure, and you'll be fine. I have this one me everytime I'm on the field. Better than sitting at the desk photoshoping all of those "dots" in all of those pictures.
A while back I got a few specks of dust on my sensor. I ended up buying this along with some sensor wipes. This was easy to use to get the large dust particles off. I supplemented using this with sensor wipes to get the smaller particles off. I'm glad I bought this.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it was a bit too small for my needs. It will prob be fine for small camera lenses as designed. I was looking for an antistatic brush to use to dust off internal PC parts like Graphics & Sound card circuit boards,& Motherboard. Dust always accumulates inside PC cases & they need to be cleaned out once in a while.I've been building my own PC's for 12 years. A friend called me not too long ago with a constant shutdown problem. It seems the PC was overheating & was shutting down before any damage could occur. The case was loaded with dust so bad,he had to get the vacuum cleaner & a small brush.
Allow the use of the Lee Filter kit on my wide angle lens with no vignetting.I also purchased the plastic lens caps that allow me to leave the adapter on the lens, as the current lens cap can't be used with the adapter in place.
I purchased this item even after reading some of the negative reviews. Here's my take.Old lenses are a lot of fun and you can get some great lenses for a reasonable price. My macro lens cost me around $100 and it performs much, much better than that. The adapter is a simple metal ring that fits on your camera body lens mount. I happen to have aCanon EOS 40D, but it shouldn't matter as long as the camera has an EF mount. You line up the red dots like you would on a lens and twist it to lock it into place. After that, you mount the lens (I have a Canon FD 50mm f/3.5 macro lens). It snapped right into place. In this configuration, I like to set the camera on AE mode so that I can manually adjust the aperture on the lens and allow the camera to meter and pick the shutter speed.The only problem (which isn't really a problem) is that when the adapter snaps into place, it isn't held very tightly in place. It is locked in, so it can't fall off but it will wiggle back and forth a few centimeters. This is kind of a pain when you are focusing since it moves around. Other than that, this adapter has worked beautifully for me. I highly recommend it.
This lens mount adapter allows you to use your old Canon FD lenses on you new Canon EOS camera.  It works well with telephoto lenses in the manual mode.  Just stop your lens down and let the camera select the shutter speed in the Program mode.  Works great with telephotos but doesn't work at all with wide angle lenses. Don't put it on too tight or you might not get it off.
The unit worked as described without issue.  However the unit is difficult to remove from the lens once its on.  Not that big of an issue for me, others my find it extremely problematic.
The mount received was as requested and work as expected except for the issue of it not coming off.  There maybe a way to do it but I don't know how except to start unscrewing things.  But that is unneeded because I don't think that I will need to remove it anyway.  Over all it does what it needs to do.Edit:  I figured o=how to dismount the lens.  However (at least on my 50) it has a real problem with make images so soft that the colors bleed out or not in focus at all.  Very disappointing.  I could be doing something wrong.  IF someone knows. Please let me know.I am also revising my star rating from 3 stars to 4.  The product does work as advertised.  I just did not know how (at the time) to use it.
Just what I needed to start using my old Canon AE1 (film) Lenses with my new Canon T3i (digital) camera!  Be careful though, there are no instructions that come with it so it may take a little bit to figure out but it works perfectly!
A good price and I think a good product for that price. I would buy this again and recommend. I am using it and am pleased.
I bought this as a second insert to go inside my F-2 bag.The padding is nice and thick and the velcro mates up with the velcro inside of the bag.Only slight negative is that the foam inserts in the sides are not sealed on the bottom. I am not sure if this is to allow a couple of them to be removed (if you only want front and back protection) or what, but it seemed a little unfinished for the price.The Canon 5D Mark III with an attached 50mm lens fits nicely in the pocket with the ability to be easily removed.
The insert fits my F-4AF well and offers sufficient padding, but the construction's lacking. Thankfully, I don't have to move it much in the bag, otherwise I'd be concerned that I'd rip the seams. 1 star off for adequate construction.
I have the Domke F2.  It came with a large 4 slot compartment insert for lenses, flashes, etc... but no padding insert for the camera area.  I bought this to put next to the large 4 slot compartment insert.  The two inserts set next to each other nicely in a Domke F2 bag.  This should have come standard with the domke F2... along with the 4 slot insert.  This is the missing piece to your bag.  Complaint... bit pricey, like all Domke gear is.I keep my Nikon D90 w/ 18-105mm f4-5.6 Kits lens attached in it.  Fits good with lens facing down or up.
I found out about this from a professional bird photographer.  When he had a normal lens on his camera (meaning not his monster 500mm), he would always use the Domke when stowing the body/lens in his pack or a snug spot among other gear in the trunk.I do mostly weddings and various events with a 5D Mk III and a backup 60D, so I bought two.  I use them to keep dust off while my cameras are at home, when carrying a body in the trunk, and I also use one as an alternative to the lens case that came with my 70-200mm when it is in my pack, as the lens case is huge and just takes up too much space.These are not padded, so they obviously were NOT designed to protect against anything more than a light knock against a hard surface.  But they keep dust and the occasional water droplets out, protect buttons and knobs and displays, and also protect body and lens barrel from scratches.The largest size is big enough to wrap a 60D and 24-70mm, but with a 5D Mk III with the same lens, there is little room to spare.  (Note that I keep L-brackets on both cameras at all times.)One thing that is puzzling is that, to get a good wrap, you have to put the softer side OUT, meaning that the somewhat water resistant side is inside.  Intuitively, you'd think that the soft side should contact the gear and the plasticky side should be outside, but that makes wrapping properly difficult as the Velcro contact points are very limited.For traveling to locations and stowing body/lens combinations at home, I highly recommend this.  Just understand that it is not designed to protect against impact.Update:  I figured how to wrap my 5D Mk III and 70-200mm f/2.8L II with the largest size.  Just had to try a few ways of folding so the Velcro could stick.  I've ordered three more of these as gifts for fellow photographers!
I was looking for a wrap to protect my lenses when I would like to carry them in a bag that is not a camera bag. I carry a large bag for all my everyday stuff and my daughters. With a kid and a large carry all I can't really handle an additional camera bag. This wrap met my needs for hauling around an additional lens. I will say I bought 2 wraps and this was the larger of the two and it is large! It was way bigger than I imagined and could completely wrap and camera with a large lens!
I have several Domke wraps in different sizes. I use them when I want to just take my dslr and one or two lenses and I don't want to carry my camera bag, I just use these in my brief case or back pack along with whatever else I am carrying that day. While they may not be padded enough to protect the equipment if I drop the bag on concrete, they supply ample protection against the equipment banging together in the bag.
I bought it for my tablet, and its great. Mine is a 10.1 inc and it fit perfectly, there is a lot of room.
I used these many years ago for camera gear.  Now I throw them in to a suit case in case I buy something breakable for the return trip.  They are good protection and the color makes the object easy to find in a full case.
I'm mostly leaving this review because when I purchased the 19-inch wrap, I wasn't entirely sure it would work with my DSLR + Battery Grip + medium sized zoom lens.It does work.  In fact, it is possible a smaller size would work, although with 15 inches being the next size smaller, I couldn't be confident (17 inches would seem ideal).That being said, the extra size for this particular wrap makes for nice padding and it will be great as I throw together an ad-hock kit for hiking and a messenger bag kit for a day about town without the requirement of a real camera bag. This wrap gives the flexibility of wrapping my body and a lens no-matter the combination.  It will further double as padding in the messenger bag for quick access when access is a necessity.
Bought two of these, one for my point and shoot and one to cover the bluetooth keyboard for my tablet, both for travel.  They serve their purpose nicely and the red is bright enough so I don't leave anything behind.
Nice product.  Well made and serves it's purpose well, flexible and will shape easily to whatever you wrap it around.  Purchased the 11" to wrap my E-PL1 with a Panasonic 14-45 lens attached, unfortunately it's too small and had to upsize to the 15".Great product.
I got this Domke 19" protective wrap to protect my Canon T1i and Sigma 18-250mm lens while travelling with it in my backpack.  It's big enough to easily fully wrap up my camera with lens and is just cushy enough that I had no worries about it banging around into my other travel gear in my backpack.
this is a nice product, and comes in varying sizes. I mistakenly purchased one too small for my wireless keyboard. Later, I learned that larger sizes are available. in the meantime, however, I had already bought an entirely different keyboard case. I can envision many good uses for the Domke product. I may buy one in the future. Thank you, Joe Fegan
These wraps are great for use when you're wrapping an odd size object or where space matters are concerned. When I travel I can't take my dedicated lens bags with me due to the bulk. So I carry these wraps and collapsible Domke inserts with me.Only problem with the Domke wraps is that they're made of felt. Since they're felt, sand or abrasive hairs can stick to the material and will sneak in to your gear.I tried the alternative Nikon wraps which have a nylon shell and a tighter nap of felt cloth on the other side. This solution seems to work a bit better. But I'm floored by the cost of these.Check the Nikon wraps here:Nikon Protective Wrap with Nikon Logo - Large (15 x 15")
Moisture Munchers  1 OZ packages work really well for underwater video housings.  I have a Sony HDR-XR520 video camera and use a clear Ikelite Video Housing.Camera motor heats up air in housing causing fogging of lens.  Tried the smaller camera type muncher to no avail... but I tried the 1 OZ. packages and it curedmy problem.  I just slide it in on top of camera when installing in housing.  Works great.  I get about 10 dives out of each packet if I keep housing pretty much closed up.Sealife Moisture Muncher 1 oz. Packs (Set of 3)
Excellent replacement  for the one I misplaced. I like the setup offered by the Velbon tripod. If you are buying the pod get an extra quick release bracket right away it release speeds up switching cam set ups....
I ordered this because I had a telescopic lens for my Minolta Maxxum, and this works perfectly. My telescope screws in great. It even has a lock ring which that allows you to center the lens as you need.
Great quality case with a versatile design.  Unfortunately Amazon describes it as 8 1/2" Wide, It's almost 16" wide.  I was very dissappointed that I had to return it.  It was perfect except for it's size.
I would buy from the vendor again! After using cameras with drive grips I have trouble using one without.  I like the bulk and control and the additional speed that it provides in the number of frames per second.  The product arrived promptly however it failed to work.  At which point I gave the seller a very very low score and review.  In response to my comments I was contacted and we worked on the problem.  The battery compartment contacts had some corrosion on them so that they insulated the motor from the batteries.  I obtained some rubbing alchohol and cleaned the contacts and checked the connections as suggested and the drive worked.  I inserted the battery pack and it is working with both my nikon fe and fm2n.  I am happy and my experience with the owner was helpful in resolving what was an annoying problem.  Don't be afraid to order from them!
Used this to clean negatives both before making prints in the darkroom, and before making slides in the digital lab. Did an excellent job cleaning off most big dust, and kept it static free for quite some time.
A good product, works effectively to dispel dust on negatives-- difficult to find traditional darkroom items.  I will use it often.
you will not need it all the timebut handy when you need itFrom Leica you get what you paid for
A bit large for an underwater camera housing.i would recommend it.
They do the job, but they are only temporary, Once they have achieved their max absortion you might as well throw them away.
I have never used one of these before, but it seems to do ok. It softens the intensity of the flash, yet allows enough light for a good picture. It seems to work better for distances not exceeding 15 feet.
My only experience using a flash has been my A100 pop-up. When I got my 56AM for Christmas, I never once used it without the Sto-Fen diffuser, so I don't have any legitimate 56AM images to compare or contrast, but it's functioned well for me so far and did well at a wedding this past weekend.Otherwise, it arrived on time and everything works great. It's a very snug fit, so if you get one and think you may have purchased the wrong diffuser, keep trying, it's hard to get on, but it will eventually.
I bought mine new several years ago - takes great pictures, but is definitely an older design, e.g. 1.25 x 1" LCD screen vs. the entire camera back of newer cameras.  I often need to take extreme close-ups for illustrations, and this has macro capability to about 1/2".  My only real complaint is the ease in which the Mode wheel can be accidently nudged to an undesired setting.  Before I shoot, I check the Mode to make sure it is in the detent of the proper setting.  Also, the Nikon software is incredibly complex and counter-intuitive.  Skip it and just use the Windows or Mac importing software you already have on your PC.
This is good for blocking the sun and helping see the LCD.  I have a fold-out LCD and have to remove the Hoodman any time I put the camera away.  Otherwise it works great.
If you use your tripod outdoor in terrain, you need this, though I question the relatively high cost.  It says it is for D19 legs but it is actually for round 19mm legs.  It should fit any 19mm legs, including D.
It can be a bit of a pain to keep pulling the pics out of the camera, and to get just the 2 x 1" pic you have to use scissors (at least on the sticky film), but it is a fun little device. Seems to take great pics in all kinds of light. You can't find anything like it on the market, at least not without a printer and a glue stick. It's not a Leica, but if you have reasonable expectations, you won't be disappointed. I got this for a wedding reception; we snapped pics and put them in the guestbook. It was a big hit.A tip: Those having trouble may be either using the "outdoor" setting indoors as I did a few times (it makes dark pics), or shooting too far from the flash (you need to shoot within 5-6' to illuminate your subject).
I work at an animal shelter and we like to have a picture of each animal on their cage cards. It used to be a hassle. Someone would e-mail me the pictures, I'd have to shrink them down, print then out, cut them out and tape them to the cards. Now, with my new Polaroid i-Zone 200 with sticky film, I can take the animal's picture and immediately stick it on their cage card, eliminating all those other steps! Unless you have a specific purpose for this camera like I did, it's probably only good for kids and teens. The film is extremely expensive though.
While this isn't something you want to take "picture" pictures with, it is a unique little device that creates an unconventional product, almost in the same vein as the Pixelvision camera.You have to put in a little practice to get the hang of capturing clear images with the i-zone.  You have to be very still holding the camera, the light has to be right (that is to say: abundant) and even the best pictures are still only 1.5 x 1" in size.  In this digital age, most will consider it a pain to take that kind of care for such a small result but those who do will probably be able to use these cameras in an innovative way.  I've heard that this has been discontinued and have stashed away several clips of film so I can continue to use this when I want.INTERESTING SIDE NOTE: You can actually get a Polaroid double exposure with these things.  Take a photograph.  Leave the strip inside the camera. Take another photograph.  Extract the film and you'll see two images, one on top of the other.  The second snapshot you take tends to be the dominant image, while the first one is fainter.  I recommend using the flash if you plan to experiment with double exposures.
I am so sad these aren't being made anymore.  I bought one last year before embarking on a two month trip through India.  I wanted to take photos of places and things along my journey and be able to stick them into my journal so as to better remember things when I came home and had to put the photo albums together.  It was wonderful.  The image quality wasn't stellar, but it isn't meant to be.I am leaving a review now, because I am beginning to compile another preparation list for an extended journey and thought this would be great to have again.  (I lost the one i purchased last year in transit home :(.
The photos from this camera are tiny but legible.  Not for albums (unless your album is 2" X 1") but perfect for gatherings with friends & family.  When I have a dinner party I take a photo of each person as they come in and use it as a placecard or name tag.  Since the camera itself is inexpensive I don't mind if even the little kids want to play around with it and I let them take their own pictures.  Watching the film develop is part of the fun.
I bought this for a friend, its incredibly hard to find and was glad i could find it. She loved it a lot
I purchased this for my 85 year old grandfather. He was wanting something to put at his residence for some added notification of prowlers. The price was very reasonable and the construction seems solid. Installation went very smooth but know that you will need two people to make the installation process easier. According to my grandfather the item works great and he is very happy with it. He is already wanting to add another sensor to it. Great product..
Remote sensor is a bit tricky to setup and adjust. Reliability at detecting motion is very good, minimal false signals. (About three months of use). Adjustable indoor volume - and - tone is noteworthy (not abrasive nor harsh). The system certainly has capability for expansion and multiple uses. Moderately expensive, but quality seems justified. Claimed battery life "up to 2 years" (9V rectangular battery) remains untested; I can't imagine it surviving anywhere near that long in a cold climate (I'm in the south). Likewise, a unit exposed to full-weather elements (mine is sheltered). Certainly worth a try considering the limited other systems available. Price seems competitive if not slightly better.
WIRELESS1000, from Optex, is a wireless chime for indoor and outdoor applications. Its wireless PIR detector is made for indoor or outdoor use and has detection patterns for doorway and driveway coverage. Just insert a 9V battery and mount the detector wherever you want detection, then plug-in the chimebox receiver to complete the installation. Features include On-Off control, adjustable volume, individual enunciation of up to three zones, an optional alarm mode, and a 1 amp form C relay.Sensor mounts easily on walls, ceilings, fenceposts, and desktops. Weatherproof design of sensor allows outdoor use.Two detection patterns: 50ft Long Range and 17ft. Fan PatternDetection pattern adjusts easily for perfect aiming.
This is a cool ID badge. You can write several messages that can be stored and pulled up later. Lots of fun.But, very difficult to program. This is made in China and they need a new translator. Also, you program on the back and keep flipping it to see where you are.And the battery runs down very fast.But it is worth the price!
Its a little over the top but still cool.  These units will attract attention and probably have many other uses beside a name badge.  Muliple pages for different saved messages up to 512 characters.  This is much too long but allows for flexibility.  Because it's only 8 characters wide, messages must be kept simple and short.  It will scroll messages of almost any length.  Text entry is done via a 3 button system.  Time consuming but workable.  Also include scroll speed, and intensity of leds.  This last item is good as they are very bright in a darkend room.  Include upper and lower case (much more difficult to read) plus lots of special characters.
This is a good photo paper to use.  Everything prints good.  I have not had them long enough to talk about longevity, but I do recommend this.
I have a lot of X-10 modules and devices and had purchased this to replace some older units.This unit is a good unit, but the X-10 technology still falls somewhat short due to issues with line noise and phase issues.  I was hoping that the newer AGC (Auto Gain Control) would help with some of these issues, or at least help with the issue if it were related to line noise.  Overall the unit is a solid unit and works as described.
I just receive two PAM02 appliance modules.  One works just fine,  the other does not work at all.  I have used X10 devices quite a bit and know their inherent problems. But this unit is BAD!  It looked a little funny when It came out of the box because it was not set at address A1 like all others I have bought.  This was set to some strange address.  I suspect somebody found it was no good and put it back in the box  and then it was sent to me.  Well, I will have eat the cost because it is not worth my time to drive to the post office to hassle a mail-back.  But, I will never buy from "Home Control's' again.  Wasting my time costs me money.Update:  After complaining to the seller:'Home Controls', both 'Amazon' and 'Home Controls' sent me e-mail responses.  'Home Controls' immediately sent me a new unit which I received within a couple days.  So, I have a little better feeling about the order and will upgrade my comment to 4 stars.
Good product to protect your camera body from belt/jeans button while walking around, i got also OP/Tech USA sling camera strap the uniloop its so annoying  that blocking your eyepice when shooting at portrait orientation, so i hook up my strap at one side and the other at my battery grip. but the cover wont allow me to cover my camera body perfectly so then I put a small hole at the bottom to allow uniloop hook up at battery grip without worrying to loose the cover.
Fast delivery - Light weight -  low price  -  easy installation -  BIG sound - glad we ordered it
VELCRO - what else needs to be said. It holds cords in a nice way and its black... they go with everything.
Many people find themselves disappointed after acquiring this product.  Much of this comes from expecting more from the device than is even advertised.  If you want something that will allow you to make digital backups of your media for playback on your home theater system, this is not what you are looking for.What this device is great for is making a copy of something for portable use.  I use it to watch recorded TV shows on my Palm (similar to PocketPC).  For this purpose it works great.  I can use this to take TV episodes, or even Movies, and save them onto a Secure Digital card; then take the SD card and pop it into my Palm.  I do this to watch between classes at College, or while on the Plane when travelling.This is also great if you want to be able to view the pictures you took on your digital camera on your TV.  Rather than hunting around for that cord that came with the camera, just pop out the SD or CompactFlash card, and pop it into this, and your on your way.  You can also use it to play MP3s off of a SD or CF card.There were some problems with the original firmware that was shipped.  But to be fair, these were released as a "Gamma" product.  Neuros knew they weren't perfect yet, and wanted user input on what features they should focus on next.  The volume issue was corrected, and the new firmware can be obtained from the Neuros website.  The new firmware also supplies an upgraded user interface that is easier to navigate.  Their forums (located on the Neuros website) are also quite helpful in resolving any problems you may have.
Good quality product. Great customer service - quick response to every questions. Would recommend to a friend. Try this product youself.
I have always liked Maxell products, going back to magnetic (audio) tape. That quality has continued in the manufacture of DVDs and double layer DVDs.I made backup DVDs for some manuals for an electronic keyboard which were on DVD and am quite happy with the results. For quality, I would rate the disks at five stars; I was able to copy at 5.6x speed (The disks are rated at up to 8x), and have had no errors using the backup disks as you would the originals.The only reason I rate these at four stars is the price; at $5.00 each (with jewel case), they are a little pricy.
The case holds only the camera, but holds it well.  I am surprised at how long the rechargeable batteries last.  Held up over a week in Disney, Kennedy Space Center and Shuttle launch, and then some.
This plate works great with my Flip as well as my AVCHD camera. When I received the product, it looked like it was already opened, but this plate is so durable, it wasn't an issue with me. I would recommend this product!
Brand is FDK not Sanyo. We had a previous FDK, it lasted a little less than the original Snuza brand in the Snuza Halo baby monitor (original lasted about 2 months). I ordered this to see if a Sanyo battery lasted longer but the seller provided an FDK. The 2nd FDK only lasted between 2 and 3 weeks. The seller replaced free (FDK again). We had to order another battery in the interm and this time I ordered a Snuza brand battery. We will use this replacement FDK when the Snuza battery dies. Although frustrating that the battery is not a Sanyo as shown in the picture, I am happy with the seller since they replaced the battery free. If we get 6 weeks out of it in combination with the 2 to 3 out of the first one then I will have got my money's worth.
It does what batteries are supposed to do. You push it in with the positive side one way and the negative the other and see what happens.
Ok, here is my review:  For the money I paid for it this is an excellent product.Good:  I use this at my desk at work (can't program with wires in the way).  The range is good.  What you have to do for the sound quality to be good is _turn the volume on the headphones down all the way_.  This cuts out the static that you hear when you first plug them in.  Good battery life, four hours for sure (charge them during lunch).Bad:  One drawback is that the headphones are a little flimsy.  I would think twice before using these for exercise.  But unless I try to program and do jumping jacks at the same time, these will work great for me.  Also, the transmitter is huge, that prevents you from being able to work out with it as well.  Again, not a problem at work though.Hope this helpsAP
I've read the countless reviews for this product and for my use, it was fine.  I use the headset on the computer to listen to music and audiobooks.  The wireless functionality gives me the freedom to move around the desk.  30 ft, that's about it.  (The sound starts to break up after that.)  It's one of the smallest headsets I've seen in it's class and the fact that they fold up not only helps storing it, but the band won't break.  I leave the transmitter plugged into the usb port and headphone jack of my computer.  The headphones stay at my desk and I plug them in when not in use.  I usually listen to audio books so charging them during lunch and after hours gets me through the day.  The sound quality fine.  Yes there's white noise, but turning the volume down on the headsets and raising the volume on the computer (to max) cuts that down to hardly any white noise.  They are very light and considering I can wear them about 8 hours a day means they're comfortable.  The Jensen headsets was exactly what I was looking for.
I use this headset primarily at work so I can play music without being tethered to the mp3 player. Overall, I've been happy with the headset. The sound quality has been very good. The only problem I've had is that periodically some sound will drop out, especially if I'm more than 5-10 feet from the player in another room.
I bought these headphones to be used with the LG Chocolate which supposedly supports stereo bluetooth headsets.  They are incompatible.  I do not know if this is the fault of Jensen, LG, or Verizon, (a combination of all 3 is likely) but I'm kind of peeved that I paid all that money for something that won't work for my intended purpose.  I thought the whole point of Bluetooth is that it's supposed to be a "standard?"  My phone would recognize the bluetooth headset, but that's about all it would do.  Both LG and Verizon weren't helpful, and I couldn't even find Jensen to ask about it.Other than that, I tried using this at a local treadmill with a headphone plug, and they worked great; range of about 20 feet, decent sounding audio and good clarity.  I think these headphones are just a little too big for my head though, although my head isn't very big; I wish they adjustable.  The back of the headphones extends a good amount past the back of my head, but at least the headphones stayed on while jogging on the treadmill without any problems.
These headphones are pretty nice for listening to music.  The sound is pretty clear, and I'm pretty happy with them.One negative note: If the transmitter is connected to a power source while you're using the headphones, you'll hear an electronic buzz in the headphones.  The buzz isn't unbearable, but it is definitely audible.  Turning down the volume on the headphones diminishes the buzz, so you can minimize the buzz by turning up the volume on your sound source and turning down the headphone volume.
Picked up the headphones to be used on a motorcycle with a shorty helmet.  I have tried many other headsets and they either fall off or have the cord.So far I am liking the headset a LOT.  The volume of the input must be high, but I bought a boostaroo and it works fine.  Initially I was disappointed they had rechargable batteries instead of AAA batteries, but I can see that the size of the headphones would have to be much bigger then.  Battery life seems good and sound, too me, is just fine.  Not using them for a cell phone so don't know about those issues.  What I thought was nice though is the simple push of a button on the headphones will allow you to switch to your cell phone when it rings.
Great sound quality for listening to music, very good wireless range.  It is also very easy to use, just plug it in and turn it on.  It also comes with both a USB and an AC charger.  Howver, I can not get a consistent connection with my Blackberry.  So buy it only if you plan on using it for listening to music.
just wish the LED would work as well for the 9V batteries so you would not have to worry about them.
Good product & good value for money. The 9v battery however does not last very long.
This did just what I wanted.  It nicely holds a couple memory cards.  Mine are compact flash but it also holds others.  The latch is a self hinge and I suspect will not last forever but that's what they make rubber bands for.  It would be nice if they had included a snap on the key ring so that it can be snapped unto a ring of the camera bag.  I found a snap on something else that I could use.
GREAT FOR LARGER MEMORY CARD FOR MY OLDER CANON G4 DIGITAL CAMERA...HANDY TO HAVE AND USE WHEN OUT SHOOTING WITH IT....
I have to carry two xD cards with me for work so this little case is very convenient. It's a little bigger than what I wanted but it keeps the cards secure and fits nicely in my pocket.
From what I've experienced using Fuji Sensia, the best colors that seem to show up on this slide film are reds, skin tones, browns, and other warmer colours. This seems to go against what I've heard about this film, as I have heard blues and greens typically glow with this film-- personally, I find that the cooler colours, such as blues and greens tend to fall short of what I had expected. I will definitely keep this in mind for inside pictures and pictures of people, but I wouldn't recommend this for photos of landscapes. That being said, this is my first venture into slide film and is the best film I have ever used by far.
This remote is essencial for behind the camera triggering when stillness is required. I wish the cord was a little longer with some sort of a hook so you can adjust where the remote hangs, but that's not that big of a deal. The IR remote is more useful, but you have to be in front of the camera for that, so this is the best alternative.
It works!Pros: it takes US plugs with equal sized prongs, or those with one prong bigger than the other.Cons: manufacturing quality not that great. The US plug may not slide in and out easily. It gets easier to slide it in and out as you use it more. Clearly, a manufacturing quality issue.
Fits all of the outlets I encountered in the EU and Switzerland. Where you plug the US prongs in was a little tight but at least it wasn't loose.
Wow - this thing is great!  Yesterday I attached my Canon HG10 HD camcorder to my hockey stick and skated around the ice during warm-ups.  I've also set it up in the dash pocket of my truck as I drove home from work one day.Doing the things I have with it can result in some pretty shaky video, but it's still fun.  When on the ice it stayed attached to my hockey stick as I skated around quite fast; I did simulate a shot with the camera, but anything other than lightly pushing the puck would certainly result in the camera flying off of my stick (wrist shots are quite powerful considering lever action, and slap shots are well, you slap your stick on the ice as you're shooting so you can imagine).In the future I'm going to try some wedding videography and at least 2 gorilla pods will accompany me to the church.  I'm certain they'll sit great on a pew without being too disruptive.  Might be good for mounting up high somewhere for a really nice elevated shot.I'm only giving it 4 stars because I think the legs could have used another 2-4 pods each so you could ensure a tighter wrap around objects - especially larger poles (swing sets, parking meters, etc.)
Very simple part, made solid, works great.helps keep my shots squared up.less touch up to do later.Buy it.
My Gorillapod arrived in excellent condition, packaged well and it is one product that does work as advertised. My only complaint or question is just what does "Ethically made in China" means? Does it mean that it didn't put Americans out of work or take an American job to make it in a communist country with no human rights? If you want to sell it in American make in the USA so Americans can afford to feed their children
I bought this to hold my Philips Avent Video Baby Monitor--giving me the flexibility to position it exactly how I need it. It works great, I can get the legs in the right position and they seem to hold very well. No slipping so far. I look forward to using it with my Canon DSLR after we no longer need it for baby.
I like how flexible this thing is and it holds my camera, Canon G7, as it should. The only downside if any is that the legs could be a bit longer. They worked perfect it is just that around larger tree branches I would feel safer if they wrapped more. Probably a mute point though.
I got this as a gift for my brother and he loves it.  It's easily portable for him to take and set up in all the weird places he wants.  Just a bummer if you don't have something to set/wrap it on to if you are trying to take a head on shot.  It holds onto most things pretty well too, I worry some of the joints might get loose after a lot of use but that hasn't been the case so far.
I've used this tripod several times already and I always carry it everywhere with me. The only problem is that to pay $40 for a tripod and it to be so small seems to make it not quite as valuable, but it is a pretty cool tool to use, especially if you take a lot of roadside shots and you want to use you trunk to replace a 57" regular tripod.Happy trails!
The Joby GP2-D1EN Gorillapod is useful as a very portable tripod for getting steady shots when out and about.  It's sometimes difficult to get the thing level and pointing in the right direction, but is generally easy to use and does what it's supposed to.  This 'SLR' version is fine for most situations using my Cannon S5 superzoom. However, it's not ideal for timelapse photography as it isn't really stable enough.  When the sun goes in and out the tripod heats and cools, causing the frame to shift up and down, which is frustrating as this is the main reason I bought it.  A silver or white version could help reflect the sunlight to alleviate this problem, or perhaps a foil skirt of some kind.
My husband used it with his SLR on a recent trip to Paris and got some fabulous night shots.  He normally uses a tripod, but this was so much more convenient, because you just wrap it around a street pole.  No set up required, just leave the Gorillapod screw on portion on the bottom of your camera, and when you are ready to shoot, attach the main portion to the camera.  A bit bulky, but you can put it in your pocket or if you are not carrying a larger camera case.I have the smaller version for my point and shoot and love it.  Rarely are there flat surfaces right where you want to shoot the picture, but there are always street poles nearby in cities and towns.
I like this little guy--he's handy and easy to use.  the joints are a bit more stiff than I expected, but otherwise it's great!
This is a light weight, easy to carry and very versatile tripod for field photography with a few limitations.1. The action is rather stiff, so I added a ball head for smoother action and framing.2. I need to use a stiffer tripod in situations where I need to keep my hands on the camera. This has too much wobble.On the other hand, the wobble damps rapidly, so this tripod works well when the camera timer or a shutter release cable is used.
I bought this for an upcoming trip where I wanted the stability of a tripod but didn't want to travel with something full sized. Having taken this hiking a few times already I have to say this product is great. It's light weight and size make it extremely portable. It's easy to use, just bend it to whatever angle you need for the shot.The only negative thing I can say is that the locking ring used to keep the camera mount locked to the tripod is not very secure and seemed to slide back to the unlock position fairly easily. While that is not a good thing I will say that the mount fits so snugly into the tripod that I can't foresee it coming out unless you were really shaking it.
This is a really handy tripod.  Holds my camera in many positions and hangs on to all kinds of things.
I'm not a power user by any means, but I thought this little invention was kind of cool, so eventually I bought one to use with my "point and shoot style"Canon PowerShot Pro Series S3 IS 6MP with 12x Image Stabilized ZoomI can't say I have really given it a thorough testing of all sorts of things to cling to, but in the instances I have used it, it worked great, the part that attaches to the camera snaps securely into place on top of the tripod, and fits the camera just fine.
Good portable tripod, does the job when not using too much zoom and not perfect light conditions.  When using it with our 42x Zoom pictures come out blurry.  And yet, it is always with us on trips and vacations, we use it all the time.
I purchased two big ones and a little one, one for myself and two as gifts for my sons. I can wad it up enough to leave it attached most of the time. You can quickly level your camera on uneven surfaces and simply hold on to it instead of the camera body while shooting stills or movies. I'm ordering a compact digital camera to compliment my SLR, so I'll probably order a small gorillapod for that.
I ordered this item because it was used and looked in the photo like the one I wanted. It works fine but in the photo it was shown as the one with the bubble leveler but when it arrived it did not have one. I contacted the seller and he said he had described it as last generation model that did not have it. He offered to take it back if I paid the postage to send it to him. I decided to keep it and have used it a few times with no problems. Perhaps it was my fault for not knowing what the difference in the last model was. But I still think the picture should be exact,too.
The product was received on time, and has performed well.  Although named "tripod for digital slr cameras", I do use it with my Canon G10, and works well.
Perfect and useful product adding a fast shipment! I used a lot for shooting nice pictures with my camera from impossible places.
I was very happy to get my gorillapod.  I was able to wrap it around a tree to take a group picture of everyone.
The tripod is good, we use it sometimes to take our pics instead of trying to find a spot to keep the camera for timer mode. Even though its still easier to take pics if we can find a spot to just keep the camera (as attaching camera to it and adjusting, etc is extra work) but if we cant then this comes in handy.
This is worth the price. Great value and very,very easy to use. I would recommend this highly.
Very versatile tripod for smaller cameras. You can obviously not expect this to hold up a large professional camera with a huge lens and extended battery pack, but it does the job for the average Joe SLR. If you do a lot of nature shots, then I can imagine this would be useful for you.
Easy to carry around a sturdy enough for a real camera.  Won't hold a candle to a real tripod but it is so small and light you have no reason not to carry it in your camera bag.
I bought the Gorillapod SLR for use with myCanon ZR80 MiniDV Camcorder w/18x Optical Zoom, and eventually theFlip Ultra Series Camcorder, 60-Minutes  (White)I got later. The tripod holds on magnificently well to larger objects, where it can wrap as many knuckles around an item as possible (like, for example, something the thickness of a human arm), but on small things it starts to fall short (like some lamps). The legs don't give in, or bend, they just can't get a grip. It seems to have some trouble gripping a human head, but that might be because I have so much hair. I suspect if I was bald it would work better.I was impressed with how well the legs kept their shape. It really is very sturdy and reliable, but it's not easy to fine tune, and it'll be an afternoon long project to straighten out the legs perfectly. Precision shooting is not the easiest thing ever.Another problem is balancing the camera. On a typical tripod, the legs are spaced equidistant from each other, on the Gorillapod, it's up to you to make sure that the legs are spread out properly, or else your camera might be tempted to fall over very easily. I also have the feeling that the legs will eventually wear out and become totally useless.On the upside, on the first day I had the tripod, I somehow managed to pop one of the legs off, but it popped right back in without any problems, hasn't given me any problems since, and hasn't come out again. The tripod is mindblowingly light. It's hard to think that something this light can hold a camera so well, but it does.At $40, it's well worth the purchase. I just sometimes wish Joby sold additional leg segments so I could make the tripod bigger/able to grab larger items (could you imagine wrapping one of these things around a medium-sized tree trunk?)
I bought this Gorillapod for a recent trip to NY. It worked just fine. It is light enough to fit in my back pocket, and it worked well in very different situations (parks, museums and so on). One thing I didn't know is that some pieces may separate from the tripod if too much force is applied, but they can be easily reattached. By the way, my camera is a Panasonic FZ28.
I love the product, I've used them before. But this one may be a bit misleading. I recently bought this to use with my D80 but my camera seems to be too heavy for it. I'm unsure if it's just a bad batch of this model or what, but you may want to go for the next model up, that is supposed to hold up to DSLR's with zoom lenses.
As a gift for my wife, this turned out to be a real winner. She is a better than average photographer and has found many ways to use this device beyond what had been advertised. However, the idea that it will cling to any polesurface is a little over rated, especially if the pole is more than 6 inches in diameter. It's a great idea with alot of possibilities which is perfect for those of the creative mindset.
I haven't used this much, but it does its job well. It hasn't broken yet but it's just a little flimsy and seems like it might in the future. One use of this was to mount a video camera on the handlebars of my kid's bike so she could record her ride around the block.
This tripod is one of the best tripods I have ever worked with. I love how I can use it on just about any surface knowing my camera isn't gong to slide. I really like the flexibility of the legs and love how they wrap around many things. Minor problem I have with it is that I would have liked for the tripod to hold on a little tighter. It still holds great and has yet to give me a reason to doubt it. I'm just paranoid with my camera. Great tripod though highly recommended.
It's fun. It's really easy to use, and its well designed and looks very alive and modern.However, as might be imagined, it is not the stablest of all contraptions, and with a device that is supposed to supply more steadiness than your hands, this is a crucial setback.Its fine for grabbing things and little tasks; don't expect any masterpieces to come out of it.
My husband was thrilled when he opened his Valentine gifts: a Joby Gorillapod, a traditional tripod and a remote release for his new digital SLR. The only reason I didn't give the Gorillapod 5 stars is we haven't yet gone into the field to use it. The point of my selection of gifts was to give him the versatility to shoot anywhere, from any surface, any angle he needs.
I bought this because I'd heard good things about these tripods and it was listed as an accessory for my Digital Rebel XTi. Either I got sent the wrong version or Amazon screwed up because this version is designed for point and shoots, not SLRs. It isn't strong enough to hold up the D400 with a kit lens let alone a zoom.I haven't decided if I'll send it back or keep it for my smaller camera.
I ordered this product and true to Amazon tradition delivery was prompt and the packaging was good. The tripod is a dream for anyone who cannot carry a leviathan  tripod. It is also a must have for family outings and impromptu shots. The build is solid and my camera (Canon Powershot A 630) hold pretty well. I also tried to latch it on to my car dashboard and take a video of a trip down a winding lane and it worked. The build is sturdy and the tip of the legs are surprisingly strong. The only complaint i have is that the tripod should come with a carry case or a bag to carry it around. Would recommend it to anyone having a digital camera!
I have had my Gorillapod SLR for only a couple of days and have used it just once.  I bought it for use with a Canon 300D with my 17-40mm lens.  (Total weight on this setup is unofficially 2.6 lbs.--unfortunately appearing to be .1 lbs. over the maximum weight specified by Joby.  But, for my purposes, I'm considering that close enough.)  Given this weight, my heavier telephoto lens is out of the question.  Of course, I knew that prior to my purchase.Here are my initial thoughts/tips:- Make sure you do not associate any of the regular Gorillapod's "demo" photos on Joby's website with the SLR version's--or at least pay close attention to the SLR "demo" photos.  Specifically, around poles and trees, you will want the legs to wrap fully around the object.  Anything less will lack the necessary strength/grip.  This point is self-explanatory in the photos but I personally didn't examine them close enough and I did sort of mix "demo" photos in my mind when building my expectations.  (Call me an idiot but I was slightly curious if the "Gorillapod-helmet" would work.  It--perhaps obviously--will not.  I don't think I'd even trust it with my Canon A610 digicam.  :)  But, I broke out a ski pole and the Gorillapod will definitely be secure on the thin pole.  An aspen trunk?  Maybe if it's a young tree.  A swing set pole?  Again, a thin one is likely to work.)- The Gorillapod seems to have a "sweet spot"--in a traditional tripod stance--where it is just fine and seems perfect.  Yet, a slight movement lower causes gravity to win the battle and pull the whole thing down in the middle.  A movement in the opposite direction seems to make the Gorillapod unstable--too upright perhaps and ready to topple.  If, in the future, Joby could implement some form of "parital leg lock," this issue could be solved.- My next use of the Gorillapod will be for mountain summit photos and an accompanying hike this weekend.  The Gorillapod's "feet" are pretty "sticky"--that is, they're basically like a no-slip Vibram sole.  So, I think the Gorillapod will do just fine on 14ers/13ers and on lake rocks, boulder fields, etc.--especially in the traditional 3-leg tripod setup.  Gorillapod competitors seem likely to struggle on uneven rocks so I'm feeling good about the Gorillapod in this use.- I bought the Gorillapod because I thought it was the best option I have seen on the market for throwing in a Camelbak--be it for skiing, hiking, or biking.  (My other tripod is a 7.2 lb. Gitzo.  I've lugged it around on a hut trip and backpacking trip--sans a few leg sections to shave weight.  The Gorillapod will suffice from now on, I believe.)  When I took the Gorillapod out today for some shooting, I just put it on the camera and carried the camera with it on--the camera being on my shoulder.  I walked to a park and didn't really even notice it.  The Gorillapod really does weigh almost nothing.- The Gorillapod makes a nice "monopod" when used with three legs straight down.- My 22 month old son loves it.  So, at worse, it's a great infant toy for improving motor skills.- Don't worry about the Gorillapod's camera attachment.  It's solid.- I have a buddy with an Ultrapod.  I bought the Gorillapod thinking I had way superior technology despite an over doubling of price.  Turns out I probably have merely equivalent but cuter functionality.  Also, that buddy has a Canon 10D.  The Gorillapod only makes sense for Rebel users in Canon's digital SLR lineup--preferably users with the 18-55 kit lens.In summary, I would call myself satisfied but not overjoyed.  I think it is at least equivalent to the alternatives if not slightly better.  But, it is not quite revolutionary.  And, keep in mind, these are my first impressions following a single use of it.  It didn't knock my socks off but I think I can make it work.I give it a 4-star rating because I will also use it with my A610 digicam.  It should be excellent with that camera when compared to the digicam Gorillapod.  3-stars is likely fitting for use with my SLR (given the sweet spot issue, 2.5 lb. limitation, and slightly elevated cost).  But, 3-stars seems low.  So, consider my rating a 3.5 and I'm rounding up.
I recommend this product.  Does what is says on the box.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Set up you camera quickly and easily wherever you are.  Great product.
I have used this little tripod for many family portraits on our fun days! I've wrapped it around our baby stroller, a guardrail, a bike, and more to get a picture of all of us together (using the self timer). It's functional and easy to use!The only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is because the tripod does "slip" a little. I've tried to get the legs to wrap in to each other to make them more lockable so to speak, but sometimes the legs just give way a little which makes me double (sometimes triple) check the cameras stability on the tripod.Still, I would highly recommend getting one!
Product is great, only thing is, that bubble level is not correct for me, but I can get used to it. Good product
This is a great tripod.  It's versatile and easy to carry around.  I have a Canon Rebel XT that fits perfectly on this.  A definite buy if you are looking for a tripod with flexibility.
I am using my Gorillapod on a Nikon D80 with a zoom lens which is a moderatly heavy combination. While it is sometimes a bit difficult to get the Gorillpod to grasp as I want it to, once the pod is in place, it does not slip out of place and works quite well. It is certainly somthing others look at and wonder what it is. It is a lot easier to transport and set up than a traditional tripod. I have used it in conjunction with a wireless remote control unit for the D80 and find this an excellent combination.
I think this might be hard to use with a big SLR camera but it is perfect for my smaller cameras, and the balance bubble is just perfect!  I am going to a place where a small tripod will be key and is on completely unlevel ground so this is the perfect gift!!
I got me a couple of these Joby GP2-41EN Extra Gorillapod SLR Clip with Bubble Level. I find them handy to have around. This is not a heavy-duty "pro" item but then I wasn't paying pro prices. I use them mostly for shooting video so I have one for the vertical and one for the horizontal attached to my DSLR rig. I could have gotten a level that handle 2 or more dimensions but folks seemed to have a lot of problems with them so I stuck to this one.
Joby does a great job with this portable tripod for DSLR's. I have a CaseLogic sling bag and it fits nicely in the exterior velcro straps.  While it supports my 18 - 55 kit lens, it is a bit 'lens heavy' and not quite as stable with my 55-300 zoom.  Joby does make a model specific for the longer lenses, however, I wanted one that would do both.  When using the longer lens I just make sure one of the legs extends out to the front to support the extra weight.  Great product, received when promised.
