Tablets are weird at first. This will help you get used to using it and help you learn what it can do. I wish I had bought this sooner.
I am really loving my camera. Although the film is kinda on the expensive side. I recommend the fortune film. ;) I took pictures of all my family and friends and surrounded my computer monitor with them. Here are some tips: Get really close to the person you are going to take a picture of. If you don't they'll look really tiny. Try to purchase the 3 pack film. You'll save some $$$$.
Polaroid's i-zone site tells me that this camera is aimed at people at least fifteen years younger than me. Okay. Whatever.I've been a fan of it since it was invented, and I still am, even though I own digital cameras five hundred times more expensive. Casual photos are all about what you can do with them. The i-zone doesn't just produce pictures, it produces toys. Give them to people. Stick them on things. Take one of these to the pub and you'll get people queuing up to have their picture taken. Send them on postcards - many times cheaper and more convenient than a pocket-sized printer and glue.Basically this camera is perfect for grown-ups with lives, as well as teenagers. And it's not exactly expensive either. If you like taking spontaneous photos, this is the device for you. No other camera has brought me as much enjoyment.
Oh, man this camera is fun! Its great to buy loads of film (yes I know, 'tis very expensive) but you get tons of cool pictures to stick wherever, and just take the camera 2 school and snap pictures, its really fun. A couple very important things to know before ya use it: Its not a pocket camera, dont try to fit it in there- it wont work! Be careful what you haul it around in, the button could go off if ya bang it around. Always follow the instructions of the button where you flip the turny thing a ma jig to the atmosphere your taking the picture in example:(if your taking a pic indoors flip it to the indoors symbol, ect) always flip the thing to OFF when your done or it wastes a lotta batteries, believe me, I know! Dont take a picture from 10 feet away and expect it to turn out b cuz all youll get is a picture of a dark dark room... and never open up the bottom where you insert film if there is already film inside because that accidentally happened and it wasted quite a lotta pics cuz it wasnt shut securely. If ya pay attention to all that the youll be in the zone in no time!Oh---One more thing! This is sooooooo cool! take a picture of ur friend leaning one way, keep the camera still and dont move it after u have taken the pic, leave the picture in the camera then have ur friend lean the other way and take a picture on the same photo...do this quickly..then you can pull it on out and see your twin or your ghost, whichever u prefer, It took me a while to get it right, but Ive got a picture where it looks so real! Its really cool! Now what other camera can do that??!
My friend at camp had an iZone and I was so jealous!  I want one!  I'll  probably go out tomorrow and buy one in phat blue because they are so cool!  I luv it!
I love this camera. I own a small handful of different types of cameras but out of all the cameras that I own, the i-zone gets the most mileage. I work at a restaurant and everyone is so intrigued by the camera that they  can't help but want to be in a picture. Most of the pictures that we take  involve me pointing the camera back at my friend(s) and/or myself.  (pseudo-self-portrait) Then, with the sticky-film we stick all the pics on  one of the POS printers and we have a little scrapbook that we can look at  whenever we want. All in all, this camera rocks!  I thorougly recommend  it!  (Cameras I own: Polaroid SLR 680, ProCam, i-zone, Canon Elph Jr.,  Olympus Digital D-400z, Olympus Stylus and Stylus Zoom)
Bored with plain old cameras, I wanted something new and interesting. The Polaroid I-Zone was the answer to my prayers! This adorable silver camera is very attractive, and it easily slips into a purse, pocket, or backpack  (convenient for school or a day at the beach)! I like the colorful borders  on the sticky film, and you can stick these tiny snapshots anywhere. I've  seen them on computers, bedroom walls, notebooks, textbooks, CD players,  yearbooks, you name it. Be creative! I highly recommend the I-Zone camera  to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary. I love this camera,  and so will you!
This camera is so perfect because it can fit into smaller bags and takes great pictures! They come out so cute and they're perfect for my notebooks and I stick them all over my room! I can take pictures anywhere with this  camera and it's priced really well too! I have it in silver and it's  sophisticated and sleek looking.
I've had an I-Zone camera since September, and I've had way toomuch fun playing with it.  The I-Zone is great because it's easy totransport and fairly rugged.  The only thing you have to watch out for is the flash setting on top - if you leave the camera in your bag or purse, something could flip the switch on and (potentially) drain your batteries.  This has happened to me two or three times, but I still like to throw everything in my backpack.  The I-Zone is also great because the film costs 50% less than normal Polaroids and is easy to store.  I've found the camera to be more popular than me at parties, too...
I got this camera as a birthday gift, and at that time I had no clue how cool it was.  I took a couple of snap shots, and then stopped using it for a bit.  But, now whenever my friends see it, they all think it's the  coolest camera ever.  Also, I have started using it for its true purpose:  as a fun, creative camera.  I take snapshots of all my friends, create cool  accesseries and decorate my rooom with them.  It takes great pictures for  the size of the film, and also it's quick and easy to use.  One of the few  cameras where your own snapshots of yourself turn out to be good pictures.  It's great if you can be creative and want to have some fun.
The first picture I took with my I-zone (which is beautiful in silver) was of course, a picture of myself. I lifted the camera above me and snapped a shot. Now, I'm definately NOT photogenic - but this picture was amazing! I  feel beautiful!This camera is easy to use, fun, and light enough to  carry around anywhere. I definately recommend it! It's my new best buddy.
I have an I zone camera at home and I love it!  you dont have to pick from 100's of film types you just look for the IZONE on the package and your ready to go!  I like it because you can change the features from inside to outside, and shade to sunshine.  My niese has one too.  This proves that ANYONE can use this awesome camera and it is a great gift idea for teens.
WOW.  Forget those chunky 3 x 3 instant Polaroids - this one beats them all by a mile: hands down.  Curvacious, sleek, yet durable, it has all the looks a person can want.  Visually, the I-Zone's top portion (looking at it from top down) leaves a bit to be desired because it looks a bit  &quot;cheap&quot; but heck, for [the price] who has the right to complain?  Personally, I think the chrome silver finish looks great.  Much better than  the kiddy red, lime green, and what not that's available in other stores.As for the quality, it can go both ways here but for the most part, its  pretty nice.  The stickers that are produced are a bit on the small size  and can be placed just about anywhere... the film isn't too sticky so you  can just tear it off without the risk of any of that sticky gunk being  leftover on the surface of whatever you pasted it onto.  Sticks great to  notebook paper and envelopes.The only REAL nagging problem that I could  unearth is the fact that, like others have said, the FLASH button is a bit  on the loose side and turns out draining all your battery.  There's a  simple workaround which is to remove the battery and keep it in your  pocket.  When you want to use the flash again, just pop the battery back  in.  This reduces the risk of unnecessary battery drainage.What can I  say?  This camera has the quality, the looks, and quite bluntly - the  I-zone delivers.  Highly recommended.
I have wanted this before it was even invented. I just didn't know what it was.  The iZone offers the same superb picture quality as its bigger sisters and more portability than ever! I had two worries before I used it:  Would the big button on the top of the camera accidentally get mashed when  I put the cam in my backpack? And, would the pictures come out as close  ups, looking cropped, or would they be in proportion, as larger photos  are?As soon as I took my first picture, these fears were put aside! The  button locks back into &quot;off&quot; mode right after you take a picture.  Yay efficiency! You just yank out the picture when you're done. The  pictures are the same as their larger counterparts, just miniaturized. I  have found infinite possibilities with my lil cam, and I have seen the  pictures stuck all around town! It's a miniature photo revolution!
I got this camera to make picture flash-cards for my autistic spectrum daughter.  The pictures are small enough to easily fit a number on each page of her card book but clear enough that she has no problem identifying them.  I highly recommend the i-zone, and the sticky back pictures are very convenient.
I have the silver adition of the i zone camera and its neat.I waisted about 3 out of 17 pictures but now i am pretty good.It takes a little getting used to, but i think its a great camera.It is actually the first  camera i ever had of my own besides a disposable camera! I love it and the  pics are sticky.Yeah!
Okay I got this for free by winning a contest but hey who cares, right?It is very easy to use. Not too bulky. The film develops quickly. The batteries don't drain to fast and... well playing with the sticker pictures  is just to much fun.What does this all boil down to? I LOVE IT!  I  might even get one for some of my friends... It's a great gift for college  students and high school students.
this camera is very good to just have fun with. it took me a while to get used to but it is very cool modern camera for younger people i hope you have fun with this camera.
I love I-zone caramras.  These camaras are so easy to use and there is so much you can do with them.  True the pictures are small, but that allows you to do more with them (I've started a collage on by bedroom door).  These camaras are also easy to carry (on your rist, in a purse, etc.), they are simple to use (turn on the flash [or not], push a button, and pull out your picture a split second later). And best of all, you can stick them anywhere w/o glue or tape. If you don't have one of these camaras you need to get one.
This is one of my cameras that I have that I love. It's cute and easy to use and it fits in your bag come on you know you love it I know I do.  It's good for parties or to go to the park for the day.
This camera can be a wonderful tool when capturing all kinds of up close photos.  The pictures can make outrageous statements than better said in a normal snap shot.  Additionally this camera produces instant gratification - and you can give them away as quick as you take them.  The sticky feature is nice, although I prefer the non-stick.  These make great additives to notes, wallets, computers, anywhere really - my fridge is loaded with them.  If you shop around for the film it ends up being about 50 cents a picture.  Basically if you're looking for non-traditional pics to spice up your life, this would be the way to go!And as others have noted, the flash button is a little loose, so act responsibly and you obviously need to get up close to the person you are photographing (or thing) because they are small images.  If you want big images or negatives don't buy this product.
I bought this camera for my neice who is a teenager.  She couldnt thank me enough for it.  She loved the color of the camera as well. You can also use Polaroid Sticky Film, that you can use to decorate just about anything  with. It makes this product even more enjoyable. She has gotten alot of use  out of this camera.  This is a camera for all ages. I highly recommend it.
I can even feel the difference between this lens and my kit lens. It's much heavier and sturdier. Takes crystal clear shots.
Super quiet focus motor, great pictures taken with it and when you attach a wide angle lens attachment to it you have a great walk around lens for everyday use.
this is a good lens nice and fast for a older model price is good a nice by if you by it you will like it
I just received this awsome lense to use with my Canon 10D and my T3, I installed it on the 10D and the camera performed flawlessI was having alot of (error99) with a 75-300mm from Tamron and I thought it was the Camera, but when I put this baby on, the camera just came alive and took some beautiful pictures, the best I've shot since I bought this camera, subjects are sharp and the auto focus is fast and accurate, I can't say enough about this lense,Thank you  Premier Pawn for this great lense  5 stars to both lense and Seller...
I love this lense... Not a 24-70 2.8L, But a nice alt. to it. For the price it was a steal...
haha, this is so easy to use, and cheap, worth it, quality pictures, and sticky so you can do so many stupid things. my girlfriend bought me a stuffed animal for our anniversary, so i took a sticker picture of it and put it in my wallet. i let my friend take a picture of his face, and then the back of his head, and stuck them both together onto a stick. soo much fun, soo easy, easy to use, and stylin
I've had my i-zone camera since they first came out, and I constantly use it (when I can afford the film, that is!). I've bought a few more for friends as gifts, and everyone seems to enjoy them. The i-zone camera is a fun thing to take small pictures with, and the sticky film is awesome!
This product is very cool. I personally don't own it, but i know someone who has actually shown how it works to me and, i must say, it is a really useful, trendy camera. The film may cost a little (well, alot) more than normal film, but for the handiness of this product, I would suggest buying the 8-12 dollar film. This little Camera can be used for many other things and i would rather use this than normal film. I think that this is also alot more fun than normal film, and the Camera is alot more inexpensive than others. So, I would suggest using this over your dad's Bulky Camera with the screwed-up flash.
The I-zone camera is GREAT!  I got one for my Bar-Mitzvah last month, and I have not stopped to look back.  Take a picture, pull  it apart, and stick.  That is all there is to it.  At school, I pull it out at lunch, and now I find myself at the popular table.  Thanks Polaroid, this is definately not my father's Land Camera.
I love my I Zone camera, but what I don't like about it is that the film isn't very good. What I mean is, it's sharp and everything, but the sticky stuff on the back isn't very durable. Also, it's about 50 cents a shot. I'm 12 years old, so that's a bit expensive for me. Another thing is, I can only find sticky film. The closest place to my house I could find non sticky film was 5 miles away (and I can't even drive yet) But that's not something to judge the camera by.) I would recomend the camera to anyone who's under 15.
I bought this Camera and it is the coolest thing for kids and teens. Its  also v. cool cuz Its the Official Camera of Britney Spears. The coolest  artist around. Take pictures, stick them anywhere you want, old people get  totally confused when you pull the picture out (which is one of the most  fun things about it) and u can give em to your friends or whoever you want.  It rocks. 10/10
This is a great fun item. Given the very small picture size several people have suggested taking photos close-up. I have to say that I find the flash extremely bright when you do this which is about the only problem I can think of about a great product.
I love this camera but I bought it and also could not figure out how to get photos to stick. I called toll free polaroid number and they explained there are 2 types of film. Plain and one that says sticky..but this camera is a blast! Very fun! Just need to know if you want photo STICKERS..BUY STICKY FILM!
I used to really want one of these, so I asked my mom. (yeah, I'm an 11 year old reviewer but at least I give you the info)My mom stopped off at the store the next day. When I got home from school, she gave me the camera, and I couldn't have been happier than I was at that moment. As you read a few sentences ago, My mom picked it up at a store, not any camera shop, or a big  electronics store, just a regular store. And it's great because parents can depend on kids like me to take care of it, and if for some reason it breaks, it's only 20 bucks a piece. The film is a bit of a hassel, but the overall product is terrific. Perfect for kids.
This simple little camera will be a huge hit at weddings, parties, goofy weekends hanging out with friends and family, and everything in between.  I have a silver izone myself but gave 2 of these clear red ones for Christmas: fun and festive presents that I know will get lots of use.  It would also be a wonderful gift for Valentine's Day, not only because of it's hot fireball colour, but because you and your honey can use it to record all kinds of happy moments together all year 'round.
The camera is one among the few sleek one i have ever seen. I have used it  and the picture quality i get is fabulous and the best part is even my  younger brother can use it.
When I got this camera I went picture crazy!  It's like being a little kid!  I took pictures of everyone and everything and stuck them everywhere!  Which is probably not the best thing to do at first.  You have to realize that the film is almost as much as the camera.  With 12 pictures on each role, they go fast!  But I wouldn't trade it for the world and I'll keep buying the film and keep taking cute little pictures of everyone.  The camera is small enough that you can take it in your purse and use out at nightclubs.  I have the start of a wonderful murial in my office.  All the faces of my family and friends are stuck right next to me on my wall in a colorful pattern.  Don't sweat the film price, it's just too much fun!
I absolutely love my i-zone camera!!... I guess the ONLY bad thing is that i cannot get enuf accessories in Oz.  They simply dont stock all the mad frames and stuff.  I also LOVE the guy who gave it to me!! He couldn't have picked a better present!!!
This camera is just fun!!!  The camera comes with 2 blue plates and 2 purple plates that can be snapped on the camera to change its color.  It is easy to load and easy to set.  The camera has built in flash and 3 flash options.  You slide a bar on top by a picture of a house, sun, or cloud depending on where the picture will be taken.  After you snap the picture, the camera automatically cuts off.  The bottom of the camera opens up which is where you put the small box of film.  The pictures then pull out to the side.Ok now for the fun part.  The pictures are small but they turn out very clear.  When you pull the picture out it looks like an armband.  You cut the ends off and peel the back off and your sticker(or picture) is ready. We have taken the camera to school parties, taken pictures of the kids and then given them to them.  It's a big hit and everybody wants one.  You can also match up the two ends, tape or staple them together and you have a very cute bracelet.  This camera is perfect when you need a quick picture for your scrapbook or a card.  One of our local doctors even takes pictures of his patients with it for their file.
I've used both i-Zone designs, and this new camera is far superior to the original.  The camera's controls are easier to use, can't be turned on accidentally in a pocket or purse, and the pictures are more often &quot;keepers.&quot;  All in all, I am very pleased with the tiny pictures that have become a regular part of my journals and letters.
I bought this camera to take pics of my wedding guests for my guest book....I love it!  The film is a little pricey, but that's the cost on instant gratification I suppose.  The sticky stuff is nice, not sticky enough to ruin anything, but will stay on a computer monitor, magnet, or in a book.
This camera is great!  Not only is it extremely affordable but it takes instant pictures.  It's small enough to fit in your pocket and the smaller sized pictures are great for small picture frames.  Also you have the option of buying regular i-zone film or sticky i-zone film which the kids just love!  The film is also cheaper priced than other polaroid type cameras, and when you consider the cost of developing film its even more reasonibly priced than regular film.  I definately recommend it for children, teenagers, or someone looking for an extra, more playful, camera
I just received my camera today, and I already love it.  I have taken four pictures, and have tried not to take anymore, because I want my film to last.  The pictures turned out remarkably good for such a small camera.  Pretty much, this camera is all around adequate, except for a few flaws.  The first flaw is that the instruction booklet is very confusing, because it only uses pictures, and there is a release button on the side of the camera, and if anything hits it, it will open up exposing the film.  This is hardly a problem; you just have to be careful with it.  I recommend this camera to anyone, including people who aren't even interested in photography.
This is a really cool camera! I had never even heard of i-zone, until the BSB promotion came out.Since I'm such a huge fan, I HAD to buy one! I was pleasantly surprised!  Not only was it COOL (neat little Backstreet Boys/Black &amp; Blue camera strap, stickers - of the guys {individual and a group}, their names, an &quot;i &lt;3&quot;, an &quot;is hot&quot;, the B&amp;B World Tour logo, &quot;The Backstreet Boys&quot; and &quot;The Official Camera of the Black &amp; Blue Tour&quot; - and a game piece to win tickets to their concert {didn't win}), but surprisingly, it was easy to use.  I thought, with the instructions consisting mainly of pictures, that I would have difficulty using it, but it's really simple.  I'm sure an adult could load the camera for a child, and the child could go from there.I would suggest taking a test picture first, before you go out into the real world.  Once I did that, I understood how to load the film, take the pic out, etc.  I don't recommend taking it to a concert, though, unless you have front row seats (don't we all wish that!), backstage passes, or are just going to take pics of your friends there.Other than that, I would TOTALLY recommend this camera for any BSB fan.  It's a great collector's piece, not to mention functional!
Get this cute collectors item while you can, the camera has a cute strap that reads Backstreet Boys Black and Blue.  Take pictures of friends, or pictures of pictures, the sticky film works great for a decoration in a scrapebook dedicated to the number one boy band.
Since it is a very precious camera, I want to value in Japan. Moreover, it can boast in a visit-to-Japan public performance of Backstreet Boys.
The battery is great, but Amazon offers the accessory kit with the same battery, plus a mini-dv tape and a carrying case for the same price.  The case is useless for the ZR series, but might come in handy for some other purpose.
The life on this battery is so much longer than my stock battery for my camcorder (Canon ZR70), I no longer have to worry about keeping it charged. I can also use my viewscreen more often instead of doing everything through the eyepiece. My camcorder experience is improved because of it and I can focus on the video and not worry if my battery starts to run out.
Getting an extra, larger-sized capacity battery for your camcorder is a must considering a lot of batteries bundled with the packages right now are the smallest-capacity ones. This is true for the Canon ZR70 MC camcorder. This battery offers extra juice without the hassle or fear of constant battery drainage compared to using the one that came with the camcorder. I now use the smaller capacity as a back-up and the larger one as the main battery. From what I understand, this battery also works with different Canon camcorder models. Very happy with this purchase!
I wasn't pleasantly surprised with this camera,despite the awful reviews.  I didn't buy it on Amazon, but was able to obtain this little wonder machine second hand.  It takes great panoramic photos and sharp snapshots like a rangefinder. It is a great backup to digital.
This is really cool camera I had never used before. I used 400 Kodac film to develop and I had took many places and many weather conditions. Every shot was fine and great. It's terrafic state of art creature of Nikon. If you would like to take a photos of your children with Nikon-quality, this is most nice choice, I think. P. S. Use 400 film.. It's important..... from the professional
This camera was recommended to me by my brother, who is a hobby photographer.  He knew I didn't want to spend lots of money on an SLR camera and a bunch of lenses and accessories.  It has turned out to be a great buy!The pictures turn out great!  You can really tell the difference that the ED glass makes.  This camera has a shutter speed down to 2 seconds... nice for shooting night scenes on a tripod.  The viewfinder is very clear and accurate.  Battery life is great, even if you play with the zoom a lot.  I get about 12 rolls of 24 exposures on each lithium CR123.  There are a few features I don't use, such as panorama mode and time/date stamp.  Also, there is an infrared remote available for about (dollar amount).My last camera was an Olympus Stylus.  This one edges it out slightly on image quality.  I highly recommend this camera.
I haven't tried the camera yet myself, but I did some research on it and wanted to make a comment on the lens.Normally, I prefer point and shoots with lenses that don't exceed 3x, and preferably more like 2x, because with long telephoto range lenses there are just too many optical compromises that must be made, and that affects the sharpness of the lens.However, this lens contains 6 elements in 6 groups, and most importantly, uses plastic aspherical components, a recent innovation in these cameras that is sure to make a difference. The new Minolta Freedom Zoom 125 also has this.I am probably going to buy one of these little gems myself. For now I'm continuing to research the different compact point-and- shoot models out there, but if I had to make a decision right now, I'd go with this one, and I've probably looked at at least three dozen different cameras at this point.
previously owned this model camera (discarded in error). great to have the camera back---much preferred to the digital purchased!
Just what the Nikon Gods decreed!  It fit the F100 in my collection just perfectly (or was it the F4?)  I am a serious NikonLeicaCanonHasselbladSinarRollie Addict.  My cats are even named Leica and Nikon.  Thanks for helping me find this part!
I have been using this batteries with the ultra -high capacity digital camera power pack for more than 5 years and they are the best.Now I just want to buy the batteries alone, were can I find them???
I bought this same charger like 10 years ago and still use it to this day. But i didnt pay $50 for it, i only paid $10... not sure i have the same exact charger but according to the picture its the same one.
2 years of HEAVY use - not even one little bitty problem.  They've traveled well under harsh conditions, and they still function wonderfully.  There you go.
Compact Design....bought it since 2002.....still going strong...went to soo many trips wit me...and easily fit in ur luggage....now i use that for my Travel only and use Powerex MH-C204 F for my daily use...can take at least 2 hours of pics wit my Minolta Z2
I have been using a Monster Battery Charger for the past 10 years, and have found it very reliable.  Recently it started to mal-function, and not charge the batterys properly.  If this new charger performs as well, and lasts as long, I will be a happy customer.
Monster is a little pricey, as everyone knows, but it's good stuff.  This unit is attractive, works well and is nicely designed.  Only one very small drawback: unless you have small pointy fingers, the first battery is a little hard to remove.  I use a little plastic relay tool to lever it out, which I store right in the charger.  But I stayed with 5 stars for this one.
My regular alkalines lasted literally hours.These lasted WEEKS!  I swear - I couldn't believe it.  If you have a digital camera, this is a must buy!  [price] sounds steep - but, even my cheapstake self feel its was worth every penny!  Go for it!
First, let me cover the most important point: Does it work? Yes.The praise that most users express for this item is well merited. I purchased this because, like everyone else, normal batteries just did not last. Ten or fifteen photos in, especially if you used flash, and they'd be ready for a change; even the so-called "Heavy Duty" or those marketed as "Digital Camera" didn't make a difference.Well, both of those terms should be reserved for these power cells; they really are less like a battery and more like a power pack. On my first charge up, which took only 3 hours and 6 minutes - I timed it - I wanted to actually test how many photos one could get.On my smaller camera, a 3MP Fujifilm Finepix S3100, I got 52 photos, some with flash, most without. Not random snaps to see how many it could record, but actually taking the time to frame them, select composition, etc.The camera stayed on the entire time using the full LCD rather than viewfinder, took all photos on highest-resolution setting, transferred between auto, manual, and situational modes, charged full flash about 8 times, and went into preview mode. Three hours, 47 minutes later, I got a "low battery" warning - not depleted - low. I stopped then, sure that I had not overpaid.**Note: These power cells will likely last much longer than 3h47m. Lower resolution may result in more photos. These numbers simply represent an unscientific but strenuous personal test to see what the product would do.Other notes about the product:- All parts except for door are made of hard, impact resistant plastic.- Fold away plug in back makes charger easier to store.- Red and Green LEDs are very bright, no mistake between charge and full mode.- Has two "channels", A and B. Seems to charge sets of batteries best; this may have been an issue with another reviewer who reported issues with using one battery at a time.- Black (body back), silver (body front) and blue (door) looks nice.I have one complaint, though perhaps it's only one founded in pure puzzlement. The door flips open...to the right. When holding the unit in your hand, with the Monster logo at the top and the LED at the bottom, the door flips open to the right. My guess is that this decision was made so that the door didn't close on your hand when loading, because most people will tilt it in their left hand so that it's facing away from them at about 45 degrees; I know I do.My final review: 5 out of 5.
These batteries are worth the 100% premium on price you pay.On my Olympus C-2100, I'm still using a set I charged up three months ago, have taken about 50 pictures with flash around the house for various things.  My normal rechargeables would have been long dead.  My battery icon still says full.It's been so long since I've charged them, I can't find the charger.
When I bought a digital camera, I already knew that I would need rechargeable batteries for it. What I didn't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines. I had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate!So I looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with Monster Cable's products.It performs better than advertised. The initial charge may have taken 3 hours, but subsequent charges have been much quicker. I have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they won't operate the camera. The charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance, and has an LED indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged. It is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it.I have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger.
I bought one of these for me and one for my sister when I got digital cameras for the both of us.  I have had my charger and batteries for well over a year now, and I love this thing!  It charges quickly, its light and portable, the batteries are durable, and the charge lasts quite a while. (Especially for me, since I usually don't take alot of pictures.)  And, this device + batteries were cheaper or similarly-priced to some lower quality items available.  When you consider the cost of having to continually buy alkaline batteries (either the regular ones or the ones formulated for electronic equipment), this is a great "investment".  You will certainly end up saving $$, especially if you take a lot of pics and tend to go through quite a few disposable batteries.
Film cameras have largely been left in the dust now that the quality of digital imaging has surpassed 35mm film. My once thriving photography activities fell dormant in the 1908s and '90s. In 2008 I purchased a Canon T2i and a Canon 5D Mark II and a number of EF lenses, such as the 50mm f/1.4, 100mm f/2.8 macro, and 70-200mm f/4 zoom and got back into it big time. I thought it would be an interesting experiment to pick up this EOS-3 full-frame Canon film camera from the latter day product line to see how it performed with my new EF lens aquisitions. My original plan was to keep the T2i as my primary camera, resell the 5D Mark II and keep the EOS-3 for those times when I might want to take advantage of the full-frame lenses. I was able to pick one up in mint condition online at auction for the ridiculously low price of $135.The Canon EOS-3 is the last in the line of "advanced amateur" 35mm film cameras. It was introduced in November 1998 and was still made as recently as 2007. The only Canon film camera still manufactured after 2007 was the professional EOS-1v model; as of this writing in early 2012 you can still buy it new at places like B&H; or Adorama. The EOS-3 has most of the features of the EOS-1v, like 1/8000 second shutter speed, 45-point Area AF, 21-zone metering, and the most advanced focusing system ever developed, the high speed eye-control and high-speed focus tracking system. It's just not as fast as the 10 frames/second of the 1v, but that is inconsequential to me and probably to any sports shooter who needs that speed as they have moved to digital.As soon as you pick up this camera and look through the viewfinder, you know that you are holding an amazing piece of equipment in your hands. The viewfinder is HUGE and bright compared to DSLRs, and the innovative eye-control focusing has to be experienced to be believed. Instead of fumbling around setting auto focus points like you have to do with every new DSLR, all you have to do is LOOK at the area of the frame you want to focus on and the camera knows where to focus. The fact that this perfectly natural way of focusing hasn't been incorporated into Canon's digital line-up 14 years later is frustrating.I just love the sound this camera makes when you take the shot and the camera rapidly advances the film automatically. I know that automatic film advancement was introduced long before this model came out, but my last film SLR was a Nikon F that was pretty much manual everything. To see how film camera technology had advanced in the 25 years since I bought my Nikon is still pretty cool even in the digital age. This is an advanced precision mechanical machine.I didn't end up selling the Canon 5D Mark II. It has become my main camera for product photography and portraits, and any time I want to shoot in less than optimal light conditions. I did sell the T2i and I upgraded to the 60D. I use the 60D for macro and telephoto work. I have to admit I rarely use the EOS-3. Film is just too inconvenient. Can't blame the camera for that, it's five stars all the way. I have been telling myself since I bought the EOS-3 that I would pick up some Velvia film and do some nature photography with it. Just haven't gotten around to it yet. Every once in a while I take it out and play with it, just for the feel of it. I'm glad to have it in my collection and don't plan on parting with it any time soon.If you have any interest in shooting film or just owning one of the last, greatest 35mm film cameras ever made, you too can pick one of these up here on Amazon or on the 'Bay for a couple hundred bucks or so.
If you are used to cheaper DSLRs with their small viewfinders and 1.5-1.6 crop factors, you will love this camera. Excellent metering, very large viewfinder, extremely comfortable to hold in your hand. It just feels good and sounds good (the film winding sound).Plus you get to enjoy your 17mm in full glory (as opposed to 17*1.6 mm)
works properly.there is  no flash and sceen-selection wheel! great!with 8 batteries in the power buster it weights quite a lot, about 1 kilo or something.shutter buttons are very sensitive.
The Canon EOS-3 is about half the price and has most of the features of Canon's top of the line film SLR, and is in nearly every practical respect a professional-grade camera.Why bother buying one now, in this age of digital SLRs?  It would quite possibly be a bad decision as DSLRs are now reasonably inexpensive and so much more convenient.  BUT...  if you need full-frame coverage from your lenses, and don't want to pay $2800 for a Canon 5D, then you can get that with an EOS-3 (or, in fact, ANY Canon film SLR).  If you want 45 autofocus points or eye-controlled focus, then you can get that on the EOS-3.  If you want a fairly solid, professional-style camera body for less money than it costs in DSLR-land, then you can get that on the EOS-3.DSLRs are largely replacing film SLRs, yet film does still have some special qualities that make it enjoyable.  If you want to work with 35mm film (or, at least don't mind it), then the EOS-3 is one of the best cameras you can get.Be sure to buy a high-quality lens to go along with it, like the 50mm/1.4 prime lens or the 24-70/2.8 zoom lens.
Found this one to be at cheaper price than a couple other places. I was a bit worried it wouldn't fit in my old camcorder but it fit perfectly and charged fine.
The battery works perfectly in the Sony camera.Delivery of the battery was as expected and the price was good.This is an old digital camera using a floppy disc for the camera card.Glad to find a battery at a good price.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JPN0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
This was the only place I could find a battery for my old Sony Digital camera.  The battery was expensive, but not as expensive as replacing the camera.  The battery came promptly and in good condition.
To be honest if I could have found a Sony that's what I would have ,but aging electronic's is why there is a use for these products. It came it charged and it works and saves me & my wife from more new tech.
Product arrived on time and fully charged.  I was hessitant as some battery reviews on amazon made me leery that I might be making a mistake.  Battery operates as promised and I would call this a perfect transaction!
I recently have become very interested in photography, and after a few weeks of reading reviews and conducting hands-on research at my local camera shop I decided on the Rebel Ti. After almost 25 rolls of film I have yet to be disappointed with this camera. Everything about the camera screams quality. Lets start with the body. Its diminutive yet ergonomically designed shape just fit beautifully in my hands, and most of the basic settings are adjustable using just a few fingers. The large lighted LCD display on the back of the camera is extremely readable, and makes it effortless to discern the settings of the camera and make quick adjustments. The body is also compatible with every EOS lens, which makes up the largest selection of lenses in the industry.This camera defines the term &quot;user-friendly.&quot; The mode selector dial on the top right of the camera body is easy to read and use. It offers just about every feature any serious photographer could need, from an aperture priority mode to full manual operation, and yet remains accessible to anyone who wants to just pick it up, turn it on, and start taking pictures. All menu operations such as ISO speed changes and multiple exposure settings are just a few button presses away, and all are easy to set. The camera even offers useful modes such as Auto Exposure Bracketing, a feature that automatically changes the exposure up to 2 f-stops for 3 frames, effectively overexposing and underexposing the same picture. This is useful for getting the exposure just right, and has saved some of my best shots.The lens is also superlative. Going from a fairly wide 28mm to a moderate telephoto 90mm, the lens works suitably in almost every situation. The zoom is very smooth, and the auto focus is exceptionally fast. The clarity and quality of my pictures taken with this lens have been very good.I have only experienced a few small problems with this kit, but they are worth noting. The Rebel Ti has no spotmeter, and only uses Canon's partial metering mode, which sometimes has trouble with difficult exposures and strong backlighting. The camera is quite noisy when winding and rewinding film, and takes a few seconds to do both as it prewinds the film. Lastly, the lens has front rotating barrel which prohibits the use of circular polarizing filters, a fact I discovered the hard way. The lens is also a little noisy when focusing.The Canon Rebel Ti is a near perfect camera for a beginner looking for a solid starter camera or an advanced amateur needing to upgrade or a reliable backup. I love mine, and have no regrets with the purchase.
I got this camera for christmas last year and was immediately impressed at how easy it was to use. I've had a few months now to try out all the features and can honestly say the auto-focus modes are a lifesaver. When your just a beginning photographer they come in very handy. It gives you more freedom to concentrate on what you are taking the picture of. Even beyond the beginner stage it allows you to catch people or places in the momment without worrying about your camera settings. Capturing real emotion when it happens is one of the most important things anyways. Isn't it?Anyway, five auto-focus modes(of which the auto-focus is extremly fast), and five user-defined modes(for those of us who are more experienced) cover pretty much any situation you will ever encounter. Very light weight. I shot a wedding the other day(the pics came out amazing without any filters or extra flashes) and never got tired of having it around my neck. Its got plenty of other great features too(red eye reduction, ect.). Check out the specs.Bottom line is that its a great camera for anyone from beginner to semi-professional, and for the price its a great deal. Plus its a very good looking camera.The only thing I would recomend is upgrading the lens at some time, because the 28-90mm lens requires me to get a little too close to my subjects. Thats just a personal preference though.Great deal for a great camera.
If you still like to take pictures using the 35mm format, then this camera is for you.  Like many others, I was quick to purchase a digital camera (Canon Powershot) and enjoy the whole digital camera scene but when it comes to superior photographs, there is nothing that can compare with 35mm photography.  I was looking for a new 35mm camera and went into a local camera shop.  I was introduced to the new EOS Rebel Ti and it did not take me long to really enjoy the features and looks of this camera.  It is significanly lighter then its predecessor and its looks are striking.  I like having the menu screen on the back of the camera in a larger LCD screen.  It's much easier on the eyes.  The different settings allow even the most advanced photographer options that are often found on much more expensive cameras and like all of Canon's 35mm line, the lenses are interchangeable and give you greater flexibility in your picture taking experience.  The built in flash pops up automatically in low light settings and you still have the option of adding on another flash on the cameras top.  You get so many features for a really great price.  ... This is the camera for both the beginner and advanced photographer.
Well this film camera looks like contemporary camera. It looks sharp. Not just the look but picture quality is very good supported by 28-90 mm lens that comes along. I had fun taking many pictures, about 10 rolls of films. I highly recommend.
I really enjoy this camera.Very ergonomic, completely flexible, full of features (including auto-bracketing, multi-frame advance, pre-programmed settings for typical scenes (night, portrait, etc.), manual modes), good flash, 28-90mm zoom, easy to read lcd screen on the back.  To top it all off it's a VERY light load, yet sturdy!And most importantly, the pictures are absolutely beautiful.If you're serious about learning real photography at any pace, pick this thing up.  You'll feel like a dog who just walked into a meat plant.
As a dentist, I take a lot of intraoral (macro) photographs.  I have a Minolta X570 as my main camera and recently added the Canon Rebel Ti.  I agree with the user who recommended that you read the manual several times -- it took me three "reads", with the camera in front of me, to really grasp the "creative modes" -- but the effort is well worth it.  Yes, you can use the camera forever on the fully automatic mode, but learn (at least) the following:-- AEB (auto exposure bracketing): the Rebel Ti will take one shot at exact metering, then one shot stopped down and up (you decide the bracket range).  One of them will be the "money" shot.-- multiple exposures:  it sounded hokey to me initially, but the ability to superimpose images is fun to experiment with and yields surprisingly good results.A-DEP (automatic depth of field): this one is worth the price of admission!  When subjects are at various focal lengths from the lens, use this feature.  The Canon's brain will determine the nearest subject and farthest subject (as covered by the seven autofocus marks in the viewfinder) and compute the ideal shutter speed and aperture necessary to render all in focus.**WARNING** If you buy the Rebel Ti kit at a warehouse (Costco or Sam's), check the lens -- it probably has the designation "III" on the front.  The one from Amazon (and camera stores) has a "II" on the lens ring -- according to the Canon EOS website, the II has more elements and better specs than the III.  If you can find a Rebel Ti kit with a lens marked "USM", that one is better still -- but the kit price will be ...more (and I doubt that the optical quality difference is even noticeable).
I love this camera so much! I got it as a graduation gift in May of 2004. I took this camera with me on my european excursion. It takes beautiful pictures and is very very easy to operate. I would recomend this camera to anyone who's looking for a quality 35mm with manual and automatic controls. I love this camera!
For the price and for it being a used product of some years now, I'm pretty pleased. Jamie of SlingerPhoto shipped it VERY promptly. My wife needed a 35mm SLR for her photography course, and this has met her needs very well. The lens and internals could use a bit of a cleanup, but that's to be expected for a used item. My wife has been focusing on B&W photography for the time being, and the photos have come out very nicely.
I got this camera on my birthday in 2001 based on the local camera dealer advice.  I wanted a camera to take good action pictures for my boys karate stuff.  It takes great pictures.  I have been very happy with my pictures.  The last 3 years I have been doing powerpoint presentations for our local school system and the pictures looks great on the big screen.  I go to costco to get the film developed and asked for the digital cd.  I when I compare my pics to someone elses digital pics in the PPT, my pictures out ways theirs by a far. I am currently looking for a digital camera (processing film gets costly when I do alot of PPT) that will get give me the same result as my canon but right now I will stick with my canon.
This camera is a great option for benginers...exelent autofocus
I have owned this camera for over 5-6 years, and love it. Now looking at upgrading to a DSLR.With the len's, I have the Canon EF 28-90 mm lens and then purchased a Telephoto 300mm lens to go with it. Quality of pictures is amazing, functions easy to use, point+shoot automatic mode great. Semi-pro photographer and with this camera, have had photos published in magazines + calendars.Takes amazing close up photos, and distant photos. A good lens is a definate requirement.I would highly recommend this camera and it would be well used. You won't be dissapointed!
Excellent Quality.Nice feel and weight.Looks very good.  looks expensive.Good features.Only thing That would be nice its for a safety switch that prevents opening the film door on an unfinished film and cause a bad moment in your life.Marco
This camera does everything I need it to do.  It's light weight, durable, and good quality.  This is a great SLR, especially for the price (since its not digital).  There are plenty of lens options you can purchase and if you've ever had a Canon point & shoot, the controls follow the same format, so you'll be ahead of the learning curve.
I'm writing this review after more than a year of purchase, this is a very good camera, all of you guys who goes for B&W beginner or intermediate photography courses, this is a peice of art, very good results, easy way to adjust, it's may be different from the Leica, but way cheaper and yet as good as it with a back led screen to show u your settings and inner light meter that flashes when your exposure settings are incompatible with the amount of light needed, unless you want the pic so dim. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND
This is an excellent camera.  It has helped me learn more about photography. The preset modes allow you to just point and shoot when you're in a rush, and the manual mode lets you get more creative.fast, accurate, versatile, durable.  little bulky, but all SLR's are.
This is my first SLR, but I have been using SLRs for a few year.  Using the EOS Rebel Ti is as easy as using a point and shoot camera.  You well be amaze with the result.
I am a second year art student and I just got this camera to explore the world of photography a bit more. The camera is far more impressive than I had ever expected and takes really great pictures, especially at close range. I have gone through ten roles already and have been very impressed with the results. I've also had a lot of fun with the multiple exposure feature, which has produced both beautifully crisp and strangely abstract pictures. I am still in the process of getting to know the creative functions of the camera, but I've had a lot of fun with it so far. I was also very impressed the autofocus capabilities. I would definitely recommend a good lens to increase the capability. This is my first SLR Camera and I couldn't be more pleased, I definitely recommend it.
This is a great camera for Beginners. All features, and a super quick auto focus. Its also very, very lightweight compare to other similar cameras.Just a bad coment, because even though it stated it came with the DATE feature on the web, and on the invoice, it didn't have that function
To be honest, I'm not much of a photographer, but that's what makes this camera so cool. It's so easy to use. I pretty much take pictures only in the automatic mode, but if I'm feelin wild, i might even just go for.....landscape mode. But for those people who actually know what they're doing, this camera has a ton of other features that I haven't even explored yet. So if I ever decide to go for a more artistic picture -- there are a ton of options for me. I just got my first two rolls of film back and the results were amazing, just as I had expected. But don't base your camera-buying decisions on me. Do the research and you might just find a better camera. Well, probably not.
I own this camera and the Gii, and I love them both.  They are both wonderful cameras, with great features.  Wonderful camera for the casual or professional photographer.
I've used Canon SLR cameras for the last 21 years and have never had any problems with any of them (a F-1, AE-1, EOS 5). I've been using this camera for the last 3 months and have been very pleased with it.This camera's initial appeal is the compact, light weight design. However, this camera offers much, much more!This camera has most of the features and manual setting possibilities found in professional level cameras along with idiot-proof automatic settings that make it as easy to use as a point-and-shoot...Because you can mount any of the countless quality EOS lenses to this camera, the possibilities of crafting quality pictures is endless. The 28-90 lens that comes with this camera is a good place to start, but don't limit yourself to just this one choice. Canon has been making EOS cameras for the last 16 years and has been a market leader all that time. There's lots of great new and used lenses available.Another definite plus to this camera is the awesome ergonomics. Unlike most SLR's, you can easily operate this one (including setting all manual and automatic settings) with just your right hand. I've never used a camera that I've been able to do this in a natural, comfortable and secure manner.
This is my first SLR camera.  While I just got it a few days ago, it's safe to say that I love it.  It is easy to use for the beginner and takes great pictures.  I'm finding quickly that I want to learn how to take great pictures with this camera.  I would say consider getting a bigger lens like the 28-105 or 28-135.  It costs more but the extra zoom for close ups would be nice.
I purchased my canon Rebel Ti with the 28-90 lens fromWolf Camera in Charlotte, NC and I have been very happy with it.  Previously I have owned and still own and use two different models of Minoltas, an XP-700 and a 400Si.  I operate a small one man photography busines from my home and all three of these camera get a real workout.  The canon is the new top of the hill user camera for me at this time.  I just need to add a new lens in the 28-200 range to extend the versitility of this unit.  Wayne Shook dba commoncentsphoto@conninc.com
Adds a little more weight but gives you twice the battery time & the ability to use AA batteries in a pinch. Also feels better when using camera in portrait position. Take note, you do have to make sure you get your left hand out of the way when taking pictures in portrait or else it gets in the way of the flash.
I had been wanting one of these for my Rebel T2 for a long time, and scoured the internet for one.  The batteries that the T2 normally takes can be expensive and hard to find, so the ability to power it with easy to find AA's made this worth it alone.  And having the extra shutter control is the icing on the cake, since I take a lot of vertical shots.A word of warning though, if you get one and install it on a camera that has the "date" feature, make sure your date settings are what you intend them to be.  I almost always keep it turned off on mine, and found out it was turned on after I got a roll of film back.
What does one say about a battery pack? It works great.  Makes it much simpler to be able to switch batteries and keep on shooting photographs.  Canon has been a good product for me and their accessories always are an asset.
Actually purchased on a whim, and looking for an alternative to the expensive disposable batteries that the camera requires.  I boughtEnergizer NH15BP-4 ACCU 2500mAh Rechargeable AA Batteries (Four-pack), and I haven't looked back since.  The biggest benifit for me was that it actually relieved me of the knowledge that my lengthy set-up times and experimenting was costing me a great deal of money.  Rechargeables simply allow me to focus on the subject, not the blinking battery light.
When you take a long exposure photo whith a motorized camera the batteries drain whith the first picture (four hours exposure aprox.), and you wasted 8$ or more, whith this baby you take four cheap AA batts and take the same photo for less $, the recargeable NiMh batteries are the best choice, i take a three hours and a half exposure whith this ones. For last, Adorama ship is fast and very good package!
Ordered this for my Rebel Ti and i love it.  Much better deal long term than spending $12 for a set of batteries all the time.
I will not consider using my camera without this battery pack;all cameras should carry one.
Works great. Much cheaper in long run then using the "special" camera batteries. Adorama slow to ship this item though, so plan ahead. Note that grip has a lockout switch for the extra shutter release, great added feature.
I always thought my Canon fit well in my hands but this battery grip made it feel like a PART of my hand. The extra 'portrait' shutter release is pretty useful and includes an ON-OFF switch in case you forget the second button is there. The grip allows you to use rechargables or cheap common alkaline AA batteries which will last something like 50% longer than the small lithium cells the camera takes (except in the freezing cold). Note that Canon recommends that you NEVER use lithium AA cells in the battery pack due to the sensitivity of the camera's electronics. All in all, this is a great accessory I can't imagine living without.
Can't go wrong with these Sto-Fen bounce units. They create nice soft light at a reasonable price. I've gone through a number of these as they can pop off but they are inexpensive enough so that I just keep a bunch of them around.
This is exactly what i need to diffuse light from my flashes. I use both a Vivitar 285 and a LumoPro LP120. This diffuser fits both comfortably.
I GET NICE RESULTS IN MY PICTURES WITH USE OF THIS DIFFUSERS, A SOFT TONE FOR HEAD ON SHOTS.MANY OF US PROFESSIONAL USE THIS TYPE OF PRODUCTS.
A must have in any photographers camera bag. The differance with tne Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce is night and day. I would highly recommend this product to casual, amatuer, and professional photographers.
If you need a diffuser this is the one to buy it fit a lot of flashes. Very Cool!!! Highly recommend!!
The Sto-Fen is a must have accessory when unit using flash units. The Sto-fen basically eliminates hot spots on your flash images and spreads the flash lighting nice and wide thereby delivering evenly lit images. I do assignment photography with only one flash. I bracket my flash images when using the Sto-Fen since the exposure latitude decreases. Take it from me, photo editors don't like hot spots and the Sto-Fen delivers.
For the price of this thing, it fits well with my Vivitar and doesn't attempt to come off.  It works great to diffuse the light and make it soft.
This diffuser softens the harsh light of an electronic flash in bounce mode.I took a few photos of my pet with the device on, and there wasn't any peteye,which is the same as redeye in people.I believe that you need to use about two f stops above what the flash table says on the flash unit.
This is a good small diffuser. You can just throw it in the bag and carry it around... you never know when a flash might come in handy...I never use a flash without a diffuser. So If you are looking at this you should also take a look at: Gary Fong C3 Cloud Lightsphere II.The only advantage this diffuser has to the C3 is that it's small and easy to carry.
This flash diffuser was a perfect fit for my Vivitar 283 shoe-mount flash.  It slips on smoothly, stays on securely, but is easy to remove.  Even with added shipping charges, Amazon's vendor offers this item at a significantly lower final cost than ordering it directly from Sto-Fen's Website.My direct shoe-mount flash is harsh, unflattering and produces hot-spots from reflective surfaces.  When shooting with my wide-angle lens using direct flash, the field-of-view is not evenly illuminated.  Installing this diffuser on my shoe-mount flash, and tilting the flash upward 45 degrees, softens and spreads the light, giving me much more attractive and uniform lighting.This diffuser does, however, reduce by more than half the distance with which I can successfully illuminate my flash subjects.  For me, it's not a problem.  I just open the lens on my camera a couple of stops to compensate.  For slower cameras or less-robust flash units this might be a problem.This is a useful, reasonably-priced addition to any serious photographer's arsenal.
I bought this Sto-Fen Omni Bounce to use with my Vivitar 283 flash units.  It fits perfectly, is tight, and provides the diffusion that I was looking for when using an on-camera flash unit.  I've done a fair amount of shooting with it and it makes my Vivitar 283 like a little mini-umbrella!
I didn't know what to expect in getting this, but I'm glad I did. the difference it makes in my photos is amazing. I've never used a nice flash or diffuser before, so having this nice of a setup has been a great help in the learning process.
I compared this to a local Store J&R in nyc and they wanted more and Tax -I was very happy with my purchase on line and it was hassle free !!!
Hello,Needed to get my old school Vivitar 285HV flash back in the game for on on location photography and this worked perfectly with no adjustments or alterations needed. Speedy delivery and on time.
I use these with my Manfrotto 055cxpro3 tripod. These feet seem to be quite tough, and they're pretty light (the spike is made of hardened aluminum).When you install them, just be sure to wedge them open so they fit the tripod legs without binding. A little water on the outside of the tripod legs helps too.They're nice feet--far superior to the minimal ones that came with the tripod.
I bought spiked feet adapters when I first got my tripod. They fit inside the legs. I use the word fit very loosely though, as they were terrible.The new ones available now are great! The fit well. Just don't tighten them to much.
I have had these for 5 years or so maybe more and they are great.  If you do outdoor photo's they are great to dig into the grass, dirt, etc and when indoors a quick twist and you are good to go.
I have always used the Omni-Bouce with my flash units. The dispersion of light does a great job of balancing my photos.
It fits the flash perfectly, thought a bit tight.  It does the job softening the light.  Combined with a off-shoe cable, you can be very creative.
It diffuses speedlite flash perfectly.  Perfect tool for making the flash light spread to the subject compare to a bounce card.
This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.The white box is for general use. Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.PROS:Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.A quality product that works.CONS:None
I have two of these diffusers that I place over my Sony HVL-20DW2 video lights in order to even out the lighting on my subjects and to prevent them from squinting. If I am close to the subject, I throw on the diffuser. If I am farther and need to light up a speaker (like a maid of honor or best man) then I will take the diffuser off.
Compr&eacute; este difusor por los comentarios de un usuario en Amazon. En verdad no me arrepiento. Es excelente para atenuar la luz que emite la lampara Sony HVL-20DW2, brindando una imagen suave y sin sombras. Es importante destacar que esta pieza no esta dise&ntilde;ada para su uso con la HVL-20DW2, por lo tanto su acoplamiento con la lampara no es del todo perfecta, pero se mantiene firme. Por lo que pude investigar, no existe otra alternativa similar en el mercado para &eacute;sta lampara. La recomiendo para su uso en tomas cercanas de personas u objetos que requieran una suave iluminaci&oacute;n.
Threw this on my speedlite the day it came, and tested it with a bit of candid event photography. Granted, the diffuser pulls back a bit on the flash's output, but the softer lighting makes it a more-than-even trade. Very happy with this purchase!
It's a handy little diffuser, as others have said, sturdy, easy to pack and go.The softer lighting eliminates that harsh bright spot you sometimes see in flash photos. I also notice the cat doesn't seem to mind being the photographic subject as much... LOL!Hubby will probably want the green and gold diffusers next. Christmas is coming!
Perfect product for me! I had many terrible flash experiences before I got my hands on the omnibounce.I was constantly "whiting/overexposing" my subjects... The omnibounce solves all those problems.. Making the flash a compliment to the image, nice even soft tones spread across the image. perfect for quick shooting in all condition.[...]Love it and would recommend it to all photogs out there!RobertB
I never take this off my flash. It works as a great diffuser, and still allows me to get some fill light in while shooting in outdoor settings as well.
What can I say? It's an Omni-Bounce. Not a Gary Fong product (i.e. LightSphere), but fits great on the flash, works as it's supposed to, and that's about all I can say about it.
I absolutely love my omni bounce!!! It never comes off my glad because its just that good! I now take portraits and rarely worry about soft light because its already soft :) the only way this could be better is if I had extra sb-28 units and did it all wirelessly with extra sto-fen units. My sb-28 and sb-28dx have more than enough power to make these worth the light falloff of about a stop or two when bounced. It doesn't replace studio lighting of course but for on location stuff its invaluable... Better than bounce cards by far! I highly recommend getting one or five!
This one works with the Canon 430EX. I'v got one and it has a snug fit. Highly recommended.
Coupled this with my Metz MZ 36342 36AF-4 Digital Flash. Fits well and does the job. Glad it wasn't too expensive.
Arrived quickly and works well!
I have owned Sto-Fen flash diffuser's for about ten years. They may look like the one that comes with your flash but that is where the similarities stop. If you use the Sto-fen as directed, you won't be disappointed. It is lightweight and works like a charm. No Velcro is needed. It is a snug custom fit for your flash head. If you leave your flash on TTL and tilt your flash head up to the 45 degree angle, you will be amazed how even the light source is with little or no hot spots. Whether you are taking a portrait or a small group, Sto-Fen is the way to go. I would highly recommend this product.
Im not a pro photographer but IMHO this little plastic piece does a great job. You can really see the difference in the pics taken with and without this diffuser. I purchased two of them as "USED" trying to save a couple of bucks and let me tell you they were in perfect condition. Im really happy with this purchase.
I received the stofen diffuser in a very quick manner.Thank you! I like this product and recommend to amateur & pro shooters.
Great Seller and product thanks. Diffuser is simple but it is just what i needed.  Balances the light for even fill with my fisheye lens.
This item had come with my SB800....but I had forgotten it at a shoot and had since tried to make due without. Needless to say, it is a necessity and I am glad to have it back!
I bought this for mySunpak Super 383 Flashand frankly, it should have been included with the flash.  It does a great job of diffusing the flash when you have to aim the the flash towards the subject. There is a slide on adapter bracket for the diffuser clip into, to attach to the flash.  It's easy to clip on and off and is pretty sturdy. I leave the adapter on the flash, there's no need to remove it when you don't have the diffuser clipped in.
I bought it for the sunpak 383 flash to go with my Panasonic DMC FZ-30 and glad I did!The above named flash is very powerful specially at close distance and where tilting it up to use it for a bounce effect is not an option. It simply allows you to get a picture where otherwise would have been very difficult with a milder more diffuse and evenly distributed light. Make sure you remember to remove it when you need that full blast. I leave the black cage/adaptor on the flash and pinch the white plastic diffuser off since sliding the adaptor each and every time is cumbersome. That's the only minor issue. In short, I think it's a must and shame the flash doesn't come with a diffuser already.
This diffuser does all that it is supposed to do.  It is easy to put on / take off and does even out the flash.  The retaining clip did take a couple of minutes to install, but that is something that is not going to fall off.  The diffuser clips on and off the retainer and that only takes a second.  This makes it easy when changing settings and scenes.
Great price- I believe it does what it is supposed to do. Recommend +++
Glad I found this attachment for my old Sunpak 433.  First unit shipped from Adorama was missing the adapter bracket.  Adorama quickly shipped a new one without hassle--THANKS!!!
It doesn't matter what kind of photography you're into, if you use strobes get one for each one. You'll be surprised by the results!
manfrotto super clamps are fine and rugged staging/grip tools.  i've owned 6 of them & they work flawlessly.  like any good tool, they work well & age beautifully.
I use this on my car's harness bar with a go pro camera.  Stays in place, no shaky videos, or any other issues.
Super clamps are great for audio, video, you name it.  Of course you can't throw these onto just any rig, they are very versatile and portable for lighter equipment.  Combined with a ball clamp, you're talking about tons of possibilities.  Manfrotto should be making dslr rigs with these things.
Just buy it there are so many uses for this product. This is definitely a must have in for your camera bag.
Using this in combination with a ballhead, you can put a full size DSLR anywhere you can imagine. Super stable. I got my first superclamp two months ago and have been a convert ever since.
Most photographers know of the awesome "superclamps" - they grip onto just about everything, hold large amounts of weight and give you the flexibility you need. One of the ways you get that flexibility is through the different "studs" (brass inserts). I've recently picked up a handful of Superclamps and studs and have had a few months to experiment with them.By far the most useful stud is theManfrotto 037 Reversible Short Stud - Replaces 2907included with this model. The "standard" stud included with other superclamps is single-sided and sticks out about 1 inch from the superclamp. This not only requires you to buy (and carry) a separate stud if you want both 1/4" and 3/8" mounts, but also that anything you stick on top will be sitting an inch off the superclamp. This is especially an issue for heavy equipment (like a ballhead & DSLR).The 2907 stud included here solves both problems by using a reversible stud (3/8" on one side, 1/4" on the other), but also being a "short stud" keeps the threading flush so you can attach a ballhead or DSLR without worrying about shaking (the standard stud, sitting an inch above the superclamp, is much more likely to move around).This item is a great way to pick up a superclamp and the reversible short stud as a 'combo' rather than buying the stud separately later on.I've attached ballheads with DSLR's on top to this thing and then flipped the stud and attached a hotshoe flash to it without any issues whatsoever. The superclamps also have a large range of uses (you can make a boom out of a tripod/lightstand and a monopod, make a background support system with 2 lightstands and a monopod, or hook a camera or flash onto railing without worrying about it).
Another rock solid clamp by Manfrotto.  I am using the Opteka TacShot Pistal Grip head.  The short stud makes this head fit flush with the grip.  This clamp is strong and I definitely have no problems having my camera attached to it.
it is Manfrotto - if you need it, you need it - and it will definitely work!
You get what you pay for. This is a pretty simple piece of kit for the price but it does the job. Tight hold on a flat or round surface. I've used this to mount a very expensive camera underneath my moving car. Just to give you an idea of the level of confidence I have in it's grip.
I have been a fan of the Super Clamp for many years, so when I was in need of something smaller to hold lights I was very happy to see that Manfrotto had a smaller version.  I used these to mount LED lights to 1/2 inch metal pipes for a time lapse video project.  They work great!
This is the exact replacement for the Manfrotto rapid connect mounting plate. Fits perfectly and is an exact copy of the one I lost. I'm sure if I don't loose these (I bought two just in case) they will serve me well for years to come.
The quick release plate will come in quite handy this Spirng Training in AZ.  Calumet is a Great Seller and I recommend them highly
Works exactly as I needed. Use on both my tripod and monopod.  Have 1 for big lenses, another for the camera.  With multiple bags I always have 1 in the wrong camera bag when I want to put it on the camera.  If I was more organized I probably would have it with me each time, but more that isn't going to happen so I will probably by one to keep in each camera bag :-)
I received my Bogen-Manfrotto mounting plate as expected and promptly.  Went to use it and found the mounting screw too large for all of my cameras.  I was not aware there are different sizes.  The 1/4" screw threads into every "consumer" and "prosumer" still and video cameras I've ever used.  Not sure what cameras use the larger 3/8" screw size that was on the first plate I purchased.I was able to return and re-order the correct plate without problems through Amazon.New plate works great.  Just like the original that came with my tripod.
This is not a standard release plate for your common DSLR Cameras, like D300's, D800's, or Canon 5D's etc..  This version of the product has a 3/8&#34; mounting screw, like most tripod heads connect too, so if you have an old Russian Camera, large video camera, or some other piece of equipment that uses the 3/8&#34; threaded mount this will work.The only thing to keep in mind is this has a plate with a flange that sticks up 90 degrees, and it may not work with your camera, or other equipment, but the plate can POP off easily if you want to remove it.
Perfect way to attach a point&shoot camera to heavy duty Really Right Stuff professional tripod quick mount.
I bought this for my Monpod, it works great, I need a 1/4" X 20 thread to 3/8" X 18 thread for my Bogen Manfatto ball head, just screw it on your Monpod and then screw you ball head on and you have a great way to hike and stablize you shot with what every cammera you choice.  Great product made of Aluminum with rubber washer to hold in place without scratching your equiement, I recommend this to anyone that needs adapter.
For a serious photographer this tri-pod is an excellent choice. Carbon fiber construction means its light weight and still stronger than aircraft aluminum! The tripod comes with both a carrying strap (get a case, its easier overall) and spikes for the legs (for those outdoor shots).It accepts all the Bogen (and Gitzou!) tri-pod heads, I used the straight bogen ball head with the quick release.The best feature of this tripod is that you can lug it around for hours without getting tired, you can set it up in 20 seconds flat, snap on your camera (with the quick release head), take a few shots, and move on. Great for wildlife, great for outdoor sporting events where you're on the move to follow the action.The second best feature is that its really tough. Think about that the next time your camera case dents the aluminum leg of your previous tripod. Not this baby.Expensive but worth it, expect 15 - 25 years of hard use out of this piece of gear.
Works as advertized. Smart design, light weight, adding a lot more traction on the ground: hardwood floor or out in the fields. The rubber cups are retractable.
Very compact and easy to pack for travel.  Allows me to completely disassemble my tripod for cleaning after shooting in surf and sand.
Great little tool kit for repairing and adjusting my tripod.  I sometimes get sand and grit in the legs when shooting at the beach, and with this little tool kit I can disassemble the tripod, clean it, and reassemble it in no time.
it works as it should be. I got few fixed focal lens that have filter threaded smaller than 77mm. this rings allow me to use common filter holder and filter kits for all lenses.
These are the pieces that are perfectly created to be used with the Lee Filtering system.  There are pieces that you need so that you can use in the proper fashion, this is what I needed.
This is the best I've found so far for keeping my no glare, transition lenses clean.  Everything else does not work & this cloth is super huge.  The little box is great to store my other smaller optical cloths in with the spray so I always know where they are.  This spray gets all the dirt, dust & everything that smudges my glasses off them instantly without streaks or leaving behind a film.  I haven't seen an reviews mention using this on their glasses, and hoped before purchasing this kit that I could without problems.  So far there have been no problems & I think this is about the best I will find to clean them.  The cleanser is gentle enough not to remove the no glare or ruin my lenses.  I'm happy to have stumbled upon this item.  A friend of mine recommended trying cleansers used for camera's and other optics, and I am glad she did.
I've been using these kits for the past few years as they come standard issue in my Army camera kit, I just ordered one for own kit the other day. Comes in a nice case so it's tough to lose the little pieces.
Automatic sensor cleaning is now the rule on digital SLRs, obviating the need, in most cases, for the SpeckGrabber.  Last summer I bought a Nikon D7000 and forgot to turn on startup sensor cleaning.  Recently I discovered 6 spots on my sensor, although only one showed up with any regularity in my photos.  These dust specks were adherent to the sensor and doing sensor cleaning from the setup menu failed to dislodge any of them.  I pulled out my old SpeckGrabber kit, not used since I sold my D200 3 years ago and in a minute they were all gone.  You don't need this tool much anymore, but it's nice to have around just in case.
I am scanning all of our old slides (thousands of them), and this brush works very well for removing dust without damaging the slides.
First they have the incorrect image for this item, the "SW-060" is a 2.5 inch brush and not the "SW-100" which is a 4 inch brush that they have featured in the image. In the past I've used microfiber cloth which doesn't remove the charged particles but this brush works great at removing those charged dust particles which kling to electronics like magnets. This brush effectively grounds the dust particles so they can be easily vacuumed away.I try to protect my computer so every few weeks I equip the anti-static gloves and anti static wrist strap with grounding wire then open the case for cleaning the dust from sensitive computer parts like hard drives, graphics cards and the mother board. Once I've loosened the dust with the anti-static brush I use my shop vac to blow it away (It saves a fortune in canned air). The brush is also soft enough to gently use to remove dust on monitors and LCD screens. I highly recommend this item.
They are of high quality and install very easily on the Canon 17-40 and 24-105 I own.  The Lee Filter system is really the way to go, especially with ND filters higher than 3 stops or so.
It's necessary to get this to be able to set your filter holder for your Lee Filters. Can't do without it. Excellent quality as all of the Lee products.
The adapter rings works just fine. It connects to the camera smoothly as one would expect and allows use of the lee filter system.
The adapter ring is easy to get on and off.  It can be left on, so adding the filter holder is literally &#34;just a snap&#34;.  All in all, this is a very nice system.
Though hard to get at times these adapters fill the bill and work just fine.  Came in a timely fashion.  I will be able to use them for many years to come.  Not like you are going to wear them out.
Worked perfectly on cannon 5d mark 3! A must have if planning on using lee filters, which are a must have for landscape photography!
I got this and tried out the adapter to a few of my old 35mm lenses, it worked, on most, but on two it was REALLY soft-focus, like Vaseline smeared on a lens, that bad.That is not this thing's fault at all, this thing is made perfect, really nice quality, I've bought similar on 'that online auction place', they were Chinese junk, inferior metals.With other lenses I have, I got some good quality out of them, I don't know why the differences yet, but it surely has to do with the lenses compatibility to the lens inside of the adapter, which I removed to check out, (it just unscrews) but it loses its focus big time.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to utilize their old lenses, or, go with a Nikon lens on a Canon, that sort of thing, you can do some good stuff with this with the proper lens.I'd buy it again, it's cheap for what it is, it's quality, so you can't ask for anything more.
Note the  Photo above is NOT this product. This product  is a adapter which contains a LENS and is superior to the one shown.The Canon FD/FL series of lenses for the  bayonet mount cameras of the past were the standard of high quality optics, and the  FL SC and SSC  lenses were the best lenses on the market. When the lighter weight eos lenses replaced the bayonet system, many users were forced to retire these superior quality manual focus lenses.This adapter  is far superior to the  cheaply machined glassless adapters available elsewhere, I own both. Not only does this adapter fit well on both the camera bodies ( I use  XS and XSi) and the lenses,  the original optical quality is maintained as well as infinity focus.By being a 1.3X teleconverter you gain additional magnification, but this is of course unnoticeable when composing in the camera.Metering is uneffected, and  the cheaper glassless  one  causes "communication" errors which sometimes disables the camera operation, THIS one doesn't.I use this to adapt lenses and my FL/FD Bellows for macro work, the results are excellent.The connection is tight and robust enough to handle the extra weight.[...]
As others have noted, this adapter does not come with any directions on how to attach and use it. So it took a little time to work it out. I posted instructions as an image file, also available at[...]Other than that the adapter works fine. Of course you have to set the aperture manually, but can still meter automatically using the Program or Aperture Priority modes.
I made the plunge and got a Canon T4i for myself for Christmas. I hadn't bought a camera since 1982 when I got the Canon A1. Over the next few years I would acquire additional lens.I've not touched that camera for over 15 years. When I got the T4i I was curious about whether or not I could use those lens on the new camera. I found out about this adaper and read the reviews.I got the adaptor last night and am very impressed with it. I had read some reviews that said that there were no instructions to mount the adaptor on the lens/camera. I was more than surprised to find that this was not the case. Mounting the adaptor and removing it cannot be easier. For the price I have access to some great glass. I plan on getting two more adaptors so I can keep them permanentaly attached on my FD lens.This is well worth the money.
All the old FD lens that were in my drawer have now found a place back in my camera bag! Now the only problem I have is my camera bag is to heavy.
I had an unused mirror telephoto and gave it to my brother as a gift.He's got a digital Canon Rebel. This adapter enabled him to use thelens on his camera. He reports that it works perfectly in every regard.No problem with fitting and stability as mentioned elsewhere.That's good enough for me.
I'm using it to join a Canon Rebel Xti and an old Canon zoom lens.  This is a great option for those who don't like letting old lenses go to waste. While I agree with the other reviewers that the combination can be a little cumbersome, it beats having to buy a new lens. Great product!
Works as advertised, nice finish.A very safe way to protect your lens.Looks better on legacy glass, like for example Super Takumars.
Just enough protection at just the right price. This insert is adjustable and takes up just the right amount of space to secure my longer telephoto lenses and prevent them from bouncing back and forth. I put one at each end of my Domke F-804 and created a third protected pocket in the center. My Sony 70-400 fits nice and secure in its case.
Get a few of these and don't even think about it. If you pack your gear in anything but a well-padded camera bag (e.g., messenger bags, backpacks, purses, etc.) this will keep your gear in wonderful condition. It's also wildly useful for folding up small connectors and so on.
I am very protective of my lenses so the times that I do not use the case, I wrap the lense in one of these protective wraps to protect them from bumping into each other when in my bag. I do not use the case for the purpose of creating a space. I also like the attractive colors that it comes in. You just have to make sure you create the right size so the item is rally wrapped all around.
This is the perfect size for my Olympus OM-D E-M1 with 12-40mm zoom. I don't like carrying a camera bag when I travel and this wrap lets me toss my camera into my walkaround bag without any worries about dings and scratches.
Versatile wrap... Specifically ordered these wraps for packing glass products. It works great for keeping glass personal toys from breaking or chipping in my travel bag. Saves a great deal of space compared to the original packages or the padded draw-string bags...
I wanted a light, protective wrap for my camera for times when I'm not carrying a camera bag.  This fits the bill perfectly.  If you're looking for heavy duty protection and low key, buy camera bag insert and put it in your regular bag.  But for something that's quick, easy and very portable, this fits the bill.  Also, the size is large enough that I can wrap my camera with a pancake/flat lens.
