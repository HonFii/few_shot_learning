I have bought 2 rolls of I-zone sticky film and only one picture has turned out at all. The rest are pitch black. The one picture was sort of neat of my cat, but other than that I seriously do NOT reccomend this product
Obviously, this camera looks cool. It's simple to use and very straight forward when it comes to taking pictures. The problem is: they never come out looking very good. Mistakes are costly too as the film comes in packs  of six! The pictures are awkward in size and Polaroid recommends that you  don't trim them due to the presence of CAUSTIC glue. I like Polaroid's new  approach, this could have been a very cool device but instead I think I'll  stick to more conventional cameras.
My biggest disappintment with this camera is the size of the pictures. They are unbearably small. Litteraly a size of a poststamp.The quality of the picture is avearge, and the camera has this annoying feature, where it turns off after every picture.
Up to you, but I would buy a generic branded battery of the same type (Lithium BP522).  I bought a generic battery and it works just as well -- saved me $50 !
I just returned this camera after two weeks of usage.  It was *much* worse than my last Pentax point &amp; shoot.  The autofocus on this camera is terrible--I probably missed 10 Christmas and son's birthday pictures because the autofocus claimed it couldn't focus.  (In darker areas, it uses a dinky white light to try to focus with.  It didn't work well.)  The zoom is also slow and jerky.  And the worst part is the huge delay between the time you push the shutter and it taking the picture.  I missed several other photos because the camera took a picture after the action had ended.  The flash reach and recharge time was also poor, though all the new point and shoots seem to take a long time to recharge the flash.We just replaced this camera with a Pentax IQZoom 120SW.  Better zoom, better autofocus, shorter shutter delay with about the same size and weight.
I purchased this camera on the recommendation of a camera store owner because of some special lens it supposedly has.  It doesn't take any better pictures than other cameras I have owned and it is sooo difficult to get it to focus on anything!  I had a baby recently and most of my early pictures of her are completely blurred because of this camera's inability to focus, especially close up.  I'm going to return it and trade it for a Pentax which always takes close ups well.  I agree with the shutter release delay everyone else is having a problem with also.
I've owned the Ti for two years. I've taken many good photos over the past two years, and really enjoyed the quality of close up pictures with the included lens. I have been disappointed a few times with taking landscape night photos. Even when the camera is sitting still on a flat surface, its still hit and miss with a long exposure.Recently, the very tiny plastic piece that latches the film cover closed broke, rendering the camera useless. Once more it didn't break from a hard drop, or massive hit. It simply broke after I set it down on a table. Even though I've had the camera for two years, I'd say I've only gone through less than two dozen rolls of film. So it can't have broken from excessive use either.Luckily I bought an extended warranty and will not be out $300, but now I think I may make the move to digital. If you want to stick with 35mm, the Canon rebel series is good while it lasts, but be sure to protect your investment with an extended warranty.
I had to return item because the back would not stay shut, causing the film to be exposed.  I returned item & am expecting a refund.
The one I received was not authentic so it would not stay on correctly (and I managed to get my full refund). I later bought another one from else where and it stays on and reads sto-fen on it. That said this one that does not stay on correctly, I was still able to use it but have to really work with it to get it correctly positioned. For that this imitation sto-fen gets 2 points. the real sto-fen, I would give a 5 as it definitely does what it is supposed to do and does not give a harsh shadow.
I am very surprised that this product has the DOMKE name on it. The insert arrived with a couple of the foam inserts loose in the bag. They are not sewn into the insert walls. The craftsmanship of this product does even remotely match the quality of the DOMKE bag. At best this product is worth about half of the asking price.
I know that it was only $11 but this protective sheet is thin and provides little protection. While the stitching was nice and it was made in the USA (at least that is what the sticker said) they could have spend $.50 more on good neoprene and made it a good item. Chintzy feeling.
Not really what I wanted but will use with my small telephoto. Once it is wrapped around the lens the corners kind of poke out.
We bought this light bulb to replace our other, smaller, similar bulb, in order to see better for our screen printing dark room. It works, but turned out not to be much brighter, or the same, as the smaller one. I don't know how that is possible, but it is. Maybe they use a higher wattage bulb and then coat it with thicker red stuff. Now we use a 60 watt CFL bug light which is way better.
Couple quick gripes.1.  The dropdown legs barely come up in the "up position".  Seriously, it's around a quarter of an inch off the ground.  That's a problem because if there is any elevation the pegs get stuck (hope the camera was on there tight;).  Oh, and they don't come off.  They are bolted in there with no way to take them off.  Why would they do that?2.  Do not try to film and move with this thing.  I've seen where people have put sand bags and all sorts of crap on similar things to reduce vibration, but nothing is working for me.So, take it for what it is.  It might just be me.  I might not be using correctly.  Either way, those two problems keep this thing in company storage.
I needed some photographic dust removal hand brushes, I ordered this item on a whim based upon looking at its photo.  Note the photo shows TWO brushes with a hand loop and the title reflects the plural sense of brushes as well.  What I received from Adorama was a SINGLE brush which looks nothing like the two pictured.  This is a small brush which has no hand loop handle, it is simply just a peg of a handle.  Would not have bought this single small brush at this price--the company is the same as mentioned in the title, and the model number is the same as listed in the product page, but it is a completely different item than what is pictured.  Contacted Adorama about the problem: never received a reply.  BEWARE.
this is the brush for you. The description says 3/4" (I missed that) so I should have known. Then I was charged $6.00 plus for shipping which makes this a pretty expensive brush for someone with tiny hands. Then I didn't read the reviews either. So what have we learned here - read the reviews, then read the description carefully, a lastly - check the shipping charges.
We got this for my 4 year old nephew to learn photography. He understood the mechanism well except that you have to manually remove the film after you take a shot. I kept forgetting this as well! If you do not remove the film, you just take another picture over the other one. This camera design is somewhat flawed, there should be a better fail safe mechanism.Get a different Polaroid. Don't get me wrong, Polaroids are great for kids though! My nephew is a definitely budding photographer.
I am extremely disappointed with the packaging.  I ordered 5 NEW for Christmas presents and when I received them, they looked as though they were used.  The package had been opened and re-taped, it was dirty and I am embarrassed to give them as gifts.  I haven't used them yet because I thought that they would come with at least a trial film to get started, but the film is not included.  I am praying that they work better than they look.
The picture is very small and hard to see from more than a foot or two away or if you are not looking at it striaght on. It is easy to use, but the picture quality is poor.
The carry case is a big uncool thing. You need to be a great manager to habdle the carry case. Hardly your SD card holds in it. No strap to hold the case. You need to use camera's strap. Not worth of the money spent. The design seems to be 50 years old. I am not happy with the product. Recommend no buy.
The lenses cover will not stay in place.  Not a pro, but I have retired the camera for a small, faster lighter point and shoot.
When using this headset with my MP3 player it sounds OK (just OK) and has pretty good range......but that's not the main reason why I bought it. I needed a headset for my LG CG300 cell phone, and at more than $150 off retail I thought this would be a great bargain.The person on the other end of the conversation can barely hear you talk, and the sound of your voice is both muffled and distorted. On your end it really isn't much better. It's pretty much unusable with a cell.I gave it 2 stars because it isn't horrible with my MP3 player but it ain't too good either. For the cell phone though.......it's junk.
this is a nice set of headphones, good range, good quality, nice ergonomics. The bluetooth transmitter on the ground is not the best solution but it is ok. My problem with these headphones is power consumption. They go out in a couple ours (both transmitter and headphones must be recharged) even if you do not hear any music. I do not understand how this is happening unless they didn't do a good job in making the design low power -basic techniques are adequate at this level . I haven't tested them with cell phones.
I bought this kit in hopes of using it as my main headphones and of course as a hands free for  my cell phone. Well, the audio quality is below average : vitually no bass, hard to listen in noisy environments, outside sound leaks in and the volume doesn't go that loud. Also the unit I received (brand new) malfuncioned, sound didn't come from both speakers. When using it as a hands free for my Sony Ericsson W600, it pairs ok, but people tell me i sound like a robot (when it works at all). So I would say, look elsewhere.
These paired right away with my VX9800, I could hear the beeping and such, but when the time came to listen to music, the music played out of phone's speakers, not the headphones. Thus far, I've read nothing good about these headphones and cell phones, so, if it's cell phone head phones you seek, look elsewhere. As for their worth otherwise, they work quite well when using just on my computer, very fun. The range is decent, not as far as I'd hoped, but decent. After wearing for about an hour, they start to hurt. They fit very snugly and comfortably otherwise. However, they look somewhat ridiculous in that the phones look like two eggs attached to the side of your head. There are better things out there.
I purchased these cameras for additional security for my business. The reason was that the cameras were designed to "pan" when activated by motion in front of the camera which would make them more realistic. I installed them per the included instructions and initially they worked as described by the manufactuer. Unfortunately, after 1 month, one of the cameras ceased to function and the other two cameras failed to operate shortly thereafter. I changed the batteries hoping that the problem might be resolved but to no avail. Luckily, I did not pay a lot for these cameras and I would hesitate to recommend them to anyone else.
I went with this design because the other looked like it had battery clips that could snap off. This one is not too impressive either - the only thing that holds the battery in the charger is a tight fit, which is a bit too tight. I'm a pretty strong guy who does a lot of mechanical work with my hands, and I needed to get a pair of channel lock pliers to pull the battery out of the charger after pushing it into place for charging... The marks on the battery are not pretty, but it was not really damaged.
I wanted a wired remote for the Canon 7D that had a removable cable so that I could swap out cables on my wireless remote (it has a removable cable but you need different cables for different body models).One of the reviews said this one has a removable cable.It does not.It was returned to vendor.I wound up ordering the "GSI Super Quality Luxury Remote Switch Trigger for Canon EOS 5D, 1D, 1D Mark II, 1DS, 1Ds Mark II, EOS 20D, EOS 3, D60, D30, 10D, EOS 1V, EOS D2000, 30D, 50D Cameras, Functions Exactly as the Canon RS-80N3". It has a removable cable and is a much better quality unit as well. Ergonomic in your hand, better tactile response and better build. Also, you are not limited to the factory length - you can add whatever length of 1/8 mini plug cable you want. For my needs - just the cable - the remote itself is just a bonus! And a good one at that!Enjoy
It creates not a nice effect on UWA lens such as my sigma 10-20mm. I never liked the pictures taken with it and have found myself not using it at all.
I've had this (Gorillapod GP2-E1EN for SLRs) for 2.5 years now. It's been used occasionally, never abused, and at first did pretty well. Over time, several joints appeared to be looser than the rest. I thought it was just wear, but recently looked closely and saw that the black plastic around the circumference of the loose sockets was cracked. I removed those segments, and now have stiff legs again, but the topmost joint (the bottom of the clamp base) is also cracked, so it will no longer hold up the weight of my SLR, even with no lens.This is a weak design, and I'm hesitant to buy a new one unless they've acknowledged this issue and improved it. This one will now be relegated to use on small point and shoot, and maybe hold a strobe.
I love the idea of this tripod! The point-and-shoot version works great, but for my Canon Rebel with a heavy lens it is a total no-go. It just can't handle the weight. With a light lens like the prime 50mm, it would probably work fine.One day I set up the camera with my wide angle lens and the tripod actually buckled, my lens broke and it cost more than $200 to repair the lens. I was bummed and at the time wished I had never met the Gorillapod.They may have improved the product by now, but if not, beware if you're hoping to use this with an SLR and a large-ish lens. Just go with a regular, light-weight tripod instead.
shaky shaky shaky.  if you buy this tripod, you better have a remote or you photos are going to be a blurry mess.  The neck has no stability!  Also i wouldn't wrap the legs around anything too high off the ground.  Not the most reliable grippers and joints.
I'm blown away by how many 5-star reviews the gorillapod got.  I have been using it for about a month, and have been extremely disappointed.First, I should point out that I'm using the SLR model for my Canon A620 point and shoot, simply because it's just a smidgen over the weight limit for the smaller gorillapod.  This means that the camera I am using is at the bottom of the weight range for this model, and should have no problems.  Unfortunately, that's not the case.  This item simply isn't sturdy enough, no matter what configuration it is in.  Even the most gentle pressure on the shutter release of wither of my two camera models (I also tried using it with a small digital SLR) moves the tripod and blurs the picture.  As a result, any time I use it, I have to take many shots of the same scene and then pick the least blurry one to keep.  And for this reason, you can forget using it on anything but the hardest of surfaces... on dirt or grass, its lack of weight works against it, allowing it to move and blur photos.The one thing for which I WOULD recommend it is for use with the video camera setting on your device.  It completely eliminates "hand shake," and because you aren't touching it while it's filming, there's no (or negligible) blur.But all in all, a disappointment.
This works great for lighter cameras, but with my Canon 50D and the 28-135mm lens it "sags" and won't hold the camera straight. I'm returning it.
Seems like it should work well, but it's just not strong enough for my Nikon D90 with kit lens.  Sitting flat on the table, it's okay, but even then, if you want to angle it up or down, the legs start to slide out from under it.  And I just would not trust it wrapped around a pole or something.  Probably my fault for choosing the wrong model.Will work great with a little point-and-shoot.  That's probably what I'll use it for.
I really wanted a mini tripod for my SLR, but I don't really like this gorillapod mostly for its (lack of) ease of use. It's more of an inconvenience to set up and get ready to use than I thought.  Screwing it on is easy enough, but then the three flexible legs are hard to set up to make the camera sitting atop take a straight shot. Most likely your pic will be at least a little crooked.  I haven't tried wrapping the tripod legs around a pole or something because I'm afraid it won't hold the weight of the SLR and slide down (but I'm sure it's designed to hold the weight of an SLR so it can do it -- just me not wanting to try).  Basically, it seems like a pain and time consuming to set up and so I rarely, rarely want to use it.
the nob on the hotshoe is very stiff and difficult to fasten/unfasten and I ended up breaking it trying to unlock it. If you are thinking to have one these for you SLR Camera then DON'T get this one. Even the larger ones are not reliable enough to risk putting your camera on with awkward sort of positioning.The other main failure with this mini tripod, it keeps wobbling for ever due to the flexibility of its bendable legs.
as the title says, the photos werent' bad considering the low quality (great for the web) but it broke within a month
Got it for grandpa, spent an hour setting it up. And it worked while connected to computer and outlet. but the power button didn't work. So when I went to turn it on it would not do anything.Then I had a second one, and my computer kept flashing warning signs and checking for viruses on an unsafe device. I just don't trust it and will be returning them both very shortly.
I purchased one as a gift for my father-in-law.  When I would use the software to download pictures to the device, the software would often just terminate and I'd find myself back at my Windows desktop screen.  It doesn't happen on all photo folders and I can't understand why it does it on some folders, but not others.  Brookstone has no real support for the software either.  Took me hours to download 60 pictures to the device.
This camcorder was purchased for a school so the students could learn how to video edit.  While the videos taken with the camera play back ok, none of them will import into video editing software.  We've tried Windows Movie Maker, EZ Media Creator 8 and 9, and an open source transcoder called Media Coder.  All of these applications either crash, or produce garbled output when using files generated by this camera.  This is true of both HD and mini-DVD footage.  Hitachi's answer? If it plays back in windows media player and on dvd players, their job is done.  If you just want to play back your raw footage, this camera might work for you.  We are returning the camcorder...Update-  We found out that if you switch the camcorder to Wide Mode, it no longer has the broken video problems.  We can now edit it using any video editing software.  By "wide screen" I mean 720X480 mode, which really is still close to standard TV width and height.  Look for it in the options menu when in record mode, before you start recording.  I now give this product a 4* rating.
I took this camera on an extensive European vacation recently. I tryed out the various functions prior to the trip and was ready to return it but it was to complicated to get a fix on a return price.  I found during my trip that the disc's just don't hold enough when you record in the best quality (22 minutes).  A major problem was the camera accidentally turning itself on.  I had the camera around my neck and several times, it turned itself on by rubbing against my chest.  I found that you have to be very careful to record a steady picture especially if you want to zoom in on a subject, a tripod would be very helpful.  The size of the camera is nice but it complicates your life having to use Small disc's and HDD and putting them together for one project.  The Hybrid is a good idea but not so easy to use unless you are a techi so I only give it a two star rating.
Got this camera because of it's size and because it's a Panasonic.  Unfortunately, video quality is not much better than the average webcam.  The screen does not flip 180 degrees contrary to what the picture shows.  There is no cover to protect the lens.  Battery life is only 40 minutes per charge.  To charge the battery, you plug the AC adapter directly into the camera.  No external charger provided.  Recording time on the included 2gb SD card is 27 minutes XP mode and 50 minutes SP mode.  Startup time is advertised as 1.7 seconds, but that's only if you enable quickstart which is basically a standby mode that continues to drain the battery even when you're not filming.  The true cold startup time is more like 3-5 seconds.  E.I.S. (electronic image stabilizer) works okay, but lowers the resolution even more.  Digital zoom is unusable, but the 10x optical zoom is not too bad if you have steady hands.  Focusing is okay in outdoors, but slow indoors.  Low light performance is similar to ISO400 or ISO800 on your average consumer digital camera.  Still, despite all these problems the unit is very small and can fit in your pocket (or purse).  It's perfect for anyone who plans to use it primarily for YouTube videos, etc.,  Extremely easy to transfer video clips to your computer.  Since they're MPEG-2 video files, you can just plug the SD card into your computer's card reader and copy them over.  No conversion necessary.  Files open without problem on Windows Media Player and Windows Movie Maker.  At $400, it's a tough sell (i.e. for about twice as much you could buy the HDC-SD1).  If this camcorder were around $200, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars.
Compre este gadget recientemente y me ha dado ciertas dificultades poder georeferenciar las fotos. El gps es poco sensible y tarda mas de lo esperado en conectarse con los satelites aun en lugares abiertos. Viene con limitadas instrucciones para poder hacer lo que vemos en la propaganda, falta mejorar los manuales y esperararia que SONY lo haga en linea. Puede ser practico para quienes deseen posicionar geograficamente sus fotos, de lo contrario UD desperdiciaria su dinero, hoy tan escazo. Para poder usarlo se lo di a uno de mis alumnos con tiempo para jugar con el y luego de 3 dias de probarlo pudo linkiar adecuadamente las fotos.
The Digital Foci is very easy to use.  I ordered 2 battery so I could keep a spare charged and ready.  One of the batteries was bad so Amazon replaced it at no charge or hassle, but now one of the pins for the CF card docking stations is misaligned.  If one is not careful when inserting the card, the pins can easily be bent.  In all of my camera's and card readers, the pins are recessed deep enough to keep the card aliened while inserting it.  The Foci's pins are placed too shallow in the slot allowing the card to go in at an angle bending the pins.  I am going to Italy and Africa in 08, but am hesitant to take it with me.
I had a similar experience to user IIB "Kula". In fact, I even took mine to Machu Picchu too.The UI is overambitious. It only needs one button in my opinion -- "save my stuff." Instead, they put a "delete my card" function in that has no confirmation, so I accidentally deleted a day worth of photos. I also had one card not copy for some unknown reason. Note I only ever used the unit while plugged into wall power, so it was not a battery problem. Finally, when I got home the unit had turned itself on and was frozen. I ended up disassembling it while it was running so I could unplug the battery, wondering if I was about to destroy two weeks worth of photos. It turned out OK, but was very nerve wracking.It's a good idea, and I want to like it but it has some fatal flaws. If you do end up using one of these, be sure to slide the "read only" lock on your cards before putting them in.
I was very pleased the first time I used it with an SD card, but the second time I tried to insert my CF card and it would not go in...then I saw that one of the contacts in the middle was bent.  So now, the whole reason I bought the device is not possible.  I am NOT a novice and as a professional photographer I am very careful when inserting CF cards. What now?
CAMERA AC ADAPTER FOR CANON POWERSHOT ACK-600 CA-PS400 CA-PS500 A40 A75 A85 A95 A610 A620 A630 & A640 4.3V 2AI purchased this product after reading its description and its ability to charge the battery in the camera.  After receiving the product (it had no instructions enclosed) I contacted Canon and researched whether or not it could do so.  Apparently there is no way for it to recharge the battery, it can only be used as an adapter when you wish to use your camera in close proximity to an outlet (i.e.: loading images to computer or viewing on T.V.)  I am so disappointed that it did not perform as described.
A 45 minute DVD in which presenter Bob Krist explains some of his more favourite settings on the Nikon D200 camera and the way in which he puts them to good effect. This product is more suited to owners of the D200 if only because they will recognise the various camera features which are highlighted as Mr Krist uses them.Whilst the content was interesting, I found it difficult to identify exactly which category of photographer at whom this DVD is aimed. If, like myself, you have just purchased your very first DSLR (Digital single lens reflex camera) and are wondering where to start, I would suggest this is not the DVD for you. If, however, you have started to take some decent photos, it should help you progress onto slightly (but only slightly) more advanced techniques. If you are already well down the road of taking excellent photographs using the many varied settings that are available on the modern DSLR then you will gain little from this product.I really must register my overall disappointment. Just think about the product titles. Firstly we have a DVD from the "Nikon School." I would have thought the very word Nikon would ensure a content worthy of that name. But not so. Secondly, the DVD is called "Understanding Digital Photography." I may be a newcomer to the DSLR but, like Mr Krist, I too have sold my photography to National Geographic and I am also an award-winning author. My understanding of digital photography, however, was not enhanced by this product and my overall knowledge is no richer for my having studied the content closely.NM
This was only worth it because a memory card would cost as much as getting a bunch of stuff like with the kit.The batteries just do not work in the camera that it was linked with. I do like all the extras like mini tripod and flash drive. I'd pay more for rechargeable batteries that work. Batteries are not compatible with the Canon s5.
I had the same problem where the glue inside the case was exposed and stuck to my iphone.  It made case removal difficult and cleaning the iphone a pain.  I would not recommend this product.  I gave is 2 stars because I liked the look of it but the built quality is shoddy.
I guess I should have seen it coming.  In the title it says I'll learn to use the EZCube in less than 20 minutes.Basically, it's a 16 minute infomercial for their products and accessories.  The presenter is dull, not a pro.  Both of these are forgivable given that there are genuinely useful tips as promised, not even specific to the use of the EZCube.  But when, just when it was getting good, the presenter advises you to visit the web site for more advanced tutorials, it's really frustrating.I just feel like I spent twenty bucks to be advertised at.  This is worth getting as a freebie in a kit, not worth buying by itself.
I'm a little disappointed with the cameras and the software.This is a unit made by Swann and the DVR software doesn't work over the web.I noticed that Q-See sold the same PCI adapter card and provided different software, which can be found at :[...]I managed to get the web-viewing working correctly after downloading the one on Q-See's site.Also, the camera's color output is off.  My green palm trees look brown.I did some more research after buying this and decided to swap out one of the critical cameras with a Q-See QAC48030 instead.Q-See QSC48030 High Resolution Weatherproof CCD Camera w/100ft of Night Vision (Color)After doing so, it gave me a better reference to what the proper image should look like.Below is a comparison of the Swann and the Q-See.Here's a shot from the Swann camera during the day:[...]And a shot from the same angle with the Q-See QAC48030[...]Notice the color difference, and the wider angle with the Q-See.Here's the Swann at night, you can see why I'm disappointed with the Swann and happy with the Q-See. The night-vision range is very short, good for about 10 feet, and the camera is about 20 feet from the driveway:[...]Here's the same shot from the Q-See, which is advertised at 100ft:[...]The light in the bottom left is on with both photos, it's just the slightly different position and wider angle of the Q-see that makes it visible.The good thing about this kit was the 4 100ft cables that were included.  They were the right length to reach all parts of my house.  The 60ft cable included with the Q-See was a bit too short.Also, one of the power adapters for one of the cameras was bad and didn't output the right voltage.  This caused the vision from one of the cameras to be really bad, but fortunately, I had another 9V adapter with the same fitting laying around.The cameras are decent enough if you don't need to see long distances, and don't need to care about color clarity, like in the case of the camera for the front door, but I can't really give a strong recommendation.To sum up-Pros:- Comes with everything you need- PCI Capture card works well, if you use the right software- Cables are the right length- Cameras are decent for short distancesCons:- Poor color quality- Poor night distance
I bought this burner so I could archive my videos from my Canon HF100. It does perform that function, but the drawbacks of this unit cause me nothing  but frustration every time I use it.First of all, it's very large. I bought an external CD burner in 2000 that was smaller than this unit. It would be nice if this were small enough to consider taking on a vacation, but its large size makes that impractical. So if you have an HF100 or HF10, make sure you buy lots of SD cards to bring with you.Also, as others have noted, there is no option to burn standard-def DVDs from a high-def camera using this unit, so if your friends and family are among the vast majority of consumers who do not own a Blu-Ray players, they're just out of luck.A bigger problem is the very poor user interface between this and the HF100 camera. When this is plugged into the camera, it is impossible to do anything with the camera except burn a disc; you cannot access any of the camera's other functions or menus.For instance, there is an option in the camera to burn all the files on the card, only the unburned files, or only the files in the playlist.If you plug this dvd burner in, and then realize that the camera is in the wrong mode, you have to unplug the burner, navigate an awkward menu system, change the option, and then plug the camera back in.Or, if you create a playlist, plug the camera in, and then discover that you want to remove or add videos to the playlist, again, you have to unplug the burner, make the changes you want to make, and then plug the burner in again.This is all extremely awkward, and the camera takes several seconds to switch between modes every time you plug in the burner or unplug it, so the entire process is extremely frustrating.Unfortunately, owners of the HF100 camera (or other cameras in the same series) are more or less a captive audience for this burner, since the camera does not come with any software that allows you to burn the AVCHD files to a playable disc, so for most people, this will be their only option for archiving and playing back their videos.
I bought the Canon DVD burner before I realized that I didn't need it.  I finally got the software package that comes with the Canon HD camera working in my computer.  Also the DVD burner does not burn DVDs for video shot on the highest definitions (MXP mode). You have to use the software package for that. Plus you need the DVD burner to play the burned discs if you want to play them on anything but a blue ray type player or AVCHD type player, which I do not have.  In short, I haven't used the DVD burner that I purchased but I'm keeping it as a backup as computers fail frequently due to viruses, even with the best anti-virus software out there.  EXTRA NOTE:  the software package when installed with Vista shows a driver error message that can be ignored.  Also I was using the wrong type DVD's.  You need to use DVD-R not +R with the software package.  Hope this helps.
The DW-100 confirms my belief that Canon engineers do not think through the range of applications consumers would have for their products. As has been stated, it does not not record discs that can be played on SD players. Major Gaffe! You also cannot burn DVDs from files on your PC or use it to play DVDs to watch on your PC. Wouldn't it be natural to think that some consumers might want to use it as an external DVD drive? (particularly if their own computer's internal DVD drive has just died as mine has?) A Canon inkjet printer I bought many years ago gave me similar grief. I should have remembered and stayed away from Canon!
false advertising by canon. I have an canon hd camcorder adn can burn hd disc on the canon dw-100 burner, but they can only be played back on the burner but not directly to your tv. they have to be played back through the camcorder. Canons web site decribes this unit as making dvd's that can be played back on  regular dvd players. This only works if your cam corder is a standard def type, not HD type. If canon had fully described there burner I would not have wasted my money.
When pausing the video, the recording is static and fuzzy similiar to cable in a storm.  I don't care for the recorded copy on playback. It is a handy tool, but the quality of the recording is not the best.
I was immediately surprised how poor and grainy the picture quality was, especially when shooting indoors.  I have previously owned a sony MiniDV recorder, which I thought did a better job recording onto digital tape.  I am surprised other people are saying the picture quality is good.Be warned, there are hidden costs with owning this camcorder, such as:1.  need to buy sony pro duo memory stick (plus adapter in my case)2.  need to buy extra battery (unless you record for less than 50 min)3.  cost of mini-DVD's (sony + brand = not cheap)4.  need to buy a camera case.Pros:-multiple recording methods-compact size-sony quality-easy of use-remote controlCons:-poor picture quality, especially indoors-hidden costs of extra battery, discs and memory stick.-memory stick difficult to take out of camera-no camera case-manual switch for lens cover, instead of fully automatic-poor image stabilizationI realize this is Sony's budget camcorder, and that I probably should be buying a high definition recorder.  However, for the amount of money I spent, I was expecting something a lot better.  I would not recommend this product.
We bought the video camera so we could bring a light weight camera on a trip to Europe. We will not be bringing it. View screen too small and you can't see any of the touch screen functions you need press if there is any sun at all. Photos are very grainy. We were disappointed. The only positive is that it is light weight.
While the product was inexpensive I am not happy with the fact that I have to tape down the battery to make sure that it stays in place while charging. The charger works well and is very portable. The battery provides enough use between charges. Again, the only negative is the battery will not stay in place within the charger unless taped down.
The charger itself does not seem to be bad, except that it could be smaller. However, the battery has a slippery plastic wrapping that prevents it from staying in the charger - I have to put a rubber band around it to hold the battery. A quick and simple test at the factory would have revealed that problem. It's cheap, but quality is disappointing.
Low quality feel.  Battery does NOT fit into charger(original battery, nor the included battery).  Fail!
The package had been opened and resealed. The spare fuse was missing. The product did work so I did not return it.I would have liked to have known the status of the product and packaging prior to purchase.SIMA International SIP5USB Travel Adapter with USB Charger and Surge Protector
The camera and software was clearly not created in the USofA... the manual is insanely hard to understand, even for a techie.  Almost impossible to read.  The set up is laborious, and when all is said and done, the picture quality is very poor.I was not able to get the motion detection function to work when the camera was in IP mode.They have a LONG way to go to make this a viable consumner product.
This product is great and it works really well, however has some major flaws. I bought this product to use on a five week stay in Europe, less than 3 weeks into my trip (and from my date of purchase) I'm stuck with a broken GPS unit. This was stored on my D300 in proper camera bags its entire life and still broke. The 90 degree elbow where the chord plugs into the camera split in two, why would they not use metal?If you plan on using this sparsely or are willing to absolute baby it then go for it, but otherwise I'd just spend the money and get a Solemeta N2 or something else.
This little device worked great on a trip to Africa until it broke.  The 90 degree connection to the camera is exposed and fragile.  I don't know how it broke but now the LEDs will flash for a while and then stop, like an intermittent connection.  GPS connection is never locked.I don't recommend this model.  I am trying something else more rugged and reliable.
Seems like a great deal for $80 (saw it is $130 now) compared to the $200 Nikon model. Ergonomics are not great - when it's on your hot shoe it either bangs you in the head or stops the flash from opening, and the cable is too long. Attaching it to the camera strap isn't great either. Didn't have a problem with battery life. and accuracy is very good.The problem is, on my first multi-day trip, 3 weeks after I got it, it stopped working. Seems like some contacts in the cable broke - it will power on if I jiggle it, but is not usable since it won't stay on. Cable quality is very poor. Just like several other reviewers, contacting support didn't help - other than an auto-reply acknowledging my request I never got a response. Threatening to return the item and writing a bad review didn't help either...  luckily I am within my 30 day return window with Amazon, so I will return it for a replacement. Why replacement? Well, I need a GPS on some trips and this is still the cheapest. I will just be very gentle and selective when I am using it and hopefully it will last longer this time...Update - April 2010I got my replacement from amazon and it still works. I am being gentle with it, trying to always disconnect it before putting the camera back in the bag. this is slow, and also means it takes more time to re-acquire signal when I am ready to shoot, but still better than nothing.BTW I found out I did get responses from support, but they went to my junk mail folder.Update - April 2012It still works but I haven't been using it much - I bought the Nikon GP-1 and the geometr is now on my backup body. The rubber cover fell off the on/off button and the busson is now exposed. I also imagine whatever water resistance it might have had before is now gone.****  I saw that new versions sold have a Y-cable to allow combined use of the GPS and a cable release - something the nikon unit allows (although you have to get D90 style cable release to plug into the GP-1, my 10-pin ones will not work). So I started searching for that cable and as of now it is very hard to find! I finally found one made by a company called solmenta and it can be ordered from their web site, pay with paypal and shipped from Hong Kong. I took a chance and ordered one, $37 after shipping. It works - I can now have the geometr GPS and one of my 10-pin cable releases connect at the same time. Another benefit of the Y cable is that now the connector right angle points up and not sideways. I can leave it connected to the camera and place it in my bag without worrying about putting stress on the connector. with just the GPS, I had to disconnect it every time it goes back to the bag.
As tech manager for our paranormal group, we were in need of a GOOD IR Illuminator so we could better use our mini-DVD. The item is not heavy, but it is a little bulky. We tested it on arrival, and because our mini-DVD is CMOS the camera was able to record in total darkness, but barely. For an illuminator if this stated range, in a small room it should have been more than enough for the mini-DVD even though it was a CMOS camera. But it did work, so we mounted it on a small piece of black wood to use as a stand. A few months later we were on our first investigaton after purchasing the unit. I was setting the immuminator and camera up and had just plugged the illuminator in, and was checking for the slight red glow when I hear a pop and sizzling noise as the odor of burning electronics filled the air. We quick pulled the unit and tossed it outside. The entire power module cooked inside. If that would have happened 10 minutes later when our teams were off investigating it could have burned that clients house down. It is now somewhere in our landfill having been used ZERO times. AVOID!
The IR50 lights up a small area, but doesn't come close to the full 150ft.  The IR's are red at night, I've installed several IR illuminators and have never seen one that gives off a red light before.  Makes it kind of hard to be in conspicuous when your trying to catch someone in the act of a crime.
I ordered what i expected to be OEM parts for my Kodak camera and all i got was a bunch of double a batteries and two wall chargers. I was looking for the power cord so i could charge the batteries that were inside the camera. I will take the blam for not researching the product better. Mike
Seller was extremely good about initial replacement then refund but the product itself (x 2) is profoundly garbage.  I would definitely look elsewhere for a more reliable and well-build product.
Tried to play mp3's off my USB drive, it would only read about 10% of the songs (150 of 1100 songs). I tried reformatting and putting new songs on my usb drive. Still bad. Tried a different USB drive. Same thing. So I returned it back to Amazon. I had an identical GPX stereo like this one that works just fine."
can't really say much about the device. i ordered it so i could play and charge my ipod at the same time with the USB port. But the USB will only work for a flash drive that already was songs on it. I returned the player without trying all the other functions
Manual would have been enough. Nothing here that can't be figured out by reading the standard manual. Didn't need to get this.
After purchasing this set and reading all of the glowing reviews I am very disappointed in the color consistency of these strobes. Upon receipt I ran a test and discovered that the strobes fluctuated from around 6100 K at full power to around 5500K at low power, exact numbers were:Head A -10-6160K9-5950K8-5790K7-5700K6-5700K5-5600K4-5490KHead B -10-6080K9-5940K8-5770K7-5750K6-5740K5-5620K4-5540KI sent the heads in for repair, thinking perhaps I had received a bad set and was told by repair that much color variance, 600 K, is within specs. I was told that with the B1 strobes are more consistent in normal mode, and the allowable fluctuation is 150 K from full to low power. So I suppose the D1s are nice strobes but be sure to bring your color meter and gels if color accuracy is much of a concern. I haven't had them long enough to know how they will hold up.
I read several reveiws about this product.  I have the first 2 dvds covering the 60D (basic and advance topics)  I really liked those.  Actually a lot of the speedlite video is in the advance topics.  I thought this video would cover how to use your sppelite.  I maybe talks about the speelite for 10 mins or so.  It goes into a lot of theroy about how it was developed (blah blah blah).  Also the newer canon have wireless flash aviaible.  In the video they connet the flash to a hot shoe cord.  They also say they have to do this,  for what ever reason I don't know.  There is actually better "how to's" on you tube.  Search for canon speedlite and your model number of flash.
Wow, is this video confusing for a new photographer!  I thought I was going to learn how to use the speedlite step by step.... no deal, instead, we get a entertaining lecture on studio photography focused on high end equipment.  The video jumps all over the place in terms of topics.  Well produced and edited, it leaves a lot to be desired for a learning tool for newer photographers.
My experience with the Power Max Pro was not nearly as pleasant as the other reviewer here.  In particular, the GSM functionality left something to be desired -- I could receive phone and text messages from it, but I could not call in or text commands.  The unit never "answered" incoming calls or requests.  There were also other problems with the GSM, or perhaps the documentation was incorrect.  If you search other review web sites, you'll see that others have had problems with the GSM, both the old version and the new "built in" one.Note that I did not buy this unit from Amazon, so they are completely in the clear here.  The place I did buy it from is a well known CA company who does not stand behind the product, further adding to my frustration.
Generally, it's a disappointing instructional video. Much of the time we see the close-up shot of a host who speaks quite fast and in a flat manner, showing he doesn't understand the subject he is reading about off camera. No pauses to stress the importance of some information, it's really confusing and the information is even better explained in Canon's Instruction Manual. There is only one section where a professional photo technician talks knowledgeably about color and printing, making the subject very understandable, and he is the responsible for the two stars I gave to this video.Almost all topics included in this video are not "advanced" at all. But, even though, you could've made a better product by including professional photographers as instructors. Not readers.
This is just a cheap little throw away camera for a not so throw away price. I wish I had picked better.
this is supposed to be out door remote station it is not when inquired why they say they don't make one however they advertise it still as outdoor rated bad deal. it does work good though
I typed in firewire to DV cord and it took me to the page with this cord on it I do not have a DV plug on my laptop so the cord was wrong . . I found a PCMICA card with 1 firewire and 2 USB ports and it came with a cord to fit my camera and it works . .
I lost my camera's charger and although I knew it was "around" I couldn't find it quickly enough. I did not want to pay thirty dollars for an auxiliary charger that would be forgotten once I found the main one. I ordered this because it was a great value. It came, it has a car adapter accessory included. Everything great until the battery hook up part. It doesn't fit my S52 battery. Almost. But almost doesn't charge it.
Trying to find and purchase a second battery for this camera has been a nightmare. I can't even find information about it in the owner's manual (and I've never seen a battery not have a type number). I don't know why HP would go to a hard to find (and much more expensive) battery type when the AA batteries were perfect and could be purchased anywhere. I sometimes take long walks and several photos and I cannot afford to have my camera go dead when doing so. In addition, the very large (12) megapixel size means that some photo editing software no longer works (Such as Microsoft photo editor) - my previous camera was 5.3 MP and took excellent photos. 12 MP just seems to be an overkill.
This mounts well to any round surface..However, the plastic construction makes it vibrate terribly.The suction mount is much better.
Tried to use this for a picture wedding guest book, but after we finally figured out to work it, the pictures printed out so slow that it was not worth it! The printer still needs to be plugged in, making it less mobile than desired, and you have to have a Polaroid Camera, which, let's face it, their digital cameras are subparr. So I say get a regular printer and use it, over this one.
First the good news.I was able to set this system up and start watching videos in less than 30 minutes.  (15 of those minutes was spent running to radio Shack to buy a HDMI cable.)The video quality and sound were outstanding.Now the bad.The receiver cannot be more then 7 feet from USB fob. If you are using a laptop, in the same room, you will be beyond pleased at the results.  If your desk top is in another room, forget it.As other reviewers have stated, why on earth would a company make such a low powered system?  Additionally, the cost for the,not included, HDMI cable is outrageous.  And, if you need to share a single HDMI slot you'll need an HDMI splitter.  The splitter and two cables cost almost as much as the device that won't work from my desktop.It's going back
I was looking forward to Flip TV because I own Flip Camera for about a year now.  Wouldn't it be great not having my laptop connectedto TV via HDMI cable every time I wanted to watch a video from my laptop on my HD capable LG 50" TV.  So I got this product, installed it it took several hours moving the laptop close to Flip TV, plugging unplugging cables etc.  So finally after software upgrade the blue light behind the Flip TV is finally on and I was able to "see" my videos in Flip Share.  But what if you want to import videos other than made by Flip Camera?  Yes, the feature is there but for some reason it can't import certain videos with different speed etc, strange?  Kind of hassle why the limitation? I wanted a feature where I can just play any video from my laptop on my FlipTV. You have the share function there. Why not give share access to desktop?  I guess it's too much to ask.  Just like the Flip Camera is a nice little camera but don't take any videos if lighting is not perfect otherwise your picture quality is not good.  Oh yes, don't import your still pictures, they look awful!  I think you can view the same pictures much better, using WII console than what I saw on Flip TV.  Very disappointing.  Not ready for prime time yet!!!!!
Too little bang for the buck. It turned a few heads while I was using it, but most of what this camera does, I can do with my iPhone, and I don't have the hassle of getting the pics and video off the SD card.Nifty gadget, but I rarely use it anymore.
I had previously purchased two of the predecessors to this new camera, the Zonet ZVC7610 and found both the cameras, and the interface software they used, comparable to more expensive brands of IP cameras. In fact, comparing the older model to another *****net branded IP cam, I found the physical camera to be nearly identical. Only the color of the plastic injected into the mold and a couple of cosmetic exterior pieces differed. The hardware contained within was the same but at a lower price than the competing brand. The interface software was a little "clunkier" than the other brand, but all the same functions were there.This new model, the ZVC7611, is a step backward in my opinion. This new model camera has actually gotten almost an inch taller and half-inch wider. The camera feels very light weight (as though the case was nearly empty) and while this new model is black (the older model was bright blue) it still retains the giant cartoon-font logo right on the front of the camera. The camera can no longer rest on its base since the cables now connect on the bottom instead of the back necessitating the use of their included stand, but the stand itself is flimsier than the one included with the older model making me hesitate to trust it.The biggest drawback is the new interface that Zonet has chosen to use with this new camera line. Firstly, this is geared for use almost exclusively with Internet Explorer and requires you install additional active-x support software. This software forces Vista (and probably Windows7) out of the Aero interface due to a "change in the Windows color scheme" while you are viewing the video. Other browsers will not be able to display video within the interface. You CAN access enough of the screens to do basic configuration of the camera (set IP address, NTP servers, etc), but will need to use one of their two "special" URLs to view video or a still photo on other platforms or browsers. Even in IE, the interface is clumsy, ugly, and lacks several features present in other brands base models (granted, usually at a higher price). Things like:* Scheduled FTP/Email of still photos* Scheduled operation of motion detection* Scheduled reboot of the cameraMotion detection is full-screen only (not definable detection areas) so I found it doesn't work well in applications like pointing it at a door across the room with a window next to it. If the wind blows the tree outside viewable through the window, the motion detection is triggered. On other cameras you can set the detection area to watch just a portion of the viewable area so I could detect things like the door opening without changes through the window having an effect. I tried adjusting the sensitivity of the motion detection, but then it occasionally misses the door opening (depending on how bright it is outside when the door is opened).The interface included with the previous model (ZVC7610) allowed in-browser viewing both in other browsers (like Firefox) and on other platforms (like Mac OSX using Safari). With this new model, you can still VIEW both streaming video and still photos on these other platforms and browsers, but you will need to use their special URLs to see them: CAM.IP.ADDRESS/snapshot.cgi (for video stream) and CAM.IP.ADDRESS/snapshot.jpg (for a still photo). You will be seeing just the raw photo or raw streaming video. Adjustment of the video settings can still be performed on other platforms or browsers by blindly adjusting the numbers in the interface, then reloading the raw steam to see your changes, but setting up this camera via a platform or browser other than Windows/IE, is a bit of a pain.This camera does display video or still photos and the price is certainly tempting, but the trade off is a seemingly less-solid camera, using an inferior software interface that limits both the browsers and platforms you can easily view video/images on. For a new model, this certainly feels like a step in the wrong direction for Zonet. Perhaps a firmware update in the future will address some/all of these issues, but until then, you will probably want to be using the Windows OS, and the IE browser to make good use of this camera. Users of other operating systems or browsers will want to look elsewhere.
the charger is good when i charge the old battery  , but the batteries are not good they swelled when i charge them .
I bought 2 of them and they don't hold a charge and I can't figure out why it won't charge.  I WILL NOT purchase this product again.
The product description is incorrect. The brand is HVG2 not Mgear. Mgear battery is 2,800mAH while HVG2 is 700mAH, so if you are looking for a 2,800mAH battery, do not get this product. I contacted the seller asking for replacement, but they said HVG2 is the only one they carry and they would accept return. I didn't want to pay for return shipping, so I decided to keep it. I will use it and update this review if it actually works good.
This is the 2nd one of these I've ordered (not from the same vendor). Both times the 1st one didn't work properly but was replaced with a perfectly working one with absolutely no hassles. I like this particular model better - it uses a mini USB plug on the Balance Board end (not like it is pictured) and this makes for a more useful cable if perchance this one fails. I also like that the like changes from red to blue when the unit is charged (my previous one did not do that).Not sure how long this one will last but the previous one died after a year of use (not constant, mostly Wii Fit usage).Update: July 28, 2013.Well, this one died after two months of limited use. Light comes on but no charge. No problem with vendor but the product is not worth the trouble.
many were now exactly what was expected in quality and modern technologically advanced, such as the lens and the fry daddy did not have a built in strainer like my former and the top is plastic not glass.
It's a convenient camera. It talks to you, which gets to be annoying, but you can shut that feature off. Problems: Pretty low res, blurry & most pics are unusable (compared to a nicer camera). Also, it has a pretty long delay from hitting the shutter button to the picture actually clicking. I've been using the camera for a year now, and I wouldn't recommend it if you want pictures that can be reproduced, say for printing.
I bought this camera searching for a cheap digital camera buy. After using this camera a few times i realized that the camera would not hold a charge for more than 4-6 hours whether it was on or not. This was probably just a battery malfunction but i wasn't about to try that camera again. It was disappointing to have a camera with me when it would never work. The camera took pictures well but the controls were sometimes difficult to work with. I returned it and ordered a Nikon Coolpix S3000 instead because Nikon is much more reliable. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
Ordered these on-line because they were not readily available elsewhere.  They arrived and the two I ordered did not work at all.  Waste of money.  They were for a small camera purchased at Aldi's made in Germany.  Great camera, bad batteries.
At first I was happy with the product. It did what it was supposed to do.But now after having used it extensively for about 3 months the latch broke! It was the actual little hook of the latch that secures the closing/locking that broke off!! :( probably due to metal-fatigue .But 3 months?? Not happy here! :( Yes I did use it often with my Canon 1DX and the 200mm F2.0. I'll see if I can contact the manufacturer and will give you an update later.
The stickers are decent enough I guess, but the product title needs to be clarified.This is not one Defender sign and four small stickers... this is one large sticker with four smaller stickers. There's no actual sign.
The sign is great but the package was missing the stickers that are sold with the package.  Not worth the hassle but wouldn't recommend based on missing items in package.
This little coke can flash drive is the most adorable thing, especially if you're a loyal coke fan like me, but that's about all it has going for it.I bought this for a reasonable price, shipping was free, it came quick and all with the purchasing was fine, however the item itself was not. I went to the beach the day after I got this and I hooked in on my keys. About lunchtime that day I realized the usb was no longer attached to my keys. It was just the can part that was no longer attached. I looked everywhere and was unable to find it. I came back and a few days later I heard something make a little crash when I was in class... the top of the usb had also fallen off my keychain and broke and I only had the thing for a week and only used it once!I love the way it looks, but I wish the key ring was a little larger so that it would be properly secure on a keychain and I wouldn't have lost the bottom half or broken the top.
I wrote the 2nd paragraph of this review after exchanging emails with DB Roth. I thought to myself what a great company they are,- really on the ball. Well I was wrong for as good as "Cristina" seems to be is how bad in the other direction the shipping department is! The product is titled "Deluxe Neoprene Black wide Neck Strap for the KODAK EASYSHARE Z981 Digital Camera. Christina issused a return authorization farely quickly. And I returned the wrong product the same day I rec'd the authorization.  Today I received a neck strap for a small digital camera , using one lug. The label again does not denote what the strap is for, so theobvious conclusion is that the strap is for all cameras of light weight with a standard size strap attachment.  Now note: this is Friday and DBROTH closes at 1pm Eastern time, so my email sent at 3pm west coast time will not be read until Monday again just like the first time this order got messed up. Well my patience has  run out, I asked for credit to my credit card and if it is not issued and recordered by the credit company in five days, I am going to contest the purchase and ask for a charge back credit to my credit card account. I just can;t understand a company doing this, surely by now they have expended any profit they would have made on the product.Now wouldn't it have been nice if I was able to leave this bottom paragraph as it was?If source is any indication-then buy! I have not recieved this item yet--But I have high hopes for it. Due to a snafu with the shipping, I received a standard strap with a 3/8 width rather than the 1/4 width that the Kodak Z980/Z981 uses. I got my package on Friday afternoon. I imediately tried to call DB Roth. But they close at 1pm eastern time and I am on the west coast. I sent an email outling the problem.  A "Cristina" answered my email.  Well, I couldn't be more impressed with their service! Today is Wednesday 3 days after DB Roth opened on Monday, and the wrong size product has been returned, Cristina just called me, indicating their reciept of the wrong size strap and telling me the right size strap was being shipped to me right away. All I can say is "Cristina" if you have any sale flyers or specials, put me on your mailing list, PLEASE!
How annoying that such a nice piece of hardware is dragged down by lazy programming.Bright screen, narrow black frame (why do so many frames have wide, wide borders?), good viewing angle, low power consumption (I measured 10 watts) with an on-off time of day feature, and a great value.And then the lazy programmers did everything they could to drag it down.For my slide show, 5 seconds is too fast.  The next choice up is 15 seconds - way, way too slow.  Not even a 10 second choice.  And how hard would it have been to allow counting up by one second?The choice of transitions is terrible: None, fade, wipes from each side, expands (don't try this one if you get motion sickness), and a couple other ugly ones.  Fade would be fine if it were smooth, but it happens in five distracting wipes from top to bottom.Even more frustrating, the "shuffle" option contains a couple of curl and peel transitions and a vertical blinds effect that are pretty nice.  But they're not in the menu.Tack that onto the ability to fry the memory by disconnecting it from the USB port without dismounting, and the need for a graduate computer science degree to get a video to play.Other reviews discuss the software's many other shortcomings, so I won't go on.Bottom line, if you just want a nice, bright, inexpensive frame to run your photos and you're not fussy about details, this should be your pick.If you want it to run nice and look the way you want, look elsewhere.
i ended up buying 2 each of the impecca, nix, and viewsonic 15 inch digital photo frames.  they all got returned except for the last viewsonic frame, which seems to work (at least for the past 3-4 days).the first impecca frame didn't work right out of the box so i sent it back and reordered another one.  the second impecca worked for a week and then quit working altogether so i sent it back and gave up on the impecca.  when the impecca did work, the dark colors were really dark and pretty much looked black which was not very pleasing.  as far as looks go, i didn't like the wide black molding on the frame.  it's really ugly and seemed to dwarf the picture part of the frame.  the remote was pretty intuitive and responded well.  i don't know if this has the auto-rotate function, but i didn't not notice any sideways pictures.  the order wasn't really random as it played the same "random" order each time the power switch was turned on.next i tried the nix but the first one did not have any internal memory so i sent it back and ordered another.  the second one wouldn't read my 16gb sdhc card, so i returned the frame and gave up on the nix.  when viewing photos from the internal memory, the pictures were very clear and bright.  the picture quality was much better than the impecca's.  as far as the looks, i liked the thin black border around the frame much better than the impecca's as well.  the remote on this one seemed pretty limited as i found it difficult to navigate the menus.next i tried the viewsonic but the remote didn't work on the first one and i found it hard to control by the buttons on the back.  i returned it and got a second one which has been working for the past 3-4 days.  when i put my sdhc card in the second viewsonic, it would show the first picture but nothing elss.  after it got hung on the first picture, the remote was useless and i had to turn it off with the power button.  i erased my memory card and reloaded the pictures and it seems to work in slideshow mode now.  the picture quality is not as sharp and vibrant as the nix's (yes, i tried adjusting the brightness and contrast) but i guess it will have to do since i already tried every other 15" digital photo frame that amazon sells.  this frame has a 1" mat and a 1.75" molding which serves to make the picture part seem smaller than it really is.  however, since there are contrasting colors, it's pretty tasteful, unlike the hideous impecca.  the remote on this one is also limited and hard to use.  this frame definitely does not have the auto-rotate function.  the random shuffle works pretty well on this.  at least it starts on a different picture each time the power button is turned on.  overall, the viewsonic frame is not great, but at least it works (at least for the first 3-4 days).  i just hope that if it's going to break down, that it at least does that within amazon's return window.amazon has been great about taking back the unusable items and refunding my money.UPDATE:  viewsonic broke after 34 days (black screen, doesn't respond to remote control).  amazon was nice enough to take it back after the 30 day return deadline.  i do not recommend any of these frames.
Do not buy this product because it does not work. It does not recognize the internal memory and not readthe memory cards.
Things that do not work for me.The NIX X15A sometimes does not respond to the remote control.  It would not open anything on my computer through the cable connection. It knew it was hooked up to a PC but would not open anything. It does not play MP4 videos.Other than that...
I've got three digital picture frames - a Sony 10 in, an HP 10 in, and the NIX 15 in.  The NIX is big and was considerably cheaper than the other two.  The NIX gives you a big picture that can be seen from a distance which is an advantage.  Unfortunately, the color rendition provided by the NIX is not even close to what you get with the Sony and the HP units.  I kept the NIX - it's ok.  But I won't buy another one.
If you want a big picture frame that can view photos as well as video, this is a pretty good buy.  The screen has above average color range and depth (the colors stand out but do not bleed, but black is not completely dark).However, to get the video to work is extremely frustrating and difficult.  The documentation on the website for video conversion is completely WRONG.  Go to the FAQ to see the correct way to do it.  They rely on third party converters to play video (into a format that is uncommon).Customer service never gets back to you for help.  I tried contacting them three times and have never heard back from them.The rating is lowered by how hard it is to convert video and the lack of customer service.
quality of screen resolution is poor.when you close and open you need to  restart the unitnot a good idea
i guess you get what you pay for. went to use it as soon as it came in and ended up bending it. tried to fix and it snapped off.
Bought this for our 2 week vacation to Hawaii, hoping to get some cool snorkeling shots and panoramas of our family. Day 1 it went into the ocean and the locking/screw mechanism didn't work at all. GoPro would be completely loose within 10 seconds of being in the water. Leash broke within 5-7 times of going over a wrist clumsily, but no big deal. Day 2 it went for a kayak ride and hike (didn't get wet). Rust made the ball bearing stiff, and then the whole top plastic plate snapped while hiking. Big deal. No longer works.It's cool that it telescopes out, which is why I give it 2 stars. If you plan on not using a GoPro for what it's for, don't buy it for a GoPro. Just buck up and getting a better quality one. I regret buying this.
This is not made to hold a camera when you are moving in a sport such as skiing or snowboarding. First, the head rotates and does not stay. Second, as soon as you extend it, the rod starts to rotate around its axis. And, it is too light and unstable to hold while moving fast.The manufacture should made it clear it is only for standstill self shooting.
not too happy as the top of the pole does not lock so your camera flip flops around. Should return it, but I used it once.
Pros:-size-simple design-easy to useCons:-unstable in extended or contracted mode. Too much play in telescopic shaft-inability to lock the ball joint-inability to lock telescopic shaft to prevent camera from spinning or flopping over.-must be standing relatively still to prevent camera from shaking or flopping over.Conclusion:I would not recommend this to the majority of folks. There are too many other options that have a better design and quality and would be much for versatile than this one, for just a little bit more money. The cons of this product limit the uses too much.
The product arrived quickly and well packaged and I was excited to try the monopod.  However, the camera mount can NOT be locked in place.  As a result, the small digital camera that I use just flops over - it won't stay in any position other than at a 90 degree angle.  Very disappointing!!!  The cost of the product was fairly minimal so the shipping costs to receive the product was about half the price of the product and it will be another half the price to ship it back to the seller...this means I'm paying twice the original cost in shipping charges!  So I'll just keep it and try to hand-hold the camera mount in place - or maybe I'll 'super-glue' it in the position I plan to use most.T-200L: Extendable telescopic handheld Self Portrait Monopod / Extender for Digital Camera
Battery fits way too snug in this product. You practically have to get it out with the jaws of life. The first time I used it a piece of the charger popped off that was not suppose to when I was trying to get the battery out. The car, household, and Euro attachment are a nice convenience for travel. I still use it and it does charge the battery but be warmed about the snug fit.
Based on the reviews, I got this charger after losing the one that came with my T2i.  It worked well for the first week or so, then it stopped charging my batteries.  I'd plug in a dead battery, and it would show the green light, indicating a full charge.  Blowing on the contact, or popping the battery in and out a few times would sometimes fix the issue, and I kept doing that for about three months.  Yesterday, while removing the charger from the wall, one of the plug heads came off in the socket, requiring me to get the pliers and pull it out.  I think I'll spend the extra money and get the official (Canon) charger, since I know that one works well and is of higher quality.
The charger seemed to be of very poor quality and the battery contact points didn't make contact on some of the lp-e8 batteries I tried to charge.  I eventually bent the contacts and got them to work for the time being, but I wouldn't recommend this product
East Coast Photo advertises these will communicate with the Canon Vixia Camera, they don't. Same as the Wasabi's yes they are cheap and you get what you pay for.Knowing exactly when the battery is going to die is a huge benefit when video taping an event, guess that is why Canon gouges you for additional batteries.
The product works and charges like it needs to. but after sometime the unit stopped taking a charge and refused to turn the camera on.
When my son (9) first opened this camera, we were both disappointed.  It felt like something you would get from a cereal box. In the end it will suffice as a toy, but not as a functional camera.Pros: inexpensive, pictures taken outside in daylight are okayCons: no flash, cannot add memory card, flimsy, awkward controls, only holds about 10 picturesSummary: okay as a toy, entirely inadequate as a camera
When I purchased this item, the description and picture was that of a &#34;LARGE&#34; Voodoo Tactical MOLLE Compatible Deployment Bag. Well, this item was the size of a fanny pack, I kid you not. I was disgusted that I had been dupped into paying such a large price for this item. Fortunately, the seller resolved the issue with me. Read the dimensions of this item thoroughly before purchasing.
This could be an issue with the camera itself, but this actually works maybe 40% of the time I try to use it. Nikon D3100.
I am a solo traveler and have used this remote shutter since 2011.  I used to use it with Panasonic Lumix.  After I purchased a Nikon D5200 this year, I ordered this shutter in April.  At the first few months, it works fine and well.  I love this product and even recommended to others.  However, in July that was the sixth trip after purchased this product, it does not work well at total.  It can take picture when you first time connect it to the D5200.  After taken the first picture, it could focus when you press the button but cannot process further take the shoot.I have two sets of this shutter, one for the Lumix and the other for the D5200.  I try to switch the shutter set and also get the same result.  I will not recommend to use it with D5200.
this unit only worked for a short time and then i push the button and nothing i take long exposure astro pick it's essential that  i have a good wireless remote to do this and this unit failed
I'm still finding the time for this when to open it. I will comeback to this and rate it. Sure.
Unboxing and installation of the GoPro on the smoothee was a snap.  I was very excited to start using this product as I had ready many good reviews about it before I purchased one myself.As I began to use it, the unit requires some adjustment for balance.  I followed the directions and also researched video guidance from the manufacturer website and YouTube.Unfortunately after 3 weeks of using the smothee daily, I could never get the unit to stay balanced and aligned.  The unit would constantly drift left or right and would take much more than &#34;light pressure&#34; as was suggested in the video to keep the unit aimed in the correct direction for what I was filming.I do very much appreciate the return process with Amazon however.  I returned the product in it's original package with the RMA and had received a full refund within 7 days with absolutely no hassle.  That was a nice conclusion to an otherwise frustrating experience with the product itself.
I was disappointed that I could not use the same mounting adapter with the Smoothee that I use with my tripods. I just plan on taking video of homes and needed a stabilizer that would take care of the jerky movement when walking. I hope I don't have to buy the GoPro camera because I love my current camera.
External use with wind factors impacted stability. External use was imperative for use. Requirement of finger/hand techniques caused users to extensive train with minimal success. Returned the product
The armband is not water resistant as described, after my first workout the sweat entered the back of the case. Left the back of the phone with moisture.
The face of the arm band was not clear, it had a haze to it.  It seemed to be a lower level of quality than I expected.  It looked used.
This product works.  It keeps my iPhone 4 dry while I run.  However, the clear screen is cloudy.  Make it difficult to see what is on the screen if I want to change songs while running.  It does the basic job of holding my iPhone and keeping it dry.  The price was much less than Target or Best Buy.  I can't complain.  I got what I paid for.
This might be useful in certain situations but it is a lot smaller than I thought it would. It's like a retail store discount key fob. Not worth going to trouble to return. Besides, my cameras do white balance with true white. This is more 18% or less gray.
I bought this for the pistol grip function for use with a small camcorder. The pivot point connecting the grip with the camera mount is way too loose. As a result the camera wobbles about at the slightest of hand movements.  As a small table mount tripod, the unit functions well when using the self timer function or cable release.
While the folding nature of this combo handgrip/tabletop tripod is pretty cool, the center pivoting mechanism that holds the plate for the camera is simply a plastic ring sandwiched between the plastic outer shells and, at least on the unit I received, this is not a tight fit (and there's no way to tighten it -- it's a press-fit between plastic parts).  This literally allows for 1/16" to 1/8" play side to side... this sideways tendency to wiggle/tip occurs when configured as either handgrip or t/t tripod.For me at least, this makes the product unusable for still photography cameras -- large or small -- since the action of handling the camera and of pressing the shutter will cause the camera to tilt.  Only way I could even imagine using this successfully to stabilize the camera would be if you were to use it on a tabletop, just let the camera flop slightly to whatever side it tended towards, and use a wireless remote to trigger the shutter... so you wouldn't be touching the camera during the exposure.What you might think is a precision metal hinge in the center, is actually a silver colored piece of plastic -- just a pair of squeeze-buttons on each side, to disengage the ratchet associated with pivoting the camera platform.I expect that most of the more favorable reviews are associated with heavier camcorder use -- where the handgrip configuration is used primarily to support the weight of the videocam and the other hand is used to really steady it side-to-side.Also for those of you who might care, immediately out of the package, the rubber grip really did have an "tire change shop" level of rubber odor and your hands do noticeably pick up the scent (n.b. this might get better with some time to air out, outside of the package).Two stars for nice attempt at innovation here, but execution just isn't up to basic task of steadying a still photography camera.ALSO, for lightweight digital cameras, you might check out the "Flip Video Action Tripod" - similar concept, available here on Amazon for around $20 or so... this will be my next purchase.
I love the camera enough to buy a USB cable instead of returning it - but the cable is absolutely essential, since Sony uses a proprietary USB port and it's impossible to charge the battery without the cable.
I finally got this camera on a Gold Box Deal of the Day but am very scared to use it underwater because I dropped it once and the battery case opened! So how sure am I that that won't happen underwater? And if it does open and the camera breaks, Sony won't give me a warranty for that. :( I don't know what to do currently.
The "Sony LCS-HG Soft Carrying Case" is just half the product I was looking for.It surely keeps your camera protected. It adds the possibility of carrying an extra battery and a second memory card. And that's it.It's not soft, it's not confortable to use it, it makes difficult to take the camera out, it makes unconfortable to keep the camera up and focusing, and once again, it makes putting the camera inside difficult. In conclusion: you end up unsure if it's better to use it or throw it away .Why?? Remember the old days when taking the camera out and ready to use was just a matter of releasing some kind of lock, the front of the case just dropped and you were ready?? Half the shell was securely attached to your camera, you just had half the weight of the bag/pouch/case hanging right below the camera?? Well, not in this case!! You'll have  to take the camera completely out. You don't have anywhere to leave the case: you'll have it all hanging from the strap, thanks (&iquest;?) to a velcro attached lace. Oh, that will be after you manage to slide the strap trough that lace. And then you'll end up with the heavy case, plus the memory and the battery hanging as a death weight from your camera. Want to put the camera out?? Put it inside the case... wait, first slide the shoulder strap through the lace.. not an easy task, as it gets messy...You want something strong to keep the camera protected until you arrive to your photographic destination, you can get one of these. You want something practical, fast to take off, easy to put the camera away??? Get something else!!
Case was tight and velcro often did not catch completely.  Was surprised that it only would fit on a belt and did not have provision for shoulder straps.  It is awkward to wear on a belt because of it's size.  Because there was no provision for a neck strap or handle for carrying, I returned it and got a slightly larger case that held more, had a neck strap and handle, and costs less to boot.
This case will BARELY fit a DMC TS3. I don;t think the case is big enough when you have to fight to get the camera in and zip it closed. Don;t even think about trying to wrestle the strap into the case and you can expect the power switch to go on/off repeatedly while in the case.Nice case. Love the color. Just not big enough for the camera it is advertised to fit.
I ordered this case as a beach back-up for a larger Lowepro Ridge 30 I normally use.Granted it is not a Lumix TS-3 official case, but the camera BARELY fits inside.  To get it in, I have to remove the default wrist-strap and pull the zipper with a bit of force.It will close, but it is pretty dang tight.  I don't think it will harm the camera, but it doesn't look right.  Perhaps it will stretch over time.  it would be nice to be able to at least fit the wrist strap in the there.
I expected to get a camera case that would be horizontal belt mounted not vertical as the one I received. It is not worth my while to be bothered returned such a small purchase. Just be aware not to purchase from this seller again.
I expected a monopod to be longer.  This one is only 18 inches long, only enough to use on a table. No instructions at all.
When I received my battery grip in the mail it was broken. The "on/off" switch had fallen completely off. I am sending it back for a refund, so we'll see what happens.
I was looking for a cream that was light to lubricate an earplug, and this is a bit too thick.  I have subsequently found that a light coat of baby oil works great.
Purchased 5 months ago, paid for remote installation and setup and Blue Iris recording software ( Does not work on my iMac, wasted $39.95). Had many problems especially getting the audio to work I have downloaded VLC plugin and after many hours does not work. I am needing more cameras but cannot convince myself Foscams are reliable or fully functional as advertised.
I've had these cameras for 7 months now and have found that they don't work very consistently.  About 3 months ago the first one stopped connecting, so I moved it to a physical ethernet connection, and about a week later it stopped connecting to that.  Now it's a paperweight.  The second camera disconnects quite often, which makes it a little bit useless as a baby monitor.  Sound on both of these cameras is completely useless.  I purchased external microphones for them, which made audio kind of workable.  Honestly it's on par with the $20 audio monitor that I grabbed at the store one day that I couldn't get either camera to work.  Tons of static and actual noise on the other end barely cuts through the white noise.  I've finally submitted a replacement request with foscam now that neither camera is working, maybe i'll update with details about how their support is once I hear from them..
This product is as described.great video and panning around the room. The customer service is excellent. very patient and knowledgeable. Thank you Calvin!I was happy with this product when the representative help me set it up to view on my phone. The very next day it did not worked and hasn't worked since...very disappointed
I was looking for the perfect wrist strap with an adjustable piece, and when I got this in the mail it looks similar but it's not the same strap it has no adjustable piece! I'm having to make a little adjustable piece myself after buying two of them for way to much money for what it is! I am not a happy camper, looking for another wrist strap with an adjustable piece!
It seems fairly strong for its size as the strap is only a hair over 1/16&#34; in diameter.  The loop is about 4&#34; in diameter.  But the big problem is it does not have the adjustment slider that's pictured and in the description.  As such, it's not going to do much to stop from sliding off my wrist, especially since the plastic coated metal strap is relatively slippery.  It probably won't serve my needs on an all-weather camera so I'll likely replace it or modify it.
Wireless is picky about the access point types. Does not work well with any router or encryption. Color is washed out during the day. Night vision does not work either. Wire connections should be water proof for outdoors.  The Loftek Nexus 543 IP cam which looks to be the same works 5x better. Same issues with wires, but at least it WORKS!
Instructions are horrible and if you buy from Amazon you can't get tech support.After much trial and error. Works as long as you are on the same network. Ie in the same house. However In order to monitor when you are not home you had better be very tech savvy and know how to forward you router port settings.I wouldn't buy again.
Poor optics and small dim screen.  It just wasn't good enough to make the cut.  I'm getting a Panasonic.  I think they make the best compact Digis and I have taken tens of thousands of photos with them..  I tried to save money on this one but it just not good enough even for the low price.
I purchased this before going on a vacation where I knew I would be outdoors, in a kayak, etc. The camera stopped functioning immediately when I arrived at my destination. It is almost as though it isn't "really" waterproof and something got in to the camera and was shorting it out. It would beep and go through all of the functions without any buttons being touched - it doesn't respond when I do try and hit a button. The flash stopped working when I was camping on the North Shore, and the underwater pics look worse than the ones I took a few years ago on a portable underwater camera.
The older model Canon Sephy printers had this built-in. What a rip off.  The reason I bought the Selphy because it was compact enough to bring on trips but this converter negates that.
THIS IS O.K BUT CAN'T FIND TOOLS TO MOUNT IT LIKE YOU CAN FOR THE GO PRO.  STILL SEARCHING TO FIND MOUNTING TOOLS SO IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE THEY CAN BE FOUND, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
This cameras waterproof housing broke the first time I took it out and ruined the camera.  I guess you get what you paid for.
If you buy a cheap go-pro that's what you get  Just go out and spend the extra money for a better quality.I just wanted it for under water pics on vacation but even this did not work. I gave it away while on vacation. I wasn't even worth packing up and bringing it back home.
This pad was purchased for photographing birds out a car window with a light lens (Canon 400mm f/5.6L).  The scalloped bottom does not fit my car door well, although I did not assume that it would, but the groove for fitting over the edge of window glass doesn't either.  It is cut straight, whereas car windows are always at an angle.  When put in place, the platform tilts upwards rather than being level.  Also, in my experience the type of soft foam used on top becomes brittle over time and falls apart, so I do not anticipate that the pad will last long.  The money would have been better spent on a beanbag.
If you want a steady platform don't go with product.  While it is super lite, it doesn't have the stability of a bean bag.  Plus the bean bag will conform to your lens.  Great idea but I sent it back.
This case is sturdy and well made. Its a nice case. The problem I have with it is that it is marketed as being made for a Hero3/3+, which it is not. It is made for a larger older hero. My Hero 3+ fits very loosely in here. I don't really like it. In the instructions it mentions that it fits the Hero 2 as well.... which is larger than the new Hero 3+ so it's obviously not made for the 3+ but for the Hero 2 and it was re-marketed to the new GoPro... a little sneaky in my book. I wanted one that fits the Hero 3+ like a glove. I have to wedge mount pieces in the &#34;extra&#34; space so that the Hero 3+ doesn't move around.
Ordered this case after discovering the Bose case doesn't really fit my AE2i.I was disappointed in what arrived for as much as the case cost. The interior lining wasn't sewn together well, the seams were overlapping and the top part of the seam was already peeling back. The cover for the compartment that holds the headphone wire was cheap, not properly covered in material, didn't fit well on the compartment and wasn't attached with any type of hinge. The zipper was hard to pull and stuck in several places as I tried to unzip the case.Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this case to anyone as I think it's way over priced and really lacks the quality you would expect. The Bose case was 1/3 the price and twice as nice and it's a pity my headphones didn't fit well in that Bose case.
I purchased three of these. Two are still functional. The one that broke fell a short distance to a carpetted floor. The lip where the speedlite slips into the stand broke away rendering the stand useless.
