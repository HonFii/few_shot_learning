Could have been longer though. well made and every thing is in the right place. just a little short compared to the original.
It works, no fires, etc.  Why not 5 stars?  How can I really give a 50 amp Receptacle 5 stars?  What does a 5 star receptacle even look like?  If you find this has improved your life substantially then give it 5 stars.  For me I plugged in a charger.  I'm not proud.
The item was what I was looking for.
Same as the ones you get in electrical supply!  Will buy again when supply runs out. Don't be afraid to order these.
The picture showed the fixture with the box.  Only the fixture came.  No box. No good with out the box.  did not use.
I have a corded drill but the cord is quite short.  This helps me reach the outlet and just gives me that extra room to maneuver well.  The cords seems well constructed and sturdy for home DIY projects.
Works great in the garage with the refrigerator.  No frills extension cord that only gets a star off due to the color.
Im not crazy about the flat cords. I prefer the round jackets.But it is the 12 gauge I needed and the price was good.
This is a good heavy duty extention cord.  It seems to be well made.  It is very stiff, however.  I had to take a few minutes to work the bends out of it before it would lay straight.
Good extension cord, but the quality is a little less than made in USA. Package says made in Indonesia. The price is right and a BUY.
No surprises here, I needed an extension cord that worked great with heaver appliances.  Does the job, cord is sturdy.
I specifically ordered these 15 foot and 6 foot cords because of the "made in the USA" in the description.  Both of these were made in Indonesia.  Despite that these seem to be made well.
Why is it that things like Vacuum cleaners and Steam Mops never seem to have a long enough cord so that you don't have to keep turning the unit off, unplugging and plugging into another outlet?  Seems like they're always about 10 foot short.I needed a 3 pronged semi heavy duty cord about 10 ft long and this just fits the bill.  Most short extension cords are two pronged and geared for light duty such as lamps and kitchen counter appliances. Having searched Home Depot, Sears, K-mart and Walmart, I was ready to give up.  Most their 3 pronged heavy duty cords are those bright orange and long 20ft and longer ugly cords.I didn't think I'd find it here at Amazon and like the man says "Surprise, Surprise"!  And it works well with my Euroflex Monster Steam Cleaner as well as my Miele Vacuum Cleaner.  And short enough for easy storage.The only reason for 4 stars is because the plug is at an angle and I would have preferred a standard straight plug.
It worked great for hooking up heater. Had to cut ends off and strip wire to hook up to heater.
never had to use it as i had a professional install the heater. so i cant give a true rating. can say that it appeared to be well made and durable
Not much I can say.  It works like it should.  Seems like it is made well.  I would probably buy a six footer next time just so I have more to work with.  Other than that.  It works and was much cheaper than buying locally.
It's a dryer cable... Nothing fancy about it. But it was half the cost online as it was in stores so I bought it here, put it in. Worked great for a day or two but then the whole dryer quit working. Nothing to do with the cable. Sadly that was just a crappy dryer. I would highly recommend this cable!
I read the reviews and was hesitant about buying this product. I affixed it to my outdoor porch supporting pillar and thetemperature has agreed with our local weather reporting stations, even during the subzero cold experienced during thelast few weeks.  The humidity readings vary somewhat from what is being reported on the weather stations, but are closeenough for our needs.  Illinois Old Timer
It is light weight and needs good secure placement.  It seems to be very accurate.  Good value.  Arrived promptly.
This product serves its' purpose.  However, it's made from plastic and I'm not sure how long it will last, but for the price, it was worth the purchase.
This is a nice looking thermometer, a good deal for the price, and it does what it's supposed to do.
Very happy with it!
We keep this thermometer+hygrometer at our back porch. it is only hung with one nail on the top and the bottom is touching the mesh-screen which makes the hydrometer coil touch the screen. makes me wonder if it reads correctly but I believe it does. Like other reviewers said, it does what it's supposed to do: tell temperature (accurately) and humidity. Very easy to read. Just wish it had a back cover.
I was looking for the least expensive gauge with big, easy numbers to read.It filled the bill on both counts, & after having now almost a year, it always has been within 1>2 degree max of the temp. from weather channel reading in town, several mile away. We have it under a porch, & I would NOT recommend this if it were to be totally open to the elements 24/7, because the sealing of the face/back, is not such that it would either prevent leaks, fogging.
I put this thermometer outside my kitchen window.... The numbers are big enough I could put it pretty far away and see the numbers well still.
I have this on my front porch so in the morning I glare out the window while sitting at the kitchen table and I am always informed throughout the day on what the temperature is.  This is very important to me in the winter months.  Now this is not an expensive thermometer it is made of plastic.  My first impression was how cheap the plastic was BUT it does what it suppose to do, so it is exactly what I wanted
This product withheld on our wall outside during one of the windiest days we've ever had.  The correct temperature is always posted and it's colorful backround adds a bit of attraction to our backyard.  Works just fine for the price.
I like this thermometer because it is easily read from indoors.  I hope it last for a long time.
Been a season and it is still working fine. Now there is proof of how high the humidity is. My husband can't argue when it is right in front of him..
We've only been using it for a few weeks at a school but it seems like it's pretty close to the correct temperature that another thermometer I have reads.  I like how it has the humidity so you can figure out the "feels like" temperature and having the wind chill reading is good too.
Accurate. Not very well made and could break easy if dropped. Looking forward to using it this summer. We will see how well it holds up in 110 degree heat.
This does a reasonable job at giving us an idea of the temperature outside.  Unfortunately, to see it, we needed to put it on the deck bannister.  So although not real close to the house, it is close enough to affect the temperature.  But even with that, it still reads a bit higher than it should.
PUT THIS ON OUR DECK RAILING, EASY TO READ FROM INSIDE,LARGE NUMBERS. KIDS CAN READ TO KNOW WHAT TO WEAR.
It was just a bit larger than I figured it would be but it is what I was looking for.  Does exactly what I wanted.
Simple thermometer. Temp gauge works OK & is very visible. Humidity gauge may be out of calibration. Not sure it has that capability because I haven't taken it down to look.
A nice easy to see face with large temperature numbers and pointer. Visible from a reasonable distance without needing glasses!
Really easy to see from far away but for some reason the humidity dial is pointing up and not down, not sure why but a good thermometer.
Easy to install, just right aesthetically..Displayed temperature is consistently 5 to 7 degrees higher than the actual. That may be a location issure.
i have it outside on my patio, seems to keep accurate readings. nothing fancy but it works for me...i guess
I really like this outdoor thermometer, as I can read it over 20 feet away.  This thermometer is well worth the price.
Relatively accurate; I like the blue, orange and red color regions showing cold, warm and hot. Easily placed on a tree with a screw but had to be taken in during windy conditions.
We really enjoy this outdoor thermometer. We fastened it to a support post on our patio and can easily read the temperature from our kitchen window. It's true that the thermometer doesn't have a back and that is why I only gave it a rating of four stars. But I cut a circular piece of masonite and fastened it to the back of the thermometer that made it easy to mount. I recommend this product.
Works, serves its purpose. Not much more to say. inexpensive, plastic. Black would be nice. Has a folding stand in the back. Can hang it from the wall.
I guess there's nothing wrong with all plastic, but I worry about the long-term aging of the clear plastic face plate...
I like this item and I had purchased five because I wanted one in each room to check the temperature and humidity. They all seemed to work fine and I can see the readings at just a glance
Great value, nothing fancy. But works very well. Seems to be accurate and measures both temp and humidity fairly accurately.
Came quickly and was as advertised.  Works like a charm.  No problems or issues.
So far it's telling me what I need to know, the temp. and humidity for my gun closet to keep them rust free.
Works great for me.  Been using it for my green house.  Accurate also.  This is for inside humidity, not for outside humidity, however the item can be used outside for temperature.
Good value humidity and temp measure device.Humidity measures 8% too high but otherwise okay.
I purchased 3. There is a slight discrepancy in readings among the 3, but not enough to make a significant difference for home monitoring.
Gives reasonable indication of indoor humidity/temp at modest cost.Many others are a lot more expensive, and work no better
If this product wasn't so fragile, I would have given it a 5 star rating. This little meter is accurate as a pin. I put a digital meter with the same functions and it showed it to be spot on. Rough handling will break it but I'm pleased with the big dials so I can see them at a distance. A glass lens would be a big plus but I can tell this product will last a long time if left alone a the use of canned air once and a while. I would tell a friend that it is suitable where heat and humidity need to be controlled.
Purchased these to use track the humidity in my refer warehouse.  They do a great job.  Inexpensive and very functional.
I noticed this item has mixed reviews. I would have preferred if it were larger than it is but I like it and use it a lot. It seems to be accurate enough.
Not the prettiest or most accurate but for knowing the approximate conditions of an indoor grow house for vegetables and peppers on the cheap it works great.For a few more bucks there are lots of other options. On the cheap end this one works great.
Gave out after 9 years of constant use. How many starts to give it? 4 due to noise I guess.
I had an InSinkErator that was in my house when I bought it. I had it for 10 years so who knows how old it was. When it wore out I was certain that it would be a big job to replace it. I ordered the same model (yes they still make the same model) and I installed it without changing a single fitting. It took about a half hour and it is very hard to access under my sink. I could have installed it quicker if it wasn't so tight under my kitchen sink.
Good quality and easy to install.  It is same as the one replaced.  The old unit started to leak within 6 years so keep an eye on it as it ages.  I think they should last longer.  When they leak it can ruin your floor and more.  would reccommed to others.
Was a direct replacement for a Badger 5 which gave me 10 years of excellent service. No re-plumbing was  needed so saved me cost on plumber's installation charge. Looking forward to  another 10+ years of great service.
I have worked on appliances for 30 yrs & Insinkerators are very reliable & a good value when used properly
I like it because it is working fine after installation. A couple of weeks gone and I did not have any problem. The reason behind not giving 5 is I did not get the fiber gasket that is supposed to come with the package. I had to go to the home improvement store to get one.
This &iacute;tem was a replacement of the Badger 1. It was simple and easy to replace. Its quieter and is working well so far.
Very satisfied with Badger 5 disposal. Works well with plenty of power. Just a little more noise than I would have preferred but for the price I don't think it can be beat.
Be aware of the need to wire this thing yourself.  Not that big of a deal if you know how to use strippers and wire nuts, but you'll have to order that stuff separately or go to the hardware store.Not included: the little clamp that  secures the wire when it enters the bottom of the housing. Really?
Easy to install. Came with all the parts I needed. I feel this was an excellent choice.Four more words required..
The item arrived with a dent on its side.  Installed, it works OK; so I did not go through the process of returning it, which involves, among other requirements, sending back a picture of the item.  If BuyPlumbing did not skim on packaging, this could have been prevented.
We had the same product before.Bought the same thing as it had worked perfectly for 8 yrs.Good for a small household.installation was really easy too.
I replaced and old same make and model disposer. Setup was easy. Seems to be working fine. It did require some additional which are not included in the box.
It was the make and model that was originally installed in the house we bought and it worked great. We had to replace it because an item(fork) accidently got in and broke the housing.  So why would I change?
The previous Badger 5 I got in 2006 or so gradually rusted out and shorted the electrics after eight years of use.  It ran well, had enough power, and only occasionally needed the hand key to get it un-stuck.  However, it got really jammed up once when a narrow piece of plastic got caught in between, requiring near total disassembly.
I never reinstalled inSink Erator before. It took me 30 minutes to install. Installation was very easy. It works great.
Product met my expectations. It delivered what was advertised. It will be nice to include cable and cable clamp for few extra $.My old unit has the cables crimped and I also couldn't take out the plastic cable clamp after even after I fought with it for an hour. I finally went to local home improvement store and got a cable that also came with clamp and all other required accessories.
Badger 5 replaced two other brand disposals which were underpowered and didn't last long. The Badger 5 has lasted years, never clogs, and runs really cool. Whereas the previous ones overheated under a large load.Insinkerator makes an add-on optional 3 way flexible output tube which connects over to the trap, which solves most installation problems, fits most of their models including this one, see it online for about $5 various places.Satisfied!
The badger 5 line is simple to install and works great! Haven't tried any of the more expesive lines because this does everything you will need from a disposal. This unit does produce some noise but lets not forget it only produces noise when you turn it on, no problem for me! Great product
For the money, I believe this to be the best Waste Disposer.  Removal of the old unit and installation of this unit took less than an hour.  It hasn't leaked and gets used everyday at least once.
it was easy to install, it took me a whole 5 minutes to remove the old one, rewire and connect the new one.It was delivered on time and works well.A
Had this product installed for my kitchen remodel.  I don't put alot of scraps down my disposal so this works great.  The one I wanted to order had better reviews but was larger  and I wanted to have as much room under my sink as possible. Just installed last week and so far I like it!
I replaced our existing 8 year old badger 5 1/2 with this one.  It fist perfectly as expected.  No cutting or extra parts required.  As noted in other reviews, remember that you will need a cord and dishwasher attachment if you are not using the ones from your previous disposal.  They are not included in the box.  Overall this is a good middle of the road disposal.  Its a bit loud, but takes a beating and still works well with no maintenance.
The Badger 5 met my expectations.  It came with all parts and clear instructions.  Installation was smooth and it's working great!
I was a bit disappointed at the plastic case. The one it replaced served well for at least twenty years. So I replaced it with the same machine. Easier as no need to redo the sink mount. iIt only lasted a few days until the motor failed.The warranty came through with a new unit, but only after a few telephone calls. I ended up having the factory send a unit to me and I removed the failed unit and installed the warranty unit myself.  Access to the serial number in situ was an issue. So, far, it is doing fine. I've saved the metal unit. in the event the plastic case fails outside of warranty, I may be able to swap cases.  .  As i communcate well and am a fairly good DIYER. Another may not have fared so well. The Merchant was just fine, as were the local representatives. But, that is another story..
This brand was recommended by the plumber. It's working pretty good (2 wks old). One day after installation it made a weird noise, like something was caught it it, I looked and saw nothing, but called my plumbers back. They saw nothing either. They put a bunch of ice down it, and everything was fine. So far, all is still good.
I bought this InSinkErator when my identical old one finally died.  I loved the old one and the new one works just as well.
Not sure what to say about a disposal. easy to install.  Went in as it should . but is also the same model we replaced.
Bought this one to replace the previous one which was the same model.  The old one started leaking water through the bottom after almost 12 years.  Never would expect to get 12 years out of this appliance.  The new one is quite and gobbles up anything with ease!
I replaced the same model with this one.  We had installed the previous one approx 10 years ago and it had apparently rusted through and was leaking from the very bottom where the electrical box was.  The new one seems a bit quieter and overall has been great.  If I can get another 10 years out of this one, I'll be happy for this price it's fantastic.
We replaced our cracked disposer in our newly purchased house with the exact same model. It lasted from 1996-2013.  It's great for a 2 person household, but I would recommed getting the next size up if you're more than 2-3 people.
I have 2 of them, service is outstanding.Updated my rating to 3 stars from 1 on 3/13/13...just got off the phone with one of InSinkErator's service representatives, Jackie.  Was contacted by them solely from this review.Jackie patiently explained to me what causes some of the failures in disposals, sharp objects puncturing casings, washing hair in the sink with fallen out hair causing wear, etc.  She was very helpful and I'll update again if the company follows through with what she said she can do.  Jackie is the best service representative I've ever talked to, a very good listener, helpful and insightful.4 stars 3/20/13 Jackie from InSinkErator shipped me a new unit, it arrived in only a couple of days and is now installed and working great!  One down and one to go!
Our old one went out in about 10 years and we ordered this on line.  It arrived on time, wrapped appropriately, fit perfectly, and met our needs exactly.  The price was as to be expected and yes I would purchase again in hopefully 10 years or so.
Replaced identical model.  Easy install, left previous sink drain in place and installed existing electric cord and drain lines.  Don't forget to punch out plug for dishwasher drain.  Seems to be quieter than the older 1/3 HP model in main house.  Great price and received in just a few days.
Investigated big box home center stores, and found best price on Amazon with free shipping. Replaced with same model that was previously installed, so installation was straight forward. Product performed as expected, and should get 5-10 years of service, as was the life of previous model. Not the best product, but worth price paid for an average disposal. Probably best bang for the buck.
It is a bit loud when nothing is in it.. Install is a snap and plenty powerful&#62;&#62; good product.  buy
I was satisified with the Badger 5 by Insinkerator, so I ordered an exact replacement.  The old one was still working whereas the motor was good but the case just wore out.  Busted right thru the aluminum side wall.  I don't know how long it was in service as it was in the house when I bought it 10 years ago.  Total rust out of the steel case teeth exposed the aluminum to the direct blast of the ground up material.  I put ice cubes into the unit occationally to clean things up and give it a little work out, until one day...The cubes came out the side of case.Another thing I did which I do not recomend now was to put orange peels into the unit and grind them partially, leaving the remains in the unit beause it smelled nice and I felt it was sanitizing things.  Don't do this.  The acids left are probably what caused so much rust.I don't think you can by a better brand and I am satisfied.
Easy to install and all the power I needed.  The only thing is if you connect a dishwasher to it make sure you punch out the stop inside the hook up.  The instructions put this information in after you have already installed it.  With the ease of installation though it wasn't a problem just an incovenience.
Old one lasted 10 years before it started leaking...known problem with this model.  Problem is, nicer ones are more expensive than I'd like to spend, so I'll deal with the poor design and hope for another decade out of this one.  Sure was easy to swap them out, being as this new one is a direct replacement for the old one. That makes things better...less wrestling with something is always nice.
Great buy. It was an exact replacement for the one in place which I had installed about 10 yrs ago. The tip from another reviewer to use a car jack to hold it in place was a godsend. Based on memory this install took about 1/2 the time and strain...and swearing.
good item
Works very well,easy installation.haven,t had it long enough to know about durability.
First unit lasted 5 plus years, I think you get what you pay for.If it lasts longer than that I will be happy.
I purchased this to replace its ~10 year old brother that started leaking from the area where you put the allen key in to clear a jam.  I'd say that 10 years out of a disposal is a good deal.  Installation was super simple, considering I already had the mounting ring in place.  My only complaint: it's fairly loud.  But what they hey...it's under $100.
saved over $30 compared to buying the same exact product locally.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the manufacturer changed the design of the output plumbing connector which meant I could not use my existing plumbing fixtures.
Had a Kitchenaid disposer installed less than a year ago and it would jam constantly.  Had to get the stick and try to free it and it would then work again, at least for awhile. Then it developed a metallic rattle and finally quit and would not respond to the stick treatment. Bought a InSinkErator Badger 5 as I was familiar with the brand and owned one years ago.  This is much quieter than the KitchenAid and proably will last. And the KitchenAid is now made by Whirlpool, whose quality is slipping.
It does what it's made to do. My only concern is the weird noise it makes sometimes (when empty) It's like a thump. We had someone look at it but they say its fine.
with this specific product, it has to do with where you live and what you can put down a disposal. wiht me it was light things and this insinkErator was replaced with the last one I had.  easy decision.  why i choose Amazon was because the price was half of what the retail stores were selling it at. I was very happy when I did the comparison. Shop Amazon first.
Installed easy, and works just fine. super value for the money! My lady and I are both over 80 and had no problems installing. supported it with a paint can while connecting.
a decent disposal for the buck easy to install, not too noisy,a little though, should last a few years hopefully
Met my expectations. I had read numerous reviews and finally settled on staying with InSinkErator as a replacement for a Badger 1/3rd hp disposal that was about 10 years old and completely rusted out inside and non-functional. Installation was relatively easy and also met my expectations. It was installed in an empty townhouse about 2 months ago and therefore has not been used, so I can not report on how well it chews up food scraps. However, it hooked up and ran as expected and seems to be a reasonably quiet disposal. I can make no comments as to comparisons with competing brands.The pricing from Amazon along with door-to-door delivery was a strong plus compared to local stores.
My previous one lasted about 7 years.  Installed the newest one because i didn't feel like changing the plumbing under my sink.  Easy to install and no problems as of yet.  Has been installed for about a month.  Works but not the best ever but also not the most expensive.  Install and use correctly and don't abuse with excessive stuff jammed in it all at once and run with water to aid in moving debris through and it'll be fine.
Very happy with the disposer. It replaced one I had before - same brand, It runs fairly quietly and does a good job. I also appreciated the literature which varified that this an ecologically sound way to dispose of our "trash".
Very easy to install. Relatively quiet. Only reason Im not giving it 5 stars is because the badger 5 it replaced was only 5 years old. Maybe thats all they last anymore? If you are doing a new install, you will need to purchase a power cord unless a whip is already installed under the sink.
I installed this unit in 1993.  Never had a problem until about a month ago...it just didn't work until I flipped the switch three or four times.  So, I've ordered another, and maybe it will last another twenty years.
Disposer replaced a smaller waste king. It looks more substantial . It was very easy to install and works great
We had the same waster disposer for over 13 years and it broke.  We decided to buy the same kind and we love it.  It seems to be quiter that the previous one that we had.  Overall it's a good product.
It is what it is... I live in Phoenix (hard water) and my last 4 disposals have ALL lasted 4-4.5 yrs - regardless of &#34;Galvinized&#34; or &#34;Stainless Steel&#34; grind chamber. 1 WasteKing, 1 InSinkErator 444 and 2 InSinkerator 5s have lasted the same period of time - within months of each other - regardless of price or specs. I AM resigned to their lifespan in my geographic area... This month's amazon price ($85ish with tax) was the same as my last 2009 HD in-store price. Bought a 1/3 HP Badger 100 (NOT a &#34;1&#34;) in-store from HD for $90 in June 2913. I'll return it for this $85 1/2 HP Badger 5 (disposal number 5, I've been in the same house forever) which was shipped in 3 days SuperSaver LV-PHX - very speedy! And in Sep 2017 I'll wait for the leak to begin and swap it out yet one more time for #6... $20ish/yr for a disposal - WTF ;-(
We replaced our 12 year old with the same brand.  We never had a problem with it until now. For some reason it just stopped working.  Nothing was jammed or damage, it just stopped running when you switched it on. We checked to make sure it was receiving electrical power and it was.  After installing the new unit, everything worked.  We had this unit for a long time and we feel we got our money's worth and more.
I just replaced a 20 year old InSinkeErator with this new one.  The installation was very easy because I did not even have to remove the old flange.  I just turned the flange on the old one and it dropped out, connected the wires to the new one and popped it in.  Turned it on and it worked.
Replaced an existing Badger 5 that lasted about 5-7 years.  I know there are better (and more expensive) disposals out there, but this was an exact fit and hopefully will last another 5-10 yrs.
My mom's kitchen was remodeled in '98, and a new one of these was installed.  It lasted about 14 years till the sides rusted through!  Since she's 96, I'm pretty sure this new replacement disposer should still be in fine shape when we ultimately sell the house!  (Sorry, Mom!)  Not the quietest, obviously not the most durable, but for the price, not a bad choice, and as a (now retired) plumber, I've installed hundreds of them in tract homes.
Lives up to it's reputation.  Easy to install if you are replacing an old Insinkerator. Worth paying more compared to other brands.
Our first Insinkerator Badger 5 lasted five years before the internal seals gave out and the unit began leaking.  Like so many appliances today, "they don't build them like they used to."  That said, the Badger 5 served us well for the five years it lasted.  It's not too noisy, does a good job of grinding and is reasonably priced.  My wife got some very small gravel lodged in the unit and it was easy to un-jam.The really good news is the unit is extremely easy to replace with the same or a similar Insinkerator disposal.  The quick-release cam-lock sink attachment system is quite well designed.  I purchased a new Insinkerator Badger 5 and had it wired, installed and fully operational in half an hour using the old unit's previously installed cam-lock and external wiring.  And believe me when I say I'm no master plumber!Am I happy our original Insinkerator Badger 5 unit died after just five years?  No, but you get what you pay for.Jim
Here are my notes - first I ordered this Sunday night - a bit ridiculous that it didn't ship until Thursday.  Luckily it came out of their Indianapolis warehouse and only took 1 day to get to Ohio - but still 4 days to ship ???I was just swapping Badger 5 for Badger 1 - I had the Badger 1 from my new build house for 7 years - no problems other than the occasional item getting stuck.  I did notice on the inside that the center plate was rusting away and missing chunks, but ultimately it was an accidental plastic bag that broke the unit although I think it was going to break down shortly anyway.Since I was just swapping the units I didn't buy the wiring kit - you might want to buy it as that was my biggest problem - my B1 unit had a plastic insertion that held the wire in place and it is not really designed to ever come out once pushed in - I had to take a hammer and screwdriver and pound the metal all around the platic to loosen it enough to pull it out.  Then the wires were crimped so you will have to cut them and then re-splice the ends to use for the new unit.Without the wiring would have been 30min to remove and replace.  With the wiring issues took me over an hour and I didn't even have to mess with the top/sink part and replacing the flange,gasket, mounting ring,etc as I just kept what was already in place.  Seems to work - hope to get another 7 years like the first one.
Installed it a couple of weeks ago and seems to be working fine.  This is the best deal I could find on the internet.
This unit installed easily and works fine.  It has nice power and relatively quiet compared to my previous smaller unit.
It's a garbage disposal. It does what it says it would do--it disposes garbage.  It's quiet and it works.  Very happy with it.
Like these, except I would suggest that the warranty should be kept for safe keeping.  My First one didn't outlast the warranty and was jammed with a SMALL piece of a broken knife handle.  -Johnny
This has never happened with Amazon before!  Instead of the InSinkErator Badger 5 we received a nice set of car speakers.  But.... they don't grind up garbage so UPS is coming this week to pick them up.  I drove to Lowes and bought the same unit, except it cost $20.00 more.  It installed quickly, (I was  replacing a Badger 1 that stopped working) and we were happy when we didn't detect any leaks.  It's a little noisy but it's supposed to grind up bones and tough food items so I can live with a a little noise.  The unit comes with a Two year warranty.  (Supposedly they come to our house to repair or replace)  I will update the review if I find the Badger 5 unsatisfactory.  The customer service lady was courteous and promised a full refund.
Existing one died after a long and productive life (at least 6 years). Bought the same model to reduce the time it took to install. This must be a slightly different internal design (or the last one was just old) because it runs a whole lot more quietly than the one it replaced. All the parts were included and it did just fine.
easy to install. Took about an hour to remove and replace the old one. The key is to purchase the replacement with the same exact drain configuration as the old- no replumbing and extra cost of pipes AND you won't have to change out the bracket which is the trickiest part. Make sure you have easy access to the existing bracket because this thing is a bit heavy and balancing it and engaging the bracket will take a steady hand and some strength. Saved myself a Franklin vs. having a local plumber come in, so yes I'm extremely pleased!
I had my original waste disposal go out on me and Amazon had this for a lot less than Home Depot. Installation isn't too bad with a little know how (used the power cord from original disposal for this one since it was not included)...that's if you have a disposal already installed. Make sure to unplug the dishwasher drain port. I did not know there is a existing plug built in and I ended up having back wash from the aerator when the dishwasher tried to drain into the disposal unit. Anyway it works fine...nothing fancy like the more expensive and quieter models. No problems as of yet!
It's relatively easy to install.  Just hope it will last longer.  Previous one lasted about five years and three months with very light use.  Emerson made better disposer before.  The original one lasted more than13 years with similar level of usage.
Product works great and was easy to install.  The only problem was that the plastic &#34;L&#34; shaped tube that attaches to the garbage disposal was shattered during shipping. Luckily the one from my old garbage disposal was still in good shape so I was able to use it.
Rapid shipping and very easy to install it your self...just follow the instructions and shouldn't take more that 20 minutes!
I bought the same brand I currently had, and it swapped out easily!  I did have to buy one piece of pvc to fit a new location of the opening.
Fit's exactly as my old system. Just be careful not to throw away your old unit before removing the power cord. The new one doesn't come with a power cord. The power cord is very easy to install, 3 cables (black ,white and green) that attaches to the unit. The green cable is the ground cable and it attach to the bottom of the unit. Works great, and very quiet.So easy you could install it with your eyes closed.
This is the same make and model garbage disposer I had previously. Home Depot had it on line but it cost more and I would have had to wait longer to get it.
I replaced this with exact existing model . I figured the first one lasted 12yrs, so why not stay with same? good product, quiet and does its job.
If you are replacing an existing in-sink-erator brand, the install lakes 20 minutes.  Remove the old one.  Pop out the dishwasher drain plug, move the power cord from your old model to the new one, install the new one with a simple twist, connect dishwasher drain and primary disposal drain into existing sink plumbing.  Was a snap.  This is a cheaper/low cost model, and it is not super quiet.  We replaced a higher end model that died, and can tell this is a bit louder... but we don't use it very often so we didn't care.
There was an original Badger 5 already installed in our house when I bought it in 1996 and it had worked fine up until it gave out. 15 years plus not bad! Hopefully the new one will last as long! After reading some of the other reviews I am keeping my fingers crossed and my eyes on the unit.I bought theInSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposerto minimize the install problems and because of the price.(Search Amazon well, there are cheaper deals than this link with possible free shipping!)The install went well with minimal cutting of the discharge tube. The only difficulty was with the new bolt-on dischrge tube that I worried about stripping the holes in the plastic housing and trying to keep the gasket seated while aligning to the original plumbing and getting everything tightened down. The unit works well and is VERY much quieter than the old one.The main PROBLEM with buying this online is that it needed theInSinkErator CRD-00 Power Cord Kitwhich was not clearly stated in ANY of the sights I checked. I expect a complete ready to use unit when I buy anything and if not then CLEARLY state what else is needed! I could have used the original's cord which can save you a little money but with the leaking it was slimy and the fitting had a little rust. I used a heavy duty cord from a high volume fan that had recently died and a connector I had from my time as an electrician or it would have been a trip to the hardware store and time wasted.
I thought my old Badger 5 broke so I bought this.  Turns out I just need the special wrench that comes with the package and un-stuck it from the bottom.  (Thanks, installation guide.)Well, I could return it.  But this thing is purely electrical & mechanical ... so it won't get &#34;outdated&#34; after a year.  So even the old one still works, I will still keep this one (for a new kitchen, or for when eventually the old one breaks, someday).
I struggled as to whether I needed the 3/4 hp or the 1/2 hp for my replacement disposal.  I learned that 1/2 hp is plenty for my usage.  It was fairly simple to install and I saved about $20 buying it on Amazon rather than Home Depot or Lowes etc.
I experienced the usefulness of the In Sink Erator since I bought my flat in 1984 which the disposer  was already installed in the kitchen. I only needed to replace the machine once about 15 years later due to wear and tear. This was my second time to replace it.  Since I cannot find the same model in Hong Kong, then I searched it in the internet and found that the Amazon could provide me the same with bargainable price. The goods arrived two weeks earlier than scheduled. I thank very much for the prompt action to my order  amd follow-up services. The only thing regreted was that I had to use a transformer to step down the voltage of my city to suit the dippser.
Had the 1/3 hp InSinkErator for about 12 years before it died.  So, life was good and Emerson has a good rep no need to change to another product.  Also is see no reason to buy the more quiet units that cost $200+, since you only turn the disposal on for a couple of seconds each time it is used.
First I'll say that if you are replacing a Badger, this is definitely the way to go. The installation was reasonably easy since this was a step up from the Badger 1 I replaced and everything fit exactly the same.  The unit runs well and looks good too. My only concern is that the top portion for the disposer is made from plastic and that is where my old Badger 1 cracked and leaked.  I hope this one will last more than 4 years.
I bought this as a replacement for my old Badger 5 which was leaking, only problem I had was the drain pipe was damaged in shipping so I got one from the hardware store. a little tip, I was having a hard time lining up the ring to attach the disposer to the drain, and it was wearing me out!  I got a bottle jack out the garage to hold it in place so I could line the collar up.
If it was quieter, which I knew it wasn't, I would have given it 5 stars. Good quality and installs in minutes. FYI, this was for an apartment unit. I really like it because of the size. It takes up little room under the sink.
The first one lasted seven years which, in my opinion, is pretty reasonable considering the warranty is only two years.
Not the best but it does the job for the money. Bought direct replacement to simplify installation. Price here was lower than Home Depot contractor bundle of 10disposals .
I purchased the Badger 5 to replace a Badger 5.5 (which is no longer available) after it froze up repeatedly. (Don't ask, I tried everything!) Although under-the-sink repairs can be frustrating because the space is tight, this wasn't too bad. I did quite a bit of research and watched a couple of tutorials before starting, which certainly helped. Understanding how the old device turned to detach and then lifting (and holding up) the new one were actually the hardest parts. You need to find something just the right height to help hold the new Badger while you get it positioned. I also used the old electrical cord and reattached it to the new base, otherwise you need to buy the cord separately. I am a female who actually likes doing construction and home repairs, and it took me about two hours.
Got the Badger 5 Friday and installed it Sat. morning.  It was a replacement for the 12 year old Badger 1 that still worked but had some funny metallic noises emitting from it so decided to retire it.  The Badger 5 was installed in about an hour using the existing hardware and plug in wiring.  It works great but is a slight bit louder than the older one was.  Not a problem though, it's only on for a short time during dish washing time.  Anyway, so far so good and the wife is happy, we all know that's what counts.
I like the product and the price was right. They are relatively easy to install and their not as loud as I thought it would be.
Better than going to the hardware store! A MUST HAVE! Very easy to install! Dont waist your time in HomeDepot!
I bought this as a direct replacement to the installed unit that was begining to leak. The only part I was worried about was changing the sink portion as it involved using plumbers putty but in the end that was a breeze.The whole process took about 30 minutes with additional time checking for leaks. Beware as if your under sink space is cramped you will need strong and sturdy biceps to hold and mount the unit.
came ready to assemble except for one piece which i just took off the old one. for the price, worth it.
I think it's a bit expensive for just 1/2hp motor. However, it was easy to replace and no leaks any more. I hope it lasts.
This was a replacement for a same one who lasted me for over 10 years, but corrosion of the water beating, creating a hole inside the disposal.
I didn't give this 5 stars only because I can't imagine &#34;loving&#34; any garbage disposal.I bought this item to replace another InSinkErator Badger 5 that quit working after 9+ years.One reason I bought this item was that I figured the installation would be easier since it would be replacing another Badger 5 and that turned out to definitely be correct.  I did this by my self and It took me about 45 minutes from start to finish.  And I am 76 years old.The new unit is very quiet and has no vibration whatsoever.We put very little in the way of food scraps into our disposal.  It is used only for very small stuff that happens to get into  the drain.This product appears to be well built and says that it was built in Racine, WI.  I liked that it was made in the USA.
This is a like for like replacement.  This came new and in good working order.  It does what it is supposed to do.  :)
I was replacing this exact disposer in my sink, so even I could do the installation.  For the money, it has plenty of power, and the noise is well within acceptable.
I used this product in my other homes and it worked fine so I installed it in my new home. It works fine here also.
I had one of these waste disposers in place for many years, worked great. Install was easy beings the same brand was in before. Shipping could have been a bit faster. Overall very satisfied.
At first the guy who installed it did some mistake and it had too much noise, then I asked him to fix it and now it is low noise. But in general should handled with care. Not to be pressed to hard.
Exact replacement and it took me less than 30 minutes to change them out and now it works like it should
Very good product with good prince, it came as promised, was easy to install, worked great, I recommend this place
I made the decision to replace my 10 year old Badger 5 as part of an update of my kitchen from 1992. It includes adding granite counter tops and rolled stone back splashes. My badger still worked but had rust in the bottom.I was walking to the check out counter when it dawned on me to check Amazon before I made my purchase. Sure enough when I went on line to Amazon I found it for $20.00 cheaper and Free Shipping! I'm so glad I thought of Amazon before I purchased it from my local &#34;Home Improvement Center&#34;!!
I had to replace my previous InSinkErator Pro 333 (3/4 HP), after getting 13 years out of it.  This model is compact but still fits on the previous Quick Lock sink mount from the Pro 333 model.It was a very easy installation, had to hook up the main line, dishwasher output and connect the wiring.  However, the model does not come with a wire clamp, which is needed to hold the electrical wire in place, so unless you can remove the wire clamp from your previous disposer you will need to purchase that separately. I did not see this mentioned anywhere.This model is a bit loud and can shake the faucet if there is a large job to be ground up.Overall the model has been working great and since it is smaller than the Pro 333 it added valuable space under the sink.
This is the second disposal unit I have purchased and installed in my home. I purchased this same sized unit about seven years ago shortly after we first moved in. It worked well for those seven years - right up until my wife unknowingly turned it on with a glass measuring cup inside it. That pretty much instantly killed my old unit, so I got this identical unit to replace it.Installation was fairly easy, and should be for you, as well, as long as you are doing a replacement and not a new install. New installs are considerably more work! We've been using this new unit for about two months now, and it performs just as well as its predecessor. I'd recommend this model for regular kitchen duty.
I chose this review because the only thing I &#34;Love&#34; is my wife. I have used this brand of disposal for more years than I can count and one of the main reasons is it's simplicity of installation. I just turned seventy years old and had no problem replacing the one I put in over 13 years ago.
I bought this garburator for the replacement of Badger 1. Everything is fine so far. The only concern is that the cable connector and wire nuts are not included, so you have to spend almost $10 to buy these accessories.
My 13.5 year old Badger 5 died, so I researched to find a replacement.  I chose another Badger 5 because I figured it would fit perfectly and last a similarly long life.  I can't comment yet on the life span because I just installed it, but the "fit perfectly" thing was "right on".  I removed the old unit, took off the power cord, and put the power cord on the new one, and it went in perfectly.  I did not replace the old sink ring / clamp, because it was not rusted or worn, and the new unit fit just fine.  It is not easy to lift, push up and hold the unit in place evenly for all three lock points while tightening the rotary clamp, but I managed to get it on there, using the box it came in to prop it up all but the last inch or so.  Took about 45 minutes overall to remove & replace, read instructions, gather tools, and clean up.  I did not buy from Amazon, so paid more at Lowes, but I didn't want to have the kitchen sink "down" in the event of missing parts or broken pieces, etc.  I wanted a nearby source of reliable help in case I got into a jamb.  No worries, it went smoothly.  I suspect some of the complaints of cracked plastic housing and resulting leaks are caused by over-tighening the drain line bolts.  Or by shipping impacts.  No need to have the incredible hulk turn that wrench - just make it reasonably snug, and you've got it.  I gave it 4 stars out of 5, because I don't yet know about the lifespan; the Insinkerator is made by Emerson Electric, and I trust all their stuff - good company.  Noisy?  Sure, a little, it's a grinder - what else would you expect?  No matter how much insulation they put around the motor, the noise is still going to come up out of the sink drain.  And really, how long should it be run?  Just a few seconds.  The new one is just the same noise level as the old.  I believe the key to long life for these is to use it sparingly - don't dump a lot of waste / crap down the sink, it can't be good for your pipes, sewers, etc.  Eat the food, throw away leftover meat, bones, coffee grounds, etc, do not expect a $100 item to grind up all your trash and still last a lifetime - ain't going to happen with any brand.
InSinkErator 143031 Badger 5 Food Waste Disposer with .5 HorsepowerItem delivered on time and was installed immediately. It was not too much problem as this was a replacement. What makes it easy was you don't have to mess around with the top part of the disposer. Just remove the bottom piece (which is under the sink) and reattach the new unit. First, read the instructions carefully. It would make the installation process easier if you have another person to assist. Of course the easiest is to hire a plumber which will cost more than the Disposer.
I wanted to replace my old disposer that began to leak and thought I'd get another Badger since that's what I had.  Then, I read reviews about problems. However, I grew up with insinkerators, and have only had this brand of fairly basic disposers all of my life so I decided to give it another try so it could be easily installed in the existing mounting.  Almost a month into using the new disposer, I am very happy with it and would definately purchase it again.  My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that some disposers have more features than this one.
Not the strongest or the best, but you have to pay more for that also.  This is an excellent disposer for the price.
I had put off replacing the garbage disposal for almost a year. I thought it would be too hard to do it myself and I couldn't find anyone willing to help me do it. When the old disposal started leaking I knew I had to do something. I bought this and installed it myself. It was easy to install, it doesn't leak and it grinds nicely. The first item I tried was potato peel and it took care of it all. I recommend it.
I had my InSinkErator installed by a professional plumber. He installed it in less than an hour. It fit perfectly. I was able to reuse the power cord and dishwasher hook-up from my old disposer. My old disposer which was the same brand and model lasted for more than 20+ years. Good quality product. Delivery was on time and packaged well.
The disposal was easily installed and works very efficiently. The only issue I have is that it is very LOUD when in use. Much louder than my old disposer which was the same brand.
So far so good. I was replacing the same model which was not working long before I occupied the kitchen.  Plumber installed it without any problems.  Too new to report on longevity issues.
Good product.  Easy installation and good instructions.  After installing a power cord, installation took a total of 10 minutes, inclusing plumbing.
This was easy to install. I had the exact sameone, so that may have helped. The old one worked finefor over 16 years and would still be working but I messed itup myself. No fault of the dispoal
Our previous InSinkErator Badger 5 was in our home before we moved in so I am not sure exactly how old it was. We lived in the house for 6 years so it was at least that old, but I think it had been there for quite awhile.About a week ago the sink started leaking and we discovered a hole in the side of the Badger 5 due to the metal being rusted through.I purchased the exact same model and it arrived quickly. At first we were considering paying a handy man to install the new Badger 5, but upon inspection of the instructions, my husband felt confident he could install it himself.The installation could not have been easier. It took him about 30 mins from start to finish with no hiccups or issues. The directions were clear and easy to follow. All hookups went smoothly and everything worked.One thing people should be aware of is that it did not come with the clamp for the electrical wire so we had to use the clamp that came off of the old one for this one. Keep this in mind and keep the clamp or purchase one from the hardware store.All in all it works fine. It has only been a few days so I can't place judgement on longevity. Can't beat the price either!
I purchased the Badger 5, 1/2 HP as part of a kitchen remodel. Although I have not installed this particular one, I have bought and used this model in the past.Its positive qualities:Inexpensive, relatively quiet, easy installation especially if set up as a plug in, equipped with a circuit breaker and an allen wrench receptacle if anything gets hung up and either trips the breaker or needs to be dislodged.Negative qualities: insinkerators have a tendency to get stress cracks in the plastic housings after a few years of usage. Given the cost and ease of installation, this is an inconvenience one can live with especially if you do your own maintenance and install yourself. I have even used JB Weld to repair the cracks while I waited for my replacement with good results.
I didn't want to mess around with changing out all the fittings for a non-badger disposer, so I bought the same brand with 1/2 horsepower and it was easy to replace the old one.  It's quieter than the 1/3 hp that the builder installed in my house when I originally bought it.  The most difficult part was taking the wiring off the old disposer to be used on the new disposer.
Easy to install (as it was replacing another Badger 5). Works great and tough to beat the price.Don't expect anything special or remarkable - it's just an economy disposal which does it's job.
I have a small apartment complex where I have been using the lowest cost (1/3 HP) models for tenants. Two reasons: first, the low cost and second, because I can't always know how a tenant will (or will not) use the disposer.After using the lowest cost disposers for over 20 years now, I find the newest (currently tan housing) models have not withstood regular use for more than 5 years. The older models were of the same blue housing as this next step-up model which I am hoping for at least 5 years use. Our older (blue housing) disposers have lasted at least 5 years and some are now almost 20 years old.FYI: I don't believe ISE is using the same quality metal causing these newer models to rust out quicker but, in my recent experience, I found that people who use their disposer properly will get at least 5 years service...that is acceptable for my purposes in the apartments. I did have 2 ISE disposers that only lasted about 2 years. One was from a tenant who almost never used it and allowed it to rust extensively and corrode from non-use. Using it helps keep it clean too. The second one, I determined was not being used properly, i.e., the tenant was not running water before turning on disposer causing food debris to accumulate in the small chamber below the blades/masticator. I did have one last almost 5 years.I believe if you always run your water first, turn on disposer, then discard food waste down disposer, you will get more longevity from your disposer and less likely have drain stoppage problems. It's also a good practice to run plenty of water (maybe even cleanser) after using the disposer to rinse out the small chamber between the blades and drain pipe. I've found that some disposer stoppages are caused by this chamber being clogged which also causes it to rust and deteriorate prematurely.I'm hoping (expecting) longer use from this 1/2 HP model and rate it 4 stars for now...I will update if there are any issues that occur. Hopefully, I won't have to update my review here.
Self-installed. Age 75. Required more under-sink space than previous item. A bit tricky installing into the clips on the sink drain. Accidently tore about one-inch of flesh off my right wrist when a screwdriver slipped. Injury is healing ok. Finished installation about 2-weeks ago. All is working great. New disposal is much quieter.
easy to install, prompt delivery matched up perfectly this one had a drain for the dishwasher and I had to take it loose to knock  out the plug so the dishwasher would drain.  DO THIS first if dishwasher drains into it
This was very easy to install as an exact replacement. It required almost no tools and took very little time. The original unit was from 1995 and it eventually developed a crack, as they will eventually do. I will be happy if this lasts half that time, and I hope I can still get another exact replacement.The Amazon transaction was an excellent deal and the unit arrived promptly.
We replaced our 10-year old disposer with the Badger 5. It was easy to install and works just fine. I don't know if there could be anything better on the more expensive ones. One thing to notice is that it does not come with a wired-in power cord. So you have to get a cord with a plug and connect it to the unit (I used the one from the old disposer). It is easy to do; just like wiring a light fixture in.
Good price.  Ordered exact same make and model that I replaced so install was very easy.  My old one lasted 12 years and only broke when a spoon fell in and cracked the housing, so I would have to say this make and model is very reliable.
Good quality garbage disposer.  Easy to install, although it was a replacement unit.  Works well with every day garbage and is fairly quiet.
Had an old Badger 5 that started leaking. Ordered a same replacement. Amazon quickly delivered and I installed it this AM. It was easy. Could be due to it being an exact replacement. Been using it for past 8 yrs, so expact this new one to last about same.
I bought this as a replacement for an existing Badger 5 that was about 20 years old and was making a terrible racket.  The new unit works great.  The only problem I had was that the discharge plumbing was inexplicably different from the old unit -- it tucked close down the side of the disposal, rather than sticking straight out for a few inches and then bending down.  That meant a trip to the hardware store to buy a couple of elbows and pipes.  The dishwasher plug was quite difficult to pound out, but eventually came out with no problem.  Other than those items, the new unit went right in in place of the old one.
Insinkerator has 90% market share for garbage disposals, which is pretty impressive.  It seems that they also have the replacement down pat, minus one key factor.The &#34;quick release&#34; of the old unit is a breeze.  It makes this a 30-minute affair to replace.  My previous unit had a cracked housing after years of use, but did not stop spinning.My biggest complaint is that they did not include a new power cord.  I had to remove the old one, reconnect the internal wires, and secure everything down.  For a company with 90% market share, this is simply unacceptable.Other than that, it is a nice, well priced unit, that will chew up most items you throw at it.  Their higher priced units have more power and are quieter, but I didn't see the benefit.  I would definitely recommend this unit.
This item shipped fast!  The directions were clear and my husband was able to install it easily. It works great!  This is the same model number as the one that was installed in our new home 17 years ago.  We're hoping it lasts as long as the original.  I would certainly recommend it to a friend.
Had to replace the same model from about 15 years earlier.  Very simple and quick installation.  I think I had everything completed in 15-20 mins.  Hoping this one will hold up just as long.  the previous one suffered from a crack in the plastic housing that would leak in the cupboard below the sink.
This item arrived very quickly in nice packaging and was super easy to install.  It works great, super quiet and was a nice low price.
I installed the insinkerator and I am not a plumber... The biggest challange is to push the disposer up and turn and hold the top down inside the sink.  I just had a neighbor hold it down for me.  Alot better than paying a plumber $70.00 to do it.  It has been installed over 2 months now with no issues.  Works great!!!!!!!!!!!
Works well, easy to install, good price compared to retail stores like Home Depot or Lowes.  It is a little noisy.
I bought this disposal and installed it myself, and for about five years it worked uneventfully.  Two days ago, it began making more noise than usual, and vibrating.  Close inspection with a flashlight revealed that the shredding disk [where you see the little teeth] had a v-shaped chip, and a piece almost as big as a dime was missing from the disk.  Just as you want a weight-balanced lawnmower blade to reduce vibration, the same principle applies here, and with the shredding disk now having uneven weight distribution, the entire unit vibrated more and made a much deeper, throaty, sound than before.I don't know if I can blame the disposal, as I once turned it on while a heavy-duty nutcracker was in it, and it then made a horrendous racket, nicking the head of the nutcracker and possibly inflicting unseen damage to the disk.  That was a year ago, and I would guess that this weakened the disk and eventually it gave out-- who knows for sure?  We used it constantly, and until now it had been fine, so I will probably buy another one just like it.
it arrived on time and more improtantly was easy to install. I will have to see how long it will last but so far works great!
Aloha,  I bought this as a replacement for my dead unit and it was a very easy installment to make and it works really nice.
