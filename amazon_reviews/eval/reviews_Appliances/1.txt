Sorry:::: but this product caught fire on me and only the new cord that I had plugged into my filter lineI then removed the other two and they were very warmNo Stars on this one they should not be soldHazard plain and simpleXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXI had to rate this item so it would enter system but please don't purchase
I needed a short, heavy duty extension cable with the grounding wire at the end of the plug away from the cable, rather than next to the cable. In the image for the 3 ft. cable, the grounding wire appears to be in the position I needed, but it is, in fact, next to the cable, so would not go into my outlet and I had to return it.
I ordered this specifically because it says "made in usa" in the product details. When it arrived, the cardboard wrapper clearly states that this item is made in Indonesia. After having had several made in China appliances and electrical items recalled due to fire hazards (Apple products, dishwasher, microwave, surge protectors, and dehumidifiers), and reading another review for this exact item where it did catch fire, I was unwilling to trust this item for unsupervised use in our basement.While the item itself gets one star for being not as advertised, I do give Amazon 5 stars for their painless handling of my refund. Excellent customer service! Hopefully they update the description soon so others aren't misled.
I was disappointed that amazon's product description states this is made in the USA.  I purchased based on that information, however upon receiving it, it's clearly marked &#34;made in Indonesia&#34;
while the quality is fine it is not a right angle plug. A right angle plug faces to the right when plugged into an outlet. This one goes straight down.
I purchased this Coleman Cable power source for the GE-New Air heater from Amazon for my garage.  Decided that the cable and recepticle were too large and would restrict the swivle feature of the heater.  I decided to wire it direct with a 220v switch using flex cable from the switch to the heater.  I had to go back to Amazon for the switch as I was unable to find a double pole double through switch locally.
this item was a suggested buy together with the NewAir G73 heater. you will not need it, nor will you need the Coleman supply cord. they are way too big for this application and from an electrical perspective, the NewAir G73 heater is a 2 pole system, it does not have a neutral(white wire). the current is returned through the ground. so find a 240v pigtail and receptacle that apply.
I got suckered into buying this after seeing "frequently bought with Comfortzone heater" for my Comfortzone heater. The heater requires cable with 75 C rating. This is only rated for 60 C :-(.  Check this out: [...]May be good for dryers etc. or heaters that requrie cable with &lt;= 60 C rating.
Don't be looking for accuracy. And if the hygrometer is is important to you... keep looking. For what I paid? I didn't expect much, and I wasn't disappointed.
Very flimsey. It is colorful but the temperature is off least 5 degrees.The picture looks much better than the real thing.If you want to know the correct temperature shpend a little more and avoid this one.
I live by the ocean and the sensor spring corroded. After a few months the temperature was wrong by about 20 degrees.
It is quite colorful but thats all i can say about it  It is cheap. It is plastic. And it is 8 degrees off. Need I say more??? What a complete waste of money.
My Springfield Precision Instruments 13-Inch Thermometer with Heat Index, Wind Chill and Hygrometer arrived in the box face down with no bubble wrap and busted!!  I asked for a replacement and still haven't seen it!!  Obviously a company that doesn't care about the customers!!
It's not worth a dime! Don't waste your time or money on this! It looks good but doesn't work so in the end it's just not worth it!
Very misleading description.....its all plastic and doesn't look very durable...and this was a Christmas gift...then get past that and it doesn't work at all...not pleased...I also left seller feedback stating how very disappointed I was and that it did not work and I've heard nothing
What a waste of money, plastic and my time.  Sometimes the thermometer works but the hygrometer doesn't work ever.  Skip this one.
Doesn't seem to keep temperature or humidity accurately.  Said it was 104 the other day and it couldn't have been more than 85.  Box says to keep out of direct sunlight, but what good is an outdoor thermometer that says that?  I don't want to know the temp in the shade
This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit.  Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low.  The humidity indicator, as others have commented, simply doesn't work.Otherwise, it was an attractive ornament.I just threw it in the trash.If you want to know the temperature, I recommend the dual mercury thermometer for $10, including prime shipping, Reed MM2 Max-Min Analog Thermometer, -40 to 120 Degrees F.You can't see it across the yard, but it's accurate.
This product is poorly made and is not accurate.The back is fully exposed I'm sure it would be ruined after 1 good storm.I sent it back to Amazon 2 days after I received it.Do not buy not worth 2 cents.I long for the days when quality products were manufactured in the U.S.
The items were received on time.The Thermometers 4 of them, received today; are terribly scratched and in bad condition. We were looking to received flawless items, new and in good shape. That's what we thought we were paying for. They looked like used.For the partial pending to be shipped we asked you the seller to make sure they items undergo some sort of quality control inspection to determine if they items are presentable to be displayed in a professional environment if they are not please don' ship and inform us.Regards,KOBELCO COMPRESSORS AMERICA, INC.
The thing says its 84 when it's only 65 outside....... Can't find a way to adjust the gauss in any way. Only a metal spring in the back.
I bought this after returning a Taylor large-faced one with the metal coil that showed temps that were more than 6 degrees above the real temperature.  This one is worse.  The temperature needle does not go above 86 degrees, even when the days are the usual summer temps of 94+ here in GA.  Furthermore, the humidity gauge is a joke.  One very humid morning, I checked at our closest weather station and found the relative humidity was 96%  This gauge showed it to be 70%.  The needle is incorrectly set and often measures way beyond the -0,  minus area, and never up into the 80-90% range.  I will never buy another thermometer with the metal coil, as it is totally undependable.  But there is no excuse for such incorrectly set needles and bad quality coils.  I will stay with the tube types.
This thermometer does not hold up to the weather. It's metallic coils are not covered allowing water to get on them. If the weather turns from cold rain to freezing which is common in the mid-west the wet coils will freeze and not change until the temperature reaches well above freezing. This is what happened to mine and now the humidity needle points straight up and Ido not trust the temperature any more either. Also this product is very sensitive to direct sunlight giving readings up to ten degrees higher when in the morning sun. I would not recommend this unless you plan to use it in a garage or shed.
Very cheaply made.  Loses what little accuracy it has within months.  Cheap fully exposed springs.  Weather fades.  And this thermometer was not exposed to the Sun.  NOT worth it!
Very cheaply made. Product has a coiled piece of metal for temp and humidity. It's about 10 degrees off and humidity about 7 percent off. Looks nice but is way off. Even did a test with a digital and was no where close. Total crap. Also asked for a new one and had them both side by side with the digital and they were both off except the digital. They should be free. Waste of money most definitely
Put it up on wall, temperature was wrong. Came back a little later and found on the ground with clear cover broken. So light it blew off wall with gentle summer breeze. Might be good in doors if you don't care what the temperature is!
If You looking or a out door thermometer do not buy this. Spend more coin, it will be worth it. Because this thing does not work.
Pretty inaccurate on both, RH and temperature.  when I say unaccurate, I mean is up by 10 degrees or so.
Breaks in humidity. Says it's constantly 80% humidity now, temp always at 90. Really disappointed in this product, was hoping for the best.
not worth sending back... but TOTALLY USELESS.  The humidity readings may be &#34;relatively&#34; accurate, but the temperature readings are definitely NOT.  Get something better instead.
I bought several of these temperature/humidity guages both for my own home and to check humidity in other homes since I am a home remodeling contractor. The temperature guage seems to work fine, but the humidity guage doesn't. I have four of these sitting  at this moment side by side on my dining room table. The temperature reads 70 degrees on all four. The humidity among the four reads from 46% to 62%.  Puzzled, I did a Google search for accurate humidity guages in this price range. Apparently, there are none.
My Hygrometer/Thermometer arrived broken - the dial was not connected to the coils behind the plate.  I could take it apart and put it back together (which I did), but then I had to find a way to calibrate it.  If I already knew the temperature and humidity, I wouldn't have needed to buy it!  So it's not clear the reading is even meaningful.  Since it definitely needs calibration (when it arrives without hands on the dials connected), it would be great if you could do so externally rather than by taking it apart (over and over) and forcing the hands to move.Don't expect the instrument to look like anything other than a plastic toy.  The dial looks OK in the photo, but in person, it looks like a $1.00 device you buy at a kid's store.  When you take it apart, you see just two tiny 1/2" diameter coils and that's it.Clearly you get what you pay for when you buy a cheap item (it's not expensive except for shipping).  Don't be fooled by the photo or the rave description.  Calling it "precision" is true irony.
Simply put, this device is inaccurate and can't be relied on at all whatsoever. If it was anywhere near worth the six buks, I'd say so. It's complete junk and they should pay YOU to use it! Just don't buy it. Unless you want to waste a few bucks...
Out of the box it didn't work... neither meter moved a bit.  I kind of agree with the reviewer who mentioned the bait and switch, but if it would have worked at all that would not have even noticed that what i received was not what was pictured.
Very inaccurate.I have two and they never agree, not even close.I would not recommend to anyone. Trying to save money only made me spend more to replace them.
When I got it, the red humidity arrow had fallen off.  I put the red arrow back on, turned it upright and it fell off.Tried again, same.  Last evolution - trash.
I think it would be a great product if they either made it digital or perhaps put a little more money into making it.  It arrived.... broken? (something was rattling inside it) and then about 20 minutes later the thermometer needle fell off and is now free floating.Especially if you look at what the inside label is made out of, it's cardboard and would just rot away in any sort of humidity anyway...I'll just get something better and spend the money for it.I don't blame the product for arriving broken, just... it shouldn't break, yeah? haha
This unit never worked. The temperature reading is completely off - it seems to got stuck and can only move 1 or 2 degrees up and down. It was poorly constructed.
We have compared the temperature on these units to many other sources of temperature sources which all are roughly the same and these units are always way off.  cheap construction too.
Very Cheap! I have 5 of them. not 1 pair reads the same, no way to calibrate anything. for same price you can get a digital one.
The temperature measured by this thermometer (measured inside the house, out of the sun) seemed too high, measured at various times of the day. It was also not close to the posted temperature on the local weather web site (when measured in a shady window.) So I bought another thermometer at the local hardware store. At the moment this device is measuring ten degrees higher than the hardware store device and eight degrees more than the weather web site.  It's too cheap to send back so I plan to trash it. Too bad. It was exactly what I wanted.
Mine doesn't work at all.  It was only a couple bucks, figured it was worth the risk (looks like about 60% chance of it working by reading other reviews).  Mine reads... obviously wrong.  The humidity never changed for weeks in my closet where I'm storing things that I want to monitor... I got suspicious and put it outside when it was humid.  Didn't move from 30%, even though the local weather said 80%.  I gave up on it and left it outside.  It rained, and the thing filled with water.  Still said 30%, lol.  Save your $ and buy a real one.
Humidity guage way off. Unit cheaply built. Dont waste your money. Not much good to say. I am at a loss for words.
This wasn't accurate and the paper backing started to curl after the first few days, making it useless for an outdoor thermometer even though I had it out of direct precipitation.
I wanted this for work. I like to torture myself by knowing how hot and humid the building is where I work. :) But when someone brought in an electronic thermometer and humidity gauge there was a big difference in the humidity. It was about 10% off. The electronic read 78% humidity and 84 degrees. The Springfield read 68% humidity and 82 degrees.
Received thermometer and it does not work. Indicationg 100 and it is only 70 in room. Shake it a little and it moves around. No wonder it is not returnable and being discontinurd.
1. You don't get the hygrometer you see in the picture . You get instead useless tin and plastic product that does not work and does not even look like the item in the picture (The thermometer works but not the hygrometer). Ironically, in correspodence with the condescending distributer, he called this an "upgrade"!! In my book it is false advertising and switch and bait when you show one product but ship another. I asked him in 2 emails to not sell this item or at least to change the photo advertising this item on AMAZON. He did not even relate to my request, but he did return the money. Amazingly, you'd think he'd like to see what the problem is and ask me to return it. NO. He does not care what I do with the 2 junky instruments. He had no interest in my sending them back!!2. Here is what's wrong: I bought two identical items. so it is not that by chance one is not working. The hygrometer DOES NOT MOVE from 48% humdity, ON BOTH identical items I bought. The items have shown 48% all of the time they have been in my house, ever since I first took them out of the box. I know 48% humidity is wrong because I have ANOTHER, different, working hygrometer that shows 67% in the same room with a BIG steam humidifyer, and 55% in the rest of the house!NOW, reader, If one item does not work you would probably forgive and hope your item will work. However, when two of the same product fail there likely is a systemic problem. Right?Don't make a mistake. Stay away from this one.
Springfield Precision 90117 Thermometer/Humidity MeterThe thermometer that I received is not  'Woodstone' as shown but  cheap 'White Plastic'????
This garbage disposal only lasted three years and now the blades are loose and clanks every time it's turned on. Buy a different brand!!!!!! Stay away from this one.
Electrical wires seem to have come undone and I'll need to take apart and rewire.  Information on amazon did not make clear that I needed that I needed to purchase a cord as well.
My old disposal lasted about 7 years before motor failure.  This one developed an internal leak and had to be replaced after only 3 years.
I was pretty happy with the disposal at first but after less than six months of barely ever being used, the unit cracked open.  I didn't notice the crack at first which resulted in a water fall through the cabinet into the basement. Seems to be a theme with this brand.
Badger 5 installed in new home less than three years ago.  Four inch crack on side.  It is above where our trash can touches the unit, so I conclude this is another faulty unit.  I will not replace with another Badger model (same customer service experience: "Oh, sorry.  Out of warranty.  You may buy another one."  Very poor response and quality.
Replaced a dead Badger-5. The new one did not work properly after several seconds and turned to hum then protection button turned off. The body got hot with smell. Followed trouble shooting instruction to loose the product and turned on again. It repeated running seconds then hum and stopped.It may be a defective product with defect in motor to cause overheat.Returned the defective product for refund.
I, ve replaced mine every year and they lied about the warranty...Please people do not buy this brand, it is GARBAGE. ...TRUST Me.......
Like many others here, my plastic housing cracked. Of course, cheap build means more sales, but it sure inconveniences me!
Installed in late 2008. Starting leaking in 3rd to fourth year. Warranty only 2 years. This is a flawed design and/or inferior material. Will not buy another Insinkerator. Cracked housing.Ended up replacing it with Waste King 9930
Installed by a professional in a brand new home in march 2008, Sept 2013 Leaking at power cord . After removing the access panel at the bottom of the disposal I found all of the electrical wiring to be wet.In comparison I installed a GE brand disposal 17yrs ago in another house, and it is still working fine. Looks like I will be purchasing a new ( different brand ) disposal
I have owned two of these disposal units- both developed leaks in the casing just out of warranty.There is an obvious design issue when I read other numerous reviews with the same failures.Avoid
We had to replace after 8 years and had to get the same unit because of space. It's very cheaply built and rusted out and started leaking water. Unbelievable how cheap they make this product.We've had garbage disposals for 35 years and this is the only one that's rusted out.
I noticed a puddle under my sink, forming directly under my 2 year old Badger garbage disposal unit. After clearing out the cupboard area and drying everything off, I ran the water only (disposal off) and, within 1 minute, I saw a drip begin at the bottom of the unit. I traced it up the rear-facing side of the disposal to its source: a hairline crack in the side if the unit.Judging by all of the other similar feedback / complaints on Google (search "badger insinkerator leak"), it is apparent to me that this model#5-81 (perhaps even the brand) is a piece of garbage - no pun intended - and I would highly recommend avoiding this InSinkErator model altogether.** SEE MY UPDATED FEEDBACK in the below comments. I received a FREE replacement unit from the manufacturer's customer service team who is apparently (and cleverly) monitoring feedback here on Amazon. **
Add me to the long list of people reporting cracking.  Normal use for 2 1/2 and the housing cracked and started leaking water.  Because we didn't notice it right away its ruined the base cabinet.  Out of warranty so I am out of luck.
only lasted two years before is started leaking from a crack in the body.  you get what you pay for in this case.
Stay away from this brand. I have had it for 2 years, and for the last year it has clogged every time I try to put potato or carrot peels down the disposal unit.
I bought 4 over the last three years since I own a apartment building.The first one I bought after about 3 years has decide to leak water when the disposal is running. Luckily I had a random bucket under it that saved me from water damage.Now I am worried about the other three that I installed 1-2 years ago. Will they leak after the warranty runs out in another year?I ignored the arnings from others on here, wish I did not now. Money down the drain...
We bought our Badger 5 just over 2 yrs  ago. This was a replacement for an earlier Badger that had developed a cracked housing and leaked. That one was over five years old, so we figured it was a good unit. The installation was easy swap out, but the quality is not the same. This unit just jams, and we free it up with the wrench. It does this every day. Just jams with no visible objects inside that would cause this.  We have septic, and use a disposer very lightly for food particles. No bones, sand or heavy duty uses. They were not interested on hearing my argument since the warranty was up. I'm going elswhere.
Both failed in the same place, the upper plastic case cracked open and started spraying everywhere when on. I guess both were just out of warranty. Replacing mine with Waste King L-2600. (cheaper, 5yr in home warranty and come with a cord installed).
After a couple years the unit started freezing up - it's simple enough to loosen with an allen wrench from the bottom, and I'm okay with that once. It's become progressively more frequent, now out of warranty and time to replace with a different brand. They don't make them like they used to, and repair parts are discontinued.
After 4-5 years of light use this unit started leaking, creating a big mess. I would stay away from anything made by this vendor.
I own a property management business in Oregon and we have a number of properties that require appliances all at once. We frequently purchase several of these to put into our custom homes. My recent experience with the Insinkerator disposal by Badger was very frustrating.Our tenant was experiencing a dripping under the sink several times, and calling our maintenance person, we found there was a very slight crack along the base of the disposal itself, lenghwise. Clearly a problem with a brand new installed disposal.I was directed to Brandon in Manila, Phillipines. I found that providing the serial number they begin the warranty from the date the item was manufactured.I was put on hold for 20 minutes and had to call the tenant twice to get information confirming the Badger product.Their fix was for me to take it to a warranty center to have it repaired. I found their non compliance to be very frustrating even if the employee was pleasant. They have obviously found a way to avoid making their warranty anything more valuable than the letters on the box.
Just read a lot of reviews about the InSinkErator Badger 5 food waste disposer noting a common problem with a cracked housing. Mine is almost 5 years old (installed with the house) and sure enough, it has a cracked housing. Defective product!InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer
I've gone through two Instinkerator Badger 5 disposals in six years.  First one leaked, and the second on just burnt up.  It's a shame, too - I had high hopes for this American made product.
InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP disposer was installed in Sept 2010 in our new home.  Within 12 months it developed a hair line crack which ran vertically through the upper portion of the unit.  The crack eventually became bad enough that I replaced it this weekend with an Emerson Evergrind E202.  Not sure if this unit will fair any better, but it seems to have a metal housing (heavy) and was easy to install  in place of the Badger.  I did have to cut the power cord off the old unit and manually wire it to the new one as it does not come with a power cord.
First one failed after a couple years...locked up.  Second one lasted a couple years longer...only to leak all over the bottom of the cabinet and onto the floor.  If you have wood floors this can be a disaster.  Did some research and found this is a common problem with several InSinkErators.  The corrode, the housings crack.  Ours leaked right through the center...out the cord opening.  Before we noticed a leak we noticed the disposal always stank.  I suspect it was because filthy ground matter leaked into an area where it wasn't getting washed away with a rinse.  We had been bleaching it...but had to do that often.  No more InSinkErators for us.
These Badger disposals are absolute junk. I bought this exact model in February of 2009 to replace the one that came with my condo(condo was 14 years old, not sure about the disposal). After 2 years and 1 month, the housing got a crack and now leaks. I will NOT buy anOther one of these pieces of garbage, especially after seeing how many others have had the same problem. Read your reviews and fix your product badger!
Leaks underneath and now motor bearings are frozen after only about 3 years of light use. Will not buy again.
I have had THREE Badger units in the past 10 years.  In my opinion they are junk.  All of the above 4-5 star reviews are RECENT installs.  All the lousy review are from users that had the units for a while. Do yourself a favor and get a different brand.  You'll be sorry otherwise.  Just my opinion.
I bought my first Badger 5 1/2 HP InSinkErator disposer in 2010 after purchasing a new home and learning that the current disposal stopped working.  Installing the appliance was easy after purchasing a new connection pipe to my current drain plumbing.  However, sometimes the good design features of a product are severely outweighed by the bad design features.  Such is true with this product.After 3 years of light service (we do not put bones or other hard substances into our disposal.  After being scolded for attempting to chop up a nice spoon at my Mother's when I was young, we make sure to sweep the drain before turning it on.) the unit developed stress cracks in the housing which caused multiple leak points under our sink.  After failure analysis, I have determined that the material composition of the unit is less than adequate for the service.  The metal housing on the inside of the unit exhibits extreme corrosion along every wetted surface.  The housing that surrounds this metal core is not of adequate thickness to withstand the vibration and stresses from the deteriorating metal structure.I have attached pictures of the failure for you to view.
Mine was leaking through the motor, it was at least 5 years old (duration of my rental). I decided to expend more effort than economics would favor to see if I could get this thing in serviceable order, see my photos and answer to someone's question for the details. In a nutshell, the failure was due to corrosion. The failure results in nasty water leaking literally through the electric motor (probably creating an electrical hazard) which creates a nasty mess under your sink and could result in damage to your cabinets, flooring, and anything else that happens to be below there. I was unsuccessful in my repair attempt (given another one, I could probably pull it off) but I learned a couple things about the construction of these disposers.We do not use this thing heavily. I suspect that if we were more agressive users of the disposal, we would have done damage to the plastic housing as other reviews complain about.I replaced mine with a badger 1 (because I am in a rental unit) if I owned the place, I would get something with all-stainless steel internals, or just not have a disposer. To me the grinder is not essential kitchen equipmentIf you have a reason to install a crappy disposer unit, save a few bucks and put in a badger 1, and expect a limited service life - otherwise, install something better than this junk.my purchase was made at a local hardware store, had to pay a few extra bucks, but convenience beats Amazon on this one!
Caveat emptor when buying a Badger.I just replaced my second Badger in five years because of the same issue. Like other reviewers have posted, the upper housing (the "grind chamber")on these units is made of plastic and is thus prone to cracking and leakage. These are also NOISIER!! than many other brand units. My recommendation is to either go ahead and spend the money on one of the better designed and quieter "InSinkErator" models or choose another brand entirely. I decided this last go around to get a Waste King "Legend 9940" (Time will tell on that brand, but it gets good consumer reviews). The waste King is much quieter, and it was way easier to install, as it comes pre-wired with a plugged cord, and the Badger requires either installation of a plugged cord (not included) or that a power line/wire be hard wired directly to the unit.The singular thing I do like about a Badger is that if the unit gets jammed, the owner can un-jam the problem by turning the motor by using a hex key/ Allen wrench (supplied with the unit) at the bottom.Bottom line here is that there are better designed units out there for the money spent, in my opinion.
I don't know what the shelf life is for these things, but mine started leaking after it's 4th or 5th year.  The bottom pretty much empties out the water.  Need to replace out the whole thing.  Not worth it.
We had these in our house and kept getting leaks and jams. We replaced them with WasteKing 2600 (which I am absolutely nt affiliated with) and voila, no problems anymore. Do yourself a favor and buy good quality units, not this.
Easy enough to install but didn't last long.  Unit is about 3 or 4 years old and the motor has gone out and it must be replaced again.  Probably all imported crap from China like everything else.
I have lived in my house for only ten years and have already had two garbage disposals.  The last one purchased at home depot was the Badger 5.  This one lasted less than 4 years.  It worked fine while it worked.  Just this week I found a ton of water under my sink and found that the flywheel seal was toast.  I thought I could replace it but the service department indicated that the body is made of plastic and can not be serviced without a high cost.  They indicated it would be most cost effective to buy a new one.I will and I plan to purchase a different brand.  Don't fool yourself I am an Engineer and know they can do better than this.
Here's another one for the list of cracked housings on the Badger 5 model. The unit is only about 4 years old and started leaking from the bottom of the unit.  Service had me run through the usual and never told me that this was a common problem with this model.  I would not buy another insinkerator model at this point, there are too many other good products on the market.  The replacement model for the Badger 5 is the Badger 5 XP if anyone is interested.
Like so many others on this forom, my Badger developed a leak. This kind of stinks for a disposer that is not old at all.
Our Badger 5 is 4 1/2 years old and was installed by builder in our new home.  It has now developed a leak and we just noticed heavy rust on the entire 3 bolt housing.  Haven't determined cause of leak, but have ordered a Waste King L-8000 from Amazon and can't wait to replace this unit. Unit is noisy and under the best of circumstances, takes forever to dispose of food.
Installed a new Badger 5 four years ago. Easy enough to install and it worked fine but it started leaking recently and I found a vertical crack at the back of the body. Called the service line and the warranty is 3 years and of course it went bad in 4. From reading other reviews the body cracking is obviously a common problem that they know about. I asked if they could do anything for me and all they offered was a small discount on the same model - I don't think so. I went with a sure thing and got the Waste King 3300 and it's 10 year in-home warranty after reading the reviews. It goes to show you shouldn't buy anything without doing your research first, not even a garbage disposer.
I owned 2 of these and had problems with both of them.  They both leaked water and were very loud during operation.
Never knew a disposal could be this bad.  It constantly backs up, has been reset numerous times, and backs up more than flood basins in Los Angeles.It has a hard time with......Lettuce.  Ya, lettuce.My last two homes, my disposals worked for years, kind of like the string for opening our drapes.  I was barely aware of their existance, astheir only job is chewing stuff up.  This thing is like a lawnmower with no blades. The worst disposer I've ever owned, or experienced.Other than that, it's fine. :/
Disposals are basically a big motor facing up (most of the unit is the motor) with a spinning plate at the top. Between the motor and the spinning plate, there is another plate/seal to keep all the water up at the top from leaking down through the motor. The Badger 5 is notorious for using a galvanized plate instead of stainless steel. The only explanation for this is they designed the plate to rust to force the unit to be replaced every few years.My Badger 5 came new with my house (I had them replace a broken unit when I bought the house). It began leaking through the internal seal plate, through the motor windings, and all over the floor after exactly 4 years (give or take a week). A quick google search will show you that this is an extremely common problem (which is not surprising since it seems to have been designed to do this). To be clear this is a part is designed to rust, not sane engineer would select galvanized steel for a water vessel unless they were putting a time limit on the life of the unit.
This product really is a piece of junk --- please, please, please do not put one in your home....or your condo, or anywhere, really.  I had one of these in my own home and the steel grinding plate completely rusted out and became worthless way sooner than it should have.  The house I've rented the last three years did the same thing, and the property manager replaced it about a year ago with -- you guessed it --- another Badger 5.  Why?  Because Badger 5s are cheap and they are everywhere.  Now, after one year, one year I tell you!, the housing on the new one is cracking and the thing sprays water all underneath in the cabinet.  I don't even use the thing that much.  It appears I'm not the only one with this problem.  I sort of fixed it by getting down under there in that nasty mess and running epoxy all along the seams.  I'm pretty sure most of you don't want to go through that.  I have now had the misfortune to see three of these things fail.  My advice --  go down to Costco and buy that monster steel disposal they have for the same price as this thing.  I can't believe this thing is made in America.  Shame on you Emerson for making such a piece of junk and sticking a &#34;made in USA&#34; flag  on there.  Honestly, I can't think of a more embarrassingly disgraceful (ie, crappy) product I've ever owned.  I didn't even buy mine here, but thank you Amazon, for letting me warn the world.
Lasted just about two years...I need to check my records to see if it is out of warranty. Dime sized hole developed on top side. Spewed food all over under the sink.  Previous smaller badger model had a metal housing and lasted 11-12 years before a small hole developed. Expected this one too last. Wrong.
I owned a Badger I for 28 years and 11 months.  It was a very dependable product for that time.  After it finally quit, I replaced it with a Badger 5.  After  2 1/2 years, the Badger 5 simply quit working.  The reset button does not help.  Based on the other reviews and my own experience, I will try another brand.
THIS PRODUCT SUCKS.  WE HAD A LOWER END PRODUCT...PROBABLEY A KENMORE...IN OUR OLD HOUSE AND NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT.  THIS INSINKERATOR CAME WITH OUR HOUSE AND WE HAVE TO PLUNGE IT CONSTANTLY.  DO---NOT---BUY.  THE COMPANY SHOULD RECALL THIS PRODUCT AND GIVE EVERY PO'D CUSTOMER A NEW ONE.
Why would they not install a cord so that it can be plugged in without a hassle? I guess the answer is they are just cheap.  The want to show a lower price than GE or Whirlpool so they leave parts off.
Got the whole cabinet wet before we realized.  Seems to be a common problem after Googling around.  I'll be switching brands.
We are on our third Badger in 5 years.  They last at best 2 years then fall completely apart.  The housing just cracks.  I do not recommend this product at all.
My tenant's Badger 5 is leaking from a crack in the plastic housing.  I read so many bad reviews about this happening over and over, even when replaced it cracks and leaks.  Now I have mold in the bottom of the cabinet and warped wood which costs money to get rid of it.  Called Insinkerator company and they denied any other complaints.  I told them that was not true and to read all the reviews on Amazon and other websites.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and they have to call me back.  This is ridiculous that there is no recall when so many have this same exact problem. I have to pay someone to replace it.
&#34;You asked the question & I will tell you the truth only&#34;This disposer was represented as missing a screw/bolt ONLY!When it was unpackaged by ME, the overload switch was pushed into the motor windings and end switch for engaging start windings was broken & part of the switch mechanism was missing(apparently removed before shipping)which implied the damage was known! Along with that damage there was electrical arcing to the windings which indicated there was a major problem with the disposer(again I state that this unit was misrepresented). I would caution everyone dealing with this company to RUN don't WALK away from them and spend your hard earned money with reputable companies!! This reflects POORLY on Amazon and their associates. The cost of returning the merchandise was cost prohibitive and was my lesson learned about Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Dissatisfied customerJim L.
Not sure how old our Badger 5 is since it was already in the house when we moved in 2 years ago. After realizing the leak under the sink was coming from the disposal, we began the hunt for a new disposal. I'm so glad I came across these reviews before replacing with another faulty Badger. We'll go with the Waste King this time around.
The housing broke on both of mine.  House was built 3 years ago.  I have 2 kitchen sinks and both aerators have broke at the housing.  DO NOT buy this disposal!
Whithin 2 years of instalation the chamber rusted all the way through and started leaking. JB Weld gave me another year of service without leaks. The unit ran well and quiet untill I replaced it for new leaks, with a disposal without a metal chamber.
My brand new home came with a brand new Badger 5 disposal unit.  Within 3 years, the housing cracked (a common problem with these units) and sprung a leak.  This is something that cannot be repaired.  When I called customer service, I was informed that this one is out of warranty, so too bad, so sad ... go buy a new one (great marketing huh?) ... so I will, but not one of theirs.
This thing fell apart after 3 years of light usage and to my surprise it only had a 2 year warranty.  My fiance bought me a nice one but it didn't fit in the space so I ended up with another badger.  I went to install it last night and when I went to attach the cord (rather than just having one preinstalled) the instructions mention that you should attach the cord (NOT INCLUDED) -- emphasis added.  They could not even charge $2 more and include the cord?
I have had two of these with plastic housings and both lasted about 4 years before the got stress cracks and started to leak.  The housings were slightly different designs and I thought maybe they had fixed the design but I guess not.  We only use sparingly so it may only last a year or so if you use a lot.  Plus is the design hasn't, changed in twenty years, so you do not have to change the flange that is already on the sink and it will still line up with the old pipes. They do work ok and are relatively cheap. The older ones were metal at lasted about 8-10 years. I think I am going to try a different brand this time around.
The unit came in the town home my daughter purchased, so she didn't get a choice of brand. Amazingly (sarcasm), the housing has developed several vertical cracks. I see that this is a common issue with this model. Having worked in both design and manufacture of consumer goods, I find it amazing that, as seems to have happened with some 1-star reviewers, the "expired warranty" response would be used by the company when there is obviously a design flaw. Jackie, no need for a response for this review; we are buying a new one from one of your competitors.
The unit is just over 3 years old with a 2 year warranty. The cast zinc side wall of the grinding section of the unit is corroded through.  Junk!!! The machine is garbage and the warranty is garbage. Products like this just give the manufacturer, Emerson, a bad name.  No more Emerson junk in my house.Now to find a quality unit that'll last 15 years like my first one.InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer
I like others, noticed a leak under the sink.  When i inspected, I noticed the housing had two cracks letting liquid drip out when in use.Very cheap quality.  Customer service is useless.Beware.
I did not buy this product.  It was already installed when I moved in.  I don't know how old or how long it had been there, but it began to leak at the bottom, making it impossible to use 1/2 of my dual basin sink without a bucket underneath which would have to be constantly emptied.Knowing nothing about plumbing, I figured it was old and needed to be replaced.Thinking that if I buy the identical model, my lack of plumbing skills would not be as big a problem taking out the old broken one and putting in the new one.After seeing how many reviews indicated problems with leaking, which my old one does, I am no longer sure I should try to replace with the identical model.The number of people complaining about it leaking out of the bottom couldn't be some sort of coincidence.  I really looked over my existing one and could not determine where or how the leak was coming from, but a broken/cracked inner casing explains it very well.I am not sure anymore that this is a do-it-yourself project for me.  I am just glad and thankful for everyone's honest reviews.
Bought one of these a few years ago at one of those nationwide home improvement chains to replace a disposal that had lasted about 8 years.  It lasted MAYBE a couple of years.  Bought a replacement last January from Amazon, installed it.  It lasted just over 12 months, and died with the same problem - motor seizes up.  We're not heavy users, never put bones or anything like that in the disposal.  It gets light duty.I'm going to see what my warranty options are, but I'll be replacing with a different manufacturer.  Fool me once, shame on them.  Fool me twice...
We moved here in 1994 and I, while remodeling the kitchen, decided to replace the 23 year old GE Disposall with an InSinkErator. That was the first one. In 1998 that one stopped grinding - ran but really only swirled the garbage - barely. New one - and that one ran until the innards rusted out in 2005. Replaced it with the slightly more expensive stainless version. Last night, 27 June '08, the motor started to overheat(smelled the hot insulation), made some loud growls and when shut off, instantly stopped. It still works but barely. My guess is that a motor bearing (sleeve?) is failing. Now I have to buy a new one - but what do I buy? We seldom grind anything more difficult then veggie peels, with an (very) occasional chicken bone. My history with these, at least the lower end versions is that they are junk. Oh yes, I also replaced a 2 year old unit at my daughters house. Did I say that these are IMO, junk???? (Interesting - just out of warranty they "die" - planned obsolescence maybe)
The disposer did not work. I had to return it and go to local Home Depot to get a new one.
Broke just under two years...completely rusted, etc.  I would spend more money and buy a better model.  Don't waste time.
Unit is just over 2 years old.  Used "maybe' once a week for 10 seconds as I don't put food down the drain.  Just run it to clean out any small scraps that went down drain.  Unit started leading and it turns out the entire case is cracked in half!  Thought it was a defect in manufacturing, but I notice many others have the same product.  Guessing InSinkerator builds these just strong enough to last 2 years before they fail.  Very sad since it looks brand new and motor still works perfect.
Lasted a whopping 5 years under light usage.  Leaks and rusts.  I had a Kitchen Aid last 12 years before we wrecked it by putting something bad in it.  I've read this is a common problem w/these units but no help from the company.  I believe this is a manufacturing defect.
Now granted, I purchased this for a condo I was selling and it didn't get installed until recently.  I was told by my contractor that when he opened the box it was a used disposal and was blowing black smoke.  Nevertheless I had to have him purchase a new disposal. Guess I won't be buying any home improvement items on Amazond.
I have had the same problem everyone else has, cracked caseing and leaking. Now I have to find a new disposal as the dishes are stacking up. We can't run the dishwasher either as the wastewater goes past the disposal before it goes down the drain.To keep it breif this model sucks and they've lost another customer.
Mine was installed by a handyman, but neither he nor I wrote down the serial # of the unit. But I had the bill with the model # and date of purchase. So when it stopped working at only 11 months, Insinkerator wouldn't send a repairer out unless I read them the serial # from the back of the unit which was under the sink. I can't get back there; I'm old. The repairer is not even an employee; he's an independent contractor. So I called him and promised to pay him myself if he found the unit was no longer under warranty when he removed it, but he said he's not allowed to come to the home without the serial #. So I paid my handyman to remove it and brought it back to my local chain hardware store where I had bought it. The owner gave me a credit and told his supplier no more insinkerator for his store. If I had bought it from Amazon, as I usually do, I would have been out of luck. Disgraceful customer service.
My garbage disposal probably gets used 5 times a year.  I just don't use it that frequently.  I have had this one for 3 years and it has cracked and filled the entire area under the sink with water.  Needless to say, as it is out of warranty, I have no interest in ever buying another badger proJust ordered the Waste King L3300.  The reviews are great and it has a 10 year in home warranty.  A little more expensive, but not enough to be a deal breaker.  Besides, water under the sink can cause VERY expensive damage!
Back in October 2002 our builder put a Badger 5 disposer in our new home. Today as I write this review my husband is replacing the Badger 5 for the third time. Three Badger 5 garbage disposals in less than ten years tells the story. Each disposer lasts just long enough to outlive it's warranty. After purchasing this third Badger 5 I stopped to read the Amazon reviews. I now wish I had read the reviews before buying this third disposer. It appears we are not alone in the housing cracking complaint. Let me warn all current Badger 5 homeowners that this time the disposer crack leaked enough water as to totally destroy the sink cabinet floor and sides of the cabinet. We had standing water over an inch deep when the leak was discovered. Now we have a major kitchen cabinet mess to fix not just replacing a dead garbage disposal. Would I recommend a Badger 5? Not knowing what I know today. If you purchase a Badger 5 expect to be replacing it every three years. Next time we switch to a different brand disposal even if that means calling in a plumber to install it.Let me also add that I found a product called Sink & Vanity Protector (Google it because sadly Amazon doesn't carry anything like this product). It is made to fit under the sink and protects your cabinet floor from water leak damage. I wish I had found this product BEFORE our leak. If you own a Badger 5 disposer you need this protection and I encourage you to buy one to prevent a mess like ours. Best tip is just don't buy this brand.UPDATE 1/7/2014 and this Badger is dead. Grinding up a lemon and it died today. Obviously this company's products aren't worth wasting your money.
Bought a house, 5 weeks later the disposal started leaking from a crack in the housing. Yup, the Badger 5 1/2 HP that seems to crack all the time from what I read. I bought a new one from Home Depot and just for kicks looked up other prices and reviews. 30 dollars cheaper from Amazon but I read all the reviews and am bringing it back tomorrow. Will probably get a Waste King.Finally some reviews that were really helpful! I hope this helps others too.....
It was a used defective unit and different than an open new unit that was advertised.Please advise sellers to be honest and do not waste peoples time.
Unit installed by the builder.  Less than 5 years old and leaking from case, just like the others.  Lived in previous home over 10 years, never had a problem with the unit that came with it (which may have been 15 yrs old already!).  Purchasing a Waste-King because of the high number of great reviews.
This unit was installed in our house right before we moved in 6 years ago.Earlier this week it gave up, producing only a humming sound despite not being stuck.For something you install in your home, I expect to get at least 10 years out of it, if not 20.  having to replace it after only 6 years is completely unacceptable.
this is a false markup by amazon. Its an $85.00 unit yet they say it is $180.00BS
I bought this unit in June,2012 and had the plumber install it. When he turned it on it was very loud and vibrated my sink so much I didn't use it very much, thinking the problem might get better after a break-in period. After 7 months it got louder and still was vibrating so much that I was afraid the bottom of my metal sink would crack.I called Amazon about the problem and was advised I had had it too long for a refund but to call the Badger Co. and see if they would replace it. Since, I do not want another Badger product I just ordered a Waist King and considered the Badger 5 a total loss. Also, another plumbing charge, I will have to pay.This is the problem of ordering on line. You can't return it to the store and buy a better unit. Walmart would have taken it back for a refund on a better unit.So, what I am saying is DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT unless you can live with the loud noise and vibration. I think this is pure junk.Update: 03-05-13- I just got an e-mail about the problems from the Badger5 Company wanting to know about the problems and I e-mailed them today about them. Will update about their reply. So far I have been out about $380 for instalation charges and the cost of buying and installing another disposal. So far, this has been an unpleasant expensive experience.Addendum: I talked to the representative about the problem I had and they picked the unit up and examined it. They called me back and stated 'NO PROBLEM' with the unit. So, I guess all of the units are extra loud and create a lot of motion!We installed a Waist King and I can not believe the difference. It is quiter and does not vibrate.
Do not buy. Light use but it has still developed 3 vertical cracks in the housing and leaks. I found many similar complaints online. Very disappointed in this product and will not buy another.
I have had the same problem everyone else has, cracked case and leaking. Now I have to find a new disposal as the dishes are stacking up. We can't run the dishwasher either as the wastewater goes past the disposal before it goes down the drain. I  have never had a problem with an InSinkErator before and never heard of any problems but this model sucks and they've lost another customer.
When you turn the the diposer, the crunching sound is very large. After one moth, egde started leaking. not money worth.
After a leak started, I found a rusted crack in the side of the disposal. It was just out of warranty, just a little over a year old, so I had to replace it. When looking into the warranty at Lowes, the guy who I spoke to said that they had had several complaints of this same thing.
I am very disappointed with this product.  I bought my home 4 years ago, with a new Badger 5 installed.  I live alone, don't cook every day, and don't abuse the disposal.  For a piece of equipment that was treated gently, this product is junk.  I have spent the last two weeks dealing with leaking in my basement, a clogged up kitchen sink and troubleshooting how to fix the problem.  I will research better products and replace my broken Badger 5.
....then like many others have reported, the plastic housing cracked and it leaked like crazy. It still worked fine, it just sprayed water all over. I tried to epoxy the housing, but it cracked in a different spot about a month later. I finally replaced it with Waste King unit that is quieter and has a 5 year warranty.
I replaced my cracked body Badger 5 with a new one.  The same thing happened, just outside of warranty, the body split open and caused water damage to my cabinets.  This is getting rediculous, maybe we need to unite against this horrible product and company!
After just over two years of light usage (most of my food waste goes into the compost pile,) this thing started leaking badly from the housing.  Purely by coincidence, I'm sure, the two year warranty had just expired.  Insinkerator assures me that I cannot repair the problem myself and that I will have to place a service call.I'll be replacing it with aWaste King, which is 1 HP (instead of 1/2) and has a lifetime warranty.  I don't know if it will be better, but at least I won't be hearing those magic words "I'm sorry, it's JUST out of warranty."
My plumber just came to install it.  I ordered a NEW unit.  Although the box appeared new and unopened, the green pats bag inside the box was MISSING the metal plate that connects the unit!!!This is the first problem I have had so far at Amazon.  But it did not come cheap!Should have bought it at Home Depot
We purchased and installed a Badger 5 in 2007.  Now, after five years, it is leaking from the bottom of the housing unit.  There's also a bit of corrosion on the top metal flange/latching mechanism.  Based on many of the other posters' comments, it sounds like our unit lasted a bit longer; however, I still find the build quality disappointing.  I wish companies would take more pride in their products and run their businesses with a long-term view rather than cutting corners to make a quick buck.
We have just had our 3 year old unit fail completely in the same way Paul did.The plastic housing is cracking.  Of course this is not something that can be fixed by replacing a washer or something simple.When I phoned their customer service, I was told that as it was out of the 2 year warranty, they were not interested.  While I can understand this for minor problems, it is pretty bad when the unit is completely worthless such a small time after installation.Emerson products might have been good 20 years ago, but they sure aren't now.Unless you like doing plumbing repairs, steer clear.
Installed the Insinkerator Badger 5 in the spring of 2008 when I renovated my kitchen. It no longer grinds up anything any more, just beats it to death. A 1" square piece of watermelon rind jammed it a couple of days ago. I finally gave up and fished a chicken thigh bone out of it and put it in the trash last night.  This is after only FOUR short years of light use by a little old lady who lives alone! And the only disposal I've ever owned that wasn't still doing at least a passable job of grinding up food after 10 years. In reading online reviews from various sources, 2-4 years is about typical for the Badger now. It's cheap, but which really costs more in the long run--a $70 disposal every 2-5 years, or $100 disposal every 8-10 years?I didn't get that one from Amazon...but I did buy a KitchenAid from Amazon this morning that's only a little more money and gets much higher reviews. Hopefully, it'll last a bit longer.
This ubnit came with our how (new construction). After three months of use, the motor burnt out and it was under warrenty and replaced. Now, 2.5 years after the replacement, i found that the body of the unit has a crack running almost the the entire length of the body. It's not like a disposal has a lot of water pressure pushing out of it. Based on the number of similar complaints and my own persoanl experience with this disposal, it appears that this is a device that was constructed poorly and I would avoid the unit all together.
I purchased a Badger 5 in early spring 2010.  I live alone, never put bones into it. kept it clean, never used any sort of draino but the motor died just after 3 years of use.  By then it out of warranty.
Buyer beware.  The InSinkErator Badger disposal that was in the house at the purchase time is leaking from the reset button.  I certainly will not replace it with a Badger product.  I gave it one star because there was not a zero star option.
Installed the unit 2 1/2 years ago.  Two year warranty is par for the course.  Lasted 6 months beyond the warranty.  Piece of junk.  Buy something else.
Our badger 5 literally broke in two this afternoon.  the plastic just literally broke.  and the disposer broke into two pieces.  never had that happen before.  we bought it 4 months ago.
My disposal is only a couple of years old and started to leak under the bottom. Do not buy this product. After reading the reviews this is a problem with this model.
Installation is straight forward and the quality of the materials is very good.  The problem is their idea of impellers or blades.  There are just 2 moving parts that grind things up and they more or less bash the food into smaller pieces.  If you put anything small such as the ends of a carrot or an apple core, the initial bashing works, but very shortly the remains of the food spin to the outer edged beyond the reach of the impellers and it just stays there.  Turning the unit on and off and on and off 5-6 times will eventually work but this is not even close to the quality of grinding I saw on much older models.  They could have solved this problem with the simple addition of another impeller (cost about 78 cents) but as it is you will be cleaning out bits of food a lot.UPDATE: They seem to have cut the warranty in half since mine was purchased just a few months ago.  Not a good sign.
We moved into a brand new house six weeks ago and it came with this disposer.  I don't like it at all.  It won't handle anything unless it's pretty well chopped up before I put it in the unit. It seems to get stuck and turn off automatically about every other time I use it, especially if there's anything 'chunky'. I can't even put a half of a lemon down it without it stopping, then I have to put the wrench in it and restart, which is a hassle to have to do so often. Besides that, there's a terrible fishy odor that comes from the part of the unit that is underneath the sink. We've tried hot water, baking soda, disposal tabs, etc. and doesnt seem to help. the odor intensifies when we are disposing of a larger quantitiy of food.  We had an insinkerator at our old home that was at least 20 years old, and never gave us one problem. Since it's a new house, there wasn't anything put down it before we moved into it. It seems like a cheaply built unit and I bet there are better models out there.  I will be looking into the warranty before it's up.
I've had 3 badger units go bad in the past week.  2 leaked through the bottom and one rusted frozen. I handle property management issues, so I'm seeing these don't last.  One was a 1/3 hp unit, 1 year warranty - leaked.  1/2hp -leaked, says a 5 year warranty but I question why the warranties are 2 years old.  Another 1/2hp unit frozen.  I managed to free it up with the wrench, but it sounds horrible now and I suspect it too will leak soon.  Read the review on Home Depot!!  you will see these are crap.  They worked great at first, but fall apart quickly.
Today I opened the kitchen cabinet and noticed water dripping from the bottom of this garbage disposal. A quick internet search shows many customers with this same problem. The unit is not customer repairable but must be replaced. The leak damaged the cabinet and dripped into the basement. I will not purchase this brand again.
Bought a Badger 5 1/2 HP unit on 1/5/2008 and it is now making very loud sharp noises. It lasted 2 years and a few months, just long enough for the 2-year warranty to expire. A previous InSinkErator unit a few years. Time for a different brand.
You can add yet another customer to the long list of those who had problems with this unit leaking. The disposal was only a few years old when it began leaking terribly. From doing some research, there really is no fix. Stay away from this product.
My Badger 5 worked as expected until just after the 2-year warranty expired.  Then while searching for the source of water under the sink and odd bits of crust on the disposer, I discovered several cracks in the grind chamber housing.  When I filled the sink with water and cranked up the disposer, it became something very like a feature at a kids' waterpark -- but much less fun.ISE responded to my complaint with an offer of a discount on a new Badger but would not provide any assurance that its design or manufacture had been changed to address this apparently common problem.  I'm used to disposers lasting for decades, not months, and don't enjoy spending time off under my kitchen sink, so I'm going to try a Waste King this time around.
This disposal was installed in my new house. We have lived here for just over 3 years and the disposal began leaking from the bottom. Like most people, I don't go under the sink a lot so I don't know how long it has been leaking but there is damage to the wood.The bottom line is, the disposal was not abused and should not have broken in 3 years. I read other reviews and this is a fairly common problem with this unit.If you are a non plumber like me and are looking for a replacement you should know that the Waste King 2600 will swap in with no adjustments needed to your existing plumbing. Make sure you order some plumbers putty and you should be able to replace your disposal in 30 minutes.Hope this helps the novice like me!!
It amazes me how high this item can be rated with such a pervasive sentiment of poor quality!  Read these reviews, see how many have experienced the same exact "housing crack" caused leaking, and others that had theirs leak from the motor bottom.  (bad internal seal failure)  If the disposal leaks prematurely, just beyond the 2 year warranty or it lasts less than 10 years... that rates a 1 on the 1 ~ 5 scale to me.  Either customer expectations are going to an all time low or Amazon shoppers are afraid to give an honest review rating.  Simply put, this is an inexpensive garbage disposal that IF it lasted 10 years between failures, your annual cost is essentially $8 bucks a year.  Not bad, just keep putting the same model in because it THEN takes only 15 ~ 30 minutes and you can do it yourself. If you want HIGH quality and long life, pay more for an all stainless steel interior model.
This disposal lasted 3 years before the seals broke. It's not very quiet and it seems that many people are having the same problem with seals being an issue. We are cautious about what we throw in the disposal so it's highly unlikely that it's user error. From experience, let me express how this is not an item you want to save a little bit of money and chance it breaking in a few years. Gross food water is not something you want spraying under your sink and is an absolutely awful smell if you don't catch it immediately. Now imagine a decent leak allowing enough water to saturate the floor and drip down into your basement.. That's right, food particle water dripping into your basement. Spend a little extra and buy a better product because this is not the one you want to put in your house.
Insinkerator used to be "the name" is garbage disposals.  Now, its just a piece of garbage.  Shortly after the warranty expires, so will your Badger 5, but not before dripping water, food goo and gunk under your sink.  After reading all these bad reviews, are you really gonna buy this hunk of junk?
I am on my second disposal 5 years. In both cases the housing has developed a hairline cracked which leaked into the cabinet of my brand new house sink base. I will not be purchasing another.
Was replaced twice under warranty.  Now it's out of warranty and it just flooded the kitchen.  I'll be replacing it with another brand.
Installation notes: 31 Dec. 2011I installed this in my kitchen today. My review is only about the installation process and the initial trial. I'll write another one after I live with it awhile.I am having lots of hate for the snap ring, and how it seems to require turning the entire kitchen upside down just to finish the installation. This is an exaggeration, but not by much.The unit mounts onto an assembly that forms a seal with the sink's aperture. The seal is achieved with plumber's putty or a similar mastic. The problem is, two of the installer's hands are needed to hold that part still, while two more hands to hold three parts in place underneath the sink. Then two more hands to expand the snap ring and clip it into place. The operation is somewhat delicate because the seal at the bottom of the sink can be compromised if the assembly gets jostled around too much.For what it's worth, a can (30 oz or so of crushed tomatoes or pumpkin) is the right diameter to place on the sink ring, then a board on top of that, then any dead weight greater than the force needed to put the snap ring into place (about 3x the disposal body's weight in my case.) Ymmv of course. The water drain part went right in to my existing plastic pipe trap.You have to supply your own parts to provide strain relief and/or conduit connections for the electrical connection. The part I got to fit to the dispos-all's body said '1/2" knockout' which is a standard electrical box knockout size, here in the US at least.After installation it ran just fine on the GFCI-protected circuit available near my kitchen sink. I never take running a motor on a GFCI circuit for granted. This one worked.========Living with it. Written 23 Aug. 2012As promised, updating the review after 8 months or so of living with it. Downgrading from 3 stars to 1.I hate it.Good: Runs every time I switch it on. Turns off every time I switch it off.Rest: It only works on a small majority of the foods one would legitimately expect it to handle. It's like the printer in CollegeHumor's "you printer is a brat" video (this shows up easily in web search.) I find myself throwing food in the trash in order to avoid the hassle of fishing out the unground chunks. It's easy to tell when this is needed because of the irritating noise it makes.It was like this from day 1, but somehow I wanted to like it and hoped it would get better. Nope.
I replaced a similar but less powerful model and it was very easy to just switch them, using the electric cord from the old model.  Fast, east and IT WORKS.  what else might be important?  Longevity but I can't speak to that now.  I am well satisfied as ease of installing was my main concern.Well, less than two seasons in the Florida Condo and the initial use yielded a buzzing followed by electrical meltdown.  It appears the unit rusted internally, totally seizing up!  Cheap internals equal bad buy!  Sorry if my initial, positive review resulted in anyone experiencing the same.  Probably not a problem if used daily but this unit is NOT SUITABLE FOR SEASONAL USE.
I am copying the text from the previous review because I have the EXACT same experience.  I bought the unit on 3/13/06 and today it developed a serious leak... here is the other reviewer's text: After 4-5 years of light use this unit started leaking, creating a big mess. I would stay away from anything made by this vendor.
My 1/2 horse Badger 5 disposal failed prematurely.  It had a 1 year warranty and was about 2 years old.  Very disappointing...We don't do any heavy duty grinding.  (No bones, never got a spoon or anything else stuck...) The repair guy says he sees a lot of premature leaks since they went to a lightweight plastic mount.I'm going to let the repair guy put a new Badger in because he has one in stock, but this will be my last Insinkerator Badger. When we get the new kitchen counter tops and sink, I am going to go with a better one!
We bought the Badger 5 Plus model about six years ago.  It is the same as the model 5 except there is added sound insulation around the top of the unit.  After about two and a half years it began leaking out the bottom of the unit- I started checking out if there was a way to repair it, but there wasn't.  I then noticed this unit came with a three year in-home warranty, so I called and the company had a service technician come out and replace the unit at no charge.  After another three years, this one is leaking out the bottom!  Time for a new disposal, and guess what?  There's no way I'd buy another one of these- in fact I'm not going to take a chance with any InSinkErator product at all.12/24/2012here's an update- we bought a G.E. disposal that has just been what you'd expect from a disposal- it grinds up food like it should, and doesn't leak!  Also, I just replaced another Badger 5 for a friend, theirs had a big hole corrode through the side (high enough that water didn't flow through, but food was thrown out into the cabinet), about six years old.  They won't buy any more InSinkErators, either.
Leaking through bottom around wires. Barely used over 4 years, usually clogged up and was very loud.  I hardly ever used it because I always ended up ind the sink hand cranking the thing to clear it.  Horrible unit. Will not buy this brand again.
This disposer was inexpensive, but after seven years it started a (relatively) slow leak which went undetected. It seeped under our floor tile and now one is loose, and the heated floor stopped working from the moisture - we may have to have the floor redone. What a hassle to save $100! I would never buy Insinkerator again!Other info:It was extremely loud.It made the lights go dim when turned on.It's poorly designed. It was completely rusty inside, and I saw It had accumulated food goo around the discharge port when I took it off. Now I know why the drain always smelled bad (despite grinding up ice and lemon peels to attempt to clean it).Even when it's empty - and on - it slowed down the draining of the sink so the incoming water was faster than the drain (we had a completely new kitchen put in with new plumbing so it's not the drain).Get another brand if you're smart. Insinkerator is a time bomb ticking under your sink.Pros: - easy to remove when it fails,- cheapCons: - Not Durable,- smells due to food accumulation,- slow draining,- rusts internally
Like others stated, our Badger 5 lasted less than 5 years after light use - developed leak and must be replaced. We have to have a plumber install it so it's going to cost us... Going try Waste Kings which have a MUCH longer warranty (and better reviews)
I purchased the new home with InSinkErator Badger 1 disposer two years ago (~3 years old), I saw leaking a week ago. When I examined closely I noticed that  there is a crack in the plastic housing unit, not bottom, top part.  When I look at the customer reviews from Amazon, almost everybody complain about the same problem. It seems that the problem has been here for at least six years, but it has not been solved yet. My attempt to reach to customer service was unsuccessful, when I start explaining the problem, the phone is disconnected. I will try tomorrow again. I am planning to buy a different brand.
We are very disappointed in the quality of this product.  After 5 years of moderate use, a crack appeared in the side, causing water to spray everywhere in the cabinet and on the floor.  This is now a useless product to me and I will be looking at other manufacturers to replace my disposal.  I'd heard such good things about this brand, but clearly this is a problem with this model.
Worked well for about 6 years.  Then it silently damaged the under-the-sink cabinet before we realized it was leaking from the bottom screws.  Must be made with substandard materials.  No where in the Installation Manual does it warn about this potential problem.  Company has no integrety.  My suggestion to who ever built this thing would be to put in a more durable bottom.  And this would not require educated engineers.  Just someone with common sense.
My wife and I remodeled our kitchen two years ago this month and installed a new InSinkErator Badger 1 to replace our much older InSinkErator.  Being short on funds due to the kitchen remodel, we bought the Badger 1 as it basically looked the same as our old one that lasted at least 10+ years.This month our Badger 1 model's case cracked about mid-case and ran 3&#34; right up the side to above the blades.  Every time the disposal ran, it splattered water out the crack, which we did not notice because it is inside the sink cabinet.  Unfortunately, not enough water came out to also come out the cabinet or we would have noticed it earlier.  Over time the standing water warped the cabinet floor.Now that I have just taken it out, I noticed it is lighter than I remember the old disposal because I can hold this up with one arm while unlocking it from the sink, and I remember needing my wife to loosen the locking ring while I held up the old one using two arms due to its weight.  This disposer's housing is plastic, not metal like the old disposal; the bottom half looks like dark gray painted metal but tapping on it shows it is plastic.This is just another cheap product Home Depot has switched over to the last 10-15 years to stay financially competitive.  I sure wish they would sell American quality products, which lasted much, much longer.
I bought a new house in 12/04, the badger-1 came with the house. Worked fine for five years, I live alone and eat out most of the time so I rarely used it. However, I made guacamole one night as I had done several times before and put the peels in the disposal. The next morning I noticed a strange sound when running the disposal, so I looked inside the rubber seal and saw that the peels were gone but the interior was rusted. I then looked under the sink and was horrified to find that it had been leaking for who knows how long, with black mold everywhere. I will never buy another insinkerator product.After looking at reviews on Amazon, the Waste King Legend 8000 seems to be the way to go, with a lifetime in-home service warranty, averaging 4.7 out of 5 stars, and only fifty-two dollars more than the incredibly poor-performing badger.
Horrible, horrible, horrible product.  Do not buy.  1/3 hp barely enough power to grind Jello.Spend the extra dollars for the Badger 5 or Badger 7.  Even if it is for your rental or you're replacing to sell the house.  Do the right thing.
Before renting out my dad's house, we updated it including installing a Badger 1. The unit lasted 5 years BUT WAIT, the house is only rented 3 months out of the year making the Badger's life only 15 months. It locked up when the house was vacant and, when I turned it with the provided wrench, I could hear the grinding of rusty metal. To date it has yet to leak, but you know it is coming when it locks up in one week of not being used.Our previous ISE (not a Badger model) in our own home lasted nearly 20 years so I replaced it with another ISE. If it does not last as long as the first one, I will chalk it up as another example of hidden inflation -- cheaper made products but selling at near original prices.UPDATE: Manufacturer's ResponseOut of nowhere I received an email from a company rep. He had specific questions on the behavior and lifespan of the product which enabled him to diagnose the problem. After doing so, he said the product should not have failed under those conditions and offered to replace the unit free of charge and free shipping! Yesterday, Aug. 6, it arrived as promised. With all of the criticisms I have heard about American companies, stories like this one need more press. As a businessman, I can appreciate the pressure to produce a product at a price people are willing and able to pay while striving to do so in compliance with all the laws, regulations, overhead and materials costs businesses face. I never expected a company rep to read Amazon reviews in order to better reach that goal. The Badger 1 itself remains rated at 1 STAR, but the company rates 5 STARS. Thank you ISE.
I have owned this nightmare for three years.  Even before the housing cracked and ruined my kitchen cabinet, the thing shook the whole wall of cabinets every time I turned it on.  It sounded a lot like a lion gargling rocks from the first time we turned it on.  Piece of junk builder's special.  NEVER BUY THIS GARBAGE VOLUNTARILY!
There must be some kind of systematic design flaw with this model.I've owned two of these little monsters, and on both of them, the blades were covered in rust after about 5 years of gentle use.  Is this what water and dish soap do to the moving parts in that amount of time?  No wonder they won't warranty it for more than a year.On the first unit, the blades just locked up -- I assumed due to the corrosion.  On the second unit, the case developed a crack in its side, and water had leaked beneath my cabinet (which went unnoticed until black mold had ruined the cabinet base).  The location of the crack doesn't appear to have been any kind of obvious stress point, so I am assuming it was created by interior rust and corrosion.I have to wonder if the more expensive models have this problem as well, or is it just on this low-end model.Advice: If you buy this model for the price, be sure to inspect it on a yearly basis for signs of its demise.
I'm not one to write product reviews, but my recent experience with ISE was enough to push me over the edge.  Like lots of other folks my 2.5 year old Badger 1 failed, but rather than developing a simple crack in the housing, my unit developed cracks all around it.  On Friday 25 March, the motor unit separated from the collar and collapsed into the cabinet under my sink.The engine and grinding mechanism struck a copper tube that fed a small instant hot water heater mounted under the sink.  By a stroke of luck, I happened to have just returned from an evening out and was able to turn off the water to the heater and kill the power to the InSinkErator unit which was still plugged in.  This action limited the damage to superficial water staining and minor scratches and a dent on the cabinet base.  I will not speculate as to the amount and nature of the damage that could have been caused to my home had I not been on the premises at the time.I DO NOT recommend buying anything with the words Badger or InSinkErator on it.  As a person with design engineering experience, I can tell you that the plastics that ISE are using for these units are flawed.  They are brittle and not capable of handling the kinds of torque stresses that are applied when grinding.  Plastic pieces literally crumbled between my fingers.  Save yourself the trouble and potential water damage, and buy something else!
Replaced an exsisting disposal with this unit only to find it didn`t work, only &#34;hummed&#34;. Since I had to take everything apart again I went to a store to purchase a new one and upon inspection realized the unit I had bought on Amazon wasat one point dismantled and pieces were missing.Because I went away for the holliday and didn`t have time to install this my time to return expired so now it`s a planter!
Please save your money and get a better quality product. I bought this product and the housing cracked in less then a year, Will never purchase another one. Its a common problem that will ruin your cabinets.
The Badger 1 disposal in my kitchen leaked through the bottom casing plate after only a few short years. This is a repeat discripancy noted in other reviews at Amazon. I do not recommend this product.
This waste disposal has a problem with leakage of water that develops not long after installation. It has happened in the last 3 waste disposals over 15 years. Under the counter was full of water each time. The only reason I am forced to keep buying this unreliable waste disposal is that the attachment to the sink is too firmly set by the plumber's putty and I would have to get a new sink to change models.
I have bought Two of these units in ten years. Cracks in the upper housing seems to be a common problem.
Bought this disposal to replace an old badger 1 that I'd used for over 10 years. It came with the house so it could be much older. This one lasted less than a year and a half. I hope I just got a bad one but after looking at the other reviews I doubt it. I'm thinking their quality has gone downhill over the years at least with the badger line. Just bought an evolution excel model hoping that they are better quality.
This Badger 1 is the model the builder put in our brand new home we had built in 2001.  I had to start babying this machine very early on.  It wouldn't grind even easy things like eggshells without getting clogged... and meat, NEVER.  Many, MANY times I've had to reach into the unit to unstick the grinders that would get locked into a non-spinning position, throwing the balance off.  It began leaking and even spraying at times shortly later.  Based on other reviews when researching a replacement, the Badger series as a whole is poorly rated.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND this disposer.  InSinkerator has models other than the Badger series that are way better rated.
Unfortunately, I did not have the option to purchase this unit. It came installed in my condo when I moved in. With that being said, this is a terrible unit! I don't know how long it has been leaking, but I bought my house in 2009 and consider myself one of the luckier ones( going as long as it did). I eventually cleaned out my cabinet under the sink and noticed it was leaking.(for how long, I don't know). I am glad I caught this before it did really bad damage. This unit leaks when just running water and cascades like a fountain when running the disposal. Do yourself a favor and buy a GE( they have pretty good reviews) or some other trusted brand!
Had mine for a short time it hardly gets used and it started leaking out of the reset button. Avoid this product or come over to my house and throw 70.00 in my new non-badger disposal.
The case cracked after less than 2.5 years in service and leaked (sprayed) the back of the cabinet.  I find this unacceptable.
Got the badger 1 with my new house and 3 years later it is leaking from a cracked housing. Sprayed water all over the interior of the sink cabinet. Very short warranty. Do not buy. Very poor construction and on the loud size. Waste king in any size from 1/2 hp to 1 hp is much quieter and has an excellent warranty.
water is leaking right near the electrical power. little over 16 months since install! this will probably be my last purchase from insinkerator
I did not purchase this through Amazon, it came with the house I purchased a year and a half ago.  After only 18 months, this garbage disposal has started leaking through the bottom of the housing.  Not the sides, not the top... but the bottom through the reset button, screw threads and all other holes.  If you've read anything online about garbage disposal repair, you'll see that this type of leak is the kiss of death.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this unit, you'll only be buying another one a year or two later.
Okay, five years into home ownership, I start to notice a stink under the sink. The Badger is cracked, and I don't know for how long. ruined sink base, not sure about the floor below it. Crack is in the vicinity of the dishwasher return pipe, directly above the outlet pipe. pretty good split, wish I could share the photo.  I don't know if I put something down there that caused this, but I'm going all-metal on the next one. Just for the record, the case is plastic.
After 3 years of very light usage (I compost most things) the case cracked spilling water into my cabinet. I just amazed me that something like that would happen. I really made me feel like this is was a complete piece of junk.
AVOID THIS PRODUCT!  I'm yet another owner with a cracked case on my Badger 1 which led to leaks.  The internal blades are also completely rusted.  The disposer probably only lasted about two years before the crack occurred.  The best feature of this disposer is that it's easily replaced with a better unit because of the common mounting system.  I can't believe anyone continues to buy this after reading reviews.
I bought this thinking it was engineered for at least 3-4 years but sure enough it lasted just over 12 months. This is an upgrade from the disposer installed in your home most of the time but do not purchase it as a replacement. Spend the extra $50-$100 and do it once rather than $80 here and then $80 in a year. Your time is worth money. This is however a great option if selling your house depends on replacing the disposal.
The InSinkErator Badger that I received does not work. I contacted the seller about returning it and getting a new one and have not heard from him. I an getting ready to move forward on this.
Purchased this item as it was the same one previously installed in our sink.  It had lasted 5 years before breaking, which is good, I think?...However; when the item was received, it did not come with a cord, which seems it should be standard...Guess it's my fault for not reading the 'fine print'.  Anyhow, it took my husband twice as long and twice as much effort as he had to remove the cord from the broken one, and install it in the new one, (which isn't as easy as it sounds).
This unit was installed in the condo my boyfriend bought, and worked OK for the first little while, but after about 2 years of light use it stopped working (totally dead; tried all the suggested fixes, many times, no luck reviving it), and about the same time we noticed a growing crack in the black plastic body of the disposal, where a small leak had developed (thankfully that seemed to happen about when we stopped using it, so we didn't have any issues with the floor of the cabinet rotting or having mold develop like others have).
I am convinced that the number of 'leak' reviews here (and elsewhere) points to one conclusion.... InSinkErator has clearly engineered this disposal to structurally fail so that you will then buy their more expensive products. My unit is just two years old and has multiple cracks in the molded metal casing. The internal wiring is likely to be getting wet, since the cracks are all over the unit.I'm considering buying another brand, but they have conveniently designed the collar (the only well-made part of this unit and hardest part of a new install) to accept any of their higher priced models. I feel like sending them a bill for the water damage this unit has caused.Here's an idea... stop selling this crap and design a slightly more expensive/safer unit that doesn't cause your customers to consider going elsewhere. Let's hear it for the InSinkErator marketing team for tarnishing an established household name through designed failure! Wheee!
cracked within little time and started leaking on the side so i pluged it with some plastic glue..next it cracked on the other side so i decide to ductape it.  Few months later started to leak on both places again so decided to get a wasteking.  Dont waster your money and time with this company.
Was a new install in our house and motor burnt out after 2.5yrs of minimal use from a 2 person family.  I expected many more years from it.  Went with the waste king for the replacement.  Should have it tomorrow and expect much better results.  Consumer reports recommended the waste king.  And honestly, the price on the waste king is very comparable to this product.
Unit started leaking through the case after a few years. Poorly designed and made. Probably designed to fail.Replaced with a Waste King and it looks to be better made(less expensive also...it was the same price for a 1/2 hp).
