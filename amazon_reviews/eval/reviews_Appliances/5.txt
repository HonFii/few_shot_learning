I like these containers so much i have ordered another set. The fact that they are flexible makes them really easy to use in the freezer, esp when you are in a hurry and want to get things out of the container quickly. I already own a lot of Tupperware products, and these i like the most. They are the most useful.
Fast shipping. Works great
What can I say? It is the usual Leviton high quality. Works good, lasts a long time.
The Leviton was new in the box.  All screws were included.  The packing was  and placed in a box the provided.  Great Deal for this device.
When you need one, you need one! But if you can wait a little longer save money and order on line.
i needed some way to plug in my camper and this fit the bill a little tight but works a
Receptacle is of good quality and should work fine for supplying "shore power" to your RV.  Since it will be used outdoors, I mounted mine in a weather proof box and cover from Lowe's, their stock numbers 49867 and 50943, respectively.  I had to modify the cover to accept the round face of the Leviton 30A. receptacle, as it was designed for a regular 15A. wall receptacle.
The unit was of a high quality and was exactly the way it was described. Could not be any happier
Not a lot to say.......... it works well and is labeled such that even I couldn't screw it up (a GOOD THING AT 30 amps!). Never did find them at the big box guys.Larry
Yep, it is an outlet and yes it works for my needs.  Don't know how you would rate an outlet other than it works.
needed an outlet Lowes had some flimsy ones saw this one so I bought it seems to be better made than ones at local store. works well
You will be satisfied with this receptacle. It is exactly as represented. The strap is configured for various mounting boxes and covers.
better than the midwest better connections it looks like it will hold up so far the last ones have not melted like the midwest
We were having a problem with a portable oil filled heater overheating a standard outdoor extension cord.  At the suggestion of a friend, I found this cord, and it made a huge difference!  Great job, and no issues with the cord getting hot.  Thank you Coleman!
The cord works as well as expected for a 14/3 gauge.  The application was subject to need ... in a pinch.
I needed a heavy duty extension chord for my standup freezer in the garage.  I bought this based on the reviews and have used it without any problems for about 5 months now.  If you need an appliance extension chord - this is it.
In 1956, I got my PHD in extensioncordology. You got your long ones and short ones, Fat ones and skinny ones, Light ones and heavy ones and black, white and orange ones. This is a three footer- 15 amp flat plugger 3 prong. You won't run your camper in Cincinnati if its plugged in Tucson. But it's a start.What else can you say about a cord. It works or it doesn't. This does and decent quality.
I needed this to extend the cord on a dust collector in my wood shop. It's well made and does the job at a better price than the big box stores. Thanks Amazon !
needed power to an area without any a/c outlets behind our theater seats on our lower level...placed this in a cord protector purchased from amazon from a side wall to behind the seats...being the cord is flat inside the cord protector there is no hump when you walk on the cord protector/extension cord...the flat plug is also a plus as it doesn't stick out from the wall...nice wall hugging effect...
I just needed about 2 feet to reach an appliance. This was just the fit. I was concerned about some cords I reviewed on Amazon that shorted out or caught on fire. This cord is made in China.Yuck! So far my house has not burned down. I will keep you informed.
Wanted a heavy duty outdoor extension cord for Christmas lighting. This one is 14 gauge and very well made. Would recommend to a friend. Color matches our aluminum porch posts and railings.
Needed a short outdoor power cable for my electric start snow blower. The angled plug makes it more secure in the electric outlet so it does not easily pull out of the socket. Its short length keeps it out of the way of the various moving parts of the snow blower.
This is a nice cord for appliances with it's right angle plug so you can get appliances close to the wall without the plug getting in the way. Well made and a decent price on Amazon.
This extension cord is exactly what I been looking for.  I need a powerful yet not too bulky extension cord for my new PC.  This cord has 15 amp, it means it can produce 1800 watts for your appliances if you have 120 Voltages in your home.  It is only 14 gauge, not too big to look ugly, and I love the price and color too.  A must have if you don't want over-charged your appliances.
I use it for a small portable oven.  It is flat on the sides, about the thickness of floor molding.  The 90 degree plug is real nice for putting it behind cabinets.
This is heavy duty, rigid extension cable perfect for all kinds of uses and looks to be built very solidly. I love the angled 3-prong plug as it sits nice and flush to the wall. Nothing not to like. Highly recommend.
I purchased this cord for our window air conditioning unit.  The shipping was really quick, and the cord itself seems to be well constructed.
Used this as a short extension for a window A/C unit.  Does the job with not voltage drop and the A/C unit works great.
Not too much to say about this. It works great. We use it in our garage to plug in our stereo when we workout. We use it nearly everyday and haven't had any issues.  It works without fail.
I bought this extension cord to give me some extra range on a small space heater.  Yes yes I know I know, they say to never use extension cords with those, but I made sure to get one that wasn't very long (this is just a 12-foot cord), and one that has a large enough gauge wire in it to handle the load.  The space heater can draw a max of 12.5 amps and this cord is rated for well over that amount.  The cord does not feel hot even after extended usage of the space heater.
Hooked this baby up to a Breville toaster oven to shorten the toasters ridiculously long plug (seriously, it sticks out like 2 and half inches). Works like a charm and allows me to move the oven closer to the wall.
My basement only has 4 electrical outlets.  During the frigid winter months, I use space heaters to prevent pipe freeze-ups.  The problem is that where one of the outlets is, the heater cord only stretches a short distance, so the heater is behind the water heater - not giving off the heat for the rest of the area.  I only needed a short extension cord - and wanted something that is Heavy Duty, to prevent overheating of the cord.  I just plugged it in - it is the perfect length!  I will provide an update on whether the cord gets hot when I use the heater.
This product is an extension cord. It is heavy duty. It plugs securely into the wall socket. It receives appliance plug securely. The jacket is stiff, but since it is intended for indoor use this should not be a problem.
We used this to run a 8000 btu air conditioner from an outlet across the room.  Worked perfectly.
I used it the moment it arrived and it works well. Better than using any old extension plug
It's quite heavy which is a good thing. I am expecting that it will work for a long time. Do the job.
This is a great buy in a first quality extension cord.  This model is very heavy duty, and well suited my use for an 8,000 BTU air conditioner. The short, 3-foot model was ideal for my needs.  I needed it because the GFI safety part molded onto the end of the AC's power cord is too large to fit into the available outlet, which is in a tight corner in the room  This short cord gave me the clearance I need, without the extra, unneeded bulk of a longer extension cord. No part of the extension cord gets warm from electrical current, even when the AC unit has been cranked up during extended heat waves.  Looks like it will last a lifetime.
So this thing sits flat against the wall. I had a lamp I needed to light up on a switched outlet. This cord not only gave me some extension cord, it also right-angled the plug. Fantastic. My living room is complete.
I moved the fridge into my closet but the plug wasn't long enough anymore. I wasn't sure what extension cord I needed but I did some research and this seemed to be more than sufficient. It works great. I don't know if it would be good enough for heavier use. Most appliances specifically tell you not to use an extension cord no matter what the length.
it was great to be able to purchase the small size for our home project.  would purchase again as item is solid.
I use this cord/brand because the quality is great, 14-gauge is heavy duty for 3-feet, and they are made in the USA. Highly recommended!
Sometimes a short, heavy duty extension cord is needed for certain places.  The fits the bill and it was very convenient to order.
Why doesn't anyone make tan extension cords anymore? Well these guys do and it was just what we needed to connect our last set of backyard lights to the rest of our string. Very beefy, very robust, also a bit pricey, but that's do to the build quality no doubt. I'd buy again.
I needed this for my refrigerator and I wanted a good heavy duty extension cord to do the job.  This is a really nice heavy gauge, three prong extension cord.  I was impressed enough by it that I bought another one.
I purchased this cord based upon another review I read.  Just wanted to leave a correction.The specifications are correct and the cord works perfectly.  Coleman Cable makes great products and I have purchased their stuff before.  A review suggested that the cord is Made in the USA.  Coleman Cable does make a lot of cabling products in the US, but the 6 foot cord I received from Amazon was Made in Indonesia.
I know a little about extension cords having dealt with the subject in my occupation as a quality director and compliance engineer for over 30 years.  You really need to be careful when selecting an extension cord for a variety of reasons.  These extension cords are well-made and are worth the little extra you might pay over what you can find that's "cheaper."  Beware of "cheap" in an extension cord! And use the right gauge and length for the application.
We chose because microwave has no outlet. 3 foot is just the right size, not having extra cord laying around. Would recommend.
This extension cord is perfect for an electric BBQ; I'm using mine with a Char Broil Patio Bistro and it works great. This is a 14 gauge cord so don't expect it to be super pliable but it does loosen up with some use making it easy to coil up. The color is just what I was looking for because it matches the light tan tile on my patio. One nice feature is the plug going into the AC outlet is set so that it hugs the wall.  This is a very good product.
It has a flat plug, which is what I needed, and appears to be well made.  14/3 wire good for 15 amps and our new, efficient fridge draws about 2 amps starting and 1 running.  I bought this unit so that I could temporarily install a wattmeter near the fridge to asses its energy usage and it worked fine for that purpose.
This was exactly what I was looking for. I needed a heavy duty cord to run a window AC unit but they are hard to find unless you want 50' of it. This is the perfect size and built great. Its the right gauge for most appliances.
Does it's intended job and was the cheapest price at this time I purchased it. I bought to use for a 13,000 BTU portable De'Longhi 4-in1 unit.
Good heavy duty cord, using it on my temperature controler.  Great value for the money.
I bought this to use with a small air compressor in my garage.  Works great, the plug fits flat against the wall, and the cord, while heavy-duty, is flexible enough that it can be run neatly along the base of the wall.
Perfect sice extension cable for small work project, with out using a much longer cord for these jobs. Got it for a reasonable price.
Never get's warm and does it's job perfectly while it's connected to a small room heater.  Good value for the buck.
This blends in with my beige carpet.  Otherwise, it's just an extension cord.  Works fine.  Get one if you have beige carpet.
I needed to extend my AC cord and this was the perfect answer.  There was too much load on my Master bedroom circuit but this reached another outlet on a different circuit.
The cord is flat and flexible.  I like that.  It arrived very quickly too.  The plug is a 90 degree type so it hugs the wall nicely.  14 AWG is pretty hefty as well.  You won't be sorry for buying this.
So glad I found this little cord for my small refrigerator. No more stumbling over a 9 ft. cord when I only needed a couple of extra feet.Appears to be a heavy, good quality cord. So far, so good.
Good to have when you don't have much room next to the outlet, like a couch or desk is against the wall.Prevents the cord and outlet from getting damaged when it is twisted (I have had that happen).
Perfect length to connect my over the range microwave to a wall plug.
Forget the name Coleman -- a standard of quality and reliability for decades.  Forget the fact that this made of super-rugged, high-capacity 14-gauge wire.  Forget that this is a grounded 15-foot extension cord.  Wait a second -- I think we've forgotten too much.What I mean to say is, when you put all these factors together -- the safety, toughness, dependability, and convenience of this extension cord, you might think it would cost $50.  Wrong.  $35?  Wrong!  It's a steal at only (insert actual price here).Seriously, folk -- you can never have enough high-quality extension cords, so do stock up!
We heat and cool individual rooms in our large house. After one winter of heating my bedroom-cum-sitting room with a portable Vornado heater, I was getting ready to set up the circular fan when I discovered the Chinese-made multi-plug extension had overheated and was nearly welded to the heater plug. A little research pointed me to the Coleman Cable 3533 14/3 General-Use 9-Foot Appliance Extension. After reading the reviews, I discovered that this cord is the proper gauge for cooling and heating appliances, does not overheat and lies flat against the wall. It's perfect for my application, is a quality item and adheres to my goal of buying US-made products. Thank you, Coleman!
They are what they are and they work just fine if you need a short extension cord. I recommend them to anyone.
I bought this cord for a mini fridge that I keep my water in and it works like a charm
I moved into an older apartment that wasn't designed for modern appliances. There are no outlets by the bedroom windows. I bought a 5,000 BTU window air conditioner & bought this extension cord so I could plug it in to one of the outlets nearby. This does the job perfectly. I've been running the a/c at night for a week with no problems. Cord is thick & sturdy.
Needed another couple of feet with new dryer, perfect fit.  Gives you more options then the shorter cords normally sold.
Worked perfect and was cheaper than the same thing at Lowes. I put it on my oven and plugged it in. No complaints.
Due to the nature of this item there is really not much to say except that it works and appears to be a high quality cord.  It meet the specifications for the range it supplies power to and met the approval of our electrician.  I would purchase another one if I had need of it.
I like the fact that the wire ends have mounting tips assembled and that the cord has a strain relief clamp included.I'd recommend this to any diy person
Used for my Bosch EV car charger so it is not hard wired.  Allows the device to be unplugged and no crimping tools needed to terminate the main electrical wires feeding the device.
Care must be taken to insure that you have the correct cable for the outlet.  We had to be sure that the four foot would be enough.
This worked as designed.  I had no problems installing it.  There is no reason to spend $25 for a 6 foot cord.  This was 4 feet and was all I needed.
When we moved into a new home, I thought I'd have to purchase a totally new dryer since code upped dryer outlets from 3 prongs (wires) to 4. I was happy to run into this cord. I was able to successfully remove my old wire from the rear of the unit and install this 4-wire cord. Turned out to be a cinch! Highly recommended.
If you need this item this is an excellent quality build and at a very great price that you can get
Eh...it's a dryer cable.  Looks well made, has nice ends.  Not really a whole lot to be wrong with it.
Much cheaper than best but.  Works well with any 4 prong plug and drier.  Very simple and easy to use.
I had a dryer with a 3 wire cord, I needed 4 wire for new home. I looked on Amazon because similar products at Lowes or Home Depot in my town were almost $50 !!!  I was shocked to find the same cord type online here at Amazon for this great price with shipping for less. Much Less...okay enough about the cost.  I was concerned that the materials or construction would be some how less than perfect and was happy that I was completely wrong. This cord is heavy material with stranded copper conductors and a well made strain relief included.  I dont feel I've sacrificed any quality be ordering online via Amazon...I did'nt hear UPS drop it on the door step and the text alert let me know at 6:10pm it was delivered. I had it on the dryer by 6:30pm and its working now drying clothes for the family. BIG Thumbs Up.
I ordered this product 27 hours ago, and it installs easily looks very durable, and seems heavy duty.  all for 1/3 the price of one at lowesI would (and have) recommend this to a friend.
Converted old dryer from 3 wire to 4 wire connection.  Cable was easy to install and was just the right length.
This helped us get our dryer up and running fast. We have had it installed for months now and zero problems. I highly recommend.
This cord was very easy and very quick to connect to my old dryer. Done in less than ten minutes!
It's a dryer cord.  It has four wires and a plug.  Not too exciting, but the price was right and the cord was of good quality.
Received with nice packaged box. item came with other orders and it was fast shipping as expected. installation took about 20 mins because i had no idea about the connection to dryer so, got help from the manual booklet.overall, this is heavy duty cord that should last +-10years in my opinion.
Our dryer had the wrong connection.  We replaced the cord with this one, and it works great!  I thought I was ordering the 6 ft, discovered I accidentally order the 4 ft, but it works.  Quality is good and it was easy to swap out.
Easy to install...works great no complaints here and very affordable. I recommend this to everyone looking for a reliable 4 prong cord.
It is a 4 feet power cord. If you need the instruction to connect this cable to your dryer, here is the configuration: [Left: Black - Middle: White - Right: Red] [Chassis ground - Green].If you have a wire connect to the chassis ground, remove it and connect it to the middle of the conductor (White). If you are still not sure what to do, go online and find a video which demonstrates how to connect the cord or call an electrician to do it for you.
Came in plastic package with installation instructions.Took 3 minutes total to read and install this onto the dryer I was lent.Has been more months than I recall and no fires or any blown fuses, wire doesn't get hot, and have been drying clothes as that is what it is for.
We bought this cord to replace our 3 wire cord due to new construction code changes. The installer made the switch, works well.
It did what it was needed to do, was easy to install and is functioning perfectly.  Can't ask anymore for a dryer cord.
Well I recieve this product in a timely manner packaged well, and the directions were easy to follow... I would defiantly recommend this product to anyone that needs a 4 prong power cable for there dryer, it does its job and moves the power from the outlet to the machine.,, so can't complain...
I bought this cable for our new dryer.  It was the perfect length and excellent quality.  Not too much to be said about this cable other than it is a great price.  I would not hesitate to buy this again.
Replaced the power cord on my new dryer and it has been working great so far. Now all I need to do it sell the replacement cord and all will be well with the world.
There were no problems installing this and it does exactly what it needs to do. Very pleased. It's always great getting a quality product that saves you money.
This is a nice heavy cord with good terminal spades that slip over the screw post not requiring screw removal. Plus the strain relief worked well.
I really liked it, good quality wire. I would recommend you to go on youtube and look for directions and be sure you are doing it right. The order of the wires is important and not just random.
My new clothes dryer was such a beautiful thing, presiding so nobly over my laundry nook.  Alas, it was unable by itself to gather enough of the raw electric energy to perform as it was intended.  Then this!  This beautiful cable came into our lives, and it brought my new friend all of the electrons it needed to happily take care of my clothing.  What a magnificent purchase this was.
It does the job well.  The build quality is solid.  I don't see any reason to spend more money on the more expensive cords.
power cord works fine and no problems with it so far. the cord is thick and very beefy, feels solid
My husband and I ordered this after realizing that our new house had the wrong number of prongs in the outlet we needed to plug the dryer into.  He bought this cord and installed it in our new dryer in less than an hour, and it works great.
This works as advertised, works great 4 loads in.  The wires are very stiff, so be prepared to bend for those odd angles.
Connecting cable was easy, connectors are exactly the size the needed to be. All work was done in 15 min, including removing old cable. Hooked my dryer and it still works. Cable is bit stiff due to its thickness, but that is not important, since it will not be moved for quite some time now.
So I went to one of those home improvement stores... and brought one of these for $24! then I got home and saw this for half the price ? Fantastic deal, got to save that money.
This cord works great. Had no problems connecting wires to the dryer and the instructions were good. This was a good price compared to what I was finding at Walmart, Lowes, Home Depot, etc...
Christmas gift for husband who always is aware of the tempurature in his garage. Knows when he wants to be there or not now.
Love this product. It shows temperatures very clearly and good colors.May buy couple more just in case ever needed...:)
Wanted a nice, cute thermometer to remind me of how unbearable Las Vegas summer heat is. This does the trick :)
It is &#34;cheaper&#34; looking but we didn't get it for decoration. Works great, and is really accurate when we compare the temp to our weather app reading. Great for the price! Love that its big enough print so I can just look out my window :)
The thermometer came in on time and was exactly what I wanted.  I have hung it on the wall on my patio for easy viewing.
HAS A LITTLE EXTRA READINGS WIND CHILL, HEAT INDEX.  NICE PRODUCT FOR THE SMALL AMOUNT PAID.
Purchased this outdoor thermometer about a month ago.  It is large, readable from our kitchen, attractive and MUCH more accurate than the old (LL BEAN)thermometer that we used to have.  Worth the price.
Allthough we have it a short time, my and I are Happy with it. It replaces another we had for about five years,which became very inacurate. I like the idea it measures Humidity (comfort index).
I wanted a thermometer for the back porch so I could monitor the temperature.  I also wanted one that I could see from the doorway.  This one had large numbers and is made of plastic.  The fact that it's plastic is a plus because I live on a golf course and you never know when a golf ball lands on your porch.
This is a great thermometer!  I originally got it for my patio garden but didn't like the size and bold colours as it seemed to become a focal point.  I moved it to a corner of my patio, away from my garden, and it looks great!  I can see it from my kitchen and it's in partial shade enough to give me a more accurate temperature.  I live in the south and if one reads the temperature from a thermometer in the sun, one would never leave the house for fear of collapsing from heat stroke.
I have the good fortune to work at Keystone Resort for the mountain Division.  We were looking for outdoor thermometers to post at our lift shacks so guests could see what the temperature and wind chill / heat was while they were skiing / riding.  The bright colors and big #'s made it so easy to read.
I love looking outside being able to gauge the temperature and see how cold it is right in my yard or on your porch.  This is an awesome gadget.
Nice and big so can be read from a distance. Im not sure about the humidstat as it always seems to be low but I don't have any way to check it.
This is the perfect gift for a local Amish neighbor for on their small barn in which they keep their one buggy.
This item is just as pictured and described.  It is easy to read and very accurate. Easy to mount on the porch and view from inside the house.  Love it!!
Both thermometer and hygrometer are accurate, or at least read the same as some higher grade devices that cannot be read at more than arms length.I've had one similar to this hanging in a shaded area under the roof of my southerly facing back porch for years, but it would get blown down when a strong wind came in at a certain angle and finally broke the post that anchored the bi-metal spring.  I attached this one with screws through the face instead of hanging it, so it shouldn't blow away.
I have the thermometer in my carport and can read the number easily and it seems to be accuate.  Thanks for the quick service.  Judith
It's fine.  It's a thermometer.  What do you expect?
I was very pleased with its appearance. It was a gift to a friend and they are enjoying it. Works great!
Costs a lot less than many others and seems to work well.  It is within a degree of other thermometers that I trust.
It has been a year since I ordered this and it is still working perfectly well, despite the horrific weather conditions in the midwest..
I've gotten rid of all my digital temp readers since they constantly need battery changes. this one reads temp as well as the digital kind plus it will last longer.
I bought this for a gift for my mom.At first she thought it might be too big, since it was just outside her window , right on the corner of  her mini deck.She loves it -so easy to see! She likes  the chill /heat index to see approximate temperature- without "reading" the dial.It was easy to mount,although look at your area to be sure it mounts the way you want it .Nice thermometer!
I really like I can see the temperature from the house.  It is nice and big.  I would buy this again.
I needed a replacement thermometer and I like the design and wind chill readings of this device. Would recommend it to everyone.
We have this thermometer on our deck. It is colorful and easy to read from inside the house.
This thermometer is hanging on our garage . We have had it a few months and I will say it is pretty accurate with the news forcast. In the past the white seems to turn yellow over time--but too soon to tell .
perfect size
What more can I say here, product is very accurate, looks good outside, large enough to see and priced right.
Arrived on time and as described
I have it on my back porch wall and it's big enough that I can read everything from inside the house. I also like the colors.
Although there is no back on this thermometer, I've found this to be very accurate. I mounted it onto a board to protect the back and ease installation to my privacy fence. The only oddity that I've noticed was that the hygrometer reads OK unless the direct afternoon sunlight hits it and that it goes awry. I assume that it's affected by the direct light, but in the shade it's fairly accurate and easy to read.
Good buy....just as pictured and advertised.....looks wonderful on the porch and comes in very handy for what to do that day
I keep some orchids in my house, so I wanted to at least have an idea of the humidity level, and this is ideal.  I'll be buying another for other rooms.
It's humid.. It's not humid.. God it's hot. No, it's freezing. It's more bipolar than most of the women in my life. But at least with this, I know I'm wrong and it's not an opinion.
Plastic but looks decent in my opinion, all things considered. I got one for every room in the house. Very nice.
It has worked very well. For its price this is a good instrument. I have also checked it against an electronic meter and it does very well.
A simple but effective measuring tool If anyone needs to measure temp and humidity then this does it completely and satisfactorily
I have this unit about 3 months now and is very accurate to outside conditions for the Hygrometer and very accurate for indoor temp. I got a very good buy.
I was a bit unenthusiastic to buy this because of the mixed reviews. But I needed it for a certain room in my house, and it was so inexpensive I figured what the heck. Turns out I'm pleasantly surprised.Another reviewer wrote that what you get doesn't look like the picture. I don't know what they received, but mine looks exactly like the picture. I really like the way it looks with those comfort ranges. I will say that it is extremely light, which leads you to believe that it's very cheap----but who cares; as long as it works and looks nice. Also didn't realize before receiving it that it's got a nice little footstand in case you want to place it on a table.The thermometer is, as others have said, very precise. And the hygrometer has been surprisingly precise as well, matching another hygrometer in the same room most of the time and other times being within 3-4 percentage points.I haven't yet put it in the attached but unheated shed where it's final destination will be---so I don't know how it performs in extreme cold (I live in NH) or in extreme summer humidity. But so far I am happy with the purchase.
This isn't some flashy meter, but it gets the job done and is pretty accurate. I keep it in the bedroom to gauge whether we need to turn on the humidifier or not.
works great.  gives us the data we need to start our garden this year.  Living in the desert poses issues with lack of humidity.
I bought this so I could look through the sliding glass door and see how miserable the weather is during the hot Texas summer.  It has talked me into staying indoors quite a bit.  Thanks Springfield!!
Who knew....such a simple little lightweight product would work so easy.  Have this in the barn to make sure not too hot/humid for the animals.  lightweight kinda cheep but does the job....love it!
WORKS VERY WELL, EVEN THOUGH IT IS VERY IN EXPENSIVE. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT WORKS AND LOOKS.
I've owned this product for 3 weeks and it has performed well---so far. It is delicate so it won't take much abuse. It's plastic construction means two long-term problems: 1) aging of the plastic; 2) it could be easily crushed. But, then again, brass corrodes and electronics are not much more robust. For its price this is a good instrument package. I have checked it against an electronic meter and it does very well.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.
We needed to measure temp and humidity for different areas of a large commercial bakery.  These worked great and were shipped in timely fashion.  Just ordered two more for bakery.
I've had cheap humidifiers that barely worked, so I bought a powerful one. Unfortunately, it was to good for my small house. Inside outside settings didn't work properly, so I used this to set it right. No more wet walls or windows.
Bought this set for the screened porch.  Not the fanciest looking gauge, but a good buy for the money.  How accurate?  Well I had my inside Thermidistat calibrated with thousand dollar gauges and this inexpensive unit was extremely close.  Saying all that remember maybe I just got lucky and got a good one.Gadget
I like this product . You can' beat the price for the product . Good Value. I bought it to measure humidity so I would know when to use my humidifyer . It was rainy the other day and it showed 55% . A couple of days later it was cold in the house and I could tell it was dry . Looked at the meter and it was 40%. Turned my humidfyer on for a couple of hours and it is now reading 52% . I want to keep the humidity around 50% and this product helps me to do that . It will help me with my sinus problems.
very good product and it is a lot easier to read it.  I ended up bought a few meters.  I definitely recommend everyone to buy them.
great value for the price, perfect for my studio to make sure the humidity is where it needs to be for paper storage.
THIS IS AN ITEM I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR. SOME OF MY RELATIVES SAID THEY MIGHT BUY ONE.ITS DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE MILITARY!
this model was inexpensive & works well...  I use a humidifier or de-humidifier to keep the humidity around 50 percent
I use this in with my baby chicks. I can simply lay it in the brooder and see the  temp from a good distance away.
I really like this meter with the humidity gauge. Like to get another one for other room of the house, it may be discontinued soon not sure.
Works Great! I bought this for my tortoise table. I had to make sure the heat and humidity levels were just right. Good product!
I bought one of these almost 20-years ago at a hardware store. I mounted it on the wall in my computer room and it still works great.  Happy to see these are still made and am going to pick up a few more.  Yes, it is a fragile item so don't think you can drop it and it will keep working. However, if you take care of it (blow any dust out of it once a year with some Dust-Off) and keep things from hitting it and you may well own this for the rest of your life.
I ordered this because it tells how much humidity is in our house so that I can adjust the humidfier on my furnish. Works great I'm glad I got two. Shipped and packed very well
It met my needs. The only element I dislike is that direct sunlight causes the unit to read higher than normal.
This item is easy to use. There is no use of batteries and does not have to be programed to function. It also shows the range that works well when setting temperature and humidity in the home.
It still works great.
Product works as it says...Instructions are good.  Took me bit longer to install it, this is because this was my first plumbing DIY project and didn't have all tools and know-hows. Got it done over a year ago and it is working great so far....I recomand it
Good product, perfect match to the previous product that i had.  Easy to install and at the right price (beat the local stores).
Had the same one for 10 yrs. Was happy with the old one, so I bought another. Didn't have to change much under the sink, it was the same size. Everything fit perfect, works great!! No problems!
I wanted to replace my old insinkerator and wanted the same model as I am not good at this. It was my first time changing. Saved a lot of money by buying from amazon compared to home depot.  It was not a big deal to install it with help from you tube. Most plumbers quoted around 500 for the job I finished in less than one hour. pretty straight forward set up unless you trying to do the complete installation. All I did was just take out the old one out and replace with this one. Didn't change anything else.
Got this installed to replace an existing InSinkErator disposer.  The change out was reasonably smooth.  Instructions have some faults (whose don't anymore), but nothing too serious.  The unit itself performed great.  It is a move up from its predecessor (1/3 to 1/2HP), but this unit is quieter and seems to get stuff ground up much more quickly.Shipping from Amazon was quick, easy & painless.
After 20 years of hard use, replaced the old In-Sink-Erator disposer that still worked exceptionally well.  This new one is even better.  Installation was simple.  Bones and vegetable waste disappear within seconds.  For residential kitchen uses, there are no better disposers.
Ordered this for my parents who's original disposal stopped working. It was an 1/3 hp insinkerator. Simple to install, good product. Worked well. Happy with purchase.
was exactly what I expected and needed, had it before and needed to replaceit after 2years unfortunately but still worth it
know it is working. This is better than my broken Badger. It works better because the last one lasted for ten years and stopped working. This one is new so you know its going to work for another ten years.
I had a 3/4hp Insink Erator Pro model go bad after about 6 years. The seal between the motor and the disposer went band and the thing was leaking water from the motor all over everything under our sink. I wanted another Insink Erator so I could easily swap them out without having to do a complete install. This unit fit the bill perfectly. I wasn't near a box store and instead of buying the Ace Brand knock off I did next day shipping on this. With Prime it was an extra $8. The price here and the extra shipping still had me at about half what our local plumper wanted for this unit and a bit cheaper then the box stores. I was nervous about dropping to 1/2hp after having 3/4 but for normal household use I think you're just fine with this. We haven't noticed much difference.Remember to knock out the plug for the dishwasher drain if you will be using that.Also don't waste your money on a wiring kit or plug for this unit. If you already have a disposal in place with a plug on it, you can easily take it off your old disposal and put it on this one. If your old on is hardwired, then you can unhook your old one and hook up this one. No special kit or wire needed. If you do not have a disposal already, then you will need to get a plug with the right length cord or find an outlet to hard wire it to.
Excellent product, great distributor -fast - easy and installation was simple. The 1/2 hp is quiet and efficient and the to your door delivery saves money and a shopping trip.
Not much to say other than it was a replacement for my broken one. Installation was easy, remove old with a twist  disconnect wires and connect them to the new one, lift and twist to hold in place. ( reminder do not forget to open the dishwasher plug for dishwasher discharge )
I had to have a guy install it for me because I'm bad at plumbing type stuff. I make leaks. But this works great, and my old one had stopped working completely, so I could not be any happier.
Our Badger 1 finally died, so we upgraded to the 5. DEFINITE improvement, much quieter. I'm expecting it to be just as reliable or even more so!
Old InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP disposal worked for over 9 years and was in my "custom built" home.  Could have purchased more expensive, feature laden model, decided for installation simplicity to stick with this same unit.  Best price was found on Amazon.  My son (a handyman) was able to install in less than 30 minutes.  No leaks, problems or issues.  Love it!InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer
Really good product though in a small package (great for my sink). Works well, is not too loud and is very efficient. I strongly recommend the brand (I have one other more powerful unit as well) and I am very happy with both. No maintenance (using it now for three years) and a good value for my money.
It arrived sooner than expected with no damage .We love it .It's quiet it works every time and it never jams up.
I purchased this disposer as an upgrade to our old one. We previously owned a 1/3 hp model, and it was slowly falling apart (It was over 10 years old) So we purchased this model. It arrived quickly, and it comes with great instructions. One note: You will need to swap your old powercord over from your old unit. This does not come with a power cord. I purchased a power cord kit at Home Depot, it's made by InSinkErator, and only cost about $12.00. You will also want some plumbers putty, but that's it! Everything else is included. I'm 24 years old, and a female with almost no experience in home repairs. But I did it by myself, without any problems. Like I said, very easy to install, and the instructions are very clear. It works great! Whatever I put down the drain, disappears almost instantly. I wish it was a little quieter, but I know they sell insulted units that are much quieter. I just didn't have the budget for one of those models. Overall, for the price you pay, this is a fantastic value!
Easy to install. Just replaced an old one exactly like this after 10 years. Should come with its own power supply. Taking out the power supply from old one and putting in new one .. took all the time and effort. Taking out old from under sink and snapping new one was effort less .. if you follow the instructions.
We've had a Badger 5 for 12 years and never had a problem until it just stopped working.  So, we replaced it with the same.  We hope the new one performs and lasts just like the old one.  It has been an excellent product.
This perfectly replaced my 6 yrs old Badger that started leaking.  I'm not expecting too much out of this one and will start looking for leaks after 5 yrs.  It's standard and good for the price; that's about all I can say.
My plumber recommended this disposer.  It works great and the installation wasn't difficult.  Came with a 2 yr warranty, and was $20.00 less at  Amazon than at Lowe's.
It replaced and old disposer, the installation was quick (I had no previous experience) and it works wonderfully and quietly.
After 20 years my first InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP (bought at Home Depot, Phoenix, AZ)  finally lost the battle against corrosion. The device is leaking, but the engine still works. I was very pleased to see, that the same device is still available by In Sink Erator. Thus, I ordered a new one at amazon. Luckily the quick lock disp mount didn't change, so I could just remove the old device from the sink and replace it by the new one. Unfortunately the new Badger 5 has a completely incompatible output to the drain. The old, straight screw neck which connects to the drain was replaced by a 90 pipe fitting. This was a very bad idea by In Sink Erator.Hopefully the new device will last again 20 years - we'll see. So I would say it's worth every single dollar.
the badger in sinkerator was just as exspected it was a snap to install. the instrutions were easy to understand.i would defintly recommend the badger5 to anyone.it has plenty of power.you don,t need any more power than a 1/2hp
I installed 2 at my last home in 20 years and now in my new home.  They do a great job of protecting our septic system.  I use ice to keep it clean.
This food waste disposer was extremely easy to replace my older disposer (same make and model that lasted 12 years); excelletn quality and worknamship. Amazon delivered with usual promptness.
Fast delivery, product was an exact replacement for failed unit--a very easy switch out. If you have a dishwasher that hooks up to the disposer-Don't forget to knock out the inlet plug of the dishwasher inlet to the disposer--otherwise you could have a flood from the dishwasher overflowing--fortunately I realized this ahead of time!
replaced identical model that was 20 years old, easy install!!  we only use it for very light duty;  this is the base model, all we need....heavy duty and frequent users should probably step up to a heavier duty disposer.....
I noticed that this is identical as the one that I pulled out to replace...  Which has been under my sink for at least 15-years (and was working fine).  I even used the old power cord and save some money...  So, this Badger must be a cash cow for InSinkErator (I assume no R&D; in years!)Easy to install (about an hour for me to install - and I'm no plumber).  Also, obviously reliable.  And I was told by several folks that unless you are interested in &#34;low noise&#34; garbage disposal, stay with this 1/2 hp workhorse.  Glad I did.
My original Badger 5 failed (started leaking on the bottom - rusted out) after 12 years.  I did a lot of research to decide what to replace it with, and in the end decided to replace my previous Badger 5 with a new Badger 5 because of price and ease of installation.  I'm happy to report that I'm glad that I did.  It was a snap to install and to my surprise, is much quieter than my previous Badger 5.  Highly recommend not spending much more for those that claim to be quiet.  This one is very quiet and has plenty of power for any home use.
I was replacing a very old unit that was the same model. I can't speak to the longevity of this replacement, but the install was very simple. I did have to make a quick trip to Home Depot though because the drain connection on this one was a little different than the old one. Plastic piping is so simple that this wasn't a problem. (I had no experience doing anything like this before if that helps give you a little confidence that you can do this too.)
It was easy to install and I have it for more than a year now and use it every day, It is powerfull and perfect for residential.
I use this a lot because i like canning and it sure does get rid of peelings of all kinds .and it keeps me from dumping it outside to encourage dogs and other animals to come on my property while Im trying to sleep
