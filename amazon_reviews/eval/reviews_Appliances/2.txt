Hung this on our patio, and unfortunately it gets a lot of sun in this position.  Therefore, its readings are not accurate.  Always higher than the actual temp or humidity.  But it is easy to read through the glass sliding door for an estimate of what is happening out there!
Humidity indicator does not record correctly, otherwise it functions adequately!
You pay for what you get. It's a cheap decoration that doesn't really gage the temperature or humidity very well. If you put in a sunny spot it way off and even in the shade it's not correct. Looks good, that's about all.
just quit working one day.  i am returning for refund.  i was using in a greenhouse so reliability is important to me
If you're the type that in the summer times loved to throw &#34;Frisbees&#34; this is just the product for you.  Only one problem, &#34;it&#8217;s supposed to be a thermometer/Hydrometer.  Problem is, it does a lousy job of masquerading.  When I took it out of the box, (I had already read other reviews&#34; it was like others said.  The back side was &#34;fully open&#34; to the elements, so open in fact that the little spring (hydrometer) and the big spring (thermometer) were fully exposed to the elements.  Even at 32 degrees and below.  The front part looked just like the top of a Frisbee.  As though someone put in 2 indicator needles and some different colored paint and about 10 coats of polyurethane, (shellac).  As mentioned earlier, if you weight to buy this in spring time because of the weight it might go farther if used as a Frisbee.  : -  (  Needless to say I immediately returned it for full refund.
it seems to work but is really made cheaply! very thin plastic. made in china! i'm not impressed i guess were getting so used to buying this crap it takes something like this to remind us. amazon's shipping can't be beat it came the next day.
looks good; measures temp o.k.; humidity indicator shows minus 0%;  In FL not in OH, therefore, not a chance it's correct!
can't read it from a diastase more than 20 yards. works fine but hard to read unless close up. Ok
Looks like a toy and cheap.  Well what do you expect for the price that you pay.  It's a hollow plastic disc without a backing and with plastic clear covering, not glass.  I'm not so familiar with its accuracy since I didn't bother to check it.  If you want a toy looking thermometer then this is for you.  If you want something elegant then find a more expensive product.
I will give this thermometer the benefit of the doubt... for now.  I had to drink some V-8 to look at the display, because it hangs crooked.  Its true test will be the Northern Michigan winter later this year.  I do like the humidity dial, though!
Disappointed because directions said not to hang it in the sun, and our only shady spot is not visible without going outside to read it.
This thermometer is simply not accurate!! The humidity aspect worked fair for one day. I would never by another one of these!
Didn't last 5 months in the desert shade (Las Vegas), Not accurate to within 20 degree's.  The humidity meter always pointed to the 80* mark, I wouldn't recommend this one.
It looks cheap. I decided to put in my backyard where it is not so visible to others. I had planned to put it in my front courtyard. I purchased another one for that area
It works well at the beginning, but thermometer does not work after 4 months. Do not know whether the Humidity Meter works.
I got this to place in a room to check the thermostat.  It varied considerably with that on the thermostat.  So then I placed it next to a digital thermometer in another room.  It also varied by several degrees with that thermometer.  So then I got yet another digital thermometer from yet another room which also measured humidity to check the first two.  This digital thermometer varied within one degree of the other (they all are next to each other) but again varied by several degrees with the Springfield analog, and furthermore by a more than dozen percentages in humidity.  Hmm.
Only lasted several weeks, not very accurate and hard to read.I replaced it with a digital humidity monitorFred T
We got this thermometer for hatching chickens, and needed a really precise instrument, which this is not.  It appears (compared to two other, quite reliable thermometers we have in the incubator) to run at least 3 degrees below actual temp.  The hygrometer I can not speak for, as I am comparing to only one other, and, while they have a 10% disparity, I cannot say which is more accurate.  A great price if only a very approximate read is needed.
So I got two for different rooms but one reads 54% humidity the other reads 62%. I guess I could buy 2 more throw out the one(s) that appear to be wrong or I could buy a higher quality unit, yep that makes more sense than trying to save a buck on the cheap one.
You get what you pay for. It is very inexpensive but doesn't measure humidity well (temperature is fine). I put it in a steamy bathroom to test it and the humidity control said 50% (normal).
It never registers correct temp for the room. We do not use and trashed it. Get what you pay for.....
Only gives a general approximation of RH. Not accurate at all in my opinion. If you need to have accurate view of RH, buy two or three electronic units to get better indication of true RH.
I received the product, but it looks nothing like in the picture. Picture has it looking like hardwood imitation or hardwood. I received cheap white plastic looking thing. Nothing like image except for the shape. Thank you very much!
InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste DisposerThe Badger 5 isn't terribly expensive but the quality is very suspect.  I wouldn't mind if I had to change on out every 4-5 years, but after a year?? That's just not acceptable.  It's the labor cost of hiring a pro or your own time to change out a defective unit, and from the sounds of it, defects happen fast and frequently on these. I got the Badger 5 as a result of leaky 3 year old Insinkerator.This lasted almost 1 year exactly when it started making a loud clanking noise whenever it was turned on.  Checked it thoroughly and did not find any objects inside the trap. Felt 2 pieces of metal in the trap that seem to have disconnected and making a ruckus when the motor is engaged.  Not sure what I should do at this point. I'll probably see what the mnanufacturer has to say about this.
My unit came without quick lock strainer. Don't know why. Description did not say that. Had to buy at Home Depot to install.
The Badger 5 came with the condo. At around 2 years I started to notice a few drops of brown liquid on the cabinet floor. I let it go for a while because it just wasn't that bad at the time. Well, it is now. The housing is cracked badly. run the sink, turn on the disposal and watch the waterworks. Not fun.
Yet another unit made in communist china by ninnies that never replaced a disposal in their lives. The wrench provided to detach the previous Badger won't survive the torque needed.MAKE SURE YOU GET PLUMBERS PUTTY.  I assumed the unit came with what I needed,  I am stoopid. It doesn't.MAKE SURE YOU GET PENETRATING OIL: If you are replacing a worn out unit, there'll be rust that formed on the attaching flange on the el cheapo steel used.  Spray all the way around the attachment mechanism and then go to lunch or Lowes to buy a large hammer.  Give it an hour for the oil to do it's deed.  Then go at it with hammer and wrench.  I found an extra person was needed with a crowbar to provide counter pressure on the Sink side of the flange.  That finally allowed the two of us manly men to separate the old unit from the sink side of the attachment mechanism.Epilogue: This review was for a unit I bought for my daughter's home. My own disposal finally died. In researching a new one, I found Waste King has actually designed a totally better mechanism for hanging the unit. That's the company that gets my dollars. As expected the dead Insinkerator had rusted shut and the joke of a tool bent without doing the job. Lots of grunting, whacking and two Aleve later, the Insinkerator was in the trash bin. The Waste King 8000 went in like Flynn and has a lifetime in-home warranty. No more rusting Insinkerator flanges for the rest of my life.
It worked fine for about 4 years until it started leaking from the reset button at the bottom of the unit. Apparently this is a common problem in this unit. The problem couldn't be fixed and we had to replace it by a new garbage disposal. I would hope that a garbage disposal lasts longer than that. It was pretty noisy too.
I had mine professionally installed, and it worked well for 3yrs.It's just my wife & I (not a lot of use)It started leaking out the bottom & from everything I've read, the unit is toast if this is where it's leaking from and that it would cost more to repair than to just replace. You'd think a product like this would last a little bit longer?
We have just moved into a 6 year old house and the Badger 5 garbage disposal has a nuisance leak.  The leak is most evident when emptying a basin of water, which then fills the disposal.  Of course, the house inspection didn't pick this up and it is out of warranty!  There is a vertical crack the full length of the housing between the conical transition and the motor canopy.  Reading other reviews, this is more than wear and tear and should be considered a design flaw.  This disposal is also relatively noisy.  We would not purchase this disposal again.  However, we did replace it with another Badger product, an Evolution Series Space Saver.  It is a completely different construction and design and comes with a four (4) year warranty.  It is as quiet as a church mouse and was easy to install on the existing spin-on mounting.  Although the cost is about double it will be well worth it!!
Have had Insinkerator disposers for years and have always gotten a fair life of the unit until now.  I installed a Badger 5 less than 4 years ago and it cracked in the upper housing the same way so many others have failed.  It cracked vertically in three places on the back side of the unit.  The leaks start small and then the cracks run, as they will do anytime there is vibration.  Since the leaks were on the back side, they weren't noticed until the leakage became apparent on the bottom of the sink cabinet.  After I removed it and inspected the cracks, it looks like it has been leaking for a few years.  Not what I expected after light residential usage.  I took pictures and sent a note to Insinkerator customer service even though it was past warranty since I noticed so many people reporting the same type of cracked housing failure.On the one hand, they denied ever knowing of a problem and quoted several customers stating that their units lasted 10 or more years.  On the other hand, they were very quick to respond and very agreeable to working with me regarding a replacement unit.  So 1-star for the product, but 5-stars for their customer service.  Though I hated to do it, I bought a more expensive unit of the same brand with a stainless steel grinding chamber and stainless grinding components.  Due to design differences, it shouldn't have the same failure.  Hoping for the best!
Just purchased the Badger 5 1/2 hp disposal to replace a Kenmore that had worked fine for 7 years. Installation went fine. No leaks and fairly quiet. Went to use it this morning and the noise was unbelievable. What a racket. I'm afraid to even use it. Already need to call for service and I've only owned this disposal for 24 hours. I just hope that their advertised "in-home" service warranty is real.
I operate a vacation rental property management business.  We have about 20 of these in various cabins.  About 13 of 20 of these Badger 5 disposals have cracked requiring them to be repaired.  While the repair has been fairly easy (thick layer of JB Weld), it is annoying to our renters and should NOT be necessary!  I am waiting for Badger to recall this item so we can send them all back!
Spend a little more and get a better disposer.  I got five years out of mine and then the cast iron grinding chamber collapsed.  Since I only got 2 years out of the replacement badger 10, I consider myself lucky.  My latest disposer is a Waste King.  Bye bye Badgers....EDIT:  Since replacing this with a Waste King a few months ago, I'm revising my review to 2 stars.  The Waste King chews up whatever I put in there, it never jams and it's even quieter than the POS Badger.
This came with the house that we bought in 2013. It recently started leaking into the cupboard similar to what other reviewers have described. I have since replaced his waste disposer with a different brand. Avoid.
This is the slightly older model of Badger 5 garbage disposal. Ours was OK, not great, until it died. It would jam on occasion, but it would sometimes bog down on as little as a cup of vegetable peels or onion skins. It was easy enough to clear and reset (with a 1/4" Allen wrench or hex key), until one morning, it just stopped. It continued to make a buzzing noise, which usually means it can be reset, but not this time.Apparently, the newer model is even worse than the one we have. I would suggest a KitchenAid or Waste King, which is what we went with...
I was replacing a unit that was 9 years old. This unit does NOT come with a power cord or the rubber gasket needed to mount the unit to the upper mount. I had to reuse both parts from the old unit. Not happy with this. The box had no instructions in it and the instructions online are very poor. The unit did work once I mounted it. It seams to be quieter than the old one. Just be prepared to buy extra parts when buying this unit.
Installed the Badger 5xp in 07. Now with warranty expired (3 years)it is leaking from bottom. From other reviews it seems that product quality is not the main concern of manufacturer. Like so many products these days. Will look at other companies to see their ratings
My first badger 5 lasted 12 years. Its replacement lasted 4 years and started leaking thru the housing. So much for badger5. I just ordered a Waste King with an unlimited warranty as my next replacement  for about $45 more.
Mine too has cracked on the side.  It is also leaking out of the bottom through the motor.  Its only a few years old.
Does not grind up bigger pieces or tougher pieces well, such as pepper stems.  Noisier than expected.  Would not recommend.
The disposal I replaced was a badger.The flange on the disposal did the fit the piece that sits in the sink. I took the flange off my old one and  it worked.The piece that connects the disposal to the drain was smaller than the opening of the drain pipe so again I took the old one and used that.I notified the manufacturer without getting any satisfaction..
Had a Badger 5 in the kitchen of a new home, now 5 years old. Worked fine. A bit loud.  After 5 years, developed SEVERAL cracks that leaked just as many others have reported.  It was very easy to replace with another InSinkErator disposal (InSinkErator 3/4 HP Evolution Compact Continuous Feed Disposer). Seems solid, very quiet. hard to know if the upgrade was worth it....they all just chew up your waste after all.
Same problem as a lot of people writing reviews.  We had this installed when our house was built, and 5 years later we started to notice water under the sink.  We were able to locate two cracks on the side of the plastic housing, which caused it to drip and spray under the sink.  It worked great until that.
I have had mine for about 10 years. Know that I don't use it like others. I don't chop up food. I use it to keep my lines clear of food from washing dishes. I noticed a little water under the bottom of my sink a few mos ago. I turned on the water and no leak. Today I noticed water in the tub of my dishwasher tablets (under sink under disposal). I filled the sink with water, took out plug, looked and water was coming out of the disposal. I climbed under the sink and sure enough found a crack at the top of the unit. Further discovery I found several cracks. I won't replace with the same brand.
I bought the unit from Home Depot probably 3 years ago and it did work OK.  But like the others, this unit will fail shortly after warranty and leak water (very stinky water I might add).  I would not purchase this unit, obviously poor construction and design.  It takes too much effort to replace disposals every few years. AVOID this product!
I've had this unit for about 3 years and it developed a leak in the bottom.  Sure enough, reading reviews from here pointed me to a housing leak, just after the warranty expired.  I'm single and don't need to use it much, but I think a garbage disposal should last more than 3 years.  I'm gonna buy something different this time.
save yourself money and irritation by buying a better product. while this 5-81 was quiet enough and did a good job in my case (i'm single, and it didn't get so much use), it rusted out after three years. and aside from the cost--product plus plumber--, the inconvenience isn't worth it. as i say, spend a little more--i'm online to do just that--and get a better unit.
The disposer is delivered quickly. I don't like it because it makes big noise after it has been installed. I won't buy it again since I am not sure if it is caused by the quality of the product. I bought two disposers in the local Sears and didn't have such problem.
In 2011 I purchased a six year old home in FL. The home was occupied for 5 years by a single woman so I'm sure the disposal saw little use. Since I've owned the home and spend a couple months a year, sporadically throughout the year. the disposal locks up on lack of use. Once I freed the blades it worked ...until now. Would it hurt the manufacturer to use a few stainless steel parts to avoid this rusting issue???
We use a drain filter on the kitchen sink, so the Badger 5 was only used when small bits of food get through- nothing major to chop down. It served it's purpose just fine for a few of years until it started to leak. Considering we use it maybe once every week or two, I could only imagine how much sooner it would have leaked if we used it on a regular basis. Should have purchased a WasteKing or something with a lifetime guarantee. Lesson learned.
I have bought many Insinkerators and for the simple reason is they usually don't last past their warranties. The last one I purchased lasted beyond the 2-year warranty. The only reason I haven't purchased another brand is because I don't have to reinstall the part that hooks up to the sink. That takes time and effort. So I just attach the new badger in the old slot.My other experience is they run very well until the warranty ends. It doesn't fine chop the particles going into the disposer and the pipe gets clogged up, and the sink gets stopped up!I gave it a two star because again I keep having to replace the unit just after the warranty expires. It's okay up until then. Why can't they make these things to last well beyond the warranty?
We had one of these In Sink Erator Badger 5 units installed by a plumber during October 2005. It is now less that 8 years old and has started leaking from the bottom of the unit. Before we got this unit, we had one that lasted many years - I estimate 15 to 20 years. I wish I could remember what brand it was. I think I'll start shopping for another brand, as the useful life of this unit seems short.
It's been said over and over.  Insinkerator garbage disposal products are designed to fail.  Add my experience to the list of anecdotal evidence.  This is my second one gone bad.  I have a couple of rental units and it sucks when a disposal fails out the bottom of the casing or the bolt on the bottom.  Tenants do not always notice or call immediately leading to further damage of cabinetry.  Do not be lulled into buying another Badger just because you know the installation will work well with your existing set-up.  I am switching to waste king.  I give it two stars rather than one cause it was relatively inexpensive and they did at least last a few years.
Installed the unit during a kitchen remodel in 2008, although it's not the quietest model it did work well under what I would say are moderate to light conditions. Easy to install and over the years had a jam or two but very easy to clear. However, last night we noticed water under the sink, after a little inspection I found the drip coming from the bottom of the housing, yes this echo's many others that have reported this very same issue. Not that it's ok for blades or motor to have an issue after 5 years but heck a leak in the housing?? Really? I am sure glad we caught it before it got worse or for that matter ran the dishwasher last night! Would love to know if ISE has fixed this issue.
I replaced a Waste King unit with the Badger 5 about 5 years ago. Unfortunately Home Depot didn't have anything else that was affordable. This unit has never performed as well as the Waste King did. It took a long time to grind food completely. The last year or so it has clogged often. The motor gave up this week and will only hum.
I bought a Badger InSinkErator to replace the broken disposer under my kitchen sink. Since my last disposer came with an installed cord, I assumed that all replacement disposers do. To my suprise, The Badger does not.  So to replace your disposer with the Badger, You not only have to be handy at plumbing, You also have to be an electrician and have the following electrical spare  parts: a cord with plug, wire nuts, and strainer relief to hold the cord properly to the Badger's motor. Can you imagin paying for a plumber, and an electrician, to install a disposer that has a one year warrenty?
I've had this unit a little over 2 years (just long enough to be outside the 2-year warranty) and the casing is cracked and leaking.  I didn't notice the leak until the water started dripping into my basement.  Ugh.  You're better off buying a Waste King, rated #1 by Consumer Reports and only slightly higher priced than the Badgers.
Worked OK for about a year then started making a horrible noise. Will have to be replaced again when we put home on the market if not sooner.
My husband purchased this disposal and I was glad because it was new--approximately two years ago.  However, about a year ago it started a clanging noise.  Something came a loose on the inside but would continue to work.  I barely put any foods inside of it, but you could not keep it going for a minute because the noise would drive you nuts.  NOW, it has completely locked up.  Pushing the reset button did not solve the problem. NOW we are going to have to buy another one as this one is not working.  I really think you only have a two-year warranty because they MAY be aware that that is how long it will last.  I am totally dissatisfied.  Too many consumers have felt the same and should be compensated for the inconvenience.
I'm replacing a Badger 5+ after 15 years of service it finally started eating itself and threw a tooth. That tooth and parts are solid non galvanized steel. Solid housing that doesn't leak.From a build quality and components perspective the Evolution series is closest to the Badger of old. Heavy metal and stainless. A bit more power. But no quieter per-se my old Badger 5+ had sound insulation and the Evolution Compact is it's closest replacement and what I'm buying.
I had my house built, all new appliances, and expected things to last longer since I don't cook and am not in the kitchen much.  WRONG!  But, the biggest shocker is that the Badger disposal is broken.  What?  How? Why?  I don't put much down there outside of toast and ... well, soft foods. No utensils. I don't have young people playing with the disposal. I just don't get it and am highly disappointed in this product.When you're looking for a disposal - stay away from Badger!
All you need to know about this product is that it has a two-year warranty.  If you are okay with buying a new disposal in two years, then get this one.  Mine lasted for under three years and I had to buy a new one with another $75 installation fee.  I sure wasn't going to buy another Badger.  Check out the Waste King Model that has a five year guarantee.  For a slightly large 3/4 HP, it comes with a 10 year warranty.
Worked fine under light usage until yesterday.  Developed a crack in the housing and started leaking. Around 5 years old and OOW but Badger said they will ship me a new unit pronto. Hope it's a newer model because this B-5 appears to have a class defect.  I'm impressed with their customer service.  No whining, no pushback.
I've had this garbage disposal for the past three years. It's not very poweful and I don't even try to put much down it. Also, it has completely broken down twice in the past three years. I would save up next time to buy a better model. My husband always says you get what you pay for.
Bought this unit because it was identical to the existing disposal, and I had very limited room for changing plumbing.  Old unit was about 5 years old and leaking through the bottom.  It was on the bar sink and wasn't used much.  it should have lasted a lot longer.
This is designed to rust from inside out within a few years; so if you never use it, it would still break by itself. Apparently the design is to create interior rust-prone spots all around the top part of the unit. These spots eventually rust out and create a split all around, and if you wait long enough the whole unit would fall off. Meanwhile the rusted-out holes would leak water everywhere.
same failure mode as Paul: housing split vertically down the back, spraying water in cabinet when used. we've used it lightly for a year.
Had the unit about 5 years.It did outlast it's warranty, otherwise I would have given it 1 star.It was so lightweight that we never put in hard to chew items (lemon, lime, chicken bones, etc.).Only small amounts of carrot skins, celery, cucumber, etc. were ever put in the thing because we compost whatever we can.It started leaking because the housing/seals have corroded and/or cracked.It is well past its 2 year warranty, but should have lasted much longer.I will be replacing it with NOT a Badger or any other product manufactured by this company.**November 2010** - We installed a new "Waste King 9980 Legend Series 1 HP Continuous Feed Operation Waste Disposer" - bought it on amazon for $109, that's a great price.Waste King 9980 Legend Series 1 HP Continuous Feed Operation Waste Disposerhttp://www.amazon.com/Waste-King-9980-Continuous-Operation/dp/B001215150/The unit went in pretty easy.  I had to remove the plug to hard wire the unit, needed to pry it out with a screw driver. The unit is great and easily grinds anything we put in.  It takes a little more room under the sink but it's worth it.  And it's very quiet too.Guaranteed for life against corrosion.  We'll see...
I bought this and hardly used the insinkerator (about once per week).  After 4 months, it started to leak at the bottom in several areas.  The bottom is made of steel metal.  The water caused the corrosion which shows the design flaw of this product.  It is strong enough to move and tear food particles but it leaks a significant amount of water.  This product is not good...stay away from all the Badgers.
Good machine but terrible instructions. In fact,  useless. Who the heck is paid to write these awful instructions. Did they not think to try it out with a dozen people and see how they curls improve?
Mine's going back to be replaced by something designed well. I don't know if I got a lemon or if they're all this bad.Problem 1 - that damn split ring used to lock the neck assembly to the sink. It takes about 4 hands to install it. You have to use one to keep some stuff tight against the bottom of the sink. You need another to keep the tube thing that the split ring goes onto pulled down far enough to expose the groove the ring goes into. You need another to open the split ring and one more to actually guide the split ring into the groove. Stupid design.Problem 2 - the metal collar that connects the main body to the sink attachment pulls clean off the main body as soon as you try to tighten it. The pathetic plastic collar that's supposed to stop it coming off is not doing its job.Problem 3 - it's missing bits. There should be a collar to stabilize the wires as they exit the main housing. I know they tell you in the instructions that it's not included but it bloody well should be. They're just too cheap to include hardware they know you will need. If they simply have to save a few pennies they could have designed a wire clamp into the body but I guess they didn't think of that.
My Badger 5 is nearly 8 years old, but like others the housing eventually cracked and the leak left a big mess to repair.  When it functioned, it was very loud and in fact I thought it broken when new--it sounded like there was a screw or bottle cap lodged in it.  The blades eventually wore down enough to make it sound "normal" which is also very loud.  Because it performed so poorly, I tried not to use it for anything large or tough.  I'm replacing it with a more 'upscale' model.  I hope it performs better than this one.  I guess for the price it will do, but ... I don't recommend this model for daily use.
Like everybody else, the plastic housing on my Badger 5 cracked and it started leaking water.  Having seen run-of-the-mill garbage disposals last 10-20 years, this was extremely disappointing.  The only reason it's getting 2 stars rather than 1 is because it seems we got lucky by getting 5 years compared to most other reviewers getting just over 2 years.
Well I am going to attempt a new replacement Badger I guess, like everyone else my badger is leaking from the bottom and I dont want to go through the hassle of refittinng all the pipes! got about 5 years out of it.Had a different model at my old home when I sold the house after 11 years that was still going strong!
No complaints, it worked perfectly... but for only four years.  Now the housing is cracked, and leaking.  Time to find a new disposal.  It won't be another Badger - four years is too short.
We had installed a the 1/2 HP Badger 5 when we remodeled our kitchen about 4 years ago. It wasn't that loud, it did the job of grinding egg shells and table scraps, however we travel a lot so the disposal had maybe 1 1/2 years of normal use on it. One day, I noticed a leak under the sink and couldn't trace where it was coming from. Finally I ran my fingers across the back side of the unit and discovered what felt like a crack. Sure enough the housing (plastic!) had a long crack in it. If it wasn't for the cardboard box of garbage bags that was soaking up all the water I could have had a big problem on my hands.In the end I have decided to replace this with another InSinkErator brand because I wanted a Made in America and the quality appears to go up substantially with Evolution series. The way I figure it, the added warranty and features of the higher end models alone pays for two of these cheep Badger 5's.
I am replacing a 1/2 hp home kitchen InSinkErator after 2-1/2 years due to water leaking from the electrical cord entry on bottom of unit.  As an electrician I don't like water getting inside the motor compartment.  Upon inspection of the grinding chamber I see a hole approx. 1/4" dia. in the composite material.  Practically all brands work well at first, but if they don't last I don't like.  Notice other leak problems in customer reviews.  Be careful!
The grinding chamber rusted out below the impeller and it leaked like a sieve.  Only lasted about 5 years with light duty use.  The only stainless parts in this thing are the swinging beaters.  Everything else is galvanized which gets wiped out pretty quickly.  You need to go upscale to a long/lifetime warranty product like Waste King's L-8000.
I installed this Badger 5 Disposer in a rental condo about 5 years ago.  I now had to replace it because it developed a 4" vertical crack in the upper enclosure (housing).  The enclosures used to be made of metal (and eventually rust through), but I now discovered that they are made of cheap plastic.  This one was manufactured in Oct. 2006.  The value of my time - making 2 trips - was worth more than the cost of the disposer.  A leak like this can also cause substantial damage to to the kitchen cabinet and floor.  It is sad that the company cannot engineer a better product.  From reading the reviews, it is obvious that this is a design defect, not the result of improper use.  The other brand I use is Waste King, and I have not had any such problems with their disposers.
Wow, I was just searching to replace my Badger 1 insikerator garbage disposal that was installed in our house when it was built only three years ago, and noticed all the leaky disposal reviews.  Our Badger 1 is leaking like crazy and getting worse really fast.  Guess we won't replace with the same model.  Thanks for all the reviews, now I know it's not just ours.
Original one lasted 25 years. Replacement only lasted 2-years, sprung a leak in the bottom, developed excessive corrosion, water all over under the sink. This unit is not at all the same quality as it used to be. The motor sounds weaker, it grinds OK but not as good as the original one. It gets stuck sometimes, and when it does work it sounds like the motor is struggling. It doesn't come with a cord! It doesn't come with a cord restraint! The instructions are really bad with multiple languages mixed together. It tells you to skip steps if replacing an existing unit, and then you have to go back to the beginning of the instructions because what they said was not correct. Be aware that if you have a Dishwasher, there is a drain plug in place that needs to be knocked out with a screw driver. It needs to be a small screw driver and it is gently hammered on the edge of the plug inside, in several locations all around and then removed with needle nose pliers.
I too have one that leaked water through the casing.  I can understand if it fails after awhile where the blades wear out or motor wears out but they shouldn't have a casing that opens up and leaks water in the under sink cabinet.I've replaced this with a more expensive Evolution model.  It costs more but I figure over a 10 year span, I'll have saved more money and frustration than buying Badger models over and over.  Too many Badger reviews also say their casings leaked.
Loud, inefficient, below grade disposal. Will not grind anything but wet cereal. It WILL give up on you after about 5-6 years of light use. Buy the evolution model and save your money and your time.
plastic casing leaks eventually
I too have one that's leaking from the bottom.  I bought this a few years ago and was the only one I could find that would fit.
bought this and during installation the whole thing came apart, upon inspection i noticed 2 or the 4 bolts that hold it together were missing. Luckily i still had the old one and just took 2 of the rusty ones out and put them in the new unit. Be advised INSiNKERATOR does NOT SEND OUT ANY REPLACEMENT PARTS!!!!! This is a terrible company for customer service. Offers to send out repair person but then says it will cost $99 since it was not a defect just missing parts??????? rediculous.
I have a long history of working with kitchen disposals having several rental properties, and thanks to the very poor quality of InSinkErator.InSinkErator products are so poorly made that I replace 1-2 disposals every year or so. Why do I keep buying them? Simply because the InSinkErator "mounting system" is well engineered which makes motor replacement relatively easy. Other brands, and they are few and far between, are even worse in quality and replacement more complicated. I will give InSinkErator credit for the mounting system, it is very good.Read the customer reviews of all InSinkErator models and you will see a common thread, they simply do not last. I noticed on the cheap Badger 1 model which I keep replacing, that the motor typically seizes and there is rust on the blades and drain area. The rust suggests the seizing may come from rusted parts, so when I went to buy another disposal I noticed that InSinkErator makes a stainless steel model at about twice the price. I considered it for a few minutes, until I read reviews of the stainless model that owners had exactly the same issues with the stainless as the cheaper model. In fact, the reviews of all their models regardless of price and motor size from owners report the same problems, they universally suffer a premature death. I couldn't see the point in spending more money on another model knowing they all last about the same amount of time. I have stuck with the less expensive model.I would say a typical life span of a InSinkErator is about 4 years. If you get to 5 years you are on borrowed time. One of my properties needed a kitchen makeover, and I actually removed the disposal completely. Smartest thing I ever did and I will do the same for my other properties when I am between tenants and even in my own home when the disposal dies the next time around.There is an opportunity for another company to come along with a well made unit and steal the market away from InSinkErator. Until then, I will do away with the disposal completely when possible, and replace with InSinkErator when I must.
I've had the Badger 1 in place for about 3 years and yes it has leaked through the casing...specifically through a couple of rusted bolts in the casing and water leaks all over the place under the sink.  Definitely poor design, the thing still runs but has to go...
I replaced the old disposal with the exact same model.  The new one had a crack in the breaker resent button and it was very noisy.  It almost looked as if it was a refurbished product.  Received sympathy from the vendor but little else.
After 3 years of very light use, ( maybe used 2-3 times a week) it has stopped working. There is visible rust inside the unit where the sink drains into it. Just makes a grinding sound. Not cool
When we bought our house, the garbage disposal was a cheap Insinkerator contractor model 333. It lasted 4 years. I replaced it with an expensive 3/4 hp model Insinkerator. It lasted 2 months past the 5 year warranty. So, if I've established that Insinkerator is junk, why did I buy another Insinkerator (InSinkErator Badger 1,  1/3 HP Household Food Waste Disposer) to replace it? 1) It is a quick and easy replacement. The quick change mounting system is the best feature of insinkerator. Obviously the manufacturer knows something about the durability of their products.  2) We are selling the house within a year.
I couldn't bring myself to give it a 1 star since it has worked admirably for the 8 years I have owned my home but for the side of the casing to corrode and LITERALLY blow out! That is just unacceptable.  It's moderately noisy but the motor seems to be bullet proof.  Besides the motor and reasonable price I just cant recommend this disposal. The money you save buying it will be offset by the water damage you take to your ruined cabinets as it starts to leak or worse, blows out like mine. AVOID at all costs!
Well, this disposer is cheap.  It's also noisy and vibrates a lot, so you get what you pay for.  Also it rusted out and started leaking after five years.  I would spend the extra money up front and buy a higher quality model.
We got this new with the house when it was built.  We use it daily.  It started leaking badly after 4.5 years, then died shortly after.  In short it lasted a few weeks under 5 years.
It appears that these models are built to leak. I should have read the reviews before I purchased mine. Looks like I make the move to a Waste King.
I have been able to keep it functional for over a year, but only by jury rigging it. The handle broke the first week I had it, and I had to JB Weld it back together. Expect the long arms to bend the first time you don't seat a can correctly. You will constantly have to make minor adjustments to the arms to keep it working. After a year or so, the drywall anchors are starting to separate from the wall. This is a fine product if you only are going to crush a few cans a week, but if you are planning on crushing 100s of cans, look elsewhere.
When used in a soda can you must come down fast and the side arms will bend if not perfectly aligned. It needs to be more sturdy and not bend.
Good looking product, but my first experience was frustrating (the oatmeal burned at the point where the pitcher contacts the diffuser)
A few months ago, I bought two 8" plates to use with my Piral terra cotta cookware. At first, they were beautiful and functional. They are now discolored and warped. I do not mind the discoloration since it doesn't affect function, though it is sort of an eyesore on the stovetop. Much worse than that, they have developed a slight bulge in the middle such that none of my cookware sits flat on them--I tried both covers on both 8" burners. For what it's worth, I used them on an inexpensive electric coil stove. Perhaps I used too high a heat? I don't remember reading in the directions that you can't use a medium-high heat.While they worked, they were great. Took a long time to heat up, but I felt much better about using my terra cotta on the stove. They look very impressive fresh out of the packaging. That doesn't last long...the black finish starts cracking and fading. The orange bottom of my cookware stained them also.Considering that this is one of few (or only) negative reviews of this item, I accept that my experience may be unique and these may work just fine for you! They didn't for me, though. I can't use them at all since the cookware rocks back and forth on them now.
used only once. horrible smelly smoking finish on it. making soup today and hoping the surface is burned off and it will serve its purpose. no directions inuded.
I was looking for a  heat diffuser for my gas cook top and bought this one. I set it on my stove and it slid around on the grates.  I didn't feel it was safe.  I just ordered the Ilsa Cast Iron one from Amazon.  Hopefully it works better.
Purchased two 8" burner plates after moving into an apartment with a finicky gas stove.  I could not adjust the burners to achieve a consistent simmer for soups, oatmeal, and other liquid-based foods.  By placing the burner plate over the flame I was able to adjust the temperature to just about any heat level I needed.  The burner plates are of excellent quality and a good value.  Even my omelets are cooking with less heat and more evenly.  You won't be disappointed!
When the product finaly arrived it was just what we needed. Good product!Unfortunately UPS is no good in Norway, when I tracked the shipment I could see it had arrived after two days to transit in Norway. And there it was stuck for a week.. I don't know what happend, but this confirms my theory of that there are no way I'll by products shipped to Norway with UPS...To bad I have to downrate a good product, because UPS don't do their job..
It started out great with even cooking temps... I could ignore the coating blistering but the problem became when the plate warped and made a dome shape right in the middle!!  Now  it is unusable. What I was hoping for was the heavier, almost cast iron ones a friend had from Europe.
Really wanted this to work, but did not diffuse enough for my stove.  The lowest simmer setting on my gas stove is too hot.  I am constantly burning things on the smallest burner at the lowest setting.  This plate did not help at all, food burned just the same.
If you have a coil style electric oven, don't even bother because these will not help.I was hoping that these would help diffuse the heat evenly across the bottom of my cookware - these did not help, we still had hot spots.After 3 months of use, the tops are scratched up and the coils look better than the plate.
Thought this would be a great solution to the uneven heating of the coils on an electric stove.It worked great for about a week on the small burner of my stove. My copper bottom pans don't distribute heat quite as well as I had expected and I still get hot spots on my electric stove.After about a week, my pots began to do a slow rattle as they heated.After two weeks of regular daily use, my pots rock back and forth and instead of uneven heating, I now have a single black spot in the center of the bottom of my pan.I thought maybe it was the pan might have a slight dent but then I notice the same localized burn spot on the bottom of another pan and I had to scrape charred remains from the inside of that same second pan.After the pots were cooled and cleaned I placed them on the perfectly flat surface of my granite counter and my pans are 'reasonably' flat. The burner plate however rocks and spins like a top from a central raised point.
The part that appears white in the photo is actually clear. It is useless on my black dishwasher, you cant even read the words. Also it is a suction cup, NOT a magnet which I thought, although that part does not really matter to me.Oh, and did I mention the cost to return it will be more than the item is worth?
I purchased this clean/dirty indicator thinking that I had solved the solution to folks in my household not knowing if the dishes were clean or dirty, but was disappointed when after putting it on my dishwasher several times, it kept falling off.  The suction cup indeed does not work very well. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and super glued a small magnet to the back of it and it now works fine.  The product should have worked as stated, but glad I found a remedy to the problem.  Be prepared to glue on a magnet if it fails to function after you've purchased it or spend more money for one with a magnet already on it!
Won't stay stuck for long. You will find this on the floor, no matter what you stick it to. Not recommended.
I haven't had ay problems with the suction cup, as mentioned above. My nain issue is that it's printed in black on clear plastic. I have a black dishwasher so it's very difficult to read. My solution was to stick white labels on the back to make it legible, but it would have been nice not to need to do that.
The item itself is not black and white, but rather CLEAR and white. So if your dishwasher is not white (black or stainless), you'll have a hard time seeing it.Secondly, it does not adhere well to the stainless steel faade of my dishwasher.
I don't know if it's just me and my dishwasher, but the suction cup did not stay on the dishwasher for more than 5 minutes. Which defeats the purpose of the indicator all together. Will have to attach magnetic strip to the back and manually flip the sign over instead of rotating.
When I bought this, I searched for &#34;dishwasher magnets&#34; so I assumed this was a magnet...it's not. This has a suction cup on the back that will not stick to my stainless steel dishwasher. It stays up for an hour or so, but then crash lands on the floor. I'm going to rip the suction cup off and replace with a magnet (because I'm cheap and don't want to just throw it away). Also, the photo makes this look as if it's black and white, but it's actually black and clear.
Spins too easily: somehow it always ends up half way between clean and dirty.  Mostly solved the problem wrapping a rubber band around the back of it, but it's a bit of a hack job so 2 stars.
This product would have been a lot better if the two sides of the disk were in colors other than black and white.  But the main problem is that just opening and closing the dishwasher door can cause the disc to easily spin, which defeats the purpose.
I find myself constantly asking my husband if the dishes are clean or dirty. It just sort of blends into the background so you forget to change it, and the opening of the dishwasher knocks it out of whack so it sometimes isn't clear if clean or dirty is facing up.
We intended to use this dishwasher indicator for house guests but it did not stick to our dishwasher and was a waste of money for us. It would probably work if you have a stainless steel dishwasher face.
the suction cup works well, but the spinner is loose so sometimes we still have to do the &#34;hey is the dishwasher clean or dirty?&#34; yelled across the house which is exactly the reason i got this in the first place! :)
the problem is the suction cup isn t holdingso the it s kind worthlessthe solution as previus review glue a magnet
I originally liked it, but since my first rating the darn thing has dropped on the floor a million times, I've even heard it drop in the middle of the night and my dog went nuts.
The spinner was larger than expected and would only stay on the lip of the counter and not on the diishwasher. We ended up ordering a different style altogether
I can't seem to get this to stick to my dishwasher.  Too bad - I was really hoping it would work.
Pros: It spins nicelyCons:  It falls off.  Gravity apparently is too much for this.  We tried attaching some magnets but those didn't work either.  Will be shopping for a different one.
The pictures make it look like it's black background and white text vs white background and black text.  That's not the case.  It's black background and clear text vs clear background and black text.  That's a problem because the only place on the dishwasher that I could get the suction cup to stick is on the black area near the buttons rendering it unreadable.  I can (and probably will) glue some white paper behind it so that I can read it, but it also has a problem of turning too easily so that I often see it sideways and revert to my old trick to see if the dishes are clean or not by checking to see if the machine is locked.  None of my front is metal meaning magnetic signs were out, so I so wanted the suction idea to work, but this one just doesn't quite pull it off.
Maybe my dishwasher is too dirty. Maybe I didn't push it hard enough. Maybe I got a duff one. All I know is that it keeps falling off the dishwasher, which makes it kind of useless.
So it arrived in the mail but CLEAN is spelled NAELC and DIRTY is spelled YTRID.  Otherwise, this was a great, inexpensive product...
Sure, it works just wonderfully when I first replace the filter, but it only lasts about 3 weeks, not 3 months. We use the humidifier all day and night in our very dry apartment which is only 500 square feet, and after even 1 week I start smelling the moldy smell. This is despite cleaning the tank and tray every 2 days (they recommend once a week) and turning the filter over every day. And you have to keep all the windows and doors closed, or it won't work at all. That makes for very stagnant air quality. Very disappointing.
If you can get 2 weeks out of each filter from about 12 to 15 hours per day of use you are doing good. The water absorbs into the filter so it does get moldy, but that's the nature of the design. I mainly used it in the hallway between two rooms with the doors of the rooms open, and the humidity reading would always stay around 25% even when on high and I set it to go to 45%, but it could never get there. The humidifier that this filter fits into is just not that powerful unfortunately. The filters are what they are, it is the humidifier itself that can only handle small to medium sized rooms. The high setting on the Hamilton Beach unit is very loud. I recently lost this unit in a house fire and I wouldn't buy it again. I'd go for either a filterless system or a unit that can handle larger rooms even if they cost more.
The filter lasts for about two weeks, after which it turns completely useless: it stops soaking up water more than two inches from the bottom (the rest of it remaining dry as the Sahara desert), thereby rendering the humidifier totally useless at any speed. The cost of filters for a single season is more than the price of the humidifier itself.
I got my humidifier a week ago. And my filter already changed his color to yellow. Plus adds some bad odor to the air coming from humidifier. So be ready to get a couple of this filters if you using humidifier a lot
All the bad reviews are right on. We may have to use this and put up the cash because i havnt found anything else, but the filters only last a short while if cared for perfectly. If not cared for perfectly you risk hurting your kids health.
The humidifier started leaking after a few weeks.  In another website, a few reviewers also had this problem.  The water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty.  Very annoying!!  The filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use.  It is also way too expensive.
Avoid Kaz products (Vicks, Honeywell, etc).  They fail to do a good job and their customer service is the worst.  This cartridge didn't do enough to demineralize.  Doesn't matter though since my Kaz (Vicks branded) humidifier just started spewing out smoke and smells like burning rubber.
The cartridge that came with the vicks humidifier only lasted about 10 fillings (they claim 30-40).  I think it would be just as cost effective (and easier) to just buy distilled water to use in the humidifier, and skip the filter cartridge.
The Filter arrived covered in mold. Needless to say I do not reccomended buying from g&s drug co. Stay away from these guys.
I purchased this because our house is order than old and I was concerned about our water quality. While the tests were easy to use and showed our water was in the legally acceptable range, it is utterly over priced for a single test.Home Depot has a similar test for $9.99. I'm kicking myself for wasting $9.00ish.PASS THIS BY AND GO TO HOME DEPOT!!
I specifically bought this test over the other ones as it stated "Iron:  Causes Metallic Taste and Reddish Color Staining." and I'd noticed my water had a colored tint to it at times. In receiving the test, it doesn't seem to mention any iron test at all. I don't know if I got the wrong test, or if that description is wrong, but it's definitely disappointing.
The product is easy to use, but it is over-priced. I bought another water test kit just to compare the results. To my surprise, what's inside the other kit was the exact same content, only the brand name was different. Watersafe sells the same product at $17.40, while the other brand sells at $12.88.
Delivery was as stated, and decent price.  However out of the package the TDS readings for tap and filtered H2O are way OFF!  And I verified same H20 with another test kit.  The latter was in accordance with City of Phoenix H2O dept.  Now I'm not giving up totally on this instrument as bottled H2O came in as expected and in accordance with the other 'watersafe' city water kit?Not exactly sure why my Tap and filtered water read (almost the same) and above 600 every time??  Unless the accuracy of the device is just off with any H20 except bottled or distilled??Rick
I had 2 Haier poartable dishwashers. One broken down 8 month and the other worked about a year. Then no matter what button you push, no action at all. The cost of repair is more than you buy one.Plus, the customer service from Haier is terrible.I am buying other brand after 2 years trying Haier.
It will not hold more than two full-sized dinner plates.  Forget pots and pans...No way are they going inside. I excpect better from Haier.  They normally make good quality products.
The following dishwasher is not as great a one would have liked. I purchased it with the high expectations that I would not have to wash dishes again as long as I tossed a load in here on a daily basis. It is to help out in my dishwasher free apartment. I can jam just about any dishes, even pots in pans in there without too much trouble. I noticed two problems with this device which inevitably led me to returning it. First of all, it didn't fit. It was too tall for just about any of my counters since the drawers above blocked it from fitting. That, unfortunately, prevented the device from being useful for me right off the bat. The second issue I faced was that as tight as I could make the faucet adapter, whenever I turned the water on, water sprayed out the sides and made everything wet, forcing me to put a washcloth over it to prevented water from getting everywhere. Besides these two things, and the rumors I here about its motherboard getting overheated, I would say it is best to spend a little more money for one of the other available desktop dishwashers.
Arrived seriously damaged; returned it and got my money back. Box looked fine, so who knows whose fault it was....just a hassle for this guy.
Set up was ok, but no instructions for the sink adapter. I got to use mine one time before the sensor thing broke. I called customer service and the woman did not know what she was talking about. She kept telling me to look for things that "are in a typical dishwasher," (that's how she described the parts when I asked what it looked like)but I have never owned another dishwasher so I didn't know what to look for. She told me to unplug it for the night and try again. It still didn't drain the water out so I called back. Another woman told me that first woman didn't know what she was talking about and that I need to drain all the water and let it dry out for 24 hours. Then instead of them fixing it I would have to return it to Amazon (even though it's under their warranty) then if the next one that came was broken I could send it back to them. I called again today because I wanted to just get it fixed and I wasn't going to send it back to Amazon. Well they don't fix these units, you have to exchange it. They would rather you exchange it back to Amazon, but if not then you have to pay for the shipping and handling and wait 2 more weeks for another dishwasher. I won't be buying anything else from Haier.
Hi all, I LOVED this, I bought it back in July direct from Haier and it died in August. It has been at a service center (and still is now it's December) and after MONTHS of haggling with Haier and being told the parts are on back order they are finally shipping a new one.  I'm suppose to recieve it this Thursday Dec 11th and I'm not holding my breath.  Haier customer service was unreal and just awful.  The only reason why I was able to get them to send me another one was because I found it online here and on Wal-mart.com.  I couldn't understand how I could buy it in have it in a day and they were making me wait over 4 months for parts, espcially when it was it was brand new when it died.  Just be careful! It shorted out but it is cool.  Haier customer service WAS THE PITS! Thumbs DOWN 100% to them! BOoooooooo!!!  -James Bishop, Manchester VT.
Edit/Update: It now leaks, a lot.  It's leaking from inside the unit where the water pump attaches to the bottom.  That didn't last too long, did it?Quick:-Near-useless manual-No installation instructions; Frustrating.-/+Bigger than I thought+Cleans well+Holds a lot for the size+Saves time/energy+Very little detergent neededDetailed:I was so excited to get this, because I hate HATE washing dishes.  My first job was as a dishwasher in a restaurant, and that became old real fast.  I was slightly disappointed, but there is good here.  Bad first, with a good finish.First of all, I'd like to say that I bought this from another website.  It said "2 level wash system" but the unit I actually received only had one. When I got mine it had "1" stickers placed over all the number 2's on the box, and alas there is only one sprayer inside (on the bottom).  The upper sprayer is not installed.  However, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  More on that later.The first thing that was unexpected was the size.  It's about 20in tall, and was 3 inches too tall to fit on my counter because of the cabinets.  However, I had a small area next to the sink, and a small table, so problem solved.The next issue I had was the manual.  I'm one of those people that reads the whole thing front to back before I use anything.  I was surprised that it was full of some useful information, but lacking SO much.  For instance:-In one part, it says the water should be between 130-150 degrees, but in another part says you should only connect it to the cold water faucet. (For the record, I use hot 130 degree water.  Works well.)-It doesn't have clear installation instructions at all.-In the manual, it says you can turn off the heated dry function, but doesn't say how.  The heated dry indicator LOOKS like a button, but it's not.  After a week I discovered by accident you have to press the wash selection button twice to turn it off.-Doesn't have clear operating/usage instructions.Another issue with this is the water inlet hose.  Once installed it IS very easy to connect and disconnect.  However, once the machine is run, you have to turn the water off and disconnect it.  Simple, right?  WELL, the pressure builds up in the pipe even after you turn off the sink.  The first time I disconnected it I got hot water exploding in my face, and it wasn't pleasant.  SO, you have to let it sit for a few minutes to let the pressure leak out from the hose.The last issue is minor.  The tray that holds the dishes doesn't come out very far.  This is probably to resist the machine tipping over, but it's rather difficult to get normal to large sized dishware inside, but is possible.Now, FINALLY, the good parts:The one sprayer has so far cleaned everything properly, as long as everything is placed facing or angled down like normal.  Also, because of the small size inside, I feel that a 2nd overhead sprayer would severely limit the types of dishes I would be able to fit in the unit, so only having one sprayer inside turned out to be a good thing, since there is extra room inside for bigger plates and taller cups.It uses very little dishwasher detergent - about 2 tablespoons for a whole load.  This means a bottle goes very far.I feel like I save energy and paper towels now.  The hot water heats up the dishes so much that the heated dry function isn't needed (although it's there if your water isn't so hot and you need it).  As long as I crack the door open right after the wash ends to let out the steam, the heat in the plates literally dries itself off.  Also, it doesn't use as much water as I would washing and rinsing them manually.Another good thing is that the picture is pretty accurate.  I can fit about 4 meals worth of plates, bowls, silverware, and cups in this thing before it's full.  I live alone and run it about once every 2 days.And the best part, I hardly EVER have to wash things manually now.  Mainly only large pans.  Everything else goes in the dishwasher!Other thoughts:In the manual, it says you have to place this right next to the sink, above or level with the sink because of the way it drains.  However, I think the manual is wrong again.  First of all, the hoses and cord is 4-5ft long, so it doesn't have to be RIGHT next to the sink.  Also, when it drains it seems that it pumps the water out, instead of just letting it drain.  I haven't tried it yet, but I think you could place it below sink level and be ok.Normally I'd say this is PERFECT as a gift for a college student living a dorm or something like that.  However, because of the pain and confusion in installation, I'd hold off unless you know what you're doing and can install it for them, or they are somewhat experienced with installing a dishwasher.  It does need a pair of pliers for the installation too.
I live in a small place, and I HATE doing dishes... especially silverware. When I saw this I had to have it.What they don't tell you, and what caused me to return it, is that the drain is "gravity" which means it needs to be at least sink high.Well, that didn't work for me because it wouldn't fit under my cabinets, and good luck trying to find a rolling cart that is counter high.I did 2 loads, neither of which I was impressed with. My dishes were not clean. However, I wouldn't write it off so easily since I didn't play around with soap amounts. Also, there is nowhere to put drying agents.I can say it was difficult to load... hardly anything fits like it seems it should.Thus, I give this a "little better than nothing" rating, but I took mine back and got an 18" Kenmore.
The unit was defective right out of the box. It cost me 14.99 to have a new unit shipped to me. You would think that shipping would be covered. Buyer beware
The Haier product stopped working after 1 week. I could turn it on but it would shut itself off in a few minutes. I called the company twice but their systems were down. They were supposed to call me back but they did not.However, Etronics, the shipper was very helpful. I talked to one of their representatives who contacted Haier and set up a replacement process for me.I hope the replacement product works better.
I'm single, busy grad student and I don't cook much, so a smaller counter-top dishwasher sounded like a perfect addition to my kitchen. In hindsight, I would NOT have bought it. It worked OK for about 8 months but then it started to leak, and a few days later it suddenly flooded my kitchen floor. Water was coming out from under the door like a water fall. It's an expensive product that's cheaply made. It's under warranty for 1 year and you're lucky if it lasts longer than that OR if you can get anyone to honor that warranty.1. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. You can never get anyone on the phone, and if you do, they give you some idioic runaround about having the 'repair specialist' call you back in a few minutes. This never happens. If you buy it, you're on your own to make it work.2. Dishwasher is huge and awkwardly shaped. It's almost as big as some full-size ones. It's too tall to fit under most standard-size apartment cabinets and too wide to sit on standard counter comfortably.3. Weak drainage pump. Machine wouldn't drain if it's even 1 inch below counter-top level, which means you can't use a crate or separate table to place this thing on unless it's exactly as high as your kitchen counter. It also has a very short power cord, so your options for placing it are very limited.4. Dishes are NEVER dry when the wash cycle is over.5. Instructions are USELESS. I was lucky that I have an older faucet system and so attaching the water hose to it wasn't too difficult, but the machine won't hook up to newer faucents and may require additional parts that aren't included in the attachment kit.6. Loading tray is very awkwardly designed. No way to stand up tall glasses without having the flip sideways.7. Cheap parts. The whole machine is made cheaply. Parts started to bend, break, and fall apart after a few months.
Since there are very few dishwashers available in this size and none of them have very good reviews, I continue to buy the Haier dishwasher.  When the machine works, it does a great job of cleaning the dishes.  However, getting one that works is a problem.  I have bought several of these machines.  About one in three will continue to work after the first week.  There doesn't seem to be much quality control at the factory.  I don't bother with the warrenty.  The machine is cheap.  So, it is cost effective to just buy two or three of them and use the non-working ones for parts.  Once you get the sloppy assembly problems fixed, the machine will last a good while.  Haier does not repair these machines under warrenty.  They just replace them and all you get is another machine that won't work.  You have to be willing to do the repairs yourself if you want one that will work and last.  Also, they advertise these as two level washing.  They are not!  But, they do a good job on the dishes.
I purchased two of these for my Holmes humidifier.  Seller was good, but product is bad.Firstly, the picture looks like the filter is surrounded by plastic.  The product in fact doesn't have the black surround, but a metallic wire frame instead.  After a few days of use, the water turned yellow, the metal is oxidized (I assume rust), and the filter is growing some white crusty stuff.  The water I used goes through a water softener and reverse-osmosis system so it's quite pure.I'll be discarding this and the second filter that I haven't opened.  It's priced low so it's not even worth returning.
this item was wong size. did not fit my humidifier. had to send it back. not a clear description on line
This product will not wick up enough water and loads up to fast so you have toreplace it to often.
Yuck.  I have bought these in the past and have had no problems.  This time they got moldy quickly.  Will not buy again.
Have had a few of these now.  Company that sells them is great but the filters just don't hold up. They fall apart if you try to clean them.  So you just toss them when they go to pot.
After reading many of the reviews on this product before purchasing, I realized that I might not get a product actually manufactured by Holmes. As you can see by the Customer Photos I submitted, the filter was not manufactured by Holmes but fits my model Holmes humidifier. I cannot yet comment on how long the filter lasts as I just received it, but I also find that filter life fluctuates greatly with weather, use and care/cleaning of a humidifier.
The price was excellent but the durability was not. The wick/filter only lasts two or three weeks at best. The wicks/filter I purchased at a retail location lasted well over a month. I'm looking for an alternate source.
Wrong size I need HolmesHWF75PDQ- U returning the 65  when I can repackage it. I thought I ordered 75. Other too small
The product did fit my humidifier and was delivered promptly. However, it does not seem to wick the water very efficiently.
I bought this filter from Amazon because I didn't want to drive 25 miles to Super Walmart to get one.  It took THREE WEEKS to arrive.  I had actually forgotten about it. I wouldn't buy this type of product on Amazon again.
My humidifier told me to replace the filter the day after I installed it.  I also had to trim the filter to fit.
The shipment arrived quickly, but the 2 filters I ordered are not anything like the genuine Holmes HWF65 as far as their ability to wick the water from bottom to top of the filter. Turning the filter upside down so the whole surface is wet helps for maybe an hour before the filter dries out again. I bought a Holmes HWF65 locally to compare it and it works as it should with the whole filter remains wet bottom to top making the humidifier work properly. As a result, I gave the 2 filters a toss.
The filter as delivered was not really Holmes branded and the built-in meter on my Holmes humidifier has read "replace filter" from day one using the replacement filter. I think the replacement filter really doesn't work well because now the water consumption of the humidifier in operation is about half of what it used to be with the original"factory" filter. I have the brochure from the original humidifier package and there's a web address to order "genuine" Holmes filters. That will be my next step to see if I can get the humidifier's efficiency  back to what I hope it can be.
The product description says this filter inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold and mildew. After 2 months of use, it is full of black mold and fuzzy white mildew. I've ordered another, but this time I'll try using a water treatment with it as well. I'm ordering the BestAir 3BT-6 Original BT Humidifier Bacteriostatic Water Treatment - hopefully that will help. If not, next year the Holmes goes in favor of a different model.
I don't know who manufactured this filter for this seller, but they look real cheap and come in a cheap plastic wrapper.  They don't even look like the picture.  I'm trying the first one tonight, but I'm disappointed to see how cheap these look.  I bought 4 thinking that if they were on Amazon they should be somewhat legit.
This filter does not seem to work as well as the Holmes brand. I did not think it would make a difference, but the dial does not seem to return to the middle of the good area since the filer was changed.  I have washed the unit numerous times, but it does not seem to make a difference.
The plastic housing for the replacement filter disintergrates when washed. When the filter dries, it becomes very hard. This is ineffective as the dial on the humidifier registers that this new replacement needs changing and this filter needs constant changing. The new extra replacement filters (2) that were purchased 6 weeks ago have almost doubled in price since that purchase. The humidifier should be sold with multiple filters and now becomes a bad investment. We do not recommend this purchase.
I have bought this filter before - this one seems cheaply made & is already deteriorating, after one round of use.
It is very low quality. It starts to degrade after a week using.Although it fits very well.Not recommended.
Ordered this because it said it would fit the model number of my humidifier, but it was too short and didn't fit.
If you read the fine print it says you may get a different filter other than this one. They are NOT the same. The other filter is a slight taller and depending on the humidifier you have the lid may not close properly. So watch out for that problem.
Well, I got the filters very soon after I placed the order.That's nice. I just opened the package a couple of days ago because I have been moving. I ordered 5 filters, but there are only 4 in the package :(I guess the seller didn't pay attetion when they put it in. Hope it won't happen again.
After two days of using this filter, the humidifier said it the filter was bad. Not too happy right now.
This wick/fan based humidifier is much noisier than my old ultrasonic mist based humidifier.  The noise level even on low is too loud.  Forget about sleeping in the same room with this thing if it's set to high.  The wick filter also gets dirty and smelly really fast if you don't clean it constantly.  On the plus side, the water tank is big (3 gallons) and there is an auto on/off based on ambient humidity.
I should have listened to other reviewers, this filter, at least mine, felt cheap, after only 2-3 weeks of use I tried to clean it gently and the whole filter fell apart under luke warm tap water. QC needs to be alerted to the horrible quality of these filters. I can't afford to be buying a new one every couple weeks. The original filter that came with my unit was much more durable.
I had bought this filter from Bed Bath and Beyond before and I don't remember it being so flimsy. Every time I  cleaned the humidifier, I found tiny pieces that broke from the black mesh on the outside. I have only used it for a month and the whole filter is on the verge of falling apart.
I have used these in humidifiers along with ones I buy from my local store. The ones from my store are Best Air Humidi-Wick filters. These ones with the black plastic outside are not good filters. The black outside quickly starts to weaken and makes the filter fall in on itself. They don't last a month and its almost impossible to rinse them off without it falling apart after a weeks worth of use. The ones from the store have a metal outside that does not weaken and keeps the filter standing up. These filters are the same price, so I would always try and find one with the metal outside so it will last.These filters are better than the cheaper knockoffs you can find at filter stores and ebay. The ones I have bought from ebay will start falling apart the second they touch water and don't even think about rinsing them out. This is a real Holmes filter. I don't think Holmes makes very good filters unless this is also a cheap look alike in a Holmes box.
IF you ever forget that thing in the humidifier, it will soon act an in-house allergen manufacture. It will basically do the reverse of what it was intended to help you with.
While the filter we received works with the Holmes humidifier it was a generic and not Holmes brand as title and description suggests. I just want to get what I paid for and expect.
While these fit older model humidifiers, they don't work nearly as well as the original filter--which are no longer made. I've used many varieties of filters that say they are the same as the originals. They're not. The originals were more like cloth and could be washed out a few times, then used again. They also didn't collect yucky stuff as quickly as the newer ones.  The newer ones don't last as long, are cheaply made, and are a lot more expensive.While this one works and meets needs, it's vastly inferior to the original product, and is pretty much a moneky sink, as it will need to be replaced monthly.
Of Course this is the only filter that will work in my humidifier I presume and it lasts only about 2-3 months.
For what boils down to a mini-fridge the kegerator is priced way too high. The one I received had a crooked door. All of the metal is rusted after two years, don't believe any stainless claims.
Pretty good - easy to use (included instructions are lacking, however) was working fine for a couple of months, but now it seems to run all of the time, and I am getting water all over the bottom of the inside. I checked for leaks but couldn't find any. The seals seem to be fine as well. It also seems to get very hot in the back. When I was checking that out I noticed some taped down styrofoam on the top inside - was this supposed to be removed? Nothing was mentioned in the instructions. Anyone else have this issue?
this is a cheap replacement filter for original. the picture looked like the original filter. the one i was sent can be purchesed much cheaper.
Nowhere does it clarify that you are only getting one filter (perhaps purposefully?). I guess I should have read the other reviews more carefully but who in their right mind would only want one filter when you obviously need 2? If my TV remote needed new batteries would I go out and buy just one batterey? So considering shipping is $5 you will save your money buying one of the other ones.
What I received did  not look like picture. The size was the same but that was it.The face was  black  not white
Probably an ok filter but deceptive!  This supplier's add selling one filter ,when two are required in almost Holmes applications.
I've noticed a bad smell when I use these filters after only a few days use.  The old ones without the blue air purifier didn't smell like this.  I will not use these again even if I have to buy a new humidifier when I can't find the old HAC-504 filters.
Although these knobs are designed to fit a wide variety of electric ranges, unfortunately they do not fit my range, which was made by Roper, a company that no longer exists.  My fumbling attempts to adapt the knobs have been unsuccessful.  I have no real complaints about these knobs, which no doubt will satisfy most customers, but my experience with them demonstrates that they are not &#34;universal.&#34;
I bought these for my ancient GE electric range.  Although one of the inserts was correct for the range post, it would not work due to interference with some screws underneath.
I will need to rig these in some way to use on my ~25yr old Jenn-Aire range. Don't buy these if your range is a push-to-turn type, they wont work without a bit of engineering.
Product description said it would fit LOTS of stoves. Mine is a regular Whirlpool stove and none of the dials fit.
Don't waste your money.  Bought these because one of my knobs broke.  These come with a sleeve to make them fit universally, but the sleeve kept sliding out of the knob.
didn't quite fit our oven.  I used a drill to widen the holes and now it works well.One size fits some --- not ALL.
Item appears to be good quality but the appearance is ruined by embossing the companies name from the bottom so that it shows from the top. Since it is a drip pan the surface should be smooth when you wipe it.
The construction quality of the drip pan was very good, however the design left a lot to be desired.  I bought them for protection for my stovetop but the center hole is so big it's pretty much useless.  Just makes another thing to clean.
For as cheap as this gadget sells for, it is made out of the cheapest elements you could imagine. It is low-tech and crapy. It would cost a third of the price if you decided to fabricate it yourself. The thermal aluminium tubbing is NOT long enough to come up to the top of the dryer. Hiding it somewhere is your only other choice. The plastic fasteners are below quality. If you have a dryer with a short outlet, you will not have fun trying to get the exhaust tubbing attached to it.ABOUT PERFORMANCE: In days of high humidity, it doesn't fare well. In general it does an average job. I wouldn't even recommend this gizmo to people I dislike.
