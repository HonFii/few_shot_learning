While I am sure this product , 15' Major Appliance Extension Cord by Coleman Cable,is fine, I specifically ordered it because the description stated "Made in USA".Whenever possible I will buy "made in USA" products. I was very disappointed to note on the package that the product was made in Indonesia. I could have bought the same item in any store for less than I paid for this one. Shame on Amazon.
As others have said here, this is plainly marked on the packaging as having been made in Indonesia, *NOT* the USA as stated in the description.  Where it's made wasn't what drove my purchase, but the seller should ensure that this clearly incorrect claim is corrected on the product description.
While it's 'stiffer' than it should be at room temperature, its passable.  It needs stretched out (weighted) straight, in the hot summer sun to get the kinks out. To bad it's winter.
does what we needed it to do - exact length and is more flat to the wall than a standard cord
Amazon description says made in USA, but the 6' cord I got was made in Indonesia. That's disappointing.  I spent extra for this cord over other ones Amazon sells on the basis that it was made in the U.S.
Many people have said it's from Indonesia, but I couldn't find any markings either way. Some people have mentioned fires; the female end was CRAZY HARD to insert, I wouldn't be suprised if the fires were from it not being plugged in all the way
Coleman Cable 3536 14/3 General-Use Appliance Extension Cord, 15-FootIt's not a  Coleman Cable 3536 14/3 But a CCI cable Major Appliance Cord. That's the only marking on the packaging. Yes it's 15 ft and is 3 prong. But that is it. Tan in color. A bit disappointed in what I received That is why I gave it the 3 stars. And I don't know if its indoor/outdoor???? On The package it says made in Indonesia. No place on the package does it say the gauge of the wire. I should be 14ga, But who knows what it is???? I can't recommend this Appliance Extension Cord since it is not labeled correctly! It's sure a disappointment! It's going back to Amazon in the AM. Another case of Amazon shipping cheep imported products and not labeling the products truthfully. I'd rather pay a bit more and get a good product in the first place. Than have to go threw the hassle of returning the item and then go shopping for a replacement item a second time! Amazon I hope you read this!
If you use the picture on the front, you're good.. but this really needs to be in writing on some kind of documentation with this cable. It's extremely dangerous to do this without it. It did work.
its nice we use it by the pool...but the humidity portion does not work. oh well
It's large enough to see from far away but it is very, very light. Everytime the wind kicks up, this thing sails away. It's hasn't broken or chipped yet, though!
UPDATE: Temperature reads OK, but in the real outdoor world of coastal south Florida, the humidity needle is subject to so many influences (breezes, sunlight,radiated wall heat)that I have come to consider it +/-15%. EOU// Both temperature and humidity are accurate to about +/- 2% maximum, checked against digital meters in a controlled environment.  The mounting will determine whether you get a true reading.  First, there must be adequate air circulation behind it, which requires more standoff than direct-to-wall as supplied (hence 4, not 5 stars); I made two 1" deep wood block spacers for the screws, and still see some variability.  Second, a wall that absorbs and holds heat, like concrete block, will radiate heat and may add a few degrees late in the day.  Similarly, a cold cement board, metal or vinyl wall may subtract a few degrees early in the day.  Third, hot air rises so if it is mounted near a ceiling, it may read a few degrees high and the humidity may be affected.  Mounted directly to a wall, readings may be wildly untrue.  The humidity bar reads from 40 to 90%; above or below that has little additional effect on wind chill or THI.  The color coded index rings are pretty much useless for a visual reading from a distance; there is simply not enough color differentiation, but the information is there in printed numbers.
This thermometer has a nice look to it.  It is very light weight.  It looks good on my open deck.  I do worry about rain getting on the back coils since the back is open.  I have not had it very long (month or so), so I cannot give it a really accurate rating yet,
I realize now that the size of the product is in the description, but I didn't pay attention to it. This is a really big thermostat, like the size of a wall clock. Way larger than I expected. Thought I'd warn others not paying attention like me!
I mounted this on the wall of my shed under my RV port.  Its in the shade and protected from the weather.  The large display can read it clearly from the house. I was a bit disappointed that the temperature reads about 5 degrees higher than it actually is.  It appears to be consistant however, its a shame there is no way to calibrate it.  The humidity seems to be accurate.  I would like to comment on the pervious review regarding the humidity - The humidity display starts at 40%, so it will look like it reading zero for anything humidity less than that.
It was cheap... it looks it, and feels it, but it seems pretty accurate.  13.25 inches is pretty big but it is super lightweight and has only a way to hang it.  I am sure the first good wind and one of my neighbors will own it. The place I want to put it gets direct sun the last hour or so during summer... it says not to put it in direct sun,,, I don't know if that is because it will give an inaccurate reading or if the thing will fade out to nothingness.  I'm still looking for a nice patio thermometer that can be read from a distance.
The plastic on it feels chinszy.. It looks great on my fence. I am hopeful it will hold up for Chicago weather? We shall see?
Nice, but the humidity gauge seems kind of off
...but it's better and more attractive than the old one we had.  It's a lot cheaper than the $50 similar piece of crap they were selling at the pool supply place.
Seems a Little off!
The temperature readings are 4 degrees off. The humidity readings are relative humidity and not real accurate either.Don't waste you're money, buy a more expensive unit that is made of metal and glass not plastic and paper.
If you are buying this solely for the purpose of measuring humidity levels, be aware that the humidity portion does not respond to environmental changes quickly.I have run this side by side to a Sper-Scientific Environmental Meter with a humidity probe attached. While the Springfield is reading about 40% R.H, I get a much more accurate reading of 24% from the other meter. While the other setup is $200+, do not expect an accurate reading from the Springfield. Only use it to determine if R.H is rising or falling.
good
It seems to be spot on with temperature, but after it rains, the plastic cover gets condensation in it and it overreports humidity by 10-20 percentage points.
I keep looking for a nice looking thermometer to put in my tiny apartment.  This one was about the size I needed, and I was pretty sure it would work.  It would have too, but I wanted one that did not have a plastic front, was of a better quality, and was easier to read.  It is small and cute any may just be perfect for someone else.
It's Ok - shows temp and humidity in my office cubicle.
The item shown is woodtone.The item I received is all white.Not what I expected.
Works as expected.
This garbage disposal unit works good enough. I've had mine now for many years. The only flaw I can find is that it cannot handle potato peels. It seems to pass them through okay, but it does not grind them up fine enough, and they always clog the drain. Keep a plunger handy if you insist on sending potato peels down there.
When we moved into our new house the food waste disposer was dead, so I had to purchase a new one. I can't even recall why I chose this one, but I did. This was, I think, in 2002.I have never done any plumbing work in my life and I am not particularly good at home repairs/maintenance, but I could install this unit without too much trouble, although it probably took me at least one hour. But believe me, if I can do it, it cannot be that hard.PROS:- The unit still works after about 8 years, so it can't be too bad!- It jammed for the first time a few days ago, and at first I thought I had to buy a new unit (which is why I started looking for reviews of comparable products on Amazon and why I am writing this review myself only now). Then I found out that the unit comes with a wrench which can be used to rotate the motor to unjam it. It took me about 5 seconds and now it's working like before.- We did not have any leaks so far.CONS:- Noisy. We do not use it too much, so we do not care too much, but it certainly is loud.- Not that powerful. We have to be very careful with what we put in, especially now after several years. We have trouble if stuff like tomato skins, shrimp or egg shells end up inside. Really we are reaching the point when we can only use it for... soupy stuff.- Given that a lot of stuff is not properly shredded, sometimes there is bad smell coming from the unit and I finding myself more and more often fishing for residues inside, which is a bit gross.Overall, I can't say that I have been too happy with this unit, but I also can't agree with reviewers that are finding this a piece of junk. I am sure it's not the best you can buy out there, but it's also not so expensive and surely you could do worse. But if I had to purchase a new one today (and maybe I will) I would certainly choose something different. Most probably a Waste King L-8000 which appears to be highly recommended by a lot of people and consumer reports.
2nd 1. 1st died right after warranty. You get what you paid for.  Pretty easy to install. Remember that it doesn't come with a cord.
I bought this food waste disposer to replace an identical one because I knew it would fit my plumbing.  I wanted to avoid the hastle of altering the plumbing to fit another brand.  The Badger I replaced threw a cutter (it came out of the opening while the disposer was running) and also rotted out on the side at the top half.  I'm hoping this one does better.  The material at the top does not appear to be metal like the first one.
Bought this unit new from Lowes and installed it myself.  The install was easy but after 7 years of use I now have to uninstall the unit.  I noticed a water leak under my sink and traced it back to the garbage disposal.It was leaking out the bottom through the electrical area.  The disposal is loud and has clogged up only a couple of times.  Overall maybe a good unit or maybe I just got lucky based on all of the other reviews, but I am going to replace it with a Kenmore unit.  For the price I paid I'll give it 3 stars.
This was to replace an identical (on the box) one that I installed six years ago, and which had sprung a leak somewhere inside.The new unit looked and connected exactly like the old one, except that the old one had a pre-installed cord and plug, and this one didn't, which changed a twenty minute job into an hour.  It remains to be seen how long this one lasts...
Installation would have been much faster if it came with the power cord, had to use the old one.  So far no problems.
This was the second garbage disposal I purchased to replace the original insinkerator that I had for over ten years.  I returned a waste king garbage diposal and I am happy that I decided to go purchase an insinkerator instead.  It was fairly easy to follow the instructions and install.  I put the badger together by myself and this was only my second time installing a garbade disposal.
My first disposer was a GE and lasted for 30 years.  I replaced it with my first Badger 5 1/2 hp, which worked great for 9 years.  It started leaking through the bottom and tripping the breaker.  My new Badger 5 I installed an 12-26-10.  So far so good.  I'm hoping get more that 15 years from it since I don't use it that often and my first one lasted 30 years.  Am I asking too much?
Today, Saturday, September 14, 2013 the plumber finally came over to replace my old waste disposer with this new one I bought. Well he immediately showed me the dent that was at the bottom of the disposer. Well I wasn't going to go another day without using my sink, so he said it may work and it did. Will do a packaging review.
Like others here, my disposal developed a small crack in the housing after a few years.  Water would not leak out when the sink was running and disposal off, but when the disposal was turned on water blasted out in a high pressure stream.  Rather than replace it, I waited until evening (done with kitchen sink for the day) cleaned the housing near the crack, lightly sanded it, and patched it with JB Weld.  The sink was used the following day but the disposal was not run until the repair had about 24 hours to cure, and all was well.  A few years later the housing cracked again, in a different place.  I patched it as I did before and the disposal lives on.This is a good disposal for the price, but the housing is obviously a weak link.  Where it seems to crack is at the fine vertical lines where I assume the mold is parted.  If yours cracks I suggest you make the easy repair as I did.  Another thing to consider is that if your Badger 5 has died completely, the latch/connection to the drain fitting does not seem to have changed over the years, and neither has the height of the discharge.  That makes replacing it with another Badger 5 relatively quick and easy.
Our lightly used Badger 5 began leaking from a crack in the plastic housing. I like to buy American, but this appears to be a well documented issue with these units. ISE needs to address its quality issue for me to go back to their products. I ended up purchasing a 3 bolt Waste King Legend Series 9930 as a replacement from Amazon. The Waste King is made in China, but rated very highly, stainless steel rather than galvanized in the Badger 5 and a lot better (longer) in-home warranty. Very disappointed in my ISE Badger 5. We will see how the Waste King does, figure it can't be worse than this disposer.
The disposer was easy to install and worked well for approximately 4 years.  However, it started to leak and we noticed a crack in the plastic housing.It appears that the cracked housing is a common problem for this inexpensive product.  It is one thing to have a unit fail but it is something else to have a failure that causes water damage.
InSinkErator arrived with broken output L-pipe. I was replaceing an existing unit so I used the old one. Unit is working well.
Stopped working,  would only hum, but was not jammed, and reset button did nothing.  But one 5 minute call to the maker and a new one was sent without fuss and works fine. I have used these models for many years and this was the first with this problem.  Since they did not want it returned, my son kept it to take apart, try to fix and used as a chum grinder.  I have not heard how that worked out yet.
Worked very well for five years and then started to get frozen.  The motor is fine, but the grinding blades get stuck and need help to get started again.
Considering that theInSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposercan be installed in less than 20 minutes you have to be a complete idiot to need to call the plumber to install this thing.  Baby - Bag your boyfriend if he can't install this. Chances are he's incompetent. Get a new boyfriend with hair on his arms OR you do it! An honest 1/2 hour, minimal tools and it's a done deed. Ease of installation and price are the reasons to buy this Badger 5.Warning - This disposer does not include the power cord. Those of us with an outlet inside of the sink cabinet can either reuse the cord from the unit you're replacing or cut the end off a cheap #14 or heavier, 3 prong extension cord and wire that in.No doubt about it, after reading previous reviews you should consider spending just a little extra dough and go for another brand. That being said, the Amazon price can't be matched at any home improvement store. Buy this disposer here and now and don't waste your time chasing around in your car trying to find the better deal.I went to that store that rhymes with Blows and layed out wayyyy too much dough. I was in a rush to get 'er done. The up-graded brands there were ridiculously expensive. I don't give a rats pitooty how quiet they are. If you're sticking it under a sink, in a place where the sun don't shine, why on earth would you spend over $100 - $125 on a waste disposer? Maybe if you live in a place like Aspen, then you NEED to spend that money.Longevity. Don't bank on it lasting until you're grey and long in the tooth. (No offense intended to those who are already grey and long in the tooth.) My previous Badger hung in there for 7 or 8 years. Do you really think it'll last for forever? I bet you've replaced the transmission in that 2 year old Chrysler Minivan already, didn't you? If you're building a spec home, this one is for you. If you're a sc#mlord and need a replacement for a rental, this one is for you. If your house is in danger of being foreclosed upon, this one is for you. If you need to replace that ailing disposer that's making horrible, loud grinding noises and vibrates the whole counter top when it runs, this one is for you.Noise? At this price what do you really care about noise? Turn up the kitchen radio.
Very pleased with product.  I replace an old, worn out unit with this new unit of the same model number.  It went back in with no problums nor plumbing changes required and works as it should. Maybe not the strongest unit available but suitable for our needs and the price was right.
I'm not crazy about these garbage disposals, but the one in there was one of these so I didn't need to replumb the under sink. From past experience these are not that reliable. You can do better but at about double the cost.
I chose this model to replace my old Badger 5  but the fittings were slightly off.  I ended up using the fittings off the old unit which included the old drain shield.
Easy to install,especially as a replacement and works fine. The only beef I have is they don't give you wire nuts so you have to re-use your old ones or go running out to buy a new pair. I think that's a little petty. And if I were performing a new installation it would have made me really angry.
3rd Badger 5 in 12 years but since I am not handy, in order to change I would have to hire a plumber @ $85/ hour. Cheaper to easily install the same item than pay for another that may fail too. The units start leaking with no motor failure.so a pan keeps me in business till a new one comes in.A compromise for me, maybe this one will last longer.
Be aware that the unit does NOT come with the power cord.The broken one in my sink was the same one as I bought - InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer.  But I could not remove it without a manual at first.  The retainer ring was kind of tricky and the screws were very tight.  At first, I did buy another brand name that seemed to be a better deal.  But I had to return it because I simply could not remove the broken one from my sink.After 10 days, I received this one. I was able to remove the broken one with user's manual. Then it turned out that the unit did not come with the power cord.  So I had to cut the power cord from the broken unit, strip and hooked up all 3 leads by myself.  And then I had to test if all wires were connected correctly and make sure the unit works fine.After another 2 hours, I finally were able to call for a day.  Everything was fine except I forgot to place the power cord thru the hole from the bottom of the unit.  I decided to live with that.
The reason for my purchase was to replace my old badger which had cracked. The plastic housing cracked and leaked water. Problably from a piece of metal that accidently got into the disposer. I feel like if the housing were made of steel, it would not have cracked.
We had to go buy a different pipe, but the disposer it fine. I just assumed everything that came in the box would go right in and everything would fit.
bought to replace exactly the same unit, as it did so it hooked right up as everything was exactly the same.But this unit seems alot noisier than the old one.how long it will last who knows got about 7 years out of the last one but have fingers crossed on this one as it doesn't seem to be as well made
Just a friendly warning -- unlike the identical model number with this replaced, the outer case, top and bottom is now made entirely of plastic.  The previous version had been entirely metal.  I doubt that this will hold up as well over time -- lots of other reviewers have reported plastic cracks or leaks that develop relatively quickly.
Not as powerful as I expected. I had a 3/4 HP unit before and it was too powerful and noisy. This one is Quieter but not NEAR as powerful. I feel tha I don't even have a 1/3 HP unit. Won't even grind up chicken bones.
I replaced the exact same unit that came with the house. I got 5 years out of that one. It's a bit noisy and it vibrates a lot with larger volume items. On the up side it didn't clog when I'd stuff it full of potato peels.
Not that hard to change out but not the same as my 10  year old one that I was replacing. Just keep that in mind you will have to replumb.
Product did not come with a power cord... so must have electrician wire one... not good...same product at H/Depot has cord ... so cost will turn out more expensive.
I installed my Badger 5 two years ago.  I'm a single homeowner so it was used lightly.  After grinding some onion scraps I noticed a leak under the sink.  After careful inspection I noticed the disposal developed a crack in the housing unit.  A quick call to InSinkErator revealed the unit was still under warrantee.  I had a repair person out the following day who replaced the entire disposal with a Badger 5XP (he said they've stopped making the Badger 5).  The problem was resolved quickly and to my satisfaction.  My only concern with this unit is how or why it developed the crack with such light usage.
I had an issue exactly as described by many others, I called them and provided the serial number and turns out the unit was manufactured about 5 years ago. She told me that warranty expires 2 years after the date of purchased, I informed her that I can't find the receipt and don't recall when exactly I bought it; but most than likely warranty expired. I then asked her if she knows of a recall about this failure mode, the cracked upper housing, as I have read a lot about this defect on line. She kindly offered to send me a new unit right away, postage included. I never got mad or anything, she just offered that option.I'm grateful to this company for not being too stingy especially if they know of a systemic defect. I was going to get a new one from a different brand with a metal housing or a beefier housing,  I guess I'll just be replacing this new unit in about 4 years. Not the most reliable model but the customer service was better than expected.
Bought this unit(InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP Food Waste Disposer) in 2005 and has started to leak at the bottom of the housing unit. The motor is still running but basically, the cabinet under the sink got soaking wet!The unit had only a 2-year warranty. Its just not worth it to hire a plumber and have this unit opened, re-sealed etc unless you are handy. Much cheaper to buy another unit.I give it 3 stars since it did last for 6yrs but seriously, given the low usage(once every other week for less than a minute), I would have expected this to last longer for 10 to 20 years.Will be considering another brand to replace the InSinkErator, one that has a longer warranty.
I replaced my neighbors Badger 5--7 years of very limited service--when it began to leak from the bottom.With that, my rating reflects the the product itself.  I have the same unit and anticipate it going bad soon.I would think that a garbage disposal would last longer.I have to rate Amazon pricing and delivery excellent---5 stars---got the unit for $30 less than Home Depotand it delivered in about 4 days.
I cannot say whether the  unti works well, or how durable it will be.  I can only say that somehow I missed that this particular unit does not come with an electrical cord.  Since I was replacing an existing model, it was not a problem to switch out the old cord, but I think there should be big bold letters somewhere explaining that it does not come with its own electrical cord.  Had I bought it at a big box store, I would have seen a big sticker on the box, but cannot do that with Amazon.  So far, my only complaint.
I was very happy thinking I would replace my current disposal with one that appeared to be the same model and design.  The model was correct and most everything was interchangeable except for the output tubing.  The included l-shaped drainage tube was different from the older model and, therefore, did not interchange correctly.  I had to take a trip to Home Depot to purchase a different connector tube and fittings.  My only wish is that if the company changes the design, the included adapter reproduce the original size, length and angle fittings.  It is in and working fine except that I spent a little more that I thought would be necessary.  Retirement is not always what its cracked up to be when it comes to money.
It's cheaper than the other brand that Home Depot also sells for $200+, but this one will start to leak on you after a few years.  I didn't notice mine was leaking until I smelled a stench coming from under the sink.  These have a defect and leak from the top housing unit - it happens to most units.  I would recommend paying an extra $20 and you can find a better brand on amazon.So yes, these work, but they will eventually leak on you and then you'll know it's time to replace.
This is a solid performing disposer. I replaced the exact model that had over eleven years on it. That one had actually rusted through, but still ran strong. The implication on the packaging is this thing practically installs itself in a few minutes. Be prepared for a struggle, as the twisting, upward motion to attach it to the upper receiver (on the sink) requires you to hold the somewhat heavy disposer under the sink while pushing against an unrestrained upper receiver and twisting to lock it in place. I live alone so a 14 pound counter weight resting from above was required (a ten pound weight was insufficient). Find a friend to hold it if you can.This disposer is damn noisy; much more than the previous exact model I had before. In fairness that one had the swinging internal blades corroded and may of been less free to bang against the housing.It does quick work of the common types of kitchen waste I deal with and I cook a wide range of foods. Since it grinds so quickly the noise is not much a bother. Significant amounts of rinse water also minimizes the racket.
Installed disposer on 2/2012 for my kitchen remodel.  Easy to install.  Fairly quiet to operate.  Since I do not use disposer often due to my drainage salutation, purchase of this disposer meets the $$ requirement.  My previous experience with Badger disposers have shown Badger makes long lasting disposers.
We replaced our disposal (InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP) with this same disposal.Just because we knew how it worked and didnt know anything else...(I know stupid reason, but it is what it is).The only problem I see with this unit is that the housing is all plastic...I have no idea why but it is...That is the part that cracked... about 2 years in to its use...We dont grind up bones and hard items like that...some times carrots and the like but no hard brittle items.Have no idea how it cracked but it did and leaked all over.The new one seems to be working as expected...If it cracks again.... I will never by a plastic disposal again...come on luck... hope it survives the life of the sink. :)
It rusted already for just a couple months of use, but this is the cheapest I could get. I don't turn it on very often though.
Standard builder grade unit. Works well. If you use unit a lot then would upgrade to the Model 5X (3/4 HP)
Hey, I am reviewer 75, so I am sure some other people will say the same thing. We put in a new one about every four years. These don't last. Sure the motor holds up, and sure, it gets noisier with age, but the guts rust out and the seal goes out first. I love water leaks near electricity, but maybe it's just me... . Be sure to read the instructions at least a little.Any other brand to buy? This is made by Emerson, who makes most of them out there. Good luck finding a good one.
This disposer was original in my house when it was built in 2004. It cracked the same way as the others have mentioned. Lasted 8 years.
I purchased this waste disposal unit because I had this already installed in our house when the house was bought. It was the exact brand and model. My first one had a couple of small cracks in the metal housing on the outside. I noticed that it would leak water from these cracks especially during dishwasher use. You can actually see steam from the hot water of the dishwasher escaping from the cracks. I looked through other reviews, and noted that other people had the same exact problem with cracks with almost the same sites. Removing the old disposal and installing the new one is rather easy if you have the right tools and about an hour to actually do the work (i'm not a plumber by the way and have never replaced a unit before). Unfortunately, other reviews that I have seen was that this type of unit lasts only 3-4 years even with minimal proper use. So eventually you're gonna have to change it again. I would recommend getting a unit with a stainless steel housing even though a bit more expensive. It might last longer.
We put one of these in and it worked great for a couple of years. Then we started noticing water under the sink and discovered it was coming from the Badger 5. Kinda scary since the water had to travel THROUGH the motor and to the breaker switch before dripping to the bottom. Surprisingly it did not short out the unit, but it did create a mess.I don't think the internals of this disposer are made of stainless steel either, it definitely rusted over time.
It works and was installed by a plumber who know what he was doing otherwise it would take me a couple of hours and screw it up.
My first InSinkErator Badger 1, 1/3 HP lasted 13yrs and I only replaced it because I replaced the sink. The old one was all cast metal and badly corroded on the inside.I installed my new one in August 2010. Just 7 months later it is completely rusted inside. The blades may be stainless steel but the grinding plate is simply bare metal. It works fine, but I don't expect it to last. This new one has an all plastic composite body, It might last longer than the metal body, we'll see.  For the price, I guess you can buy a new one every 5-10yrs.This model does not include a power cord, so you will need to reuse the old one or purchase a new one.InSinkErator CRD-00 Power Cord KitThe sink collar/flange that comes with it is dull steel, so I had to purchase an extra brushed stainless steel flange, so that my new sink still looked good.InSinkErator FLG-SSB Sink Flange, Brushed Stainless Steel
This disposer was installed by my builder about ten years ago.  it had light to moderate use (vacation home).  It finally kicked the bucket just in time for Christmas.  I did all the troubleshooting steps just to find out that the inner parts had rusted into dust and that was why the machine no longer worked. I had never heard of such a thing, and when I contacted the company, found out there was only a one year warranty and somehow I was ahead of the game.  The company handled it well, they were professional and prompt. I did make sure that the next disposer I bought had a longer warranty and more horsepower.
Personally used this for about 3 1/2 years in my condo that was built in late '06 (install date), rusted through the bottom casing last night with two holes about the diameter of pencil lead and two more very soon to come. Disposal was always noisy but seemed to have enough power for the basic tasks I would need it for. I was satisfied w/ the disposal but I would not buy again.
Our builder-installed InSinkErator died after four years of use, and we replaced it with this model, a slightly newer but similar model of the same brand.  We chose this one because of the price and because we knew we could install it using the same fitting/space as the old one.This Badger is not as noisy as some, but it's not nearly as quiet as some of the upper end models.  (We installed an upper end model in my parents' home a couple of months after we bought this one, and my parents' is *much* quieter.)  Still, it is quieter than the original.  I would rate it a "moderate" for noise.The disposer grinds food without problem, just as it should.  If you have a large family and use a disposer heavily, I highly recommend going up to a 1/2 HP model.  For moderate to light use, this model should be fine, although don't expect it to last more than five years or so.
Noisier than I would have expected.  How hard is it to make these things quiet?  Apparently quite a bit x
After buying 3 of these in 15 years, I've started to see a pattern (!).  My latest Badger 1 started leaking through the various screw/circuit breaker holes in the bottom.  On the previous ones owned, I had a permanent leak on one and an unclearable-jam on the other.  All of these "cheaper" Badger Insinkerators have galvanized steel rotators and stainless blades...what that means is, in about a month or two, when you look into the unit it will seem horribly rusted because the galvanized steel will still rust.  That's just par for the course for these models.  (Actually, I think theInSinkErator Badger 5XP 3/4 HP Household Food Waste Disposerwhich is similar to the Badger 9 at the big-box home stores, might be all stainless).  You get a 1 year warranty with the Badger 1, it's 1/3 HP, but it has no sound insulation.  In truth, none of this had ever really bothered me except for perhaps the lack of all-stainless steel components.  I live in Phoenix where the water is very hard, although I do have a water softener (salt-based), yet I'm a still a little disappointed with the 5 year life span I'm getting.  I do not use disposals much, but I pretty much want to have one installed for those occasional times or when guests arrive, who would usually expect one.This time, I think I'm going to try theInSinkErator Evolution Compact 3/4 HP Household Food Waste Disposer.  It's $169 on Amazon (same at brick and mortar stores), but it's a step up in most ways...all stainless steel internal components, sound insulation, a larger grind chamber (34.6 oz compared to 26 oz for the Badger 1), more HP, and a 4 year warranty.  If I get 10 years out of this one, it would be the same cost as two Badger 1's lasting 5 years each.So you can decide for yourself.  If you live in a softer-water area, or don't demand much from your disposal, or are a landlord, this one may be for you.  But based on my experience (and apparently, that of several other people in the reviews here), you do seem to be giving up some longer-term reliability with the less-expensive models.
Replaced the leaking one in my house and was a direct fit.  It's no less noisy nor does it work any better than the old one.
Mine leaks too. Right thru the plastic case. It still works but we have a bucket underneath to catch the water. I'll never buy another plastic garbage disposal unit.
This model disposal was in my home when we first moved in and lasted us 9 years before it went on the blink and started to leak from the bottom. Worked very well but a little noisy. Replaced it with InSinkErator Badger 5 1/2 HP That has more power and is quieter, Hope its as reliable.
I've had a Badger 1/3 hp in my home for 12 years. It's loud and noisey, but held up. Finally developed a leak and went to replace it. Ended up getting a 1/2 hp Badger 500. Not because of the quality of the product. None of the local stores carried anything but the lower and high end models in stock! And as I said. it was leaking so I had already removed it.
The title on Amazon for this product shows 1 1/3 HP. It was only after I ordered and recieved the product that I found out they have cleverly titled it the InSinkErator Badger 1....and that's only 1/3 HP. It's both false advertising on the manufacturer's part and ignorance on Amazon's part that they've listed it so poorly. It may be a fine product, but we never even opened the box. Once we realized it was only 1/3 HP, we immediately returned it for a full refund.
InSinkErator offered better service and support after the sale than most other companies, and assisted me in replacing a faulty part.
This is my 3rd one in 6 yrs. Works great until it fails. Easy install. Probably should buy a 1/2 HP motor but then I'd have to install the whole new setup instead of just sliding the same model on the existing fitting.
To be fair, I do not have a lot of experience with garbage disposals. This one came with out home, and we used it for 6 years. I guess the solenoid went out because it began to operate intermittently, ad then finally crapped out. For $75 bucks, I guess 6 years is not bad. It is what it is.
We were just trying to replace our existing disposer with the exact model, so we went with this one.  Had I realized that I was going to be redoing more of my sink pipe assembly, I would have gone with one that has a little more horsepower.  That said, this model works fine and does the job we need it to do.  But I'd go with a 1/2 horse power model at a minimum if you have the option.
This is the second can crusher I have bought this year and like the first one it will do what it is supposed to do by crushing cans.  The disappointing thing about this can crusher is that it does not crush the can completely flat and produces some sharp corners by not crushing it completely flat.  I also believe it will eventually fail because the sides of the handle seem to be weak and flex.  This is where the first can crusher failed.  One good point about this crusher is it will crush large cans like Red Bull or other energy drinks.
The product its self is good but the screws that came with it were horribleIf you drink things in cans its for you
it helps me at home with can clutter and for recycling saves storage space tooi see more room now
Like other have said the top coating began chipping away immediately.  Also on first use it did smell &#34;off&#34;.  However it keeps working and doing its job.
Do not purchase if you have a glass cooktop. These are raised for coil burners. Not a bad product, but for coil only.
I had hoped this would be thicker than it is, but it has helped reduceneed for higher heat on my electric stove and scorching of homemade soups.
Have a propane stove with a couple of high-power burners and even at their lowest setting, this burner plate does not produce a steady, low simmer - simply not thick enough.  Probably would work well with electric stove or try the Fox Run Heat Diffuser - available at Amazon.  It seems to produce a good simmer on our propane gas stove.
But, maybe because the lowest setting on the stove is still pretty high.  Probably need a thicker one or maybe double it up.
Bought the 6" and the 8" diffuser.  They both smelled of burnt paint for weeks before they seasoned. The 6" works ad advertised but the 8" developed a rise in the middle that makes the pans wobble.
I purchased this plate to use on my electric stove in conjunction with a Tagine (Moroccan clay cooking pot). I used it once with the Tagine and it worked fine as far as diffusing the heat so that my pot heated evenly. However, I noticed after the first use that the black coating started flaking immediately. I'm not sure if this is supposed to do this or not but it doesn't seem like it should be doing this first time out.I've used it once since then and it still seems to be working. It's pretty ugly now though so I put it in the cabinet instead of leaving it on the stove. I've purchased other Nordic Ware made items and never had this problem.
I love Nordic Ware.  I live in Minneapolis, which is the home of Nordic Ware (OK, technically Nordic Ware is in St. Louis Park, a first-tier suburb, but it's effectively Minneapolis).  This device is good quality and reasonably priced, and if you buy it for the right reason, it works fine.  It's very good at getting rid of hot spots and spreading heat evenly across the bottom of your pan.  I haven't used it with terracotta cookware (such as a tagine) but I believe it would be very good at preventing uneven heating and would thus help prevent cracking.  But as a heat reducer, so that you get a decent simmer on a gas stove, it's ineffective.  It slows things up at the beginning and continues to release heat after the flame is turned off, but in between there's no noticeable difference.  I finally broke down and bought an Ilsa.  It's shamefully expensive but it works.  So I'm going to continue to use my beloved Nordic Ware pots and pans, but the Heat Tamer is going to Goodwill.
The word &#34;dirty&#34; and the white section shown behind the word &#34;clean&#34; are actually clear. It was impossible to read on my black dishwasher. I had to cut a white circle to stick behind it so we could read the lettering.
My only complaint about this is I wish it was a little tighter when you change the dial.  Tends to slip a bit.
This product looks like it might be great and probably is on the right dishwasher.  However, mine is black and the letters don't show up well.  I tried to spray paint the back white but the paint smeared the letters.  So if you have a black dishwasher this won't work.
The product photo looks like a black and white disk.  It is clear and black and does not show up on a black dishwasher.  The disk is a bit loose, so is wobbly and does not seem to stay on the proper side of Clean or Dirty.A
It spins a little too easily and so it sometimes moves to a half/half position.I also have a black dishwasher and it's very hard to read.I bought it because the dishwasher is plastic and it was the only suction cup one I could find.
Maybe I have a crappy one, but it won't stay put on my dishwasher.  Other than the weak suction, I like it.  It looks nice.
The indicator suction cup is holding strong.  The indicator wheel is a little loose and sometimes turns a bit when you don't want it too.  Over all, it's serving it's purpose.
Perfect for the person who can't be bothered to open the dishwasher and look at what's in there to gauge if it's dirty or clean, especially in households with more than one occupant. The only downside is that it didn't stick to my dishwasher well, so I had to affix it with some duct tape. Maybe it's just a ploy by the duct tape folks to sell more of that?
This works ok but it's actually quite large and there is no way to &#34;lock&#34; it into the dirty or clean positions and there is enough play in the dial that it easily rotates out of the desired position. I ended up sticking this on our freezer for that reason so it doesn't jiggle out of position as easily but now people have to look behind them to see the status of the dishes. Thought about sticking it on the counter just above the washer, but it's so large that it ends up being an eyesore there.
I bought this product because we have a stainless steel dishwasher, so a magnet would not work. Actually, the suction cup didn't work either. It fell off within 20-30 mins of sticking it on (and this happened a few times). So, we have it suctioned to the counter top above the dishwasher. Unfortunately, I could put anything on the counter top - even without a suction cup.Also, I agree with other reviewers that the clear half (not white) of the product is a poor design. It's very difficult to read or see - this half blends in with our granite countertops, and it would blend in with any silver or darker dishwasher too.Despite these flaws, I still give the product 3 stars because it does its job in reminding us all whether the dishes are clean or dirty. Now, if only one of our roommates would pay attention to it...
Just think about the color of your dishwasher, mine is black and well you get the idea.Should have put more thought into it.
I like this product, but I just bought it at Fred Meyer for 1.99!!  No shipping either!  I cannot believe I was going to pat $5 for it.  But the item itself is nice for what it is so I did not want to give it less stars!
Pros1. Easy to read and understand.2. Suction works great on the non-metal surface of my dishwasher.3. Appears to be fairly durable.Cons1. Does not have a latching mechanism to hold the Clean/Dirty wheel in place. You just have to hope no one bumps into it. Fortunately the plastic on plastic of the wheel and axle have a decent amount of friction preventing it from spinning too much. Could be remedied perhaps with stick on Velcro attached to the base and back of wheel (haven't tried this yet though).
Received product today and didn't realize it was clear and black, but the picture looks like it is black and white.  Very hard to read on black appliances.  Not a big deal, I should have read the specs closer; my bad.  To remedy the viewing to make it easier, I traced around the suction cup on a piece of computer printer paper and attached it to the back side.  Now I can read it perfectly fine, so I am happy with it.  What do you expect for a few bucks. It works fine enough for me.
I bought this for our family so I would know when dishes are clean or dirty.Pros:This spinner has a great suction on it.The design is also niceConcept of just rotating is a great ideaCons:The spinner spins too muchIf you have small kids, they can spin it very easily.The spinner doesn't stay in one spot unless you absolutely don't touch the spinner.overall the concept is good, but I would recommend a magnetic indicator or one that doesn't spin so freely. Half the time the spinner gets touched by a child or just from opening or closing the dishwasher door and the thing spins. Wish the spinner rotated less freely. Would not buy this product.
The dial is too loose and turns if bumped. It also doesn't work for me because I have a child that can easily reach and spin it making it useless for us.
Okay, I know you should read the product specs closely, but I put in "Magnet" for the search and naturally assumed that that's what I was getting....  It's not a magnet AND more importantly, the parts that appear to be white in the photo are actually CLEAR.  So, if you happen to have a black dishwasher like I do, or even a stainless one, you can barely see the indicator, let alone read it.  Just some thoughts to keep in mind.
It took many tries (couple weeks of tries) before I could get the suction cup to adhere to my stainless steel dishwasher.  No complaints once I got it to stick.
First thought it was a magnet and then it came in the mail and its a sucion cup. it was dirty with finger prints and some what scrathed. looked used.
This is a decent product, but it only stays stuck to my dishwasher for a few days without falling off.
not good quality. not worth what I payed. it doesn't stay put (suction doesn't work).AND the "dial" won't stay on the word desired to indicate clean or dirty.
This is ok! It would be better if it came in different colors instead of only black and white. More colors would be great!
The suction cup part works fine, and it hasn't come off of my dishwasher once.  However, spinning it from clean to dirty is WAY too easy.  It spins its self sometimes, when you open or close the dishwasher, so you have to check it before you walk away, which kind of defeats the purpose...
Good but does fall off too often.
Sticks straight to the dishwasher. Nothing fancy, nothing special, but it does the job. Now hubby and I don't have to guess if the dishes are clean or not.
this is a good indicator however i had to put a paper backing on it so that i could tell what the lettering said since the plastic is transparent and black and not white and black... this is a bad design flaw, also it spins freely and easily when you don't want it to
I like the looks of it, but it does not suction very well to my dishwasher.  It will do. It's better than a piece of paper labeled clean on one side and dirty on the other with a magnet holding it up I guess! :)
Its such a shame because I love the design and the way the stainless steel shows through the clear parts.  However, it would stay on for awhile and then drop off when nobody was even near it.  I kept putting it back on until it cracked.
All in all, I was pleased with this purchase, especially the price. However, several of the Clean/Dirty dishwasher indicators I bought were chipped and they were supposed to be new. Wasn't too bad, though.
It kept falling off, the suction cup doesn't work very well. I super glued a small magnet to the back of it and I'm all set. Works great.
The common wire screw was VERY hard to screw down , not sure if it really is tight on the wire.  Still, it's working.
I really like the humidifier but these filters are soooooooo expensive.  I change ours every other month sometimes every month and they cost $15 a piece.  WAY overpriced.
It keeps the air *kinda* moist, but it never reaches the desired humidity level (I ask for 50%); even on the highest setting, I can only reach approx. 25-30%.  My old apt. has a "forced hot air" heating system, so some humidity is crucial.  I use the thing about 20 hours everyday.  After 3 weeks of by-the-book care, the original filter just stopped absorbing water & became hard & crusty.  Replacement filters can be a bit pricey, so I bought a 4-pack elsewhere.
filters - basic and okay.  I need more words which is incredibly stupid but here they are.  These work and are basic.
First - the reviewers that recount experiences of bad smells from their filters need to undrstand that wick humidifiers, like the HB 05920 and 05921, require that an anti-bacterial solution be added to the water tank when filling.  This solution, I use "Golden Solution" (try Google), prevents mold and algae from forming on the filter and in the tank.  This prevents the odors and gets you a couple months out of your filter if you run your unit 24/7 like me.Second - there are other replacement filters on the market that are the same size as the HB True Air replacement filter and cost half as much.I use two HB True Air humidifiers and usually stock up on 4 filters each for the 6 months they run continously in my loft.  I have a couple True Air filters and a couple Best Air filters  right now and cannot tell the difference between them when it comes to performance.  The name brand True Air's keep their shape better, but for nine bucks, I'm not worried about the asthetics of the inside of my humidifier.Hope this helps those who use these filters.
In my experience, the blue filters do not last or wick effectively. I cannot get the humidity above 30%, and I think that is because this particular brand of filter dries out faster than it should. I empty and refill the tank daily and flip the filter. The filter does not last the day without drying out. Current filter has been in use for less than a week.I found the old style (not blue but white) filters from another vendor and hope that they will wick better and get the humidity up. Otherwise, this humidifier will go onto the curb and I'll get a different brand.
I cant say if it is the actual filter or the humidifier itself but it seems like this filter builds up a lot of mold quickly.  I have purchased 3 so that I can rotate them.  Hopefully this will give the filter time to dry out before i put it back in.  However, just a word to the wise... If you have to leave for over a week, make sure that you remove all parts that get wet otherwise the moldy smell will settle in the un cleanable parts and it takes a while to work itself out of the system.  So my recommendation so far - buy more than one filter.....
Does not last long for the price. they had another version of this one that is better but they stopped making it! This one will last about a month and you have to flip it every day or it turns moldy looking. The other about three months. There is no alternative for this model.
I have been disapointed in the last filters I purchased for my humidifier.  The price has gone up by several dollars and although the filters are suppose to be good for at least a month, I am finding they are not even lasting that long.  I regularly clean my humidifier and make sure the water tank is odor free, I am disappointed and plan on sending a email to Hamilton Beach directly.  Good Luck!
Price rise from last year 6.99 to 15.00 this year. Disgraceful.Dr. Lucille F. Becker
Works OK, but doesn't last - and costs a bit much.
If you're on Amazon looking to buy these filters you likely have bought the Hamilton Beach humidfier at a real store and now need filters, only to find your real store doesn't stock them.I've had the HB humidifier for a couple of years and have used many filters; they are *very* expensive for what they are.  They are cheaper if you buy them direct from HB (or even third pary sellers through Amazon), but by the time you pay shipping with the other sellers it's all pretty close.  The expense of the filters though is an important point to consider if you are considering to buy this type of unit.  If you need whole house humidifying all winter long it's not the right choice; if you own your home vs. renting have a whole-house humidifier installed.As for life expectancy...one can read the reviews and see that some people have a few days and some people get a few months from one filter.  This is all a function of your own water and air quality.  If you've got rusty water don't be surprised if your filter is yellow in a week, yk?Also, I've seen several reviewers saying they're trying to humidify their homes to 50%.  This is probably too high for ordinary winter use in cold weather climates.  Anything over 35% and you're going to get condensation on your windows which will freeze if it's cold.  I have a whole house humidifier (something your furnace/AC guy has to install); its maximum setting is 35% and the colder the outside temp is the lower they recommend you set your humidistat at.  Anyway, I use my HB room humidifier in the bedrooms of my kids when they have a bad chest cold.  The extra moist air helps them breath and soothes irritated airways.  But it's just for bedtime, and only when they're sick.  My unit has no problem making one bedroom as moist as I want it short term (50%); I think in a large open space it would struggle.
In a quick summary, we are pretty happy w/ the Hamilton Beach humidifier but the filters do not last longer than 3 weeks if you use the system for long periods of time.  Of course you have to keep up w/ the clean water, turn the filters over so both ends get usage in order to prolong the life, but we have found that it (filter) still grows mold and the water begins to smell after the 3-4 week period - no matter how clean the water is.  We have tried similar, cheaper filters but its the same deal.  You really need to stock up for the winter months.  If you use the system like we do in the winter, 24/7, you may want to look at other system because this can become costly for people on a budget.
The service provided by the vendor was timely.  The items arrived undamaged.  They are a bit over priced by the manufacturer.
It's only a filter, how much can you really like it? I haven't even used it yet, probably won't until cold season.
Hard to find via retail stores and we only use ours in the winter\dry months.  They work just like the originals.
First of all I have to say that the only part of the test I used was for water hardness. That test gave a color scale and myself being one of the 10% of the male population that has color vision problems, I had to guess. I live alone and was not able to refer to someone with correct color vision. Even if someone had been available, the scale was not graded well enough to get a close rating. It was marked at every 20 hardness rating so I had to decide what the color was closest too in order to set my water softener. It did give me a starting point, but I will still have to tweak my water softener settings to get the best setting.
this product worked (I Assume) like it was supposed to work. it appeared fine. i am not an expert at water testing. it just seemed like the kit was equal to a junior science kit. like it came from a hobby store. maybe not. it may be because I've never used a water test kit before. The lead test did not read anything. you only get 1 of each test so i do not know the lead content of my water. i use a water filter and hope it at least works as stated and removes the lead.
What attracted me is the price and 7 different contaminants.  Instructions are fairly straight forward, although there are some parts that seem quirky. You just have to read it a 2nd time. My lead and pesticides didn't work, nitrates didn't exactly match up on gray scale and the ph colors were actually more difficult than they should have been to match up.  Maybe it's just the water we have. Overall it's okay.
Just wanted to confirm that this kit contains EXACTLY the same test as the First Alert but First Alert is much less expensive.First Alert WT1 Drinking Water Test KitOther than that the kit seems to do what it's supposed to do.
the test kit works to some degree but some results are not easy to read due to the closeness in colors from one level to another.  I won't be buying this again.
it was ok, I wish there was a bit more details but this will due.
i owned one for 3 years; when its drain motor broke down, i had to throw it away as it is very costly to fix. i got a second one because this brand/model was the most inexpensive for doing the job.
In a bit of a hurry, I ordered the Haier dishwasher without reading all the reviews. It arrived damaged and clearly it went into the box that way, because the box and packing materials were pristine.  I called the company and they suggested I try to fix it myself, if that didn't work, then I could take it to a service center.So, after bending some metal with pliers and a bit of duct tape, I got it working.The unit does work now and quite well, but it is so flimsy that I worry it won't last long.
First, contrary to a previous review, there is no actual setup.  If you have a basic working knowledge of the kitchen sink, setup is pretty elementary.  If you do not have this knowledge, then setting up a dishwasher is the least of your troubles.The dishwasher arrived dented, and oddly soaking wet...?  The box and interior of the unit were dryer than the desert I live in, but the exterior was completely drenched.  The dent was small enough for me to not worry about the hassle of sending it back or repairing...so onward!This unit is too tall (21") to work under most cabinets, so you will have to find somewhere else to put it.  The hoses are pretty long, so you should be able to find ample room within their reach.After connecting the intake hose to the faucet and turning on the water, it was obvious it's designed for pretty low pressure systems.  Undaunted by a high-pressure shower, I directed the drain hose down the drain and let her fly.The first real problem that one will notice is this thing is hideously LOUD.  It is so loud; I had to double the volume on the TV in the next room just to hear it.  It washes nicely though, so perhaps it's worth it.Next problem: the drain hose is gravity fed.  After the drain hose vomited all over the floor, it was apparent the dishwasher needed to be located somewhere higher than the sink, which in my apartment required some creative use of phone books.The normal cycle seems to take forever, and when it is done, the dishwasher beeps violently for something to be done.  The beep is annoying, but not as loud as the cycle, so it works out.Considering the price, I think the old adage "what you pay for is what you get" sums up this machine pretty well.  It isn't destined to last a good long time, but it does clean dishes and fits in my tiny apartment.  If you don't mind a loud dishwasher, I would probably recommend this unit to you.  Keep in mind this unit is the only small, reasonably priced dishwasher with two spray arms, and it makes a world of difference.Happy dishwashing!
Update: I had this machine for three months before it started giving me problems. One day it would not start at all. I read the trouble-shooting and some other customer tips on-line. Apparently, there was a problem with our water level sensor; it would not reset itself after each load. I figured out a handy little trick: you have to shake and tilt the machine back on it's hind legs. Doing this resets that sensor and the machine will start.In the meanwhile, I contacted customer service. They were a huge hassle to deal with. They said they'd have repairs call me. Everytime they called I was at work even though I gave them a specific time frame. They never left a message or a return number. The number on my caller Id didn't accept incoming calls.After several months of phone tag, shaking and tilting of the machine finally quit working. My boyfriend had to remove the back panel to locate the sensor. We tried ordering the part ourselves but Haier was out of the $11.99 sensor and wasn't going to have anymore available for purchase. My boyfriend, who is Korean, came up with a clever idea. He used one of his chopsticks to reset the sensor before each use.After a few more service calls I finally connected with a sympathetic representative, he really understood my frustration. He ordered a replacement machine for me. All I had to do was pay $14.99 and mail in the serial number and 6" of the electric cord.A few week later my new unit arrived. I've had that unit for a little over a year now and it has been running beautifully. I hardly use it for the simple fact its a hassle to load, especially since the only place it fits is on top of my refridgerator. Right now, I'm looking to buy an 18" portable dishwasher on wheels.Please beware of this machine and Haier's customer service. I'll never buy another Haier product. When I purchase a new machine I'll most likely toss this one; I wouldn't want to curse my friends with this machine.
well it works, doesnt get dishes quite as clean as a full size name brand dishwasher, but it does sufficiently clean dishes. the single biggest problem i have had with the dish washer is there is a cover that comes down about 2-3 inches from the top opening that seems to serve no purpose what so ever besides not allowing full size dishes to go in the machine. i solved this problem by cutting it off.
Simply put, this is an ok product...if you get what you want. I ordered this unit from a different retailer (wallyworld) and they sent me a different version of this product that only used (1) lower spray arm. I researched portable dishwashers, before deciding on this unit, solely because it has (2) spray arms (supposedly). So double check, before you purchase, or make sure the return policy is solid. Lastly, the problems concerning cycling, and the 'fault' warnings, may very well be avoided by using the proper temperature levels (or just use cold water). My unit ran fine for 3 full cycles, but then cramped up - getting out of sync with itself. I believe this happens because the thing overheats, if your water supply is too hot. I turned mine down, and have yet to experince any more trouble. 2cents, hope it helps - Duane
it's ok for an old lady or a college kid, not practical for a real kitchen.  works as stated, can't fault the seller.  just not what i thought it would be.
Honestly I never got to use it after I bought it because I couldnt get the hose to attach to my sink. It may have worked great, but ultimately I just wasted money since I couldn't get it to work.
I have owned this dishwasher for almost 2 years and occasionally it will fill with water, go through the cycle then drain most but not all of the water before it refills.  Bottom lines is it refills before all the water is pumped out and shuts off without finishing cycle.  When it works, it works well.  I have this problem once or twice a month.  Generally a good bang for the buck.  I would buy it again if in a pinch.
This is probably a good dishwasher but everyone hides the details of how hard or cumbersome it is to hook up and use. Even the so-called user photos are staged to hide the connections and do not show what it does to the usability of your sink after installation. I don't think these photos were submitted by an actual buyer. Probably an employee of Haier. I want to buy one but won't until I find out and see the connections and their design. Is the sink even useable after install? Do you have to disconnect it everytime you want to use your sink? Is there storage provision for the drain hose when not being used or is this thing always hanging in your sink. I would like to see some legitimate clear pictures showing just how well it is designed and how the water is connected. Does it have a pass-thru connection so you can use your faucet without disconnecting it? To much vagueness and not enough worthwhile pictures.
The dishwasher works well and is easy to use. It came damaged in shipping. It doesn't have any hose or cord storage. The hoses and cords are fairly long and it would be nice to have somewhere to clip them to or wind up on.
Okay, when I got this little machine I was so excited! Then I attempted to hook it up to the sink for it's first use &amp; I was quickly frustrated, because there are no hookup instructions. With hubby being out of town for the weekend, I made my way to Home Depot bringing in &quot;what I have on the faucet now&quot; &amp; &quot;what I need to put on the faucet&quot;. After a half-an-hour of assistance, I finally found two connection extentions that would allow the dishwasher's hookups to be compatible with my own.Great- Now I've got it (&amp; without hubby's help:) &amp; it's working pretty well... so far. I have had to run two heavy cycles on many of my loads, but this may be because of the detergent (I have experimented with 3 different brands so far &amp; Palmolive seems to work the best:)I have never owned a dishwasher before, so this may be a stupid question, however, when I put the detergent in the dispenser, it seems to drip or fall down the door to the bottom of the washer.It this correct? The manual is poorly written, &amp; it pretty much states that the dispenser is a guide for measuring detergent, but isn't the soap supposed to stay in the dispenser?Anyways, the machine seems to be doing a fairly good job. If Haier would rewrite the manual &amp; add an &quot;extra heavy&quot; setting for bigger jobs, it would get five stars. Otherwise, it's working fine &amp; draining properly.
Works really good but leaks underneath, thru the vents.  The factory should fix that defect.
I like this machine when it works. It does everything you may want from normail size machine except its life span. I purchased my 1st one in Aug 2005, and it leakes in Aug 2006, 20 days before the warranty expired. I called Haier, and it sent me a new one and took back the broken one. In Sept. this year, it rejected water with continous beepping. I do not know what it is the problem. After i read some reviews here, it sounds like there is some clog inside. Before I throw it away, I kick it heavly on the back. It works again, but it required me to kick it at least once every week. Now, Nov 8th, the upper fan collapsed. I take the fan out, and throw it. Still,  I do not give up, and put the water and force it work. The dishes were cleaned.According to my limited experince of two, its life span is about 1 year to 1.5 year.(I used it everyday.). If the price is  $200, it is about $0.5/day.  Buy accordingly.
Having received my dishwasher as a Christmas gift from my son I was thrilled with the prospect of not having to wash dishes any longer (never had a dishwasher).  Well now Easter is here and the damn thing will not work.  I push the button and in 15 seconds the machine beeps and will not start.  I called customer service and was told no service centers in my area and the service department would get back to me within 48 hours from the next business day which should be Wednesday.....I will see if they actually do.  While it was working it worked great little noise and cleaned very well.  Now the only noise it makes is the beeping telling you there is a problem.  High price to pay for a kitchen counter blocker.
I have some concerns with this product. We have had ours for less than 3 years and it has already broken down. We have an old house built in the 40's, so very limited space to install a dishwasher. The dishwasher should have lasted more than 3 years, but I am buying another one, the same model, only because of the price, and the area that I have devoted to the dishwasher will only fit this model. I figured that trying to have it repaired may cost me as much as a new one, and would still be stuck with 3 years old parts that could fail at any time. If you notice the other review has owned their dishwasher of less than 3 years. I hope that this new one will hold up longer than the first one. I would read the other review and then make an intelligent choice it this is the dishwasher you want to buy.
Hello all, or Aloha all :)I was given this dishwasher. It was missing a part. I was told to order part number WD 0015 01. I was told this was the correct item by the person who gave it to me, and by the referred company. I just got my order today. It was in a box that was about 6 inches X 6 inches. So, knowing how companies love to pack oversize boxes with tiny parts, I wasn't too surprised. Now, my Haier DW has the hoses connected and the plug, of course. So, imagine my surprise, when I opened the box and finding what looks like a rubber washer! Am I missing something? I did download and print out the manual. The "quick release" is connected to the hose, as shown. Do I just fit this rubber ring/washer into the "quick release" to run the dishwasher? I actually was going to purchase this item from Amazon. Due to health reasons I am unable to sit or stand for long periods of time. Finances did not allow for an Amazon purchase but I read the reviews here to see the good and bad features. I read more good than bad. So, I printed the manual, and I think I am good to go. Do you see anything I could possibly be missing from my description that would prevent me from hooking it up and using it?Mahalo/Thanks!
Can't say anything good or bad about the item as it was damaged each time it arrived (2x).  I don't think it was the package as much as the shipping servicing handling of the item.  One was bashed in on the side and the second was cracked down the bottom panel.  I could only return one since the first box was destroyed in the rain (by being left outside by the shipping company).  Now I have to go find a box for the 2nd one since Amazon can't seem to supply me with one.  So no full refund since I have to go "shop" for a box and buy one to return the damaged item in.
Had mine about 3 years. Actually I think now that after reading these reviews that my water heater must have stopped working the first year. You can always use hot water I guess at a little more cost per wash but it's worth it. Does ok overall. I did have a problem with the water not shutting off. You had to smack it in the rear on the right side where the float was to get it to trigger. That problem went away after about 9 months. I do run bleach or CLR through it once in a while to clean it out and that helps. So overall, I use it at least 4 times a week now for 3 years and it's held up with the exception of the water heater.
Not bad, not bad. At least I don't have to wash dishes by hand anymore. After having to be shown how to attach the input hose to a faucet so the water source doesn't spray all over the place, thanks to a incomplete manual that doesn't mention how to do this, the thing performed beautifully, taking an enormous amount of pressure and not leaking at all! However, the washing results are typical electronic dishwasher mediocre: The silverware has to be rinsed off, so do the glasses and anything that was particularly dirty when you put it in there. The detergent reservoir is a little indent in the door, not a well that dispenses the detergent as needed...and you don't get two jet sprayers in the machine...just one!While it DOES get the majority of the dishes clean enough to eat off of, and takes filthy eating-ware and makes it usable again, this unit was a MAJOR disappointment, considering that it costs 2/3 of what a full bore basic unit would have cost! The sorry thing is, the market's kinda short on units like this, even though the need is definitely out there, and ALL the units are in this price range or higher and don't vary that much in design or what they offer, manufacturer to manufacturer.Guess at this point, it's up to me to find a better detergent....
To preface this review, I got this unit used and it is being used in a two person apartment.The product came with a decent manual, not the best, but certainly not the nightmare some people described. To give an idea of how much info it contains, it has 24 pages for each of the three languages - English, French, Spanish. The description on how to hook it up isn't entirely clear, as the illustration for the sink isn't like any sink I've seen in the US. Nonetheless, with some common sense it shouldn't be that difficult to figure out. You only have three things to worry about - 1) the rubber hose which brings water into the unit, 2) the drain hose which dumps water out of the unit, and 3) the power cord. I had to go to Lowe's to get a sink adapter, since what came with the unit didn't fit the threads on the faucet. I think maybe most people have problems at first because they don't realize the nozzle part can unscrew from the faucet.Operation is pretty easy - turn on the water supply, plug it in, press the power button, press whatever wash cycle you want. I think the vented dry button on my unit is broken since pressing it doesn't seem to change anything. Setup and take down is simple, it maybe takes a minute or two to screw/unscrew everything. At first I was having problems securing the drain hose, once it dumped water all over the kitchen floor and I spent a good half an hour wiping it up. I came up with a solution where I secured the drain hose to the rubber hose with rubber bands, thus insuring that the drain hose drained into the sink and not the floor.This thing does a good job of cleaning the dishes, so long as everything is properly loaded, but there's the problem - loading it. The problem I have with the unit is not just its size, but the design of its interior. Some of the spokes are so close together it's plain impractical. You can fit plates in there, so long as they're not very big (I have a lot of plates that don't fit in there), but the design isn't very friendly to bowls bigger than a small cereal bowl.For two adults who basically use dishes/tupperware for all three meals, it's becoming clear that this dishwasher is inadequate for our needs. It's simply too small. I think this dishwasher would be a better fit for a single person who maybe eats out more often and doesn't do much cooking.
The Haier was purchased a few months ago.  Having an old house without room or the proper electrical for a full size dishwasher, I thought we'd give it a try.  Hand washing just doesn't get the dishes that nice, hot, sterile clean, so this is a great alternative.My machine arrived with some dings and dents, but the hassle of returning it outweighed the damage.  Like many others, I had to replace the washer in the hose (it all depends on the kind of faucet you have) before having a nice leak-free connection, but it's since impressed me with its performance.  My set up is a bit different in that it is permanently connected to the hot water hose of my washing machine (with a shut off valve) and drains into my washer.  In terms of washing, I give this machine high marks.  It runs in our household at least once a day, giving us super clean dishes and it swallows more than you would expect.It's the quality/fit/finish that I have issue with.  The dish rack doesn't stay on tracks in either direction(thought swapping it around might solve the problem, but no).  Even though I've tried to be very gentle with loading, one of the racks upright pegs had it's rubberized coating torn and that piece rusted off within a week.It doesn't seem that it will be a long-lived appliance, but I can appreciate it for what it is.  It's a great alternative to hand washing and when you consider the price at Amazon includes shipping......it's worth a try!****UPDATE****Have had the machine over a year.  There are going to be more pieces rusting off the internal rack, but it's still going strong.  It runs a minimum of once a day and I am still pleased with the purchase - with acceptance of its limitations.  Still beats hand washing!!!  I think the fact that I have it permanently installed with the Y adapter on my hot water line is helping with its ease of use.
I am bsically happy with this product. I will point out, that it is very imprtant that the water connection be hooked up securely and the cold water on fairly high or all the way.  This is my second dishwaher of this type and I believe i burned out hte first one by not turning on the water more than half way whenI ran the appliance. For what it is, it doe a great job, runs quietly and doesn't seem to use a whole lot of energy.
My dishes are nice and clean--no issues there. Haier's design, though, leaves something to be desired: The layout of the dish tray is awkward and inefficient, and as other reviewers have mentioned, the wastewater hose should have been attached to the intake hose. My suggestion: buy the Danby instead.
Works great.  Dry winter indoor heated air now tolerable. Recommend getting at least three for the season.  Easy to clean.Thanks
pros: works great with the HM1865 model holmes humidifer i have at home. actually, it's probably better quality than the original filter that came with my machine. . .cons: it's WAY overpriced though.  if i could do it all over again, i'd buy it form the holmes website which has it for half the price even with shipping included!.  don't get confused by the whole 'PDQ-U' letter scheme. . . it seems to be the part number.  the box labels it as a HWF65 'C' filter which is what they are also selling on the holmes website.5 stars for quality.1 star for price.3 stars overall.
The filter meets my requirements and works as advertised.  My old filter had a metal cage around it and it will last longer I believe.
It's too small so have cut a seam and open it up so it can be used.  My larger size is no longer made.
Life span is short week to two at the very best.  A better product replacement should be designed for future customers!
This filter will work longer than many reviews have indicated. What keeps it fresher is to wash your tank, basin and filter in vinegar. Pour a little vinegar in the basin, tank and fill with water. Dump this water over your filter while rinsing. Rinse everything with cold water. This should be done once a week. It helps to turn the filter over each time you fill up. Cheap store vinegar will cost $2 and should get you through one winter season.
Can someone please tell me what is the difference between the HWF-65 and the HWF65PDQ-U? I have several HWF-65's laying around from my Holmes HM2060W humidifier that recently died and I am trying to find a replacement humidifier that uses the same wick filters. I am seeing a model (HM1865-U) listed on Amazon that says it uses the HWF65PDQ-U replacement filter but no one (not even Holmes) will answer my question of WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO replacement filters?!!?!?!?!? I just need this burning question answered...
These are half the price on Holmes Website.  Thankfully, someone else pointed that out previously.  So, for the value, I don't understand how anyone could give this a 5 star rating.  We blow through 2 of these each winter, and they used to sell in a 2 pk (for $20), so keep that in mind when ordering.  One will likely not be enough.  We use ours every night from about November to March.  It would be nice if these would last a little longer.  Oh, I should mention that we have a whole house water filtration system/softener.  I would think that would keep the hard water from building up so quick, but they do get funky quickly.  When desperate, this can be cleaned/rinsed and put back in, but they kind of start to fall apart when you take them out.
it was twice the size (tall) as I needed so I cut it in half (with very tuff scissors) and now I have two filters! thank you!
I bought this filter because it is a Holmes filter... but it is actually a generic one. It works, but I am not happy with the false advertising. I also disliked a lot that I purchased 2 items at the same time from this seller and I was charged DOUBLE shipping because shipping charges apply to every item purchased - sigh-, so I will NOT buy from this seller again.
The only thing going for this is the cost. It was a lot cheaper than buying one at my local store which price gouged replacement filters. They wont last as long as the name brand replacements, but will work for about a month.
The filter did not fit in the humidifier as well as the original one did.  The filter gauge did not reset, so it still reads "Replace Filter".  It does, however, work just fine.  It was a bit of a challenge to round it out to get it to fit correctly in the unit(as it comes flat in a box).  It does the job for a fair price and they are hard to find locally.
The filter worked for a while and then I noticed the water in the humidifier reservoir was not going down. Checked the filter and it was hard and not wicking. I'm gonna try the Holmes website ([...]) as they have real filters from $6 with free shipping.
It did the job but got smelly just  as quickly as the filters that aren't &#34;extended life.&#34;  I expected it to have a longer life.
This product is great when it is brand new, but after two weeks, it starts to smell because it starts getting moldy.  Putting bleach on it makes the whole room smells like bleach.  Ick!!  Takes two days to get rid of the bleach smell, then have to turn on the air cleaner.  What a pain to get a little humidity into the air!!  Only purchase if you can keep buying them over and over, again.
What I didn't like was the shipping wasn't very speedy. Not bad, but if you're used to getting things quickly (as most things come that I order through Amazon whether it comes directly from Amazon or the company) this one doesn't.
These are necessary.but kinda pricey considering they only go about 30 days and need tedious cleaning in vinegar or replacing
This is just OK. It does not seem to work as well as the last time. Delivery and web handling of this product was excellent.
These filters do a great job of providing water to be forced into the air by the fan, but they are don't stand up well.  Cleaning is required every week (or more depending on how hard your water is), and that cleaning will eventually destroy the filter.  They last at most one season.
First of all I love the machine...BUT the company's have downgraded all filters to junk.  Do not want to throw out the machine so after much much looking I found these to be as good as the expensive filters. So I bought several of these filters for the season.  They last a couple of weeks and then I throw it away and replace with a new filter
After cleaning the entire humidifier and putting the new filter in place all was working great. Two days later when I refilled the water tank and turned on the machine a stale moldy smell started coming from the humidifier. This never happened last year with the original filter and it does not last long but I'm not quite sure why this is happening. I cleaned the machine again and even sprayed the filter with  Febreeze but the moldy smell still comes up when the the unit is first turned on. I'm not quite sure where the problem lies.
There's nothing too exciting in the world of filters. It does what it needs to. What else is there to say?
I have owned several American Harvest Jetstream ovens over the past 15 years.  While I really do enjoy cooking with them, they are not really designed for heavy duty use.  The expander ring is just one of the items you must replace every year or two because they crack.  I would be extremely happy and willing to pay more for the Jetstream Ovens if they were designed to last longer and were built of stronger materials that withstood heat and heavy usage.
