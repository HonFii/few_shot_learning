It beats watching a blank screen. However, I just don't seem to be in tune with to comedy of today.
There are many episodes in this series, so I pretty-much just skip through them to try to find a description of something I think I would like.  It's kind of a crap shoot as to whether you'll be entertained or not, but hey, if you're just sitting around trying to kill 20-30 minutes while you're waiting for something else to do, it's worth a shot.
Not bad.  Didn't know any of the comedians but first time viewing put a smile on my face.  I'll check out the next season soon.
comedy is a matter of taste. this guy was a little funny but there are others that are far funnier than this guy
if this had to do with Dat Phan, he was hilarious, I enjoyed his comedy and would watch him alone numerous times
some comedians are very good, some not so good, and some are just not funny.  I don't know the names to chose from and watched this by picking random episodes. However, I do know some big names in stand up comedy and these were not included on prime.
I only watched the Wanda Sykes portion of this show. I think it was interesting to watch because it was before she came out as a lesbian. She was married to a man at the time. She actually made some jokes that raised my eyebrows since she is now a lesbian. I didn't like this because it seemed hypocritical but I think Wanda Sykes is really funny. She is one of the few comedians who can make me really LOL (Laugh Out Loud). If you want to see what her comedy was like before she came out a lesbian or you are a Wanda Sykes fan, watch it. I am a huge fan of hers. I would like to see her in a live how. I am glad she is true to herself now and came out as a lesbian. I hope Wanda keeps on making me and others laugh for a long time to come.
There were some good entertainers, and some are just dumb.  I kept a paper and pen and wrote down names of the ones I wanted to see more.  They keep them in fairly short bits.  If you are looking to laugh continuous this may not be for you.  But each person has a different sense of humor so give it a try, but don't expect greatness.
It was fine - not my favorite but a comic on her way up. Some of the same cliche material I hear from others but a spark if the individual world view comes to the fore.
It is nice to see some of the more popular comedians when they were first starting out. You can tell why some made it big and some didn't. If you like stand up comedy, I recommend giving it a try.
This is a cute series, and I did watch two episodes, and enjoyed both of them.BUT I had to ask myself, if I had watched these two episodes on regular TV, would I have watched a third episode a week later? I had to honestly answer that I might watch it, but if something better was on, I wouldn't &#34;need&#34; to watch it.If you enjoy comedies, you might love this series more than me, and I might return to try it again in a few months or years. Sometimes, I return to a book at a later date and love it more, and the same could happen here.
The show is a little bit dry, but is definitely funny.Have only seen the first four episodes, and they were definitely funny enough to continue watching the series.Characters are easy to relate to as they are about my age, funny stuff.
It's basically a slightly less intelligent version of &#34;Seinfeld.&#34; If I had to define it I'd say it's sophomoric humor which contains lots and lots of yelling amongst the main characters. For lovers of low brow comedy, this will be among your favorites. I haven't seen all of the episodes yet, but so far it appears that no topic is taboo.
Overacted but occasionally funny over the top sitcom of friends running a bar that involve getting caught in some silly scheme, one character trying to convince others how selfish or immature they are acting, being broke, getting drunk, or getting laid.  Perhaps the story ideas got funnier in season 2 as they did with "Portlandia."  This show is definitely geared towards viewers in their 20's.
This serries is OK, but it really lacks the substance that Criminal Minds, MI-5, CSI or Alias has.  The list goes on. When is the second season of Bones and Criminal Minds coming out?
The hypothetical life of the protagonist time traveler, Dr. Who, has entertained me and my relatives who have grown into wonderful young men and women. They derived hours of pleasure watching all the episodes available here in the U.S.A. However, I did not give the show five stars because the stories are a bit far-fetched for the trained mind.
They've come a long way since the original Dr. Who. I still like the latest versions. If you are a Dr. Who fan, then these episodes give you a taste its origins... OK, but corny.
Same review as season 5.  Too old, short of nostalgia no real reason to watch.  Give each episode 5 min for future reference.
starting with an actor who was noted for military roles and still going on today Dr. Who is part of many of our lives.The original shows were on miniscule budgets and demanded a lot more imagination from the viewers than today's shows.The Aztecs in this show were probably more comfortable on the London Underground than in the Central American jungles but that doesn't matter.The Doctor is a far cry from today's version-  with no real alien identity (two movies had him as definitely an elderly Earthman)- but that didn't matter- kids loved it and more than a couple of their parents too!.A captivating history lesson
Hi, it was great to get to watch these episodes (The Ark In Space) that I never saw before, especially on Prime.  But...most of the season's episodes are not available. If they had everything available including classics about the Daleks, Crinoids, etc. this series would be a home-run. Also, Tom Baker is my favorite childhood version of Dr. Who, which is another reason why I would love to see everything featuring him available on Amazon Instant Video.
Everything has to start somewhere but as a viewer there is only so much nostalgia one can have for sci-fi.  Thus is a 50 year old season and it shows.  Campy at best.  If you want a good starting point for Dr. Who I suggest starting with Dr. #3 in app 1970.  This is also the start of color. That being said seeing Cybermen as an original 'bad guy' shows the connection to the past.
Nothing wrong with production value/quality.  But the subject matter is so improbable that it seems like such a waste of energy to pack even more people into a crowded area (Tokyo) of a crowded country.  750,000 people in an engineered group of buildings stacked like a pyramid.  Watch it if you don't have strong reactions to hubris on display.
I like the show because you can learn Spanish words and that is good exposure for my 3 year old. The show is good for very young children but it is a very simple show.
There is a adventure in every episode. Every adventure is new. In each episode, There is a place to go.
After watching Dora for the last +10 years! I have Kids ages 3-16!Good for kids. Lots of stuff to learn.
I don't like Dora but the kids are transfixed for 25 minutes so it allows me to get something done. I only like Dora because of learning words in other languages. otherwise, it's annoying
I still like the show, I just kind of enjoy the early seasons better... It seems that right about this season they stop singing the original map song as much and my daughter really enjoys that song.
I won't write you a &#34;book&#34; on this one, others have already done that. This was one well done series, in just about any aspect. Well written, it even &#34;looked&#34; good- unlike the typical SYFY Saturday movie. I always wondered why religion came into the plot line the last couple of seasons, negatively portrayed at that, but maybe the writers were running out of material. Well written even if you don't like the subject matter sometimes, or the enemy ( I &#34;liked&#34; the Goa'uld- seasons 1-8, better than the Ori- 9-10, and even then the stories had something to them.Start at the beginning of the series, not the end, and always be sure to watch the extras each season.This was the best of the three Stargate series.
This season seemed to be more about the artsy predilctions of the actors and producers.  The battle with the Ori became more and more convoluted and was not resolved to my satisfaction with the bad guys getting their butts kicked by the good guys.  I liked the first 9 and would watch them again.  I wouldn't watch season 10 again.
Not as good as season 5, 6 or 7 but okay too.But I was very disappointed with the ending.Stargate definetely deserved a big impressive ending.For heavens sake! - such an awesome TV show - we are talking TV HISTORY:and then this weak lame ending........zero stars for the creativity of the writers involved.
The very dated soundtrack hurts this otherwise OK 70s crime drama. All the suspense scenes are marred by the hokey Dave Grusin score, which sounds like a dippy 1960s TV show. Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing.
Good movie especially if you like Mitchum.
"The Friends of Eddie Coyle" is a 1970's crime movie, with great dialogue, acting, and intrigue. The movie reminded me of "The Sopranos" more than classic film noir. "Eddie Coyle" is more realistic and subdued than a lot of noir. It also has a lot of criminals interacting: pulling capers, making deals, and distrusting each other, like some of the criminals in "The Sopranos". It's centered more on the interaction of the characters and the story than on action. There are several great scenes, where the dialogue and the acting are engaging, particularly when Robert Mitchum speaks. I've never been a fan of Robert Mitchum, but here he's excellent, bringing a lot of emotion and weariness to Eddie Coyle. The story is also very good, as we see Eddie struggle to stay out of jail. The DVD is from The Criterion Collection, and looks good. There is a new commentary track from director Peter Yates. I don't think this film will appeal to a wide audience, because it's completely a crime film and nothing else, but fans of crime films might thoroughly enjoy it. Reviewed 8/23/2009 after watching on DVD.
Had some trouble accessing some of the episodes, but very enjoyable.(Might be my old DVD player).Linda Sheean
Show starting to find reasonable plots hard to find, but I enjoy the actors and their characters therefore I found the series enjoyable.
Warning!  There are multiple spoilers in the following review!I've watched STARGATE ATLANTIS from the beginning and have more or less enjoyed it from the start.  I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I'm convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I'm not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they've been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett's leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I'm anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series' run.  If you don't have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC they have killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in the overall cast, there were some great moments.  The season finale (both SG-1 and ATLANTIS have had some fine season enders) was splendid.  And the season featured what may be my favorite episode of the entire series so far in "Common Ground," in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a wraith who is allowed to feed on no one else.  Christopher Heyerdahl has played several wraiths on the series, but in this episode he was allowed to give this particular wraith a dignity and complexity not allowed any other wraith with the exception of Michael.  He gradually drains the life out of Sheppard out of sheer necessity before the two of them, cooperating as human and wraith never have before, manage to escape from the Genii.  Then, in a moment that could lead to interesting plot developments in the future, we discover that the wraiths cannot only drain another creature of life, they can also imbue them with it, and as a sign of comradeship he heals Sheppard.  I want arcs like this one!  On a host of other series some of the most interesting characters have been those who came over from the other side.  On STAR TREK: VOYAGER, we had Seven of Nine; on BUFFY we had Angel, Anya, and Spike; currently on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA we have Sharon Agathon and (possibly) Caprica Six; and on SG-1 we had Teal'c.  I think it would be fascinating if they could do something like that with a wraith.So I wait for the beginning of Season Four with some nervousness.  The show has some weaknesses and problems, but they are fixable.  The series has not lost any of its potential.  But until we see how the new city in the air Atlantis works in terms of story and how the new cast changes affect the chemistry we won't know for sure.  One thing is for certain.  Season Four should bear little resemblance to any of the first three seasons.
This was my first try at rent a series which has, to me unknown actors.  Bice relationships between a few of the characters
It could happen! But for me the story was tragic and bleak (that's the point, I know!). The visual effects were good, the acting was good, and the story was okay. It was a vary long opening to an attempted invasion of earth. And I felt it's main female character was short changed.
While I liked this mini-series enough to but all 5 parts- I was disappointed in the non-ending . Maybe there was supposed to be more story later? Major characters are tossed away. I wouldn't see it again.
Typical short series kinda sci-fi. Worth the watch if your looking for something easy to watch and have time to kill.
The story was interesting but effects and budget where low by BBC standards.  It was nice that it's all wrapped up in just 6 episodes.
Fans of Phyllis Logan, who plays Mrs. Hughes on Downton Abbey, will enjoy seeing her in this show. She plays the often tough, but ultimately heroic Squadron Leader Helen Knox. The story has a few puzzling twists, and there's way too much military trigger-happiness. The sets have that "BBC Drama" familiarity, yet they somehow seem out-of-place for this story. Nonetheless, if you like Phyllis Logan and/or Downton Abbey, then this show is definitely worth watching!
Science fiction is one of my favorite themes. It can be smaltzy or realistic, it doesn't matter as long as the plots are moving forward realistically and the acting is decent. More often than not,  most Sci Fi hasn't developed varied plots, but for now, until the industry has more imaginative writers, it is ok. I prefer real science fiction, not blurred into fantasy of mythical beasts and vampires, which end up moving the imagination back into reality and snuffing out the momentum of plot advancement.My only suggestions are: keep it real with emotional responses, don't overdo it with fake shooting scenes, devise unique ways to solve problems (McGiverish), and grow the the characters relationships.  There is nothing wrong with a good &#34;McGuffin&#34;.If a series can develop over time, I'll be a faithful watcher. If not, once episode or less is enough.
Invasion Earth is a very slow moving Sci-Fi that you really have to try hard to get through the first few episodes. I would not recommend this series.
Well, I think this series would be great for mystery science theater review.  I like the campy quality of the series  but die hard scifi fans probably won't like it.  I would like to give a nod to a Downton Abbey star who plays a significant role in this series.  Can you pick out the actor?
Brit show with several downtown abbey regulars in cast.  Ok for middle of night insomnia.  Fred ward should have been a bigger star.
A lot &#34;off the wall&#34;.First thing I noticed was the Alert response time (at the beginning) of nearly 10 minutes is TOTALLY wrong. (Seriously folks, it's under 60 seconds!!)  and to place the ONE GUY responsible (for the whole debacle) in a position of leadership!?! NOT HAPPENING!!! And there's not a way -- good or bad -- to 'spin' it.The story was very good, but what this series lacked was a director.
playback is horrible.is pauses all the time and makes watching it a pain in the A&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;.if this was a dvd I would return it for a new one, but it is instant video purchase.
Just about the time that I thought just about every possible variant on the TV cop/detective/crime solving show had been explored by the creative geniuses who provide our nightly broadcast television ration of pap, piddle and trivia -whoa - here came a show that tickled our Sherlock Holmesian/forensic knowledge fancy.  Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross-out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of'  "Built to Kill" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt-casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in "Living Legend".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the "miniature" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the "Miniature Murders" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch-to-a-foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half-inch-to-a-foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full-sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio. Other extras include commentary tracks for seven episodes, and a tour of the real CSI-Las Vegas offices; which, astonishingly enough, are very much more cluttered and not nearly as plush-looking as the series sets.
Off to a slow start in episode one but shows promise. I will continue with that hope and give a more in depth eval.
I bought this dvd and 5 other seasons on the recommendation of my back doctor. So, far the first episode has been very dry and dull. The second episode picked up nicely. I am up to the fifth episode and still unsure about this show. At times, it's a series about a psychotic serial killer with morals. Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though. So, I gave it three stars. Perhaps I should give it four, but time will tell.Ralph J. Fitcher.
Good show.  You get attached to the character's.  Not what expected in a cop type show.  Watching all the seasons on amazon prime has been great.
They hit a slump here. I also think they really miss Glenn Close. When she joined the show the number of viewers went up 30%. With her gone the show really struggles.
Still horrifying due to its nature but very informational. A watch for history buffs and to never forget one of our darkest tragedys
Honestly! Can we have a different story line than terrorist, mole in organization, rotten government..blah, blah. Will I keep watching? Yes, still have two more seasons to go. Jack almost gets a little pathetic, perhaps that doesn't help. After watching both this and MI-5, I prefer MI-5. More emotion, more attachment to characters and better story development.
I'm a huge fan of "24" however I must say that whoever wrote the 2-3 line synopses of the Season 6 epidosdes should ask for his or her money back from whatever institution of higher learning they attended.  The introductory sentences that tell about each new episode on the roster should really give some good information about what's in that segment and it can be done by almost anyone who learned even the basics of writing in grammar school. I can't imagine that Amazon and the people who produce "24" would allow some imbecile to degrade their work even with something as small as this.
I was incredibly disappointed in season Six of 24. The reason I give this a three-star review as opposed to a two is that I think that perhaps the standards for this season to live up to were very dificult coming off of season Five, which is easily the best season of the show thus far. The plot seemed to go in far too many different directions, far too many relationships unresolved and there were far too many questions that remained unanswered. I applaud the show for being ambitious and trying different things, but there were too few moments of Jack doing what he does best and too many moments where the show felt like a long and very boring civics lesson in terms of presidential power and the transfer of it.Also the problem that seems to be facing this show right now is that Jack has little to no emotional investment anymore in CTU or in his own life. His best friends are all dead (and he's had to kill one of them himself), and his lover is practically catatonic. All he really seems to have left is the job (and his daughter), but that just doesn't seem like enough. The brains behind this great show had better find someone or something fast to get Jack to reinvest himself in emotionally or else this season could be the harbinger of doom for the Hour of Bauer's Power!!
OK, this one is kind of over the top. Jack Bauer comes back from Chinese captivity a broken man. Then he is confronted with a series of terrorist attacks culminating in the explosion of an atomic bomb. The show also has turned somehow more gruesome since we early on see Jack bite the neck and kill one of his captors (Jack as vampire?)  and then eventually he will kill one of his friends and torture his brother. His father also turns out to be an enemy. And we get to know this pretty early on in the series. While the performance of Jack Bauer as burned-out is particularly well done at the same time it is distracting and the show suffers from his lack of motivation. There is also an unnecessary emphasis on a multitude of subplots which tend to cause more of a headache and do not contribute to the storyline. That said it is not bad, it is simply not as good as season 5. As other reviewers have noted, the loss of many central characters has also weakened the interest for the series.
In the time since Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) was kidnapped, the United States has become a dangerous place.  Suicide bombers hit the country on a regular basis, and no one is safe.  New President Wayne Palmer (D. B. Woodside) has arranged Jack's release from a Chinese prison camp.  Jack is to be traded to the terrorists in exchange for a promised cease fire.Jack agrees to give his life for the peace of his country.  But when he finds out that it was all a lie, he escapes to begin another cat and mouse hunt with the terrorists.  Only this time, they've already struck once, leading to a calamity.  Meanwhile, the trail leads Jack to his own family.  What secrets are his dad and brother hiding?  Can he stop the terrorists before they unleash even more terror on America?And more importantly, what happened to this once great show?  I've been a fan of this show since season one.  While my favorite season was the third, I've thought all of the previous seasons were great.  But not this one.Part of the problem was the been there, done that factor.  The writers seem to be out of plot twists, so they are relying on the same one stand bys.  Unfortunately, loyal viewers can see those coming.  There was very little here that we hadn't seen before, which made the season boring.The other big problem was the dropped storylines.  Several times, a story was introduced and dropped in a matter of episodes.  Sometimes, they came back, sometimes they didn't, leaving us hanging.  Add to that the increase of personal drama over suspense, and you've got a lack luster season.Now, it wasn't all bad.  This season was still entertaining.  But compared to the previous years, day six was a real let down.
Season 6 has been eclipsed my more modern series such as Lost. The formulaic plotline is old hat and getting long in the tooth. 24 was a groundbreaker but is okay for my treadmill workouts.
A newcomer to 24, in that I've only been experiencing it through DVD, I was particularly impressed with how the show seemed to improve with each season.  This was why I was a bit surprised that season 6 had such a dip in quality.  (Spoilers)  Season 6 begins with a situation beyond the usual "reality" of 24, an america besieged with constant terrorist activity.  Bombings are frequent, and apparently common place.  This alone was a turn off, given the shows ability to feel real and unique.  I wasn't interested in an america under seige.  Add to that other unrealistic moments such as a nuclear bomb going off, and apparently no fallout or worry, as well as someone tortured with a drill returning to work, and you have a season that was particularly unrealistic.  Also, the characters, most of which were unlikeable, seeming to exist only for sake of moving a plot device along.  One moment the presidential aide is in favor of a harsher stance against terrosits, the next he's fighting against those who are.  Jack starts the season traumtized by a couple years in prision and tortured, but quickly is fine.  Oddly, though he spent really only one (1) day with CTU in the last three and a half years (after season 4, he only spent day 5, until day six with them), its shocking how well he know the technology and protocols of CTU.  They never change?  Even the twists were boring and unexciting, mainly as they come from a previous season.  Girl having an affair with a spy? seen it. Threat of nuclear bombs? seen it.  Heck, even the use of the good cop/bad cop president and vice president and invoking of the 25th amendment have been done.  (end spoilers).I guess the issue comes down to writing.  Its not that the actors did not work hard, they had little to work with.  The writing feels almost lazy this time around, as if trying to reycle old stories in a slightly different way.  Sadly, the twists weren't shocking, and usually not interesting.  The characters weren't as likeable, and the plot was a bit of a mess.  While I was able to watch it, I don't know if it is a season I'll rewatch, like the first five seasons.  Only for 24 fans.
When season 5 ended we left Jack on a freighter headed towards China.  When season 6 started Jack is being returned, complete with scars and a dazed expression, to be traded in a "Bauer for Bombs" exchange.  "President Palmer the lesser" bows out in the middle of the series to let the vice-president, who is diddling his turn coat assistant, run amock and make a lot of bad decisions that keeps the plot rolling along.  His chief of staff handles the dual role of good guy/bad guy (at the same time) well.  Back at CTU Mary Lynn must still have that bad smelling limburger cheese sandwich in her desk as her expression remains puckered again this year.  I'm not saying I didn't have fun watching the current series - just that it may be getting a little chiche (but we still haven't jumped the shark).
Season 6 is OK but the novelty is wearing off.  Jack is superhuman, of course.  Supporting characters Morris & Cloe are interesting. The rest are basic carryovers.  We will see if the new (12 hour) 'Live another day' comes up with something new.  I have been working my way through from season one over the last few months.  Could be better with long breaks between seasons so you get ready for a fresh Jack Attack fix?  That's how I see it.  Have fun watching!
This like season two of lost in space was the time when a serious show went into the land of silliness, although it's alot of fun and fast moving the whole concept of the show was scrapped for this more kid friendly romp that could be said to be the fantasy season part one.  I like this but after the first two seasons I just wanted the noncamp era back.  That being said this camp era is a blast if you just enjoy it like that.
Veronica Mars - The Complete Third Season is pretty much a mixed bag. This was the last season of this cult classic and I can understand why this show was cancelled. Kristen Bell who plays Veronica Mars is a good actress but the plotlines and glossy writing is too much. The characters were one-demensional and artifical. Stick with the first two seasons instead, season three was a snoozefest.
This series has for the most part been enjoyable to watch. The process of finding the guilty party holds your interest.
First, I love Veronica Mars. Cleverly written, generally well acted, good production values. Not to mention that Kristen Bell is a little doll! I would rank the first two seasons among my top 10-15 all time favorite shows. It started out strong in season 3 as well, but then began fading. By this time, several interesting characters were gone- Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter)and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin)most important among them. Another problem with the third season is that there were too many threads left hanging and unexplained subplots, perhaps to have been picked up in the 4th season, which never materialized. I suspect that late in the 3rd season, cast, crew, and writers knew they were not to be picked up for another season, and everything started going downhill. If you haven't seen this series, you may be able to find some episodes online to see if you like it. I was poking around free TV sites (legal sites, paid for by advertising, of course)when I first found this series. But then if you do like it, I would say the first two seasons are probably a buy, but could only marginally recommend the 3rd season.
While entertaining, this season seems more contrived than others.  The personal ties from earlier seasons added continuity to the episodes. These connections are often missing on the college campus.  Still the series is entertaining.
nothing really too special ...but it is rather etertaining.....wouldnt buy it but its included in prime so i watch from time to time
This is a good movie to rent if you were into the series like I was. I'm not sure how the producers thought this was a good idea for the big screen. For people who had no clue about the series did not get any back story on the characters who participated in the movie verses the series and why.....It is like picking back up although 10 years later straight from the series....leaving out the cliff hanger from the last season though. For those who did not see the series, I'm not sure will get much from the movie other than, &#34;hey, this would be a good tv series&#34; which it would!
I was looking through my Amazon Video selection and I came across this movie.  5 stars!!  I had never seen a movie rated 5 stars. I immediately purchased it but overall, I thought it was pretty bland.  Veronica has some snappy comebacks and good expressions,but  I did not think it was worth the money and definitely not 5 stars.
The cast is largely the same, that's good. But the whole movie just doesn't &#34;gel&#34; with the excitement and sparkle of the original TV series, the first two, anyway. There are flashes of the old character's great acting and it gets better as the movie progresses. But I was left disappointed, I'd expected more.
Not bad.  Slightly campy and geared toward teenagers.  A few good jokes between father and daughter.  I would probably watch another Veronica Mars movie at home but (I wouldn't rush to the theater).  High school reunion scene reminds me of why I do not attend my own.......funny.

Love Kristen Bell...movie/plot is a little sophomoric.  Kristen is such a strong leading character, she needs to star in a movie that has more depth
Finished watching the series just a few weeks ago.  They left us hanging, so we were so happy to see the follow-up.  If this was a TV series, it would still do well today.  (Hint, make more.  Bring her back.)This movie however, felt just like the weekly show.  And as mush as we love the weekly show, we expected more from the movie. There was one obvious continuity mistake.  I'll let you find it.  The mistake makes you feel they were not too serious about doing the film right.Message to the producers... step it up.  Try again.  We want more, but don't take us for granted.
It was what it was.  With approximately a billion jokes tailored &#34;for the fans,&#34; it's an easy pass if you aren't already a fan of the series.  There isn't much of a story here, and it about equals the quality of the show it's based on.  That said, if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it and laugh harder than everyone else in the room.  It'll make you intolerable to everyone else, but you'll feel special.
But, the overall story seemed a bit predictable.  I really like the Kristen Bell, and she handles the role well, but, overall, it was just okay for me.
Veronica MARS looks like VENUS, but is a down to EARTH girl who is from cliche filled NEPTUNE where no one drives a MERCURY. Veronica narrates the last dozen years of her life so we can catch up, but continues her "Sex in the City" style of narration well into the film. She is set to work for a law firm in NYC and has a great boyfriend. When someone from her "nearly everyone is rich and famous" class is killed, and the main suspect is her ex-boyfriend. Veronica returns to resume her role as an investigator in the case.This was a made for TV formulaic script, and wasn't done well. If you have evidence to clear your client, you present it to the DA and not the local sheriff who doesn't like you.  I also don't understand why she never returned the calls or answered the phone from her new employer. She could explain what she was doing, if they were willing to wait, fine, if not, also fine. But to simply ignore the calls without giving them the respect and decency to provide them with information to make a decision is immature and irresponsible.What channel has the "Columbo" reruns?Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. no nudity.
This is one of those plays that may work brilliantly on stage, but is hard to translate to the screen. The cast is great, the director talented but the movie never quite gels into anything substantial.
Sorry, but the other reviewers are leading you astray. As usual, (re)viewers fall in love with a show and think it can do no wrong. Well, plenty goes wrong in Earl's second season---mainly the scripts.The writers are milking the same old laughs, and even a bunch of decent guest stars can't make this nearly as funny as season one. They try to get outside the box at times, but when all of your characters are basically morons, things get a little stale after a while. The trailer park humor worked for a season, but now it's just old.The only really funny thing on this show now is Joy; Pressly does a great job of making her lines come alive, show after show. Everyone else seems caught up by the slowly increasing weakness of the scripts. There's also the feeling that now that the formula is set, let's milk this puppy while we can. Randy and the cleaning lady are especially flat by the middle of this season.This season has its moments, but it also has loooong minutes of pedestrian writing and nothing interesting going on, and cheap attempts at weak laughs.Didn't think this would jump the shark so soon.Earl's list should now include, "Had a good, really funny show and then made it boring."
Season 1 was simply fantastic. This is slightly a let-down. Probably because the novelty has worn off slightly. As we know Earl is a no-good guy who discovers Karma and decides to undo some wrong things he has done in the past. The persona of Earl is still very sweet and maybe one positive thing is that the episodes are somewhat less aggressive in tone than sometimes in the first season but it is nevertheless not as great.
A bit funny, if you like silly funny.  First couple of episodes seem to introduce a great plot.  Then everything becomes predictable; you almost know everything next on the agenda.
Not really a comedy, sometimes stressful, sometimes insightful.  Ends with a question mark, probably due to the writers' strike.
South Park is a great TV series, one of the alltime best.  The DVD's of the series are somewhat less.  Many of them have the irritating founders of the series with mindless spoofs that you can't skip over.  Worse, this set, among others, has some DVD diskette problems that make the playback freeze-up just when you are enjoying a scene.  Disappionting
Funnier than I thought.  My husband wanted to watch this so bad, and I was hesitant.  The newer seasons are better!
Moments of real comedy on this show, and sometimes really brave comedy, are almost always followed by moments of truly moronic humor. "Poop" jokes are a favorite, for example. Sarah gets points for the occasionally brilliant surrealistic humor, then loses them for her sheer idiocy. It's hard to like this person/character, despite her occasional genius.She is also very anti-semitic at times. But, she is also Jewish. Are Jews allowed to make nasty fun of Jews and also of manufactured anti-semitic hysteria? Anyone else would be declared a war criminal for making a joke about big noses...but apparently if you're Jewish you can go much, much much farther than that. At one point she even suggests the Holocaust was faked. How dare she? To the electric chair! But wait...she's Jewish...I would love to see more Christian and Buddhist and Hindu and Muslim and Jainist etc comedians who have this sort of egotistical self-loathing cushioned by loathing of everything and everyone else as well. But somehow we don't get much of that.Silverman says that's because the media is largely owned and run by and for the Zionists who make the US fight their wars while they run their banks and Federal Reserve, but she is Jewish, so she can say that. It's darn offensive, however true it may or may not be, and I think she should apologize. It does explain her getting to do a show this offensive, though, so maybe it all makes sense. Her boyfriend is Jimmy Kimmel, perhaps the least talented person on TV (quite a feat), so it all fits together in some arcane fashion.In any case, while there's some uniquely weird and funny stuff here, the poop that surrounds it makes it somewhat of a moot point.It ain't normal, so that's a plus.But it's also often so mean-spirited that it just ain't funny.
It is impossible to watch this show without some kind of strong reaction.  There were times watching this show that I laughed as hard as I have laughed at anything I've seen in recent years.  But there were also times when I was simply appalled at how unfunny and in bad taste some parts were, as if the point had ceased being to make us laugh and had become to shock and dismay us.  There are many moments when I am simply blown away by the brilliance and originality of Silverman's comic vision and times when I wonder if she has any conception of what is funny and what is not.This is definitely not a show for everyone and it has nothing to do with how well one's sense of humor is developed.  There are simply a lot of absolutely terrible moments in these episodes to go along with some hysterically funny ones.  If you can filter out or ignore the bad and merely focus on the good, this is a show you will either partially enjoy or consider a masterpiece.  But if you can't filter out the bad or if you obsess over the bad to a degree where you can't appreciate the genuinely funny bits, then you could well consider this to be one of worst shows ever concocted.I especially loved the initial episode, where Sarah buys some cough syrup that has a decided effect on her perception of reality.  That episode -- and especially Sarah's self-absorption that is so extreme that she almost obtains a childlike innocence -- reminds me very much of the balance that Paul Reubens was able to strike in PEE WEE'S PLAYHOUSE.  Unfortunately, she is not able to maintain that balance through the rest of the series.  I did not enjoy any subsequent episode as much as that one, though the one in which she thought she was dying of AIDS came close.  Here is a bit that presents the show at its best.  Sarah is feeling a bit down so she decides to go get an AIDS test so that she'll feel better when it comes up negative.  As part of the exam she is asked to respond to a questionnaire that tracks her lifestyle choices.  Here is a bit of that dialogue:Nurs:  Did you ever have a blood transfusion in the 80s?Sarah: Yeah.Nurse: (alarmed) You did? You had a transfusion in the 80s?Sarah: (bemused) Oh! Ha!  No--I thought you said in Haiti.Nurse: (even more alarmed) How long were you in Haiti?Sarah: Oh that's hard to say; I was doing a lot of heroin at the time.On the other hand, there are the truly awful moments, most of which cannot be repeated on a board like this.  It wasn't merely that they were off color or excessive or extreme.  They were simply not funny.  And being extreme simply for the sake of being extreme is not funny.  Andy Kaufman could pull that off, but few others.So, this is a show that can only receive a limited recommendation.  More perhaps than any other comedian today, Sarah Silverman invites extreme reactions.  There have been many moments where I have found her to be as funny as anyone alive and times when I can't tolerate her.  I suspect that this is pretty much what you will always get with her.  But I will say this:  there isn't anyone else out there quite like her.
In a word,Trite.  Nothing new or challenging here.  It's the Oxbo Incident rehashed to the nth power. Very predictabledialogue and ideas. Circle the wagons. Pull together. Beware those who don't agree to authority figures in the face ofdisaster. The walls and my patience came tumbling down! FCH
This show has some really corny acting. I only watched a few episodes. I gave it a chance.  But.......gave up.
I definitely thought this show had potential, good actors with good perfomances, and a pretty good plot all told. word.
Jericho was an attempt at embarrassing GW Bush ; that alone made it nearly FLOP . the apocalyptic theme is ok for the regular viewer . for science , hunters , mechanics radio types , it will leave you COLD ! .. forgot FARMERS !! i think they git the worstest  treatment as far as "REALITY" is concerned . players as all pretty good . McRaney always does well .story line is consistent , but the props are sometimes BIZARRE . 3 get into an argument because a young woman says "gas cant be transported in metal tanks !!" well , just plain STUPID .the second season does wrap it all up in similar vane , but some twists only the emotionally handicapped mite , i say MITE believe .well its up to you . i call it a "draw" . you're not losing your money , but if looking for "reality" in your viewing , this isnt where to go .G'nite y'all
It's an okay show. Acting is about par with being a CBS drama. Story line is great but the story has more potential than the show delivers.
I like post- apocalyptic genre, and this show has a good spin on the concept. Nothing so overwhelming that the characters cannot do some problem solving and still have something positive to look forward to.
I have always enjoyed &#34;end of the world as we know it&#34; movies.I like the actors, they come across as real people, but the script writing can be a stretch.Sometimes the acting is not believable.That said, the show has my attention and I will likely watch it through to the end.If this review is not clear, try comparing the acting and script of Walking Dead to that of Jericho, day & night.
England, 1519. King Henry VIII rules England and is beloved by his people. His wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, is popular and the king's chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, is able and formidable in administering the country and defeating plots against the throne. Another of Henry's advisors is Sir Thomas More, a man of great conscience and integrity whose respect and friendship the king values.However, it is a difficult time in Europe. The Lutheran heresy is raging unchecked in Germany and the Pope is unable to defeat it. King Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V are engaged in a deadly rivalry, both hoping to enlist England as an ally. With his queen - the Emperor's aunt - apparently unable to bear him a son, Henry also begins movements towards a divorce. When he falls in love with the beautiful Anne Boleyn, this matter becomes pressing and threatens a breakdown of relations with Rome.The Tudors is a television drama produced by the Showtime network and based on the life on Henry VIII, focusing on his relationships with his six wives and the political and religious turmoil that resulted. The first season covers a period of roughly eleven years, running from the accession of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor (in 1519) to the death of Cardinal Wolsey (in 1530). However, real historical events are compressed, combined or moved around in the timeline to read better as part of the drama. The contentious marriage of Charles Brandon to Henry's sister Mary Tudor (slightly confusingly changed to Margaret in the TV series) happened in 1515, but is moved to later on to create an interesting mid-season subplot, for example.The Tudors plays fast-and-loose with the details of real history, but like HBO's Rome before it, the show does succeed in getting across the events and complications of the period. The complexities of Henry's relationships with fellow European rulers and the Pope are recounted well, as is the seething tension within the English court. As a very rough introduction to the history of the period, The Tudors works, though those interested in the real events are referred to the many history books about the time.As drama and narrative, The Tudors is something of a mixed bag. The script is inclined towards the expositionary, with surprisingly little incidental flavour, and what there is is often questionable: a scene showing Henry VIII composing 'Greensleeves' is amusing but also cheesy and highly inaccurate (Henry VIII definitely did not write the music to the song and his authorship of the lyrics is questionable, at best). One of the strongest episodes in the season is the one where England is ravaged by disease, as it shows how Tudor England coped with such disasters and features more incidental scenes of life amongst the common folk than other episodes.The acting is mostly good, with the likes of Nick Dunning (Sir Thomas Boleyn) and Henzy Czerny (the Duke of Norfolk) providing able support. Henry Cavill (Charles Brandon and, more recently, the latest actor to play Superman) is good as one of Henry's few true friends, though he arguably may have made a better Henry VIII himself. Maria Doyle Kennedy gives an excellent performance as Catherine of Aragorn, mixing palpable fear and worry over not being able to give the king an heir with pride and anger at the thought of being set aside. Natalie Dormer is given the hard job of portraying Anne Boleyn, the woman a king plunged a nation into anarchy for, and almost pulls it off. She is hamstrung by the indifferent script, especially as the story skips large chunks of their courtship and the precise reasons for the king's fascination with her are left somewhat ambiguous: in the TV show she simply appears to play hard to get, fascinating the king who normally just has to nod his head to get a woman into bed with him. Given their seven-year courtship and the intensity of Henry's feelings towards her, this feels rather inadequate as an explanation.Central to this first season is Sam Neill, who plays Cardinal Wolsey with just the right mix of intelligence, political scheming and ruthless anger. Wolsey is presented as something of an antagonistic figure, but he is also shown to be a caring family man (Wolsey had a wife and two children) and to be utterly devoted to the king. As Wolsey repeatedly fails to get the annulment Henry wants, he becomes more desperate and Neill portrays Wolsey's descent with passion and intensity. Neill is possibly the highlight of the first season. Jeremy Northam also gives an excellent performance as Sir Thomas More, highlighting both More's well-known piety, intelligence and integrity but also his darker side, such as his commitment to burning heretics and Protestants at the stake.Where the series falters - and it's quite a big misstep - is the casting of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in the central role of Henry VIII. Eight years prior to The Tudors, Rhys-Meyers had played the coldly cunning role of Steerpike in the BBC's adaptation of Gormenghast, and bizarrely he seems to be playing Henry VIII in much the same manner. The real Henry VIII is noted for his charisma and vivaciousness, his force of personality sweeping up those around him. Whilst Rhys-Meyers certainly nails the king's intelligence, confidence and raging temper when thwarted, his performance is also often cold, desperate and occasionally whiny. I can understand the idea of subverting the traditional image of the fat, middle-aged Henry VIII by showing him as a young man in the prime of life, but Rhys-Meyers simply fails to get across the complexities of the real historical figure.Fortunately, this is not quite as disastrous as it might be supposed: The Tudors may be about Henry VIII, but the series follows those around him more than the monarch himself, and the emphasis is on the court and period as a whole rather than on the one man by himself.From a technical viewpoint, the series is well-directed. The use of CGI to flesh out the castles and stately homes of England is interesting and rather ahead of its time (and makes up for the fact that the show was filmed in Ireland, with limited or no access to some of the real locations portrayed in the series), though also sometimes distracting. Early in the season we have relatively brief camera shots of locations that try not to dwell on their computer-generated nature. Later in the season we have rather distracting rapid camera movements and broad shots of locations which are clearly CGI and artificial (and whilst the CGI is good for 2007 and the show's limited budget, it's still not great), creating a bit of a dissonance once we switch to the live-action scenes.The first season of The Tudors (***) is flashy, fun and enjoyable but also lightweight. The lack of historical accuracy is not a major problem - the show at least portrays the real events, if not always in the right order or with the correct details - though the uncharismatic performance of the lead actor and a sometimes indifferent and flavourless script certainly are. Luckily, most of the other actors are excellent and as a rough introduction to the time period and events, the show does work.
If you are entertained by a scheming, self-centered, sex maniac, this is your series.  Not sure if this was over-done to sell the series or some sort of dramatically correct portal of the reality of the times.
It's a good show that has a LOT of sexual content. I'm just wondering if it's all needed? Other than that it would get another star. And for the record....I'm not a prude. Far from it. I just think the show doesn't need all of the sex scenes.
Engrossing and spectacularly produced, to be enjoyed as entertainment, not history, as it contains many errors of fact. For instance, the writers throw in a couple of completely fabricated homosexual affairs, seemingly just for the hell of it. And a fabricated murder of a royal, married to the (historically) wrong princess. And some of the timelines are messed up. And the series starts with the murder of someone who wasn't murdered. And completely wrong on a suicide and someone going crazy.But, due to its contemporary feel, it succeeds in getting the viewer interested in this period of history, if nothing more than to check up on its accuracy.
Casting could have been better here, as could some of the acting.  The music is nothing great either, and I don't care much for the fellow playing Henry.  The first season drags out all the business with Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, and Thomas Wolsey, also.The costumes and locations are wonderful, and there is some entertainment to be had.  Apparently the history is inaccurate, though I can't really comment on that since I am not that familiar with the era and people involved.Okay for a cheap rental, but nobody needs to purchase this.
I ordered this product and did not receive it; this review is from the uncut televised edition, which(I presume) is the same as the DVD.The theme, as with so many themes in 1950-1970 comedies, is a mild slapstick farce where a man's devotion to marriage is challenged.  Bob Hope is loyal to his wife but a misdialing of the phone gets him mixed up with a sexy movie starlet(played pefectly by Elke Sommer).  The rumor at the time in Hollywood is that Hope had requested to make this film with her as co-star.  I can't confirm that, but seeing the film, you could understand if he did.The film is pretty amusing and if you are a Bob Hope (or, to be honest, Elke Sommer) fan, then grab this.  Phyllis Diller is his "co-pilot" and, as always, puts in a perfect performance too.
The Bob Hope MGM Legends Collection contains seven of the funny man's films, spanning over two decades of Hope's illustrious screen career.  Bob Hope (1903-2003) got his start in vaudeville, and enjoyed a successful career in radio and on the stage, and became a huge star in film and on television.  In the movies, Hope's style was usually characterized by fast talking, witty repartee, and generally being light on his feet.  After teaming with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, in The Road To Singapore (1940), the first of the seven "Road" pictures, Hope's career elevated to new heights.In chronological order, the films in this collection are They've Got Me Covered (1943), The Princess and the Pirate (1944), Alias Jesse James (1959), The Facts of Life (1960), The Road to Hong Kong (1962), I'll Take Sweden (1965), and Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966).  A quick summary of the films follows:They've Got Me Covered (3.5 stars)Set in Washington D.C. during World War II, Hope plays a newspaper reporter who is on the trail of some Axis agents who are trying to implement a nefarious plan.  Dorothy Lamour co-stars.The Princess and the Pirate (3.5 stars)Bob plays an entertainer on a ship bound for America, who gets tangled up with a princess (Virginia Mayo), when the ship is captured by pirates.Alias Jesse James (3 stars)Set in the American West, Hope is an insurance salesman who sells Jesse James (Wendell Corey) a life insurance policy, and then has to try and make sure that no harm comes to the infamous outlaw.The Facts of Life (4 stars)Comedic legend Lucille Ball co-stars with Bob in this sensitive and funny drama about marriage, love, and fidelity.  Not to be missed.The Road to Hong Kong (2.5 stars)The final installment in the "Road" series finds Hope and partner Bing Crosby involved in an out of this world escapade, as Russians agents send the pair on a rocket trip to the moon.  Joan Collins co-stars.I'll Take Sweden (3 stars)Hope is a father worried that his daughter (Tuesday Weld) may marry the wrong guy.  He takes her to Sweden to derail her wedding plans, but once there, both father and daughter find romance heating up.Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966) (3.5 stars)Elke Sommer plays a starlet looking to get away from it all, who gets a misrouted telephone call from a real estate salesman (Hope), which instigates a kooky escapade that threatens to break up two marriages.These seven films illustrate that while Bob Hope's unique comic style evolved through the years, in many respects, it remained essentially the same.  Ranging from Westerns, to swashbuckling tales, to wartime adventures, to the close of the Crosby era, to coming to terms with the beatnik generation, the affable guy with the quick wit, endless quips, and ski slope nose was there to entertain.  As this set has apparently gone out of production, getting a copy may unfortunately be a difficult and expensive proposition.Due to a glitch at Amazon, this set and the film Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number are linked as being the same product, so this review is listed for both products.
Saw the series on tv a few years back and decided we'd forgotten and missed enough episodes to re-watch the series.
Absolutely loved Season 1.  For me, Season 2 is the same plot over and over, continuing from Season 1.  The characters haven't developed much past Season 2.  Although I enjoyed Season 2, I probably won't buy anymore of the Eureka DVD's due to the repetitiveness. Overall, the idea of a town full of genius scientists is so cool!  I was hoping for a bit more innovation of the plot line because the idea of the show is wonderful and entertaining and because this show has so many great reveiws.
good enough to watch / have on in the background. Would be 10 billion times better without the Max Headroom idiot (Matthew George "Matt" Frewer) (what kind of idiot named Matthew needs Matt w/in quotes w/in his name, now if his name was Matthew George "the Dork" Frewer it would all make sense). The guy has the worst fake Australian accent ever & is horrible trying to be crocodile Dundee. Luckily the dum dum is only in about 5% of the scenes.
Saving Grace is the show I love to hate. The main character, Grace Hanadarko is a completely unlikable character with very few redeeming qualities. She is in a down spiral into self destruction (and hell) and she does everything in her power to hasten it. A cop, Grace has many inner demons. She is very promiscuous and uses sex and alcohol to escape her inner demons. Sex, adultery, alcohol and violence, that is Grace's life. She is a good cop though and, although a bit violent on the job and an affair with her married partner, she has an interesting sense of justice and a desire to get the criminals.One night, while drunk driving, Grace hits a man and in a moment of desperation asks God for help. Well, God answers in the form of Earl, her own Guardian Angel, her last chance at redemption. Well, Earl is far from the traditional angel with wings, he is a scruffy looking, tobacco-spitting, and rather sketchy looking angel. He tells Grace she is headed straight to hell and that this is her last chance. Earl provides Grace with guidance and clues to something that she has to figure out (the big reveal of the season). Through Earl and the rest of the cast, we delve into the inner psyche and past of Grace, a deeply troubled and scarred woman that has suffered through many things including the death of her sister (Oklahoma bombings).Grace's self destruction is even more interesting when we learn that her brother is a priest, her sister is a perfectionist and a bit OCD stay at home mom and her best friend (San Giacomo) is the voice of reason in more ways than one and offers unconditional support. The way all these characters are contrasted against Grace provides a very interesting view of Grace herself and whether she will straighten out. Although I dislike the show and I dislike Grace, one must admire the multi-layered and complex character that Holly Hunter plays with perfection. Truly, her acting skills shine through and although I hate the show, I can't help but watch. It is just like those reality TV shows that you really don't wanna watch, but can't help doing so.
I kind of like this show, but it never really grabbed me.  Still I did watch 2 seasons of it.
I think the first two seasons are my favorites by far.  There are some excellent moments in Season three; however, I think it became more of a drama than what it had been in the previous two seasons.  Unlike Babylon 5, it is clear that Battlestar didn't have an overarching direction.  Great writing, but....
I'm arriving a little late to this party... had started watching the re-imagined series when it started on the Sci-Fi channel, but lost track.  Over the past year I have started to pick back up from where I left off and I am not pleased.  While I love the concept of the new Battlestar Galactica, loved the earlier character development and the backdrop, I found the end of season 2.5 and the entire 3rd season to literaly be all over the place and disjointed.  The careful crafting of a story so elquently done in both the pilot episode and season 1 are no where to be found towards the end of season 2.5 or 3.  As the show has progressed it has become a very simply written, spiritual, religious mess and the characters are not as cohesively developed as they once were.  The writers must have changed.  I've got a bad feeling about season 4...Not total trash, but certainly not what the pilot episode or season 1 were.  Such a shame!
The first two seasons were so great, there had to be a "letdown" season. Don't get me wrong, season 3 is good, just not compared to sea.1 & 2.  The first 2 seasons were just OUTSTANDING science fiction at its best.  Still worth owning in your dvd library.
This was a memorable season for the show, revealing a lot of tension.  I am not sure, however, how satisfying it was.  Yes, I'm giving the season three stars and they produced quality work.  However, while I am enjoying the events, I'm not sure that I'm enjoying the characters.  I find myself in the odd position of not being sure if humanity -- as represented by the main characters -- is worth saving.  All of these people are deeply flawed.  I don't feel actual respect for any of them.  Of course, they are in a situation like none in which I have been, so perhaps I'm being overly harsh.Battlestar Galactica is a decent show.  The actors for the most part do their jobs well and the individual stories are interesting.  I'm just finding myself questioning whether I should be rooting for the enemy... or for anyone at all.
This years' series is not as good as previous years. Bought it thinking that it would be.
I was interested at first because it grabbed me into it....but then soon found out with it starting backwards in story got to be boring. Each character seemed to be defined in detail made me lose interest.  I soon began to know what would most likely happen next per series and then did not care to watch.
The Good Wife has become a traitor, we always thought she held to some kind of loyalty standard to the firm. I turned it off two weeks, doubt that I will watch anymore. Too bad, what are they reaching for, they had enough plots going, I think they have ruined the show.
This is supposed to be a legal drama about a class action lawsuit. But rather than lawyers, all the characters are basically gangsters on both sides of the case. Glenn Close gives an extraordinary performance and Rose Byrne does better than expected, but the story and script really let them down.At the heart of the story is basically a lifted-from-Enron case where the employees of a bankrupt company are going after its former CEO. But its a superficial resemblence because whoever wrote the script understood little about such matters.Ted Danson drags the whole piece down. Since Glenn Close is playing an evil character, Danson's character has to be played as arch-evil. Mustache twirling evil. And Danson delivers an astonishly stupid broadly drawn evil character. And he is probably close to what Danson imagines every non-Hollywood CEO to being. Danson goes out of his way to make sure that there is no possible way to have any sympathy for rich Mr. businessman. And thats really the only way for the story to work given that Glenn Close is playing a gangster.For a series about the law, there is very little "law" in it and what law it has is done unimaginatively. They never get beyond the depositions. They never follow anything like the timeline of a real case. And why not. To the main characters, law is a distraction. If lawyers spent time on legal matters, when would they have time all the gangster stuff: Hiding and killing witnesses, blackmailing the opposing lawyer, spying, stealing, witness intimidation, bribing prosecutors, containing the ambitions of the underbosses and so on. The character Glenn Close somewhat resembles is the lawyer Sean Penn played in the film "Carlito's way".One of the core problems with the Glenn Close character is that her word means nothing. Every deal she makes, she goes back on. A stand alone character can work like that. But not someone running a law firm. Any organization runs on a certain level of trust. A lawyer operating within the profession depends on a certain level of trust. If she was going to act like that, she needed in the context of the show to keep herself innocent and to preserve her image at all costs.The series would have been more interesting if it had been more realistic and if both sides in the case had been shades of grey. And to cover all the stages of a case: (1) Selling the client to take you on as a lawyer (2) figuring out a strategy(3) depositions and discovery, (4) negotiating over a settlement (5) Witness prep (5) jury selection (6) the trial.The combination of amoral gangster lawyer and ruthless crusader for justice also really doesn't work. Every time Glenn Close starts to talks about "victims", it comes across as totally false.By the end of the season, they have started walking down the sad road toward making excuses for Glenn Close's behavior. Dead baby drama in a cemetary is an incredibly cheap way to drum up sympathy.This is another of those things where the potential and most of the actors end up being greater than the script that they were given.
If you like to watch a group of awful people lying and doing awful things to each other, then this is one for you. It's hard to find anybody to like in this show. Add that to a bizarre editing style that keep jumping around in time previewing what is to happen in the future -- then jumping to the past? Where's the present?Lots of character and plot manipulation to keep the story going to the point of ridiculousness.The acting is very good and the casting very good, just a hateful story.It being a serial, I got sucked in and slugged it out finishing 2 seasons, but the ending of the 2nd season didn't even make sense, other than, incredulously, setting up for more seasons. I was so glad to not look at Glen Close' face anymore, that it was a relief that it was over. Out of complete boredom, I may take a peak at the 3rd season, if nothing else, to see how the heck they will try to patch the absurd ending to season 2.
With the cast it could have been better. I think the direction and writing made this rather a long drawn out negative show. Not one bit of light at the end of the tunnel and pretty much ambition and greed leading the way...Washington DC all the way. I get enough of this lovely life on the news. Do not consider it entertaining when it is being played out in our lives. But hey that is just me, you may love it.
You know how The Wire: The Complete Series starts out slow but in the end everything comes together and you realize that you've watched the greatest show on television? This is the opposite case. Call it theTrue Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)effect. Every episode is exciting and drives the show forward. Every episode has something cool that keeps you watching to the next one. And the title sequence? VERY cool.Yet when it's over, you'll feel like you've just wasted 13 hours. It's not so much that the whole thing falls apart at the end due to the stupid denouement of the major mystery (although the answer as to why Rose Byrne comes into a police station all bloody with a dead boyfriend in her bathtub is very stupid) but also because once it's over all of the missteps in the piece become glaringly obvious. When you are watching it, you just enjoy Glen Close and Ted Danson at their crazy manipulative best. Glen Close is in pure bunny-boiling evil form (and she does kill the dog) and Ted Danson is like a version of Sam gone to pot without conscience. The games that these two (and Danson's lawyer) play to one up each other are particularly amusing and convoluted.Sadly, once it's over the plot holes become way too obvious. A simple malfeasance case is probably too dull to sustain an entire show, but in one episode, Glen Close manipulates one of her own witnesses to lie in deposition in order to ruin her case and make the Danson camp think that they are winning. In another episode Close kills a dog which I believe might be problematic even for lawyers. And Ted Danson openly talking to one of the people suing him in order to manipulate the lawsuit is just dumb all around. And if we enjoy watching Glen Close be evil, why do the writers think that we need to see her crying like at the end ofDangerous LiaisonsBut really, the entire thing falls on Rose Byrne's tiny shoulders and Rose Byrne is just not up to the task. Yes, she's supposed to be a naive lawyer just out of law school but most of the time she comes off as utterly stupid. When her assistant ruins all of her appointments and messes up her day, she has to wait the entire episode to fire him. And it's supposed to be some kind of fall from grace when she's no longer a nice person. Partially it's the problem of the scripts. She is supposed to be naive, but most of the time the scripts make her act like an utter idiot. But mostly, it's Rose Byrne's fault. When Glen Close is telling her that she admires her because she is very shrewd, well there's nothing all that shrewd about her. Even though, it's obvious that she's been hired in order to get to a witness, there's nothing about her acting that suggests that she's anything other than a vacant and pretty face to be manipulated. This is Mary Sue characterization at it's worse. She has nothing to offer, yet everyone claims that she offers the world. And if this is a woman who comes from hardscrabble circumstances who clawed her way to the top of her law school class and can turn down a 130K starting salary, we SHOULD believe that she's actually intelligent and shrewd and just as much of a force of nature as Glen Close. She SHOULD be Glen Close's chaacter in process.Instead she's just dumb. Sure, it's fun watching Glen Close push her around and play with her like a tiger playing with a bunny rabbit; but if the script is telling us that she's this amazing lawyer learning how to be a manipulative powerhouse, then that potential should be obvious. Yet it's not. And that's why overall, this thing fails.I'd recommend buying it if you watched a few episodes and liked it, but be prepared to be disappointed. Fortunately it's TV, not HBO so it's reasonably priced.
First off, what happened to Barek & Carver? I know the actors left the show, but there was no explanation given at any time as to why their characters vanished from the series. Barek & Carver were the perfect foils to Logan and Goren/Eames. That is partly why I'm giving this season III stars instead o the usual V. The other part stems from my disgust at the fourth episode. Seeing the particular class type of people in that episode portrayed sympathetically just nauseated me. aside from that episode and the unexplained departure of Barek & Carver, it was overall a good season. And having seen Bogosian before as a villain in Under Siege 2, I really hated his character in the first few episodes, but eventually, I sort of began to even lioke the moron, even though my dislike of him resurfaced in one or two of the final episodes. and why wasn't there a second episode to the one with whoopi cushion?
Maybe these are all starting to run together for me, or maybe it's just that I was lukewarm to this particular season, but I just didn't find it as watchable as the majority of the other seasons.  It is the eighth year, and that's a high mark when it comes to ideas and plot-lines.Law and Order SVU is about the special cases.  Those cases of rape, child abuse, and elder abuse that typically deal with hard to face victims and emotional tragedy.  They're hard to watch, but because of a generally stellar cast it has become one of the most popular series out there. While you don't have to watch the season in order, it is good to at least try because there's a bit of background on the detectives that you could miss out on otherwise.  But the episodes are primarily stand-alone, with each resolving by the end of the episode.There were a few stand out episodes in this season.  "Confrontation" takes a horrible fear of rape, and multiplies it by having the rapist come back again and again for insidious purposes.  "Scheherazade" has a killer telling a tale, but drawing it out to elude his own death.  But with these episodes come a bunch that after watching the first time, I just skip over them when I rewatch the season.  And those are the episodes near the end that involve Benson's half brother plot.  I know they were trying to twist things around but it just didn't grip me and I thought her tale better when she didn't family ties.  At least the last episode had some pretty big cliffhangers, making you wonder what was going to happen and eager for the next season.Characters:Christopher Meloni as Det. Elliot StablerMariska Hargitay as Det. Olivia BensonRichard Belzer as Det. John MunchIce-T as Det. Fin TutuolaDiane Neal as ADA Casey NovakB. D. Wong as Dr. George HuangTamara Tunie as Dr. Melinda WarnerDann Florek as Capt. Don CragenConnie Nielsen as Det. Dani BeckAdam Beach as Det. Chester LakeThe original cast of characters are all here, but there are a few more that had a considerable amount of time in this season.  Nielsen as Detective Dani Beck replaces Hargitay in the first half of the season.  While she was ok, she wasn't as good as Hargitay, and it was a relief to see her come back.  Meloni too just didn't have the chemistry with Nielsen like he does with Hargitay and so his performances weren't as moving as they normally are.  Belzer and Ice-T continue to play a secondary role and had an average amount of screentime when compared to the other seasons.  I did like the few roles played by Beach as Detective Chester Lake.  He had a calming presence about him that I enjoyed.This series is not for the faint of heart and especially not this season.  There is violence, staged scenes of rape, abuse and other harsh topics that not all will want to see.  But the show is gritty and tries to be realistic so it could be hard for some people.  The majority of the camerawork is on the detectives but they do have to process the crimes so at least one time in every episode, there's something tragic to see.Not the best of the seasons but I'll certainly keep watching.  When it's been around this long there's a reason for it, and I know the series can certainly improve to its former glory again.Review by M. Reynard 2013
I do enjoy this show, but it would have to group it among my guilty pleasures. The tone is somewhat uneven and the show does fail to provide those moments that will make you have to watch the next week. A bit campy at times, which does help overall, I'll be interested to see if the second season is any better than the first.
I like the scripts but am not sure about the lead actor..sometimes I like his acting but I think it would be betterif he was a little more sarcastic. I know he has gottenvery wise in mind and body but with knowledge comes asense of humor and I would love to see him go just a littlebit more into what he is hinting at now...just a little more sarcasticafter all he has earned that no matter how grounded he hasbecome...The scripts are full of it I just wish he would take a littlemore advantage with the delivery..It needs that ZING!!! Forgiving isfine but complacent is just too much to ask..I'm thinking..But that's just me..
the lead character is definitely different and at times I don't think all of his elevators are on the same floor, But it isn't bad and a good alternative to the same old, same old stuff they put on TV
Not as good as I anticipated, probably since I saw Homeland first.  Still watching season 1 so maybe things will get better.
The lead character is interesting with his enlightened view of life.  The episodes drag a little with not very good writing.
For a pilot this was great.  I need to see more of it to decide if i will really like the series or not but I suspect the show will make it through it's first season.It is entertaining and interesting definitely worth a watch and a look at the second episode.
This is a good show, just not really moving. It is a good who dunnit for anyone to watch. Nice show.
Very average. Not very interesting at times. A lot of eye candy gets thrown in t keep your attention as the plot very slowly unfolds.
The question is "Did We Really Need to Rebuild Her?" After watch all eight episodes of this Bionic Woman remake, I say NO!This last TV season NBC choose to remake the Bionic Woman for the 2000's. In trying to gain success like Sci-Fi Channel had the other 1970's remake  Battlestar Galactica, The producers took a gritter style...and It failed on many levels.As lovely as Michelle Ryan is, she is NO Lindsay Wagner. Ms Ryan tries to give this piece heart. The Character , a bartender , is given her bionics after an auto accident with her Government surgeon boyfriend.  She is saddled her with a felony kid sister (Lucy Hale) who was dumped on her when their father disappeared. Ryan is one of the reason's to watch this show.However, the heart of the show is buried deep within sub plots of the previous sort of Evilish bionic woman Sarah (Katee Sackhoff from the remake Of Gallatica) and ideas of double crossing people that seemed to be ripped off from old ALIAS plots. This new Woman is told is a soap opera form, which weaken this piece.The highlight of the show after Ryan  is Miguel Ferrer as the mysterious  Jonas. He plays a tough as nails agency boss, better than Richard Anderson ever played Oscar Goldman. His stone cold demeanor works well in this character, better than he did in Crossing Jordan (which season one is coming on DVD soon)The funnest thing about this new Bionic Woman. She  has $50,000 dollars worth of bionics parts, up from the 1970's amount of six million..inflation, inflation, inflation!I am sadden that only eight episodes (which are all presented here) were made of this series before the writer's strike of TV season 2007-2008. It had promise, but we may never know if it could have developed. NBC Network  has not stated if this show has been renewed for the next season. So these eight episodes may be the only  episodes of this seriesI can only wish that someone would release the classic Six Million Dollar man or the original Bionic woman on DVD...Now that was great television!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
This is typical filler for those times when there is nothing else to present on TV. This is a standard soap opera with a few not to many quasi-sci-fi visions sprinkled in with no logic.Michelle Ryan is cute but there are a lot of cute actresses. I wish her luck in finding a vehicle with redeeming social value and not this mindless rehash of old plots.
So why would they leave her disadvantaged with only one arm, eye and ear Bionic? Yes, both her legs are bionic, but as long as they had her on the table why not do the job right? Especially compared to Sarah's obvious superiority.
I remember the bionic woman from many years ago and I guess it didn't compare to the original but I enjoyed it and was a little disappointed that it was cancelled
This re-make of the classic series Bionic Woman is not as wretched as some would like to say. Overall it suffers from a slightly dull athmosphere, and it is true that the writing could have been tighter but the acting is rather good and the effects are first-rate even if they are somewhat in the background. So the story is quite simple, underachieving bartender Jamie Summers is almost killed during an accident and re-built by her experimental-surgeon boyfriend. Afterwards it is quite straightforward. But as I wrote it is not as bad as some other reviewers put it.
As a fan of the original Bionic Woman, I am appalled by the liberties taken by the writers in this show. First of all, they have completely altered the story of Jamie Summers, the original Bionic Woman. The story presented in the series is COMPLETELY different. I don't undertand why they didn't just change her name.Second, the acting of Michelle Ryan is not the best. Still, I do think she is doing the best she can with what she has been given. But, she displays no emotion, barely any tears when crying. Her face looked completely emotionless when her fiance died or when she was at his funeral. The show just doesn't deal with her emotions. They have concentrated so much in the action and the lines that they have forgotten an important part of television, facial expressions and body language. The younger sister seems to be the only one displaying an emotional range in the show.The show is not that cohesive. They do not explain certain things. Why was the sister sentenced(?) or prohibited from using computers? The show just doesn't tie in things together.The show has a very nice visual style (hence my rating of 3 stars) and I think it has some potential, but a lot of things have to be fixed. These facilities, very low budget by the way, where she trains have really bad security and look like a basement. They should vamp up these settings and make them more hi-tech. The plotlines and the writing should deal more with how Jamie feels about all of this. She took everything so matter of fact (except for the initial screaming after her operation). Someone needs to wake her up and say "Woman, you are Bionic! React! I would also like to know how she knows all these fighting techniques. Was some computer implanted into her head? I mean, she did not train for that long!In conclusion, the show has a lot of things that need fixing. And the first thing should be for Michelle Ryan to start showing some emotion and act better.
Interesting remake of the original...The Pilot was ok...nothing special, nothing great...to me having "Starbuck" in the series beginning is not a real draw after having to endure Battlestar Gafartica remake with her in it...Other than that, the episode didnt really do much.  Im guessing this series wont last much longer than its predecesor unless they really vamp up the whole concept.Hope you folks like it...
A new show with great potential, but I'll need to see more clarity in the future stories since this one gave bits & pieces of many things to come.  As long as some of the mysteries and/or underlying stories start to come together in an overall idea, then I'll be watching.  Otherwise, just another remake that didn't quite make it.  We'll hope for the best.
they jumped the story to far from reality eliminate the things that made Bionics and reinvented it as something else and added bizzare plot twist that didn't really make sense.  If you were a big fan of the original this one may disappoint; still special effects are of course better as tech has improved but that's about it.
I was looking forward to this show... I've always enjoyed the shows about time travel.  But I still don't understand what causes him to go back in time.... if it was explained I missed it.There were some clues that I guess were too subtle for me to catch as they happened, and I only 'got it' at the end of the show... Is that what they were going for?  Anyway.. I will probably watch one more episode, and then if it isn't any better I'll pass....
This is obviously a minority opinion here, but I was not especially high on Season One of THE BIG BANG THEORY.  I first have to confess that sitcoms are my dead bottom least favorite genre of show.  I barely make room for HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, but all in all it is a format that I find pretty dreadful, on the same level of reality and talent shows and crime procedurals.  I hate the limitations of the camera work, the lack of character development, and -- the worst invention in the history of television -- the laugh track.  Moreover, Season One of TBBT did not get the formula quite right.  Much of it was that they hadn't sufficiently found ways to soften Sheldon's character, who can at times be very funny but at other times -- especially in this season -- be excruciatingly irritating.Season Two saw a number of subtle alterations of the show, mainly softening Sheldon, but also increasing the dynamics between the various characters.  But Season One felt slightly off to me.  I can't help but contrast it somewhat with HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.  The latter almost acknowledges the limitations of the format and constantly stretches it, including a pretty large number of exterior shots on the Warner Brothers lot.  The show also uses their laugh track much more lightly than TBBT.  Both shows suffer from too small of a cast (a common problem with sitcoms).  The  best comedies are not sitcoms, don't have laugh tracks, are not restricted to sound stages, and have large ensemble casts (cf. MODERN FAMILY, 30 ROCK, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, PARTY DOWN, early SCRUBS, and THE OFFICE).On the other hand, it is fun seeing a show with lots of nerd references.  Plus, I've actually known a couple of people who were geniuses along the line of Sheldon (though I should say that perhaps my greatest nerd moment was that when I worked in the University of Chicago Bookstore -- before it became a Barnes & Noble -- Chandrasekhar would always do a beeline to me to get help finding books [hey, having a world class genius -- another Nobel Prize winning physicist told me that in his opinion Chandrasekhar would rank as one of the two great twentieth century physicists after Einstein -- acknowledge your competence on books, even as a lowly book clerk, and nod to you as you walk across the campus may be a faint form of achievement, but if you don't understand this you don't understand the guys on TBBT]).  And as a comic book lover it is fun seeing a show with a lot of references to comics (though they seem to be limited entirely to superhero comics, while that makes up only part of my interest in comics).  But all of this was not quite enough to overcome the sitcom limitations, the laugh track, and irritating way that Sheldon was written in Season One.  The good news is that Season Two represented a huge improvement.  It still isn't among my favorite shows (no sitcom ever could be), but it is one that I will continue to DVR after having caught up on DVD.
Overall Prison Break was a very good show. Show title could have been better. This season they are put in a prison in another country and have to break someone out. Not a good season at all. Prison was boring and a lot of the new players were boring. Putting them back in prison was not a good idea. Had a shocking moment and some good points but not a great season weakest of the 4. Buy only if you like the show.
The DVD arrived on time; however, the item is a bit messes up.  I has trouble getting the DVD'S to start playing.  The DVD is slightly damaged.
The outcome of Scofield's plans are becoming far to predictable, not to mention annoying. The ongoing blunder's remind me all too much of the CTU in "24". I still like most of the folks involved in the story so that helps keep me interested. Hoping for some closure in season four, but fear more mistakes and bad decisons will weaken the storyline.
because, as one of the extra bits shows the storyline was starting to take a very dark turn. Another complaint I have is the introduction of several new characters, never to be heard from in following seasons. Claire Benet.'s flying boyfriend?, watch him here- he's not in 3rd season, no explanation. Wasn't the son of Ali Larter's character named Micah?, his Black relatives are introduced here, not one word about any of them next season.I have a feeling that if this season had gone full length the series might've had an even shorter run.
It's truely unfortunate how quickly this show took a nose-dive after such an excellent first season. This is easily the worst season of Heroes, but to fair this is due to the writer's strike and their best writer from the first season leaving; he returns for the forth season but it's too late to save the show. Having said all that there's still some great progression with the main characters and a fair amount of interesting new characters that works well within season 2. If you're only a casual fan of the show I'd recommend skipping this one, as it doesn't really tie much into the rest of the series aside from a few details, and only purchase the first season, but if you're a pretty big fan then get all of them since there's only four seasons.
Heroes Season 2 is not as good as Season 1 due to the writer's strike. It would have likely been the end of the show if they didn't move a head with Season 2, but the show did suffer some. There are a lot reviews for Heroes Season 2 that point out the many flaws and give spoilers, so I don't need to do that here. My only observation is that the some of characters acted completely... well out of character, and a lot of plot devices were used to move the weaker plot lines along. If Season 1 wasn't as good as it was, this Season would not have been so disapointing.Still all of that said, you need to watch Season 2 to get to Season 3, so recommended for the Heroes fan.
I love the concept for this show. Instead of superheros with superpowers dressing up in tights to save the world, Heroes features a bunch of ordinary citizens who have superpowers - and face the consequences. These characters each have unique powers and each copes with the powers in his or her unique way. The show had a lot of potential for character development and moral allegory.I think the show partly succeeds in the former. Some of the characters become quite interesting and unique. However, unfortunately, too many of the characters are too milquetoast. It's as if in not wanting to make the characters comic book superheroes the show makes them boring. I think this was the wrong direction. Too many of these characters would have been interchangeable with your average soap opera character with little difference, except for the flying, electricity, etc.Where the show really disappointed me is the story. There was a lot of potential, but the writers chose to go with the usual tropes of 1) a secret corporate conspiracy, and 2) a psychopathic villain. I for one am sick of these. In recent years it seems like most sci-fi shows have adopted one or both of these tropes. Few of the episodes provide particularly thoughtful plots. I didn't ever find myself thinking that the show raised a particularly interesting or novel moral issue. Too bad.Season 2 actually was better in some ways than Season 1. I loved Hiro's "hero's quest." Hiro is one of the few characters I've come to care about. He provides a wonderful mix of humor and thoughtfulness. Kristen Bell's psychotic Elle was also a nice addition. She's one of the few characters who has the potential to develop into a larger, more interesting personality.However, Season 2 suffers from a lack of focus. There's no ticking bomb or the equivalent. Sylar is still around, hitchhiking and the like, but he's not the main threat. I like the idea of a slower season, but this season just went slow nowhere. Even worse, Sylar is just getting annoying. He's lost his powers, but the other characters still can't seem to kill him. This is partly because they are incredibly dumb. Several characters see Sylar distracted, and then proceed to announce their presence and warn Sylar of the risk. Note to superheroes: when you're facing an incredibly dangerous super being, stealth is good. Sneak up on him and shoot. Don't give him a chance to shoot first. A few too many moments like this one for Sylar and the other villains just reduce the respect viewers have for the heroes.Overall, I'd give it 3 stars. Good for what it is, but it becomes tiresome after a while.
Season 1 of Heroes was very good, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories about superheroes.  Season 2, well..  I first saw it years back - renting it from a big-box rental place.  Recently,  I picked it up cheap.  The season suffered from the writers' strike, which hurt a lot of shows at the time, even killed some, and gave us a pile of reality shows.  In the case of Heroes, season 2 got clipped to only 11 episodes, so whatever the writers originally planned to do with this season got derailed.  In spite of all this, they did manage to tell some mostly coherent stories.  The season also adds a lot of new characters, which may or may not be a good thing.  Plus, on top of the Hiro story (told in Japanese), we now get the Maya and Alejandro story (told in Spanish), so the show is hard to watch while playingThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Game of the Year EditionNot a complete waste of money if you can get it for less than 10 bucks (including shipping and handling.)
While season 2 turned out to be the weak point of the series it was far from being terrible.  The first season gave us the introduction of the hero characters and their individual stories and plots for why they did what they did,  the second and the rest of the season gave us more on the superhero plotline stories rather then the secret identity story plot it felt like.  While there are a few characters who felt they weren't needed it didn't detract from the enjoyment I got from watching the show, and for the price the set is going for right now I feel it's forgivable especially since this is the shortest season of the four seasons the show as on the air.  The video and audio are great with nice clarity and sound especially as you hear the background sound.  So again while this wasn't the greatest season it's still and enjoyable enough season to add to your dvd library anyway considering what the price for the set is going for it's a pretty reasonable bargain....
There are still plenty of things to like in Season 2:  the return to TV of Kristen Bell, Star Trek alumni Nichelle Nichols and George Takei in guest roles, the adorable Micah, likeable Ando, and the relationship among Matt, Molly, and the Doc, as well as the Petrelli brothers and their conniving mother.The problems:  the storylines about the virus are a pale echo of the final season of the 4400; Hiro's trip to the past should not have been so dull; there's a lot of tragedy, violence, and angst without the humor and to joy to balance them out.  And what Hiro did to Adam Monroe is inexcusable.
PLEASE NOTE: Reviews are opinions. The purpose of the reviews are to HELP those who haven't seen the show decide whether or not they want to purchase/read/watch/listen to something. That's what the voting is for NOT if you agree or disagree with the reviewer. If you disagree-write a review. The comments section IS for those who want to disagree.The second season of "Heroes" stumbled with its story arc involving Hiro traveling back in time to feudal Japan. FYI, that subplot IS tied into the main plot of the second season. The focus here is on the Shanti Virus a concoction that can take away someone's powers but IS often lethal. There is also someone targeting those who were involved in the founding of "The Company". As with "Lost" the introduction of new characters was problematic--fans were more interested in finding out what happened to their favorites from season one. The show recovers somewhat by midset unfortunately the show was interrrupted by the Writer's Guild strike. I have no doubt that the second half of the second season would have made up for the stumbling start of season two based on what we find out in the extras but that didn't happen.The show looks extremely good in its DVD presentation. The extras are quite good as well which does make up for the diminished quality of the show. We get 11 commentary tracks. I haven't had time to listen to more than one or two of them but they are pretty good. If I'm not mistaken these are the audio versions of the video commentaries that were available on the "Heroes" website.A couple of the featurettes included here were also on the webiste. The most effective and interesting ones here are the preview of season three (which has some minor spoilers so you may want to wait to watch it if you want to be totally surprised)and a featurette that allows us to see how a series of scenes wer constructed."Heroes" still has tremendous potential and here's hoping that the third season "Villians" is an improvement over the second season. This is a good set but isn't as strong or as good as the first season of "Heroes".Rent it.
Originally the second season was supposed to be as long as the first (22 episodes), but thanks to the writers' strike we only got 15 episodes in the can. It shows as the series kind of ends abruptly.Some of the storylines are a bit forced. The whole Landry-Tyra relationship is fine but the circumstances are very very dramatic (I won't give anything away) and yet I found huge flaws in the storyline, especially with Landry's father being a cop.Lyla getting religion doesn't work for me at all and Tami's post-partum antics grate a lot.I felt the series veered too far away from football really in season two.Even the storyline of another school's football team, displaced by a tornado, having to share Dillon High School's facilities was very weak.The extras are typical deleted scenes and some commentary tracks on some episodes but the panel discussion at some TV festival with much of the cast is pretty good. Taylor Kitsch (who plays Tim Riggins) is classic with his answers. It is fun to get to know a bit about the real people behind the acting.
Warning!  There are some spoilers in this review.In the spring of 2007 it was reported that NBC had asked the producers of THE OFFICE to expand it permanently to a one-hour format.  Initially I thought this was a terrible idea, that the show would be irreparably weakened by expanding it to an hour.  Then I saw the Season Three DVDs with the deleted scenes and with so many really great deleted scenes, I though that perhaps it would be possible to expand it to an hour.  Now, however, I'm not so sure.  Especially after this last of the four one-hour episodes that start off Season Four.  As a half hour show, THE OFFICE almost always leaves you wanting more.  But as a one-hour show, it always seems to go on too long.  Like most of the four episodes starting off this season, this one just felt like it was over before it was over.I'm not saying that it would never be a good idea to have an hour-long episode.  The show has had some very good expanded episodes in the past.  But four in a row seems to have stretched the show further than it really wanted to go.  I'm actually looking forward to it going back to shorter episodes next week.This episode revolves largely around two major stories.  First, Michael's increasing money woes created by having Jan live with him without working any herself.  To help make a bit more money he takes a second fulltime job as a telemarketer.  The scenes showing him at his second job are the weakest in the episode and really do feel like padding to make the show go a full hour.  The other major story centers around Pam and Jim deciding to visit Dwight's bed and breakfast.  After three years of teaming together to play tricks on Dwight -- and indeed this visit starts off as a trick on Dwight -- they realize how deeply he is hurting because of his break up with Angela (caused by his killing her elderly but deeply beloved cat by putting him in her freezer) and make a couple of gestures to try and make him feel better.  For instance, they give his utterly dreadful B&B; a stellar review on the Internet.  I like the symmetry of Pam and Jim not being together for a long period of time during much of which Dwight and Angela had a hidden relationship.  And now that Jim and Pam are together, Angela and Dwight have broken up.I have no doubt that the show will get back on track, but to do so, the network needs to permanently commit to the show being only a half hour each week.
Good for the science and math lovers - kind of of like a NCIS with a math twist.  The first few seasons were the best because they were clean. Now they're involving too much sex and swearing for my taste - just trying to bring in a new audience, I think.
Season five is, well it's bad. It opens with what we think is Dinnozzo getting blown up, but Ducky see's that the body on he autopsy table never had the plague. Plus, the international arms dealer that everybody was after has disappeared, and the CIA wants to know where he's at. Finally Tony makes an entrance, and we gather that he had to blow his own cover with Jeanne, and tell her that he's an NCIS agent, and that he's after her father. And then magically, we get to the end of the episode. Jenny has all of a sudden turned into a rule breaker, step outside of the law type of character. We know she killed La grenoulle, and there is only one episode after this one. Where Tony has a hard time getting over Jeanne, since he actually fell in love with her. And then we don't get anything else for the rest of the season, as a matter of fact. I would have thought, that after going undercover, then being forced to reveal to your target's daughter that you're a federal agent, and that you really love her. I would have thought that have made him a bit more mature, but nooooo. Instead we get one episode, then it's back to the freshman in college Dinozzo. Even Gibbs seems to have mellowed out, even Abby doesn't get as much screen time as she used to. It felt more like a soap opera, the only episode of any real worth was "Chimera" where they go on board a deserted Naval research ship, out in the middle of the ocean. And even that episode is so-so, Jimmy Palmer has an entire episode where a killer is after him, and even after going back and watching that episode a couple of times, I still don't understand why that script got off the ground. And we come to the ending of the season, I'll just say it, Jenny dies in a shoot-out out in the middle of the desert. And to be quite honest, you really don't care by the time they get to it. This season felt lazily put together, and lazily executed. Not one of their better ones.
The first 7 seasons were always entertaining, the stories were always engaging, but with this Season 8, I felt a bit disappointed, Louise Lombard(female blond detective) & the other male detective(can't remember his name) are gone leaving only Brass as the lead detective who of course never fails to make me laugh with his one-liners, Sara Sidle(Jorja Fox) departs which was disappointing, Fox is what got me watching in the first place, never got tired of watching her, & Grissom who has always been somewhat one-dimensional becomes even more so, don't get me wrong I really like William Peterson as an actor, but his Grissom never seems to ever have the flair that David Caruso & Gary Sinise's characters have in the spin-offs "Miami" & "New York", not that this season is bad, it just to me wasn't engaging, I mean when people are bleeding what appears to be green blood, you know the show has run its course, or the one where Katy Segal is a muredered Hollywood star who had her assistant look like her & both were involved with a not-so-bright producer, & the episode itself plays like a sitcom, maybe the writer's strike had somthing to do with this, I don't know, & why do we always have to see a dead person's brain??? the spin-offs "Miami & NY" don't ever show this, why does this one??? somtimes I think the producers have a twisted sense of humor, the previous seasons did this too, enough with the brains already!!!!, also Warrick dies in the last episode, you know when cast members start leaving it can only mean that they feel the same way as I do, Warrick & Sara are two of my favorites on this show, & I am not even sure Season 9 is worth watching, especially considering that Grissom even leaves in Season 9, again this one has run its course, unlike its spin-offs which have not(yet), but unfortunately CBS is going to milk this show to death even though "Miami & NY" which have not run out of engaging stories(yet) could just as easily carry the network, but again, networks have lost their creative edge & can't really come up with anything new anyway, so they are going to milk the original C.S.I. to no end, there are some good episodes, the "Without a Trace" two-part episode is good as is the first 4 episodes of the season "Dead Doll", "a-la-cart", ETC, but the last few are just ridiculous.
This is the most socking and disappointing of the Bones seasons. The short duration because of the writers strike (don&#8217;t they realize the effects of their strike ripple through the years to create animosity?). This caused some short cuts in the plot points of the season. One of the episodes from Season 2 appears in season 3 and it feels horribly out of place. The finally was very well done and leaves you on the edge of your seat!
Im sorry I LOVE u SGA but this last season was not up to the high level that was set. The best ep was a direct ripoff of momento!
"Atlantis Treads Water" was my review for the third season, and for this season I sadly had to come up with another way to say that a lot of water got splooshed around but it didn't seem to go anywhere.On the upside, we've got likeable characters, now joined by Sam Carter from Stargate SG-1.  But on the downside, we're still going back and forth between Wraith and Replicators.  It's getting old.It's too bad this series isn't more about exploration and discovery, like the orginal Star Trek was.  We can have recuring bad guys that need to be dealt with, but we an also have adventure and discovery, which seems to be lacking in this series considering they can get anywhere to a new galaxy they want and back nearly instantaneously.Looking back on this season, I felt like I'd kept up with old friends and had some good times, but I asked myself if anything really made me go "Wow" (like the Wraith seige of Atlantis) and I couldn't remember anything.  I think they need to get rid of the Wraith and the Replicators once and for all and move on to something radically different.The season finale cliffhanger was rather good, so here's hoping for season five.
Why is it that this military team acts with the tactical awareness of a box of puppies.The show has heart, a great premise, and occasional flashes of creativity, but they assault the viewer with aggressively-stupid character actions on a regular basis.  Thank Ra there's a fast forward.
Great series, although, by season 4, the story becomes too complicated and at times, unbelievable.  Really liked the mix of characters.  Totally unlike the Battlestar Galactica of the 1980s.
I just finished the Battlestar Galactia series with some mixed feelings about the show and the path it took to tell its story.I enjoyed the first two seasons quite a bit, but the third seasons writing started to faulter and the fourth seemed like they were using different writers altogether.The show attempted to take on some pretty serious issues that can be hot button subjects for some. We hear throughout the series of the gods (human belief) and god ( cylon belief) belief systems and which was right/true Vs. the other false god(s) and in season three it really heats up and is one of the major factors for the war. I didn't feel that this show was a good platform to try to rationalize religion, social/wealth status  and race issues that have plagued us forever the way shows like MASH was able to effectively address during its run on TV. Yes, its a drama, but its a scifi/fantasy drama and it wasn't near as effective nor as convincing as other shows like Mash's superior writing, acting and directing teams talents.The shows writers creat tension for the show by having these constant  riffs between the military and civilian populations that for me made little sense when the entire race was fighting for survival. Not everyone would use weapons, but would provide support for the troops and the population in one form or another. Yes, there would be issues, but everyone (all were soliders) was fighting for their lives and their race. Yet, we would rarely ever see people join the fight as troops or pilots like we saw during WWII and when you think of the stakes involved the shows creators/writers really blow this need for unity and patriotism that saved the day back then as well as for their war.I don't know about you, but half way into season two I had had enough of Galus Baltar (James Callis) who did a great job at being the King Antagonist of all time!!! I felt his role turned into some kind of comic book character like the road runner (at least I like the road runner) who never received a scratch no matter what was thrown at him. Baltar would have been killed more times than all the humans and cylon's combined if his character resembled something other than pure fantasy.All the mutinies and drunkeness and disobeying of orders that were in this story would have been the end of the human race in any other show.Look. I'm am in the middle on this show and how I rated it because of all its flaws and its OTT (over the top) stories/plotlines and silly characterizations of some of the cast. I liked the first BSG (1978) a little more than this one because of their character portrayals and stories. That said, I really liked this shows special effects and action scenes over the original series and between that and most of the casts acting abilities help to still make this a decent scifi series to sit back and watch.There is a fair amount of cursing and their version of the F&#8230;word (fracking) being used a lot ( you how many service persons like to swear a lot) to keep from being rated for mature audiences. There is several sex/love making scenes through ought the series especially Dr. Baltar's character without any exposed breasts.Again, this was a mostly fun to watch series especially the first two seasons with the third and fourth more of a challenge to sit through. 3 stars.Ps. I don't think that the ending was worthy of the first two seasons buildup and it turned into a big let down.
This show disappointed me because I wasn't looking for soft porn disguised as something else. The few episodes I watched reminded me of Weeds, except sex instead pot was the overriding theme woven throughout each episode. If you're looking for soft porn with some story, then you'll love this series. It has 3 seasons, so clearly I'm in the minority view here.
The story lines are not too bad and the characters are fairly interesting.  It is what would be called soft porn so that's a bit of an alert for those not quite into that kind of thing.  I find a lot of the people sad and living unfulfilled lives.  Maybe that's why they want to full them with lots of sex.  I do find that it keeps me watching to find out what is going to happen next with certain characters.
I am watching season 3 now.Well written, well played, some time really funny.But I can't say I really like it.I cannot completely grasp my head around the main character.If he is an alcoholic, a smoker and a drugs user, why is he in such a good physical shape with perfect air.There is the cliche: alcoholic writer that can write.His relations with his long time girl friend/wife: Can you really be faithful one week and sleep 2 different woman the next week,for 3 seasons of the show.The language: I am not against using the F word or the S word at all, but in this show it is use everywhere even to qualify Father Daughter relation ship.Is it because I do not live in California, that I do not get this show, or is just Hollywood and most people that make TV shows thatdo not live in the same world as me.I will watch it,  but I do not get what is theme of the show really about.
This show wants to be the small screen serialization of Bret Easton Ellis or Jay McInerney, but it doesn't quite get there.  It doesn't have the depth, and it feels too much like other "struggling creative guy in the big city" comedy dramas we've seen.  Good to watch for Duchovny, though.
I like this TV show but it does get a little old watching David's character as an overly sexual playboy who keeps up the bad habits. I'm wondering when they will introduce the episode where he catches HIV at some point. I have watched a few old girlfriends from San Francisco die because of guys like his character.  Anyway, its entertaining. Also, the male behavior in the TV show reminds of the lifestyle and mentality of a lot of men in L.A. and San Francisco which is interesting, BUT it does get old too. Its like...really??? Gross! Grow Up!
An opportunity for mere mortal to check out the goings on in sunny California, in particular the  home to the rich-not so rich, the famous and not so famous and their life styles.
This show does feature great performances from it's lead actors. But the subject of depraved 40 something men who are drug addicts is not for everyone. Sadly too many of that generation are just as bad in the realm of parenting as the lead character is here. This is no heroic story but the symptom of a generation that helped to bring down society and is in this case this character is still at it! If you look at the character with disgust then you can laugh and realize that there are people out there just as bad as this guy is.  Still it's funny and if you look at it as what is wrong with things then you get It completely but if you think 40 year old men doing dope and such without any regard for anyone else is good then you are as bad as this admittedly charming lead character is.  The whole point is that in cali things are so low that any age of man acting this way is ok. It's a comedy but lets face it, this guy is a bad example of a dad, and person. Which is why this edgy show chose it's title.
Okay, I admit it...I look at accidents on the highway and I watched the full first season of Californication.First, it's completely "overbaked" including the annoying theme tune...and I watched it anyway. Second, it's completely formulaic right down to the required-for-cable sprinklings of T&A...and; I watched it anyway. The Sex in the City-esque voiceovers - both with and without the typing on the computer - was a hurlfest for me...and I watched it anyway.If I hadn't lived in LA myself and hadn't known more than one guy like Duchovny's character maybe I wouldn't have been sucked in, but alas, I was. Maybe there's some backward-masking or some subliminal messaging that got me through this. I'm not proud to say it, but I watched it and it's okay. Not great IMHO, but okay.
Looks interesting, but not at that price per episode, and I lost interest, just not my world I guess. Oh. well.
A terminally ill chemistry professional adds to his income by producing and selling drugs, more and more sucked in a world of illegal deals and crime.A story is interesting as a sound example of going-all-the-way from a law-obedient model citizen to hard core crime doing everything to sustain family wellbeing in harsh time.A reviewer is unsure of educative value of this standing apart produce but situations shown have been provided by tragic-comic way professionally.
It is obvious that it was written by someone from New York or LA.  Someone VERY &#34;city centric&#34; who imagines that every town, in America, has this line around it where the &#34;town&#34; abruptly ceases.Also, the writer was probably someone very liberal, who realy has no idea how the US military works.  The military would not stand idaly by and watch all of this happen.  It also would not &#34;fracture&#34; and start following different leaders.  That has long been a pipe dream of the liberal left.  The military has a well established chain of command with rendundancy built in.  It does not just go to pieces.Another point, I see no one with a CB or Ham radio.  Personally, I know lots of folks who would be in direct communication with people all over the nation.  You may argue &#34;EMP&#34; but ground burst EMP would be localized and temporary.  Ham/CB chatter would be quite active.Over all, the show is worth watching, it is not quite as stupid as many TV shows coming out of Hollywood in recent years.  This is probably why it was cancelled so quickly.  I also like that its &#34;seasons&#34; seemed to consist of more than 4 episodes.  Something which has really begun to get my goat is how new &#34;TV shows&#34; come out and have less episodes than what we used to call a &#34;miniseries.&#34;  This show does keep you interested and has good characters.  I suppose my problems are techincal.  I just would like to see a show with some realism, is that asking too much?
Haven't watched enough episodes to conclude but what I've seen doesn't have me sitting on the edge of my seat or having me cheering for the characters yet.  It's sad to think this is a possibility for humanity.
It's a decent season but they just kinda flopped on the end. Decent show but dialog and writing is marginal at best.
This season is a fan favorite but I didn't care for it as much. Probably because the males were SO dumb that it was painful to watch them flounder through the game.
Here's the plot of ZOMBIE STRIPPERS: There are strippers...and they're zombies.  Still with me?  (Of course you are; you wouldn't be reading this review if you weren't at least intrigued by the premise of this film.)  Is ZOMBIE STRIPPERS gratuitous?  Is it poorly acted?  Is it demeaning to women?  Is it unnecessarily political and philosophical?  Does it look like it was made by a grad student who had some money left over after filming to buy a truckload of Ramen noodles?Yes to all the above.  But, damn it all, ZOMBIE STRIPPERS is FUN!  And, surprisingly, funny.  A vast majority of the jokes hit the mark, and they are delivered flawlessly.  Robert Englund is the scene-stealer here; he's campy fun in every movie he's starred in, but here he knows the movie is crap and lives it down wondrously.  The rest of the cast--Jenna Jameson included--is merely along for the ride, strutting around topless, biting of men's private parts, shooting pool balls out of various anatomical regions...basically, everything you've ever wanted to see in a horror comedy, but never thought you actually would.  At its core, ZOMBIE STRIPPERS is a god-awful movie, and truly it's really only worth a viewing or two...but God, what a viewing!
OK, this movie is really funny. Its gross, but funny.Zombies are everywhere but the world goes on business as usual. But there's this strip club whose bidness is suffering until of course Jenna Jameson gets half eaten by a Z, then turns into one and becomes the hottest attraction around, along with several other zombie strippers. I have to admit, they're pretty hot. Jenna was a lot hotter before she became a twig. WTF???Anyway, the funniest part of the movie is when an Army zombie is eating Jenna Jameson on stage and her boyfriend/hubby whatever Tito Ortiz who is a bouncer at the club runs out the door rather than sticking around to protect his womern. Hilarious! BTW, this movie looks great on DVD, very nice production. 3 Singles.
I didn't know if this film would be awful or not.  Turns out it's in the horror-parody genre, most reminiscent of "Return of the Living Dead" (the first one, not #2 or #3) which was an amazingly enjoyable film to watch.  A couple decades later, this film has similarities in its tone and in the sheer fun it has with the zombie genre.  It definitely pays homage to scenes from a number of previous zombie films.  It has a linear plot: virus in a secret govt. research facility escapes, infecting strippers in an off-site illegal strip club, and things go from bad to worse.  However it has a decidedly comedic tone to the entire film.  It used as a source material a French play about "The Rhinoceros" (a gentleman's nightclub), hence all the references to French and European existentialist philosophers, writers etc.  In what other film would you get a stripper quoting Nietzche, or a spec ops guy named Camus?  It also pokes fun (repeatedly) at the George W. Bush administration-be forewarned- and it deliberately overplays stereotypes like the "crack special forces", the for-profit corporate contractors, the East European Madame, the greedy but inept nightclub owner,and so on.  It's not really very scary, but there's quite a bit of blood and special effects depicting violence at times.  And the "stripper" actresses are quite good.  They do make some beautiful stripper- dancers.  There is female nudity in the film.There are a few holes in the plot but it's all meant to be fun, so you can't take the plot all that seriously anyhow.Bonuses to the DVD include a whole bunch of trailers for other films, quite a few cut scenes (some pretty interesting), commentary filmtrack, and two fairly short clips on the making of the film.  I enjoyed the extras.  If you like zombie movies and parody, then you will like this film.
Lap-dancers are turned into zombies with mortal consequences for attending the illegal venue: the more blood-the more males like it!This film is not my cap of tea surely.
I was not going to pick this one up because recently I have been turned off with movies staring Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger) in the last couple of years as he seems to be getting a lot of roles in stinkers of movies.This one wasn't much better, however, as dumb and over the top as most of this movie was, by the time it was over, I had not been bored, I sat through the whole thing entertained, but when it was over, I think i said outloud a number of times "W.T.F did I just witness"?I'm going to hope they intended this to be a comedy, because if it was meant to be serious then the jokes on them. The plot of this whole movie is pretty weak, a group of the best of the best army group, which consist of 3 emo dorks with guns, a moron who likes to lick knives, a pretty wimpy looking guy trying to be a bad mofo'n leader... oh, and a Paris Hilton wanna-be all go into a facility that a zombie outbreak has leaked out in and they gotta go in and shoot all the zombies.... something goes wrong, one of the emo soldiers is bitten, and instead of getting his brains blown out, he escapes to a strip club that is supposed to be illegal (what was illegal about it?) and like any person bitten by zombies, he becomes one, then attacks the star of the strip club and she becomes a zombie too. The club owner (Englund) doesn't mind that his new zombie girl goes out & strips, then takes a victim backstage and doesn't just take tips, but eats them too, as well as converting the rest of the strippers into zombies along the way. As long as it's making him some money, it's ok with him... until it all gets out of control.Describing that made it sound like the plot is a bit more then I thought, but it's not really. The army group have got to be the most unconvincing army persona ever assembled, to believe those D&D; grand masters survived military is a joke in itself... but this film wasn't going for realism, just stupidity and humor.So I haven't really said anything positive about the film, the acting and plot are not much, so why let it slide with 3 stars? Well, as I said, it's not boring, it is watchable, and fairly entertaining for a humor that is something like a Troma film, but with a bigger budget.I probably would have only given it 2 stars, maybe 2 and a half, but there was one scene in this movie that I was laughing hysterically at... it's a scene between two of the zombie strippers having a shoot out to see who's the better zombie, and the typical ping pong ball trick comes into play, but you'll have to see for yourself how it's played out, and what happens next... it's too ridicules to not find funny. So that scene alone I gave an extra star to.And then there is the make up and puppet fx that are actually very convincing and a lot better then you would expect. I was impressed hearing that things like the decapitated head was actually a puppet, or mechanical head rather then a real actors head with his body removed later with CGI or something.For the pervs, yes there is plenty of skin to see, provided you like skinny, bony-looking women with implants, which i found to be about as un-erotic as the zombie strippers decaying bodies through the films.... actually, i think they looked better as zombies... anyway, the end really spoils the movie when the worlds dumbest army troups come back into the movie to give the worlds most confusing ending that partly makes little sense, but leaves you wondering, WTF WAS THAT ABOUT??? then you re-cap the film and think, WTF?????? and i'm sitting here typing this review still thinking, WTF WAS THAT???????
It started out really good, with the military killing zombies, and one being bitten and accidentally goes to the strip club. There are some smokin' hot naked girls stripping and most of them get bitten and turn into 'Zombie Strippers' They like it because it inhances their performance. Soon, they must stop the flesh-eating strippers or everyone will die! I didn't like the idea of the zombie strippers talking, I like the quiet zombies. If you love zombies and naked women, you'll love ZOMBIE STRIPPERS!!!
Zombie Strippers (2008) is a horror comedy that as you might guess from the title, involves a number of women working as strippers who are transformed into zombies.  Reality is pretty much off the table early, as besides taking a few shots at George W. Bush, featuring half naked women getting violent, spilling blood, and engaging in some outrageous acts, is the main point of the film.Sometime in the future, a private company working with the government has developed a Chemo-virus that re-animates the dead, and turns them into relentless fighting machines.  A soldier infected by this formula while on a mission, winds up at a strip club where he attacks a dancer named Kat (Jenna Jameson), turning Rhino gentlemen's club's star attraction into a zombie, who covered in blood, becomes an even more popular performer.Club owner Ian Essko (Robert Englund) sees his staff of strippers gradually being transformed into infected homicidal zombies who murder his clientele, however he isn't too concerned, since profits are way up.  The talent includes Gaia (Whitney Anderson), Lilith (Roxy Saint), and an innocent newbie named Jessy (Jennifer Holland), a Christian fresh off the farm, seeking to earn enough cash to pay for an operation for her grandmother.  When the zombified clientele gets loose, Essko arms his staff.  Eventually the army gets on the trail, and raids the establishment with chaotic results, as the violence reaches extreme levels, featuring outrageous gore, and some pretty radical special effects.Zombie Strippers features cartoonish violence, gory kills, lots of blood, crushed skulls, and half-naked zombies engaging in some radical dance numbers, in between infecting the club's mesmerized patrons.  The zombie makeup gets more extreme as Jenna Jameson and Whitney Anderson evolve into rival creatures who do battle on the dance stage.  Jameson's character even goes on the attack with vaginal launched projectiles.For zombie fans that are also Prime members, Dead Snow (2009), Brain Dead (2007), and Aaah! Zombies (2007) are among the current offerings that might be worth your time.
This movie has a good plot. The ending is touching. It shows how great a mother's love for her child is. It moves at very slow pace. It has only a couple of suspenseful moments. The special effects is below par compared to those of Hollywood. This is also one of the reason  that makes the movie not so supenseful. It's worth watching once.
This is a good movie. Nice and scary. But be prepared to do some reading as it is in spanish.
As any film on unexplained or horror, a story of former orphan's plan to renovate her former closed orphanage building into a family-run seaside hotel, is lacking of any practical logic and far remote from reality as everything else occurred during run of plot rather psycho-delusive than worth being created at all.There are much worse movies of such gender and if some wasted time and money to watch, it is good for producers anyway.
Surprisingly restrained considering the trailer had so many threatening and spooky images. I will say that 'The Orphanage' does get an A for atmosphere, but reading subtitles during this film distracted me from the experience. I usually pass on films with subtitles, but this film seemed too good to pass up and there are always exceptions to the rule. It's a pretty easy film to follow, even though this was played up to be a very spooky film, I found it to be more sad than scary. The DVD transfer looks very good and this is worth seeing, but maybe rent before buying it.
The Orphanage (Juan Antonion Bayona, 2007)I was thrilled with The Orphanage just after I first saw it, and was all set to go round comparing it to Pan's Labyrinth like everyone else is doing. But then I got behind and didn't start writing this review for a week, and when I sat down to do so, I realized I'd forgotten a great deal of it. It took some serious brain-wracking and a consultation of a plot synopsis for me to start remembering scenes from the movie that had impressed me.Laura (Mar Adentro's Belen Rueda) moves back to her childhood home, an abandoned orphanage, looking to refurbish it and start a smaller, more intimate home for disabled children. She and her family aren't even settled in. however, when her autistic son finds himself some imaginary friend-- but just how imaginary are they, and what do they want with him? Distressed by this turn of events, Laura turns to paranormal investigators to find out what's going on.I think my problems with remembering the film have to do with my seeing Saint Ange last month, which riffs on many of the same themes and is, simply, a better and more memorable movie. Still, Bayona's first big-screen feature film does outdo a number of recent Spanish supernatural flicks that have made it over the Atlantic (viz, the awful Darkness). A second viewing reminded me what I liked about it the first time-- the acting is mostly solid, the atmosphere is well-done, the pacing and direction are both first-rate. Definitely recommended, but I'd suggest watching Saint Ange around the same time for a compare-and-contrast session. ***
Great short stories by some of the greatest directorsJonathon Schaech, Saul Rubinek and Sean Patrick, star in two of the stories.
Two things should be taken into account when you look at this. first is the season of Masters of Horror and secondly is the packaging. For the first part, the movies were a great thing. i know a lot of them had a cheesy little factor to them, but nothing like this has really ever been accomplish. That was why I found myself buying into it and buying into it with so much love. honestly, it is an amazing feat. Since this is the first part here, i will list the movies so there is something cataloging all the stuff here:Episode #: 1Title: "The Damned Thing"Director: Tobe HooperStars: Sean Patrick Flanery, Marisa Coughlan, Ted Raimi, Brendan FletcherSummary: A mysterious force sends a town into a murderous rage, and only the sheriff, whose parents were killed by the same force years ago, can stop it.

However, a supernatural force from the lawyer's past awaits them just below the surface.Secondly, there is the packaging. When I first saw this picture and picked it up, i have to say I was happy. I loved the design and I loved the idea thta I could work this into my collection. I had gotten plenty of things that did not fit exactly rigth and, to be honest, I was not worried. I loved the way it looked adn i loved the way it seemd to be a centerpiece. The problem was that it was nothing like what i envisioned.When I got the set, there was an issue of sliding DVDs that really made life a mess. Considering the investment there was not turning back, and that meant that I was stuck with something that didn't work out. I always take my DVDs out of the packaging when they are weirdly designed, too, trying to keep them from harm. Still, this is not one of those things you could do. The packaging already did a number of some of the DVDs and, sadly, I was left picking up the scratches. I'm glad they have new sets to get rid of those but, beyond that, there is the idea of getting what you pay for. I paid for a set, a pretty set, and i got a marred notion of what pretty can become. considering the complaints I have seen around, i would say this is a universal trend.In conclusion, buy the set but not the box. It will make life better for you.
Mary Shannon (Mary McCormack) is a Federal Marshal with the Witness Protection Program.  Working along side her partner Marshall Mann (Fred Weller), she helps witnesses adjust to their new life in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Since most of these people are criminals who agreed to testify against other criminals, that isn't always easy.  For example, there's the con artist who may or may not have set her sights on a new mark, yet gets her picture in the paper.  There's the man who brings his wife and mistress into the program only to decide it was time to break up with his mistress.  And even when the witnesses are innocent, their lack of desire to leave their old life behind them can lead to problems, too.If all that weren't enough, Mary's personal life is far from calm.  She is supporting her dead beat mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and her sister Brandi (Nichole Hiltz).  Not only has Brandi fallen for Mary's sometimes boyfriend Raphael (Cristian de la Fuente), but she is also hiding methamphetamine until her boyfriend can arrange the sale.  What will happen when that little bombshell comes out?Personally, I'm still not quite sure what to make of this show.  At times, I am quite interested in seeing how things turn out.  Then I get fed up with the soap opera nature of Mary's personal life.  More often then not, Mary comes across as smug and condescending instead of human and funny, which I have a feeling is what they are aiming for.  And the way she lets herself get manipulated by her family drives me crazy.  And yet I keep watching because I need to know what will happen next.  And I will tune in when the second season starts.I certainly can't fault the acting in any of this.  The actors all do an impeccable job of bringing their characters to life, flaws and all.  I think it may be those portrayals that keep me coming back.So yes, I will keep watching the show.  If you are interested, I'd suggest catching some reruns before you plunk down the money for this set.
Along with being recognized as The Farm Boy who became a Space Knight, Mark Hamill is a high-profile friend of a number of creators and editors at DC Comics, prompting him to write several introductions to their graphic reprints of their most popular collections and donating his voice as The Joker on "Batman, The Animated Series" as well as several "Justice League" series installments. Before he worked as the "Clown Prince of Crime," he appeared in two episodes of The Flash TV series as Barry Allen's answer to this deadly villain: James Jesse alias The Trickster! During the early stages of this TV series, most of the villains were either generic throwaway thugs or fabricated knock-offs of classic DC characters (notably Nightshade/The Original Sandman), but along with the appearance of Captain Cold(Michael Champion) and Mirror Master(David Cassidy), Hamill's Trickster was part of a long-awaited adaptation of members of The Flash's Classic Rogues Gallery.In this Rematch episode, he's sprung from facing trial by a new partner, Prank. Some would call her Harley Quinn before-the-fact and they wouldn't be too far off.While The Bad Guy's plot regarding how to deal with The Good Guy was an interesting twist, Julie "Catwoman" Newmar and Victor "King Tut" Buono did the same thing with Adam "Batman" West and Burt "Robin" Ward a few decades earlier, which made this installment less-than-great but not-that-bad. If they took the Comic-Book-on-the-screen path with the show from the beginning, it could have lasted as long as "Smallville" or at least "Lois and Clark." Who knows?
or so this documentary will tell you. I have enjoyed all of the Charlton Heston movies I have seen. One of my top 5 favorites is THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, his first major movie. Even the off-beat movies like WILL PENNY, were entertaining. The man had a mind of his own - unusual in Hollywood: particularly at his rise to fame.
If you overlook the REALLY stupid stuff, then this show passes the time.For example, every alien planet they go to speaks English when not even every nation on Earth speaks it!  Or, They continuely use P90's, a weapon designed as a sidearm for vehicle crewman and using, essentially a pistol cartridge, as a main battle rifle against what appear to be armored opponenets who are amazingly resistant to trauma to begin with.  To top that off, they are blowing WAY more ammunition than they could possibly be carryiing with them.  Sorry,  I am an old Infantryman, you can never have enough ammo but Dang!  These guys blow it like it is going out of style and would run dry in seconds.  unless they have a tractor trailor loaded down, like the one obviously setting behind the camera, there is just no way they could possibly operate.  A more realistic weapon would be a heavier caliber rifle round, with more &#34;punch&#34; to penetrate and trasfer kinetic energy to the types of targets they are engaging.  I would take a nice German G3 myself.  Even an old fashioned Ak47 would be better than what they are toting around.I also get a kick out of them using AT-4 unguided anti-tank rockets like they are stinger missiles, against aircraft.  Did the producers ever bother to consult with ANYONE who has ever been in ANY military?  Just wondering.This IOA, an international control organization, that does not know its butt from a whole in the ground, being mindlessly placed in charge of something which is clearly funded entirely by the United States and which is made up almost entirely of US personnel, is a bit disgusting also.  At least make them seem compotent and not so disgusting.All of that said, there is a lot of action and the charachters are intersting.  The individual show plots are mildly intrigueing.  As modern &#34;bad TV&#34; goes, this is better than most.
I know they had plans for a Season 6, so the show doesn't wrap up as neatly as it could have and I still have a place in my heart for Stargate, even if this isn't SG-1, but overall this season was disappointing. It had it's moments and I love the sci-fi and imagined history, but I just couldn't get into it anymore. Watch it for free, but I don't think there is a need to spend your money on this.
Season Four of STARGATE ATLANTIS was the series at its best, in large part because the show shifted the emphasis away from episodic, standalone episodes, to serial, long story arc episodes.  Season Five, however, shifted increasingly back to the episodic format.  There were some longer story arcs, but sadly most of the episodes were standalone.  This isn't to say that there weren't some good individual episodes, but the show lacked the narrative cohesion that drove the previous season and made it so enjoyable.As with Season Four, a significant number of the best episodes involved the wraith Todd, as Dr. Keller created a genetic modification made it possible for wraiths to subsist on regular human food.  There were hints from time to time that this was leading to a dramatic realignment among the wraith, but this was never pushed to its logical conclusion.  This was symptomatic of the entire season, with a lack of story arcs that would bring the series to any kind of overall conclusion.  Given that they knew well before the end of the season that the series was not going to be renewed, one would have hoped for a better send off.In the end, the series was a show with a lot of unrealized potential.  They had a great concept with Atlantis, the Ancients, and the Wraiths, but the show was hurt by a failure to write strong long story arcs and by some weaknesses in the cast.  Joe Flanigan and David Hewlett were marvelous as Col. Sheppherd and Rodney McKay, but too few in the rest of the cast came up to their level, and most of the other characters were either weakly written or never really developed to the degree that one might have wished.  Still, the series as a whole did provide a good viewing experience.  I think five seasons is about the right number for most shows.  Most shows decline somewhat after that many seasons.  While ATLANTIS was not as interesting in Season Five as in earlier seasons, it hadn't gone on so long that it became unlikable.  And at its best, the show was a lot of fun, with some very good viewing moments.  And The Wraiths have to go down on the short list of the great bad guys in TV history.
Five stars for the original footage, which is spectacular. The narrator, who voiced Hal the Computer in 2001 , A Space Odyssey, sounds like a wartime newsreel commentator, which is fitting, I suppose, given the material. The script, however, is only informative if one has never heard of Operation Barbarossa or knows nothing about the Russian Front. Additionally the prose is really purple, since the writer seems to think it enhances the dramatic content to repeat words. Eg: It was a drive that was relentless. Relentless. RELENTLESS. But the worst part of it was the dissonant score- imagine Nora the piano playing cat, only without the cute fluffiness. At the end of both volumes the endless pinging of the piano keys was relentless, Relentless, RELENTLESS.  Recommended with the sound off.
what annoys me the most is the cliffhanger left at the end of each episode. makes it hard to stop watching when you have nothing to do.
I don't think this season is quite as good as the first 2, but it is still good. entertaining way to spend some time.
24 Episodes on 3 DiscsIn Season 4 of "How I Met Your Mother," Ted played by Josh Radnor continues an inadvisable relationship with Stella played by Sarah Chalke. We all know she isn't the mother because the show is already in its sixth season by now without her! Just like with Robin before her, the audience is playing the waiting game for it to end. Ted faces a difficult year between problems with Stella, unemployment, Marshall and Lily moving into their own place, and as always confusing signals between himself and Robin.Marshall played by Jason Segel and Lily played by Alyson Hannigan begin to move on and become full adults and have issues with their new apartment and contemplate parenthood for the first time. Robin played by Cobie Smulders has difficulties with losing her job, almost getting deported, and exploring a friends with benefits relationship. Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris continues to be AWESOME but after realizing the extent of his feelings for Robin at the end of Season 3, he spends this entire season pining away for her and manipulate her relationships while staying quiet about his intentions. While it is fun to see Barney reveal a soft spot, the audience doesn't enjoy seeing him so vulnerable that it effects his game with the other ladies.Bonus Features:The most disappointing part of the bonus features on this one is that this season has the least amount of episodes with commentary (four) and three of them are with show creators and/or writers and only one episode, "The Naked Man" has actor commentary...and it is with Josh Radnor who you all know by now plays my least favorite character. However, it did confirm that Alyson Hannigan and Cobie Smulders were pregnant during the season which I totally suspected since they kept wearing REALLY loose clothing and holding things like popcorn buckets in front of their stomachs.Other features include the "Barney Stinson: That Guy's Awesome" music video with all the power words falling from the sky and exploding, but does not include Barney interviewing himself with a British accent. There is also a Season 3 recap, another gag reel of silly moments, and lastly, there is an Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Panel discussion called "A Night With Your Mother" featuring the show creators and main cast members that is less than 20 minutes. They discuss how Barney and Robin's relationship came about as an emergency tactic after the writer's strike. There is also a hilarious highlight where Neil Patrick Harris leaves to go to the bathroom with is microphone still on and everyone is laughing to the point of tears.
This season is simply not as good as the previous ones. While the previous seasons were excentric and wild, in a most unusual way, here the attempts to go for gross-outs actually spolis the humour. The cast is great as the bunch of low-lifes who run Paddy's bar in Philadelphia but while there was acrazy funny side to the humour, now it is simply crazed. Danny De Vito was allways a problem because his character is not likeable at all in this series. The titles of the episodes say all: Mac and Charlie Die, Who Pooped the bed, Sweet Dee has a heart attack.... It does simply not hold up to the standards of the first seasons, which were irreverent funny. The worst bar in Philadelphia episode is the best and goes quite over the top with the gang kidnapping a restaurant reviewer for sacking their pub. The live performance featurette is good. there are still som funny moments but you will be better off starting with seasons 1 and 2.
