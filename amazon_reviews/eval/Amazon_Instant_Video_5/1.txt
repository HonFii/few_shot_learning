This one is a real snoozer. Don't believe anything you read or hear, it's awful. I had no idea what the title means. Neither will you.
This show is plain dumb and not funny. It is sad how much TV comedy has deteriorated. Gone are the days of fantastic shows like Seinfeld, Cheers, Frasier, Everybody loves Raymond, Tool time etc. And they are replaces with shows like this one, with 2 dimensional stupid characters, bad acting and idiotic writing, where sleazy behavior is supposed to be funny. It is not!!!The 3 guys characters all have exactly the personality; all unlikeable, dumb, juvenile, infantile, sleazy and lack any redeeming qualities, and the girl is the same shallow personality in female version.The stories all have the same theme; juvenile pursuits of cheap thrills like one night stands (referred to as "banging") or getting quick cash without effort. And to get these thrills these 4 characters and even the father in season 2 are willing to do anything; "banging" the other guy's mom, selling alcohol to minors, threatening people with Jihad terror attacks, cheating the welfare system etc.The 4 characters plus the father are supposed to be business partners and friends, but all they ever do is screw each other over. With friends like these, who need enemies?YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
maybe i just dont get it...but crude not funny and irritating most of the time....guys that dumb shouldnt be on TV
It was a disappointment. I gave it a few episodes to get into it, but it didn't get any better.
Ugh, I can't take it - making the presidents right hand man involved in terrorism ?! The first lady clinically insane.  Then making you think it's the vice pres, then it turns out to be the president himself.  Uhhh, yeah, right. I thought at first at least they didn't do another mole in CTU (which they had done every single stinkin season).......then, turns out they did have someone in there following the 'right hand mans' orders! But he 'thought' he was doing the right thing.  Either way, STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES.  And they still have everyone respond to anything with "I understand".  Choose a different line once in awhile !  I give this 1 star, no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars.  This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I've watched. It's more boring daytime soap opera than action/drama like the seasons before this one.  Feel free to skip this season, I wish I had.
Couldn't even finish &#34;Sky City&#34; - it just feels like a sales pitch. Just get to the extreme engineering people.
My 18 month old grand daughter loves it!  I guess she understands what Blue says when she 'speaks', I sure 'whoof, whoof' don't!!  I just love that she loves it!
When I was little, I used to despise watching this program, and I only hate it more now. Every episode, of course, is repetitive (I know it is a nursery schoolers' television cartoon, but there are more educational, entertaining series out there, such as "Little Bear" or "Little Bill", that can educate children without repeating themselves continuously) and predictable, even for a three-year-old child. When I was a small child, I understood that, whether you answered a fourth wall-breaking cartoon character's questions or not, they were going to find out the answer on their own anyway, and it can grow tedious waiting for every little scene that you knew to expect after viewing previous episodes to be over with so the next boring, repetitive scene can appear and bring you closer to the conclusion of the episode. I know that many little children don't realize that Dora will figure out the answers to her endless supply of obvious questions on her own as soon as the blue arrow clicks on a landmark along the path for her, but I did and hated to watch her. I also thought that the characters were ugly. I mean, Dora did teach me some Spanish, but most of the time she bored me out of my mind.
I found this dull and unexciting.  The graphics are very 90s ish and the soundtrack is so-so.  She's no Diego that's for sure.  Then again, she's probably in the country legally...
What a morose way to end such a fun series. I always said that if they ever began taking this show seriously, it would come to a bad end, and I was right. It's like, we're ending the season with no sense of humor. In fact, we're gonna off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we're going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T'ealc. This show succeeded through its sense of humor (why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English? Duh!). Now it fades into oblivion without any sense of fulfillment. What a shame. Maybe that's why this season is going for $29! I'd rather buy two copies of Season 1! How do I pick zero stars?
Example: scientist walks into the bar where there is only 1 patron & the bartender.  That patron, the pilot who shot down the UFO asks the scientist to his table & in his second sentence, he's hitting on her.  Unexplainable given he had just been on the phone with his girl friend begging her not to break up with him.Example: scientist shows credential at the gate to a secure military base holding the UFO.  Guard doesn't have it verified. Really?  Then, scientist doesn't or can't go into the hanger & examine the UFO with the other scientists.  Why doesn't she verify what's she's seeing?Then when she & the pilot go to the hospital, they are admitted without it being verified they can have access.  Hunh?
The show is done in the 1990's, but it looks older than that.  I didn't relate to the characters and I don't like to gross alien testing.  I like my invasion stories to have characters I care about and watch them grow.
I watched this because the Brits usually do a good job with good production values, casting and story lines.  However, in this case it proved a waste of 5 hours. The writers, directors and editors should be ashamed to put their names in the credits.  Important things happen with no apparent reason and the watcher is left scratching his/her head wondering what was the point.  The American general is miscast and not believable.  Lots of clicking of computer keyboards for solutions that never seem to work out. The ending stinks!
ordinarily I love British comedy but there was really nothing funny that I could find in this sitcom. . .
Did not like this one at all ... the actors lacked passion for the work they were doing ... camera work wasn't that great either.
Very slow moving story...not very enticing...sound quality not great.  We did not finish this movie as it did not hold our interest.  Unusual experience at best.
It pains me to trash this show on Amazon, because seasons 1,2, and 5 are truly great.  This season feels like a made for basic cable action show that would air every Sunday at 2 AM.  Every plot device, formula, etc., is recycled here from the other seasons, almost to the point where they feel literally cut and pasted.
This is a first: An unusual number of five star ratings at a rate that surpasses all of this past years Academy Award (Oscars) nominated movies put together (TOTAL). Also, interesting is that the same fanatic slasher types are hacking the heads off of any one who dares give it one star (or less). Depending on date the same reviewers gave the one star reviews a: 0 out of 25; 0 out of 14; 0 out of 13; 0 out of  12, 0 out of 11. I'm just happy they're not all from Salem.The reason: A large number of people are making sure their Kickstarter funding for this movie proves rewarding.The movie: Simplistic dialogue that could only come from a cliche saturated Hollywood high school apprentice writer. Acting so bad the actors could manage only one short emotionless line then pause for the next actor to robotically respond in kind; back and tediously back and forth. Scenes composed of  95% dumbed down dialogue. Other 5% of scenes composed of a superficial attempt to  appear current e.g. tablets, internet video, Samsung product placement phones. Lot of formula characters e.g. dumb act cool cops; surfer dude; party people; lawyer cutouts; etc.Baddd: How bad? I was ff after 10 minutes and checking it every 10 to see if anything changed. Answer - as blandly homogenized as milk.People! For the honest reviewers not financially invested in this movie; if you want to see quality acting, storyline, sets, props and actually have to think, then watch "The Best Offer". It may cleanse you of the effects of this film's shallow banality. As far as the "fanatic-obsessives" I hope that VM series wasn't a representation of lives (un)productively lived. Let me know.
Great to see the gang again, sad to see them together in this.  I'm not sure which makes me feel worse, that I watched this or that I paid for it (okay rented).  It started well I'll give it that, but that lasted maybe 5 minutes and then let the shlock begin!  The only thing that could have made it worse would have been having Harry Hamlin show up for a cameo.
Ok, here's the thing with this show..everyone in it is excellent..I meaneveryone..the story line is fine and the writing good for the set up.I love the parents and always have but the show falls short of evergetting in the least little bit close to what it could be..I don't know whyit's a disappointment but it is..it's got all this gold and for some reasonit's been cast in lead.  Bummer man, because I would really like to watchthese people..and believe me I have tried more than once.
This show is nonsense.  The people being conned are too stupid to be believed and the main characters aren't much better - really, it's almost painful to watch.  The show gives no credit to its audience.  I only made it through the first long long episode.  Insipid best describes.
This was at one time a free download. I downloaded it, but never had the chance to watch it. On the 31st, some weird power failure completely disrupted my computer. The unbox player had to be re-downloaded. None of my films or downloads was marked as downloaded, but they began to come back - over 90% of them. The rest I simply re-purchased on unbox - though I had to buy Borat on DVD. When I tried to either re-buy or re-download this episode, I discovered it listed but not for sale. Why? Can anyone at Amazon answer that question - several other episodes are also unavailable. ???? I cannot even seem to delete the useless episode. Que pasa? I give it 1 star because you can't give something no stars - a rating deserved by lots of stuff.
not funny - not silly - just stupid - really a waste of time if you watch this show .
Don't waste your time with season two.  She could be fun if she wasn't so hateful inside.  Not good.  Yuck.
A soap opera. Stupid script, bad acting, glaring tech flaws. It promises a lot and delivers a lot of boring stupidity.
I only watched one episode. It had too much nudity and sex in it. The story line was good but didn't enjoy the rest.
If your into history you'll love this!!! ***** for all seasons!! It's a must see. Not for younger children!!! I love to see how people lived in the 1700's.
Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...there is that enough words?Edit: Bad acting - oh my god can't they find an actor that can actually sit a horse? Whenever they get on a horse it reminds me of those cartoons when I was a kid where the character was out of sink - the horse goes down the rider goes up - a jarring tribute to those who were raised in the saddle. I'm sure that the 12 people that did not like my review live in their mother's basement and keep a bottle of liquid silicone and a box of Kleenex next to the remote.
Season 6 is a slap in the face for those who faithfully followed this series for 5 years.Something happens to screenwriters when they have to write those last 3 episodes -- they stop being creative and want to simply take the money and run.  They write crap.This ending is even worse than The Sopranos ending -- would you believe it?  They should be ashamed of themselves.I bought Season 6 used, at a great price, and I now would feel ripped off if they had given it to me for free.If you liked the previous 5 seasons, and the characters, do not -- I repeat -- do not watch season 6.  They are stealing money from you under false pretenses.
This was the worst show on tv . A bunch of cardboard characters , wooden acting , stupid cases and vulgar and tasteless jokes . This was totally repulsive garbage and the fact that TNT kept it on seven seasons shows they are a stupid network .
This was one of the most mind numbing movies I have ever seen. Cary Grant did the best he could with this plot and his costar...don't waste your time or money!
This is nasty pure trash. Humans should not treat others this way. It is thoroughly not enjoyable. please trash it.
stupid show, stupid plots, some actors made it fun, sort of.who bought this thing for the network?  Are they still employed?
Based on all the 5-star reviews, I bought Season 1.  Watched it and holy bejemus was I shocked!  This show is horrible, people!!!!  What the heck show are you watching???  First, the story is way way way over-the-top unbelievable.  Chuck becomes a national security asset and CIA and NSA agents just randomly take up minimum wage jobs near him to, what, protect him?  And why wouldn't the CIA girl, Sarah, take a job INSIDE the Buy More?  Why is she all the way across the parking lot at a stupid hot dog shop where she can't even see him?  You take a job to protect someone you can't see????  And then Chuck just totally randomly "flashes" on people and things that he just randomly runs across and that randomly starts each super retarded and super lame random "adventure"????  The actors (and characters) are horrible across the board, all of them boring, unfunny and uninteresting.  The show is not funny in the least.  I mean Big Bang Theory, yeah, that's a 5-star show--great characters, great actors, funny as heck, witty, solid stories.  Chuck by comparison has none of those things and is truly a bottom-of-the barrel 1-star show.
PLEASE make the stupid laugh tracks STOP! Every other word... ah hahahaha. Unwatchable. Glad I only wasted my money on the first episode.
TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion.
this is the exact type of garbage which sends tv viewers like me away from the networks in general and nbc in particular away in DROVES.the creators of this show dont seem to know the difference between nerdy and prissy-effeminate. one character looks like a guy in a clown suit and the other is a recycled version of niles crane from frasier.the characers are retarded and this sitcom belongs in 1982 right between hello larry and the facts of life.the most offensive thing is the laughtrack which screams at you from almost the first moment.this show is an absolute insult to the viewer will be taught as an example of what not to do with a sitcom. the idea might have been a cool one if it wasnt written in giant crayons.if they are going for the youth demo with this one, people need to be fired.
The only "bang" in this series for me was the sound of my remote hitting the television screen in disgust. My bad, I bought into all the rave reviews for this abysmal, Erkel-ized comedy.Throw glasses onto Johnny Galecki and it STILL doesn't make him funny. (His casting as the weirdo, brooding idiot on Roseanne I always found strange, too.) Are people finding this "cute"? "Smart"? All I can say if I am over 50% similar to you, do yourself a favor and find some quality TV sitcom reruns to scratch your comedy itch. This will having you banging your head against the wall.
Wow what a terrible show...I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with "unfunny".It's geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way...just in a bad way.  Bad acting, casting, scripting and on and on.
The shows selected would stop and go with my system; PC-DSL. LO is the show for me and why you might asked? I once wore a &#34;Badge&#34;, I served with honor and respect and proud to have served.
The best thing to happen to season 2 was the writer's strike, it put the season out of its misery!  With that the producers decided to cancel the rest of the season and try again next year.The cliffhanger from season 1 was not even delt with until most viewers stopped watching.Oh, this second season was PAINFUL to watch!  My co-workers dropped out after only 4 episodes. I recorded the show so that I could fast forward through, hoping it would get back on track.  It never did, I kept fast forwarding through the entire season.Season 1 was great, never to be equaled by season 2.  Maybe season 3 will be better, if anyone is still watching.  It is sad to see the hottest show of 2006 go down in flames in 2007.
It has a lot of dirty talk and sex scenes but it's not funny. It's like a cheap soft porn. The dialogues are over the top.
AMC's - what is this? is a no sense or no nothing show ? this is fun? i don't  understand , people do you like this? no more words.
I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the "hype" surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media.  This show is another one of those "con" jobs.  Sorry, folks, but this show is just plain lousy.  It's depressing.  It goes nowhere.  The characters constantly bicker and fight.  Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, unsympathetic.  In short, this show was torture to watch.  And still believing the hype, I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3, hoping, praying, the show would somehow get better.  It doesn't.  The premise is good.  It could have been a good show.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikeable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that does not evolve--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good.  Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad in this.  His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry.  The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show.
Season 2 just ends in the middle of the season leaving the viewer with a HBO Soprano's ending.  Purchased a prime membership so the family could have a movie night. Thinking about going to Netflix it is only 1 cent more and has CC for the hearing disabled.  Like many Amazon rebroadcast television seasons are not CC or have a few of the episodes that are CC and  the rest are not in the same series. So if a member of your family can not hear or has trouble hearing Netflix or Hulu might be a better option since Amazon carries little selection for the hearing disabled. Called Amazon customer support about CC their programming :i.e. Jericho , Falling sky, etc., waste of time.
Jenna Jameson has no looks left and hasn't for years, and can't spell the word "act" much less do any of it, and it shows beyond doubt in this movie made for teenage boys. Anything at all to stay in the public's eye up to and including marrying a violent, egotistical drug head, so I guess it is true that birds of a feather stick together.NOTHING worth while in a movie my neighbor started  watching, and we both agreed to shut it off after 5 whole minutes it was so bad..SAVE your time and god knows please don't waste your money.
the story is ok. only thing bad is all of the dialog. all of it. and the girls. not hot, but good for stripper quality i guess.
Rented on whim. Wished I hadn't. Expected "camp", funny, b-grade SYFY but what I got was just terrible. Nothing good about this piece of crap.
This movie is in Spanish only and this director & his producer need to be boycotted on any movie they make. False advertising. They have the DVD cover and title in English... but to watch the movie, you either have to read subtitles or closed captioning. It is a sham to use false advertising to sell  to unsuspecting shoppers. They did the same thing with Pans Labrynth.It also would not have been a huge imposition on the director and producer to provide an Alternate English audio option like we do on our English speaking movies. This is the second and last time this director will ever sell any movies to me. I will never buy another of his movies even if every movie he makes from this point on is in English... because he's used up any trust we may have had. So when his career goes in the dumper in the US... don't blame the economy. Blame yourself for deceptive advertising and printing the DVD cover in English. If the cover and title had been in Spanish to begin with, we wouldn't be so irate because we would not have bought it in the first place. I have thousands of movies in my collection but this will be the last time this director ever darkens my viewing.I have nothing against Spanish. In fact I lived in Panama for 2 years.. but I don't want my movies in Spanish and I certainly don't appreciate the deliberately deceptive False English DVD cover and Title to make us think the movie is in English.If any of our US producers or Directors put a Spanish label and Spanish Title on a DVD cover and tried to pass it off to the Spanish speaking countries ... and then only had the movie in English or French... I suspect their consumers would be very angry as well.They wouldn't like it anymore than the Germans would want to watch a movie in Arabic or Chinese.Amazon is also responsible for this deception by allowing it to be marketed in English. If a movie is in Spanish, then the Title should also be in Spanish. And since this is an English website... it should have a huge warning at the top of the page telling English speaking shoppers that this movie is in Spanish only!And as an added note: This director does cheesy, immature camera effects. Near the end, he just goes nuts with his 360 camera rotating around the main character... it seemed like 5 minutes of nothing but spinning. It got so monotonous I had to fast forward just to get away from it. This is something a 16 year old would do shooting a movie in his garage for a school project.And let's not forget that the kid with the sack over his head was a cheap takeoff on Jason from the "Friday the 13th" movie series.Avoid this director and producer like the plague!!!
Offensive, and I am not easily offended--would be O.K. if not a prime time show.  Main character coarse and vulgar.
Really cheesy with really bad acting. Reminded me of one those terrible B- movies that play late night on cable Tv.
I give the actors, makeup, & effects 5 stars.  The writers get a zero !!!  Just another completely implausible scenario.  Science fiction is one thing, unbelievable fantasy is another.  The back to life and transformation cards are played way to often in Atlantis, probably why it died on the vine.  Every episode was the same old blah, blah, blah.....
I bought this season used and the second disc was actually the 2nd disc from season 5, not season 4. So, in other words the wrong disc was in the case. SUCKS!! Plus, the discs skip sometimes. So badly it'll freeze up and you'll have to either fast forward or totally skip the episode. Pissed me off!!! I gave this 2 stars based off of that, not because of the quality of the show.
I was shocked. Didn`t even finish it.It was mind-blowingly shallow and infantile.Only FOX could ruin something as great as the original PB.Never in TV history have I witnessed a descent like thisfrom excellence with Season One to foolishness in Season Four.Only watch season one and forget they ever made 2,3 & especially 4
I am baffled by 30 Rock.  I bought Seasons 1-3 at a second hand DVD & CD store and it has been an utter pain to sit through every single episode of all three seasons.  It's like torture.  I can't believe I wasted my time and suffered through them.  This show just is not funny in the least.  It's hammy, stupid, utterly unrealistic in any possible way, the writing is bad, the acting is horrible.  There are other similar "loopy and unrealistic" TV shows, such as Ugly Betty and Scrubs, that work (I love both those shows).  But 30 Rock is just bad.  It doesn't work.  It seems like in every episode they are struggling to make the show funny and the show falls flat on its face every time.  The show's "stars" Tina Fey and Tracey Morgan are just not funny at all.  Alec Bladwin is good and kind of funny, but it's almost like you feel bad for him that he's surrounded by such bad actors and given such bad scripts.  And in Season 3 they resort to these super hokey "guest star" appearances by people like Steve Martin and Oprah Winfrey that are just super hammy and so painful to watch.  Like I said, I'm just mystified at how bad this show is and how it's lasted so long.
The first series was average with some interest however the second year the characters seem to degrade. The writer seemed to loose his direction and the stories became more unbelievable.
If you like fake tough guys, moronic story lines and dialogue that could have been written by a chimp, then this is your show.
I thought the premise of the series was  ridiculous.  These rebels are criminal low lifes whose lives appear to be caught up in a Walter Mitty hero fantasy about being bad boy bikers.  The script throws in glimpses of male bonding, emotional depth, and odd paradoxical integrity, which comes off as absurd given that they're just a bunch of middle aged wannabes caught up in an arrested development of their teens.  If the storyline didn't attempt to be taken seriously, it could have been a good comic satire.
Too much talking with irrelevant dialog. Not my kind of show. Did not see a point to the episode I watched.Will not watch agaian
Casting for main character all wrong.  Mediocre writing, very off base cop to gang relationship.  It seems as if they cast MR. Rogers to be the bad ass, almost impossable to believer.
Not all that realistic. Loaded with profanity - well of course they are depicting 1%ers. Everyone knows if you ride a Harley your a member of some outlaw gang even if your 70 years old and wear color coordinated nylon riding suits.
This season stinks. It is preachy with no punchline. It seems tired and worn. I enjoy the Denny Crane/Alan Shore relationship but the writing just seems to take that dynamic for granted in season 5. The increased appearances by Melvin Palmer doesn't help either. That character is best in really small doses. Seeing Jerry all the time is a bit annoying as well.All in all... I'd kinda like a refund. Maybe Alan Shore will take my case :-)
Despite John Thaw's acclaimed qualities as an actor, I find that he was only convincing when he played a character who was very close to himself. So, which ever of his later characters you take, you are really just left with John Thaw. Morse is very much John and, to me, the best part of the show was the views of Oxford University. The plots are incredibly complex which does not really produce a compelling detective story; the viewer, or reader, really needs some chance of being able to solve the riddle. The character of Lewis is equally poor and boredom is never far from my mind. John had a British RADA accent overlaying his boyhood Manchester brogue and it often slips quite badly which is embarrassing.
Why is it that no comedy show can go a half an hour with out making fun of Jesus or Christians? American Dad started out great but now it seems they will take the road most traveled. All jokes revolve around Christians. This episode was no different. It started out really funny and I almost said "see you do not need to bash Christians, but I interrupted by the show bashing on Christians. I have quit watching Family Guy and The Simpsons because of this. The only shows that I really like to watch any more on FOX was Futurama and it was canceled and then there was King of the Hill and it is being canceled. Oh well, after I stop watching American Dad I will stop watching FOX altogether. Which is not such a bad thing? Almost all shows on FOX are garbage anyways.
There were actors from the first season that suddenly were not there and actors that were replaced with other actors - Super confusing AND much worse than the first season.
Season 1 was not a master piece by any means, but it was entertaining enough. I could see why they decided to make a season 2. However, they switched one of the main actors which was really weird. It also appears as they switched the writers as well. The story lines were just terrible, and the actors did not seem to believe in them either. I fast forwarded through each episode.
To easy for others to use and children to get. Got credit and they told me how to block when gaming.
come on people these are for kids...  I don't care that Diego is &#34;suave.&#34;  he needs to do something with his hands other than putting them all over Dora...  Is he in this country legally by the way?  i don't want my 3 yr old exposed to an illegal immigrant or whatever they're calling them these days...  enough.
This is perhaps the worst Batman cartoon of all time.  Whoever put this on TV should be beaten with a sock full of pennies.
i have contacted amazon at least three times now. the sound in this movie sucks. every fifteen seconds or so, there is a 'break' in the soundtrack, making it impossible to watch.
Am I missing something here?An entire season on one(1) disc and a running time of 60 minutes.No thanks, especially at $31.89
and I find it irksome when a program, which deals with lying, begins it's TV life, as it were, with lies.  Intentional or not, it's sad that most of Hollywood, if not all, portray Jehovah's Witnesses as a bunch of frothing fanatics. This program would be case-in-point.  It seems to me that the 'writers' would and should make, at the very least, an attempt to get facts straight before portraying the beliefs of nearly 8 Million people.  Clearly this wasn't done, shame on them, and since they in fact DID lie to everyone the program looses any credibility it hoped to gain with me and many others.
Plot: woman is seen with her coworkers, family, and bf while creepy eery music is played. Everything kinda appears in black and white actually . . . although it may be the gray rainy London backdrop. Anyway, she sees a woman driving off that looks like her. She follows her. She has a car accident. More creepy eery music and people.Comments: This movie tries to heighten the suspense and horror aspect of it with cheap things like music and people showing up only to startle someone. But then the gore starts. Not much but some. You get to see a dead man. You get to see dead woman who has been suffocated with a plastic bag and bludgeoned to death. You get to see another woman in a shower brutally murdered by another woman ramming her fist down the first woman's throat and all this blood pouring everywhere. So there is gore and weird music. Pretty much sums this movie up. I think it is an art flick trying to be cute with a simple morale message. But I don't know. They didn't quiet achieve that. Maybe I am giving it too much credit . . . maybe it is just some stupid horror movie. Anyway it is a waste of 1.99 and your time.
Loser. Expected something better from Whedon. Big fan of Firefly, the best tv series ever. Think he is desperate or strung out on drugs. Don't waste your time and money here.
I was a fan of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, so I had high hopes for this.Well, we've got lots of shots of scantily clad young women, no chemistry between characters, no endearing characters, and a story about a kidnapped and abused girl.  Nothing like delving into a parent's worst nightmare with characters we don't care about.  Oh well, that's that.
Saw this on the 'Tube,pretty boring and usual envrionwhacko conspiracy type plot and bad corporation,good citizen defending the "wetlands" and nature.Conservationists ironically can only conserve Nature and nothing else in Human Form,The rights of The plants and animals trump Humans.Shame that Roberts and Denzel both good actors were in it.
Wonderful show if you are an adolescent. If not then find something else to watch. The concept is funny but the show is not.
An Austrailian import, it is a 'Splash' for tween girls. In comparision, it makes power rangers look like high drama. Don't waist your time or money here.
Needlessly confusing and characters I didn't care about so the DVD was shredded after the first fifteen minutes. Next time have a better opening, movie creators. That is all.Rotten Tomatoes gave this film a low rating. Maybe you should, too.Based on a roleplaying game of the same name.The budget for this film was a bit over $25M and it made a bit over $2M at the Box Office. The prosecution rests its case.OVERALL GRADE: D minus to D; WHEN WATCHED: April 2012.
It seems every year Hollywood dumps out a movie that is some combination of zombies, alien invasion, gory violence, gunplay and swordfighting all rolled into one.  For 2008, this was Mutant Chronicles, a movie about an ancient alien device that is re-awakened by WWIII and starts to turn mankind into zombies.  An international crew of soldiers, both guys and gals, are teamed up to destroy, or at least turn of, the alien device.  The movie has nothing special about its plot, dialogue, or even special effects.  All in all, a waste of almost 2 hours.
I was an elected official of a small, local government. This series &#34;nails&#34; it ! That's why I hate it so much, it's too real. Not fun...very uncomfortable.
I tried a few episodes.  Nothing that interests me,  Had the feel of the office, but in a worse way.  Maybe I just didn't give it enough time, but I didn't want to waste any more time on it!
Like many people, I can have my interest spiked by advertising and such was the case with this show.  The advertising generated sufficient interest to get me to watch the "pilot" program, however, having done that, I will not be watching any of the other episodes (despite one review which indicates that the second season "gets better").In my opinion, the "pilot" should set the scene for what is to come.  It should generate sufficient interest to induce you to watch another episode and another and so on.  As it did not do this for me there is no logic in watching further episodes.
Very stupid, i just didn't get it, maybe I'm old school and epected something romantic to follow. 2 co-dependant people with issues, hard to grasps!
This show is weird.  They just get off on blowing things up and crashing vehicles.  Thousands of dollars in every crash are being wasted that could be used for a good purpose.
Though I have not really seen very many full episodes of this program before, the ones that I have seen have bored me out of my mind. The plots are awfully dull, even though I do enjoy the music a lot of times. The performers are fantastic at singing and I enjoy many of the songs that they have covered, but the plots of the episodes are awfully bland to me. Other people might think differently, but that is just my opinion. I like the singing; just not the series itself.
I don't like this show. I tried it but not worth my time. I know a lot of people love it but its jaunt not my thing.
This show is a series of melodramatic storylines and overly-pop-styled songs that numb the brains of people matured beyond childhood and the tweens.  These eye-roll-inducing scenes are punctuated by genuinely funny appearances by Jane Lynch.  Her comedy is a raw, edgy, intelligent addition to a show that is basically the demons of American Idol possessing a school.If you are a fan of American Idol, Disney teeny bopper shows, and show tunes, watch this.  If not, run for the hills!Vapid melodrama run amuck with Jane Lynch injected to help you keep your sanity.AVOID.
Cheap video game quality animation even in HD format. The purchase of this series was a waste of money and time!
I am just not a fan,and think of this along with many other &#34;popular&#34; shows like Sponge Bob as toilet humor tv. Mindless, check. Ridiculously irritating, check. Perfect for the dumb masses, check!
I just discovered this little gem. I had been seeing that it was on the USA network for a couple of years now, however, I had not taken the time to watch. Today, I watched 2 episodes from season 2 I would guess and I absolutely loved what I saw. I am a huge fan of this sort of happy ending character driven (though not to deep) type of show. The stories are simple yet realistically believable. There is a certain continuity as well. The two stories that I watched also involved a much older Henry Winkler playing the father. I won't go into details of the story-lines, however, I will say this show is worth the time, if not the money. However, not for the price that is being charged here or by the manufacturer. There are only 12 - 13 episodes to these sets by USA as that is all they do to make a season. It's the same with all of their shows. The shows are great, but the price is ridiculous. That is not to say that I won't purchase the sets, just not at this price. I will wait for a sale or get them used. I refuse to pay more than $10 - $13 with tax and shipping for a season of less than 14 episodes. The good thing is that Amazon and other sources sell not only used copies but have great sales. So, if you can wait, it's well worth your time and investment to own this show.wasitchuRead all my reviews here at Amazon.com, just look for wasitchu.
Everyone was excited Futurama came back, but when the crew went through the black hole they lost all the wit that kept the show interesting before, and I can't get the crew's corpses out of my head because this is what this season represents to me now, a defiled corpse. Really it's just plain embarrassing to watch now from how stupid and forgettable the entire season is.Like the episode where Leela and Zapp were stuck in the middle of the woods naked, they literally do nothing but sit around naked. When I say Fan, you say Service! FAN, SERVICE! FAN, SERVICE! I guess that's supposed to substitute for jokes now. Anyone else noticing the sheer amount of cartoon nudity stuffed in each episode? It's like they think the reason people love watching the show is to see the characters naked, which is maybe for some of the people who gave this abysmal season 5 stars, but I liked Futurama for the storyline and jokes, which this season is severly lacking in. Instead of story, we get political campaigns!There's also the prop infinity episode which is nothing more than the writers getting on their soapbox and telling everyone what to think about Prop 8. Thanks Futurama, I forgot you were synonymous with political rallies. I mean FFS I'm not watching Milk here, I'm watching Futurama! I don't CARE about the writer's political opinions, especially when they have nothing more to say then their opinion on Prop 8, shut up and get back to being a good show!Oh and my personal favorite episode the season finale which is probably titled 'mutant pride', is an episode where it's literally just Leela with a microphone yelling "MUTANT PRIDE, MUTANT PRIDE!". Then the mayor or whoever that's against mutant pride turns out to be a mutant. Wow, real subtle, I could never connect the dots, thanks Futurama. I swear I'll go out and vote for whatever you want me to as long as you shut up with the politics and get back to your good old self.What happened to Futurama, when did it go from space adventure comedy to some soft core porn/gay pride rally? I'm not against Prop 8 or gays, but LEAVE IT OUT OF THE DAMN SHOW BECAUSE I DON'T CARE! Or if you're going to bring it up do it quick and with subtlety and don't center episodes after episodes around it. What was once a well written love letter to old sci-fi shows is now nothing more than a corpse, taped together with Prop 8 bumper stickers and shambling around a strip pole trying to be sexy for it's fans.
Boring dialog, bad acting, flat characters, and extremely tedious story line don't add up to anything.  I lost interest in the first few minutes, but I kept watching and hoping for something to happen. I was disappointed. It's definitely beneath Dylan McDermott and Kyle Secor's talent.  I'm surprised it lasted 2 seasons.
After watching the first episode I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and watch the second episode.  I made it through about 15 minutes and knew this was not for me.  It seems to be a dark mafia type show.  Some people may enjoy all the &#34;shoot them up&#34; but after watching The Glades and Justified Dar Blue just doesn't measure up.  I would not recommend it.
I have never watched this, but I know it eats dirt.  How?  Cause I read every  5 and 4 and 3 star review.  Isn't it sad how we are manipulated?  Ok.  Say it is given 5 stars and you get all excited and and watch 2 hours and realize its a dog.  Who gains?? Does Amazon pay something each time anyone watches anyepisode?  mmmmm?  I really don't know but I suspect and so should you.
It couldn't keep my kids ages 3-14 entertained, it was a waste of time.  watched different apposed and it was the same.  it's not like the old one
Seeing as SpongeBob SquarePants has still remained so overwhelmingly popular after all of these years, I know I may receive a few negative votes from customers for my negative critique. But, before you press that unhelpful voting button (which, please, don't do until you have read my entire review) I just want to let you know that I am not criticizing the whole series. At the beginning of its lengthy run, it was so phenomenally hysterical and witty that episodes were bound to generate at least a few chuckles from you, and the very best ones would leave you wishing that you had thought of some of the jokes featured in the episodes. Sadly, that spectacular quality has declined.In more recent years, the program has underwent a deterioration in quality (I sincerely apologize to the makers of SpongeBob SquarePants). The negative qualities of a majority of the main characters have been enhanced (stupidity, greed) as pointed out by many other people, and the episodes and specials have a "rushed" feel to them. They defy the boundaries and limits set by the older seasons (which, albeit they may not bother many other people, enhanced the comedy of the program and became traditional jokes for the series) and the humor has grown more grotesque and stupid. The characters are all now more annoying in an attempt to make them appear funny, and I know lots of people have noticed the same changes and also can agree that the cartoon has lost a lot of its heart. If you want to watch SpongeBob SquarePants episodes, watch the earliest seasons if you want to be truly entertained. I genuinely apologize to anyone who may have been offended, but it's just the way I feel. I'm very sorry and hope I did not insult anyone.
I hate it and I think its a horrible show. Makes me want to hurt the writers and the creators.
I don't know why this movie was made. If you are expecting some funny Robin Williams bits, FORGET IT. The movie deals with teen suicide. The victim is Robin's son. Robin is a father with zero parenting skills. While the son is a suicide victim, when you see how obnoxious he is, you would hope he becomes a murder victim. What a terrible waste of film. Don't bother watching this one.
Why did they make this movie?  It's vulgar and not funny.  The story is sickening and pointless.  Promoting this movie as "Hilarious" is disgusting and highly deceptive.  Avoid like a plague.
(1.) Dumb; not a comedy no matter how bombastically distorted the characters were.(2.) No lesson or message to be learned in these absurd caricatures.(3.) Only the genetic abnormalities found in the world of Hollywood and it's hanger-oners would find the perversions of romance a fascinating story.
It amazes me that such an amazing actor can star in such crap sometimes. This and the one where he works in the photo shop....crap!!!
Robin Williams is good in this role, and it's not the first time he has balanced a bit of humor with a serious subject.  But, since I can't give it 0 stars, I give it what it deserves, because even though there is a laugh or two, in reality it is a HEAVY drama with tragic story lines.  So don't watch this expecting laughs like I did, and maybe you won't be disappointed.  It is extremely depressing, and if I had watched this while depressed, this movie would have made it much worse.And, by the way, to the reviewer who said not to leave negative feedback because the movie doesn't live up to expectations, I say this:  It is described as a COMEDY.  Not dark humor.  Not black comedy.  Not even "intelligent humor" as another reviewer said.  If I had known this movie was going to be so dark and depressing, with ONLY a laugh or two, I wouldn't have been expecting one of Robin Williams' comedies.  I'm fully aware of his amazing ability to do comedy as well as drama, but I don't like to see a "comedy" movie about suicide, accidental or otherwise. (and BTW who knows for SURE it was accidental anyway???)  There is NOTHING funny about suicide. Chances are pretty good that I would have passed it by had I known it was so dark.  And that may just be the point, right??? Make people think they are getting one of Robin Williams' comedies, which are gems, and are MUCH harder to act than the dramas.
Robin Williams is one of the funniest men to ever star on the silver-screen, but occasionally he does a weird dark comedy, that's very hit or miss. In World's Greatest Dad, Williams plays an English Teacher, who covers up his son's bizarre and embarrassing death. The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper, making his loser son, an overnight sensation. Williams is a great actor and gives credence to even a bad film like this, but even he can't save this one. The story is just ridiculous, his son (Daryl Sabara) was a complete nightmare that everyone wanted dead. No one would all of a sudden care, just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note. It's also extremely unrealistic, since his son was as stupid as they come. That being said, with the exception of newcomer, Eric Martin, the rest of the supporting cast was awful, making the film that much more unrealistic. World's Greatest Dad may have landed it's star, but it's a sloppy movie, that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's an hour and a half of pure torture, with the occasional funny scene that's all Robin Williams. This is one film that just starts out slow, never gets going and is anything but the "hilarious", "wonderful" film that I was expecting.
I rated the movie a one.  I love Bobcat and Williams is an excellent actor.  But, I saw no value in the movie except for maybe the last minute and a half. It is not a dark comedy, I adore dark comedy.  I rented the movie "This must be the Place" and that was a good movie with dark comedy.  There was also plenty of depth.  This movie was about the human condition.  Exaggerated maybe, but rotten kids are sometimes just a fact of reality. The actions of the father were pretty much unforgiveable so he was just as horrible in his own way.  People can read what they want to into the movie to justify recommending it, but there was really nothing beneath the surface and there was nothing worth laughing at; even in sarcasm.  As a matter of fact, they were two people I'd rather not know, and that includes the hour plus minutes I spent staring at them via the computer monitor.
I spent the whole time waiting for a point. There was none.  Some of the acting was okay, but ultimately something was lacking.  It just didn't make much sense and was not interesting.  The whole concept had potential, so it was disappointing that it didn't deliver. It dragged on so much that I had the feeling that the story could have been better told in half an hour rather than an hour and a half.  I'm glad it was free to watch.
They should have released this as a animated movie and not a motion comic.  The story deserves that. I bought thinking it was a movie I had missed.
99 cents for 10 minutes or less, interesting concept "what if superman's ship had landed in Russia and he grew up under that type of totalitarian regime" -- but you only get a few minutes of story and the rest in screen credits, not worth 99 cents
episodes are only $1 but its pretty slow kinda hard to watch...and for being only like 10mins it def is not worth it at all
After watching this soapy, relationship-entangled space opera for five endless hours, I happened to glance at my watch to notice that only five minutes had passed.Award yourself the "Purple Heart For Patience" if (like myself) you somehow manage to stick with this turkey to its distant, disapopinting conclusion, for the purpose of finally discovering the nature of its..."UNIMAGINABLE MYSTERY," which the creators of the series -- from one grueling episode to another -- keep dangling enticingly before you.Perhaps the one and only redeeming feature about DEFYING GRAVITY is the immense sense of gratification and relief -- and "lightness" -- you're likely to experience after recommending it to (i.e., inflicting it on) your worst enemy.
Same plot over and over again.  My husband watches it but it seems very boring to me.  Needs more plot variety.
Boring, boring and boring. The script look like a recreation of a classic  mexican movie but is not. This  movie is worst.
Even a bad movie can be good but this isn't even bad good.  Not worth the bother no redeeming cheesiness.
This show is terrible, shoddy acting, unbelievable storylines, the montages with awful cover songs, etc etc.1. The supposed "good guys" are gun brokers to gangs and murderers in their own right, I could care less about them. That's one of the main things that makes a series good is that you actually care about the characters but these guys are such scumbags all around it's actually painful to watch. I'm glad they lost overall at the end of this season. I was hoping for a better second season but this was worse than the first one and that's saying a lot. I won't be wasting time on this series anymore. Glad I only borrowed it.2. It's a sad thing to see the cops in the back pockets of these gangsters. It's embarrassing to see the Chief of Police following them around and even taking part in their crimes, a little todie. He even rats out his own "brothers" the FBI and ATF to this gang, endangering not just the informers lives but the lives of fellow law enforcement officers, awful. This is supposedly to protect some town from the real world? As long as they kill outside of city limits its OK with the police? I'd be afraid to live in a town like this, who knows what's next with the corrupt police and this biker gang. The cops even look the other way when someone is about to be killed? Even if Sobel is a bad guy what self respecting police officer would do that? The process of the law is one thing among others that makes us a society but this show seems to think it's all OK if one set of bad guys kills another or you're "protecting" a town, ugh! Murder is wrong no matter who does it and who it is done to.3. The constant song montages are so cheesy and overdone, ugh!! The covers are awful as well. Just a filler so everybody can LOOK so deep in emotion and to be pitied, etc. Weak minded people love this stuff.4. Trying to make criminals into family men and righteous vigilantes etc is so terrible. I was sickened by all the hugs and love yous between criminal killers I wanted to gag! This show is so embarrassing to watch. I'm just sorry I gave this POS another seasons worth of my time.5. A doctor turns into a helper for a criminal gang and even assaults and threatens hospital staff when she's reprimanded for it? Please. She needs to take that stick out of her a.. as well I've never seen a character so constipated before!The shallowness of it is so obvious, the characters are wooden(Clay) or miscast(Jacks). Genna, mother Sons, is such a lowlife it's another layer of BS that makes me dislike this show so much.If you want a realistic and well done drama you need to go to the premium channels. Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, etc. For a decent but not great regular cable drama I like Justified. But this is just tripe.It's sad to see so many weak minded lovers of this tripe, good maybe it keeps you busy watching the tube so you don't do more damage to society by your idiocy.
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SHOW IT'S SO UPROARIOUSLY GUT-BUSTINGLY KNEE-SLAPPINGLY GOOD! I ALSO LOVE DAVE 'N BUSTERS, THEIR FOOD IS SO GOOD I LOVE THE STEAK ESPECIALLY FROM DAVE AND BUSTERS; DAVE AND BUSTERS IS GREAT LIKE THIS SHOW! I ALWAYS ORDER THE COORS LIGHT FROM DAVE 'N BUSTERS, IT TASTES SO REFRESHING DOWN MY THROAT AFTER I ORDER A DELICIOUS STEAK FROM DAVE 'N BUSTERS! I'M NOT SURE WHY BUT EVERYTIME I WATCH SEASON 5 OF IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW DELICIOUS DAVE 'N BUSTERS IS AS WELL AS COORS LIGHT!BTW GO TO DAVE 'N BUSTERS AND ORDER THE STEAK AND A COORS LIGHT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
started watching this and just didn't feel like finishing. What could have been an interesting storyline was very disjointed, jumping back and forth in time, pretty graphic sex scences that don't add anything to the story...
I guess if you like suffering and in dept turmoil you might like this movie. I thought it was very simplistic and shallow. How others thought it was deep is beyond me. I might have missed something, but from what I saw it wasn't well scripted or thought out. More action and explicit explanations might have helped. I know these things happen it's just the movie wants to wallow in the morass of confusion instead of anything deeper.
I read some of the other reviews before watching this and although they warned about the later parts of the series, I found even the beginning unclear and poorly developed.  We watched the first episode only and couldn't be bothered to follow up any further.  It simply was not entertaining and that is all we wanted it to be.
Not sure what is the point of putting things like this on the internet. Spend your time staring into the sun. You will have find it more fulfilling.
Sorry, I like "Californication", but something happened in this season, the whole thing was a like a bad parody of itself.  Where it's possible it might have been able to suspend one's disbelief about this show before ... it is not possible any more, you just have to watch this season and try to enjoy it for the cartoon it is.Speaking of cartoons .... I bought this factory sealed and new from Amazon, and the video is absolutely horrible.  I thought I was watching this series on You-Tube ... back a few years.  The resolution was terrible and the pixelation was unendurable.  I checked the disks and they looked fine physically, so  this must have been a mastering job done by a complete incompetent.  Can anyone else comment on this ... I just really could not believe a brand new DVD set just out this year could be done so poorly.If you have to see this I don't know what to tell you, all I can do is relate my experience.  Very sorry I spent the money.
If they take out the swearing and sex, there would be no show - thin, thin story line. I would not watch another episode for FREE!
A guy shows up on the first episode in the nude joking about his dongle.  I'll pass.  I don't need this crap entertainment.
It's not you, it's me...The first two seasons were intriguing and a curiosity but as of season three, I am over it.
I have very mixed emotions over this latest entry into the long-running and much-beloved Stargate franchise. I fondly remember seeing the original movie at the theater and was immediately impressed by its imagination. As it evolved into a weekly series I watched as my sons grew and became enthralled in the story line with me. And yes, we even liked "Atlantis".The Syfy channel promoted this show as an "edgier" Stargate. I found that this did not work for me. The very elements that made the original movie and following 15 seasons so enjoyable was now totally lost in this self-inflicted reinvention. Stories that were once fun, adventurous, full of camaraderie & humor were now jettisoned in favor of a grittier, darker, gloomier, smuttier and meandering approach.Some shows can evolve successfully. What we had here was the results of a very bad miss-calculation by MGM Television in canceling "Atlantis". And then upon realizing their mistake the panic-ridden response to rectify this error by delivering back unto us a forced-format that was now supposed to be better because now it was "edgier"."Edgy" can be a dangerous creative mixture with a show like Stargate. "Edgy" can mean daring, provocative, and/or avant-garde. But the nasty flip-side is that it can just as quickly turn into something unusual and unpleasant. And much of this "Universe" seemed forced and uncomfortable.Example: One early entry went something like this. "OK, we have a room on board the Destiny that we are only now able to open and explore"... "Oh look, its one of those Ancient's Chairs, I wonder where this will lead?" We quickly find that it leads to an hour with an angry lesbian, a fist fight over infidelity, and "Oh snot, my girlfriend is a stripper".As the second-season cancellation decisively proved, this new and "improved" model was not the way to have gone. Yes, this was not "your grandfather's Stargate" but as it turned out it wasn't my teenage sons Stargate either. Those of us who wanted "edgy" adult science fiction got it from "Battlestar Galactica". Sometimes it is possible to "break the mold" and I feel this is exactly what MGM accomplished by hastily forcing this blend of science fiction together.And that's a shame. First off, because the 15 seasons of Stargate SG-1/Atlantis were unique, interesting and fun. It should never have ended so suddenly. Lastly, the second season of "Universe" seemed to start finding itself and showed some promise. It was just unfortunate that it couldn't survive the errors of the first season.I would have even accepted a couple stand-alone movies like "Ark of the Truth" and "Continuum" to have dealt with the season two cliff-hanger properly winding the show up. Though promised, I fear we will never see these. In a dorky way it would be cool to find a 10th Chevron that dialed the show back onto the airwaves.Note: You are right if you noticed that I did buy a copy of this DVD by "Amazon's Verified Purchase" notation. I confess. I love the Stargate franchise so much, and even though these two seasons are woefully inferior, there were cameos that forever connect it and therefore makes it necessary to have in the collection. I just waited till Amazon had a crazy sale to buy them.
This series has none of the draw of the two previous, mostly because the characters have absolutely no depth, nor does there seem much of a chance that any will be developed. There's simply nothing to connect with. There's not a single figure who is likeable, funny, worthy of loathing...nothing. I gave it five episodes, and that's it. Too bad; "Stargate" and "Stargate Atlantis" ranks as two of my favorite TV shows of all time. This stunk.
I really enjoyed the various incarnations of Stargate-until SGU.  I hate to say it but SGU is just plain boring.  The plots are sadly lacking and there is just no chemistry.  The actors do a good job with what they have to work with but it is just not enough.  I watched eight episodes hoping it would get interesting before I gave up.  I wouldn't buy this series in any form no matter how cheap they offered it.
Don't waste your time on this series.  It's like watching one of the stupid daytime soap operas that never go anywhere.
Too much attention placed two male type major characters. I sick of them by the end of the season. Needed more plits
This outta be the typical review the lovers of this show are probably used to by now... surely enough, I love the movie, SG-1 & Atlantis... but cannot stand this one.Why? Well, I can't put enough emphasis on the word BORING. It sums up most of the shows. The first episode looked promising. The SGC had discovered that dialing a 9th symbol on the Stargate could possibly take them somewhere even further than the Pegasus galaxy. There is a very large team from Earth on another planet at the far reaches of two galaxies, attempting to discover what dialing the 9th symbol leads to? Out of nowhere the planet they are on comes under attack all of a sudden by aliens, and whomever was not beamed up by Scotty had to make a run for it through the gate to the mystery of where the 9th symbol leads to.Upon escaping through the gate, they find themselves on an unmanned alien space ship that is losing power and falling apart. From then on the first couple of episodes are up and down, sometimes they have interesting things going on, but for the most part it is a lot of boring dialog between characters I, and I know many other viewers too, just could not find likable.There is a stubborn scientist, a dork who beat a computer game and was asked to join the group to lend his expertise in being attempt at a non military or scientific perspective, a young girl who is irritating, boring, not in anyway any sort of eye candy, and certainly not a strong female role model like SG1 and Atlantis provided plenty of. The only thing noteworthy of her is her father eats peaces of BLEEP for breakfast. Being that she looks 16, no normal hot blooded male over 18 is going to be watching her for other reasons than acting either... so it's a losing situation either way. Not to mention, she seems to be a BLEEP (rhymes with bore) and the crush the dork has on her is more annoying than anything, because I just don't care if they end up together or not when he's focusing on her during every waking moment he's not being told to hack into the alien ships computer and do something life saving... like unblocking the toilets.Many other characters are just as bad. In fact, no one is good at all. A blonde bimbo always doubting her medical abilities, Chun Li still trying to keep everything political by worrying about paper work rather than except the fact she is a million miles away from home and may never return, the colonel who is always being praised for how good he is supposed to be by his men, who always seem to be on the edge of insanity or blubbering like babies, which the colonel does himself when he's not saying pointless dialog or switching bodies with Richie Valan's and porking his missus. We had such great colonels in SG1 and Atlantis, O'Neil, Carter, Sheppard etc... and now we get a guy who looks as threatening as Carrot Top flicking cotton balls at you. I would even take the last two seasons of Stargate SG1's team over everyone in this show!The rest of the cast pretty much mostly seem to be day players/extras and stand ins just to make it seem like there is plenty of more opportunities for more characters to come in later in the series, but i'm at the end of the first series now, and overall I think I have been entertained by about 15 minutes in total during the whole running of the season. So I just don't care if anyone new comes in for season 2. It blew it's chance by becoming a soap opera rather than everything we came to love about SG1 and Atlantis.I'm not sure it even comes down to bad writing, I think it's the boring cast and how the whole thing is being preformed. The biggest thing that's making it boring is the humor... or should I say, the lack of humor. This show has little to none at all. It's mostly dark hallways and pointless dialog about their personal issues with each other or whether Eli or Rush should be the ones fiddling with alien computer programs to try and activate this and that thing to re-route power to shields, weapons or  a device that can give the annoying chick a new brain. (it happens, sigh). The rest is tedious dialogs of complaining, winging and arguments between them, taking most of the focus off of any sci-fi elements... it clearly stands out this season did not have a big enough budget to design better sets, aliens, or interesting new technologies. There was something for everyone, old and young, sci fi fan or not in SG-1 and Atlantis, this SGU version, it's the worst idea for Days of Our Lives in Space that could have ever been conceived.Excitement is too far and in between. Even when guys like Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks and Amanda Tapping make guest appearances, it just does not make the show better. Everything about it is wrong. It's not just the lack of humor, or adjusting to new cast members, it's the entire atmosphere of the show. With SG-1 and Atlantis, you never knew what was going to happen in the next episode... but watching SG-U, you know what's going to keep happening, and the new things that do happen, all I can say is zzzzzzzzzzzzzz... it was like reliving the end days of WCW Nitro. Repetitive, boring and no imagination. You know from the first few episodes it's always going to be Eluid hacking this, Rush's new theory on that, whats her name boring you to death with how pointless she is, moring interactions and dull emotions by the rest, and a sleazy scene thrown in now and then to try and attract 13 year olds whose mom's put net nanny on their computers.I really can't say it enough about how boring I found the majority of this show to be. Nothing at all worked. I still hold hopes that a Stargate finale movie or season will get financed to wrap everything in SG-1 and Atlantis up. The word about the script that was written to do so mentioned it tied together and wrapped up all 3 Stargate shows... quite frankly, if it does get made, I couldn't care less if SG-U has anything to do with it, as it is the black sheep of the Stargate Universe, the actual universe, not the show with that name.And another thing... the music and soundtrack. The film, SG-1 and Atlantis had amazing scores, full orchestras that provided music that even if you didn't pay much attention to it, it never interfered with the scenes, it built up intensity, set the moods for action, or made you feel emotional when it needed to be... yet this SG-U show seems to have none of that. Not even a decent title sequence theme. It copies the dumb formula from Grey's Anatomy and inserts some stupid, depressing song, and plays it in it's entirety... what where they thinking when they through that would be a good idea? And the so called "creative" and edgy soundtrack turned out to be nothing more than irritating noises. One particular episodes music was actually giving me such a headache I ejected the DVD and threw it across the room, never wanting to hear ten minutes of what sounded like a spanner being smashed into a pipe every 7 seconds with a god awful dull slow humming noise... whoever recorded that should be expelled from ever creating music for TV/Movies ever again.There is so much more I could point out on what I hated about this show, but if this information I've mentioned already doesn't convince you this show sucks, or you can understand why I'm far from being alone on hating this show, then nothing will.
I should just keep my mouth shut.  But could not tolerate this show at all.  Lame.  They just recycled the Stargate saga, but out came trash.  I love the Stargate stuff, but this was just lame lame lame.
BOO FOR PBS. I was very disappointed that only three episodes were free for Prime Members and the remaining were for purchase. American Experience was a broadcast from Public Television which the U.S. Taxpayers support, whether they like it or not, from their taxes. To have PBS peddling this program for their monetary gain is appalling to me. This program can rot on the shelf before I would consider looking at it again.
As I wrote in my review of season one, season two was going to make or break Sanctuary. And it broke.Only watched the DVD set, so perhaps if I had spaced it out a bit, it might not have been so bad. Ms Tapping's acting ability failed to come to work with her, effects didn't improve (in some cases were worse), the werewolf guy is still a miscast (it shows more in this season). And just before I started writing this, I see there's a season three!?! Poor sci-fi/fantasy fans. There's so little really good stuff to watch, that some of us will take anything.No more Sanctuary for me. Ever. No surprise amazon has season two "on sale".
Tosh.0 is not for me.  I find his humor pedantic and crass.  I know many people enjoy this show.  So if you like your humor on the bawdy side maybe this one is for you.
This show had so much promise.  Sure some of the characters were dreadful in dialogue.  Yes, you could tell things were off to a slow start.  But when the V first hit Earth it's all very exciting.  Then the show was thrown into a pile of trash, and is generally not worth watching.  I recommend watching the series until the V introduce themselves on the giant undership screens, then hit your foot with a hammer, and save yourself the time of watching anything further.
I wanted to like this show, but it was just so incredibly bad.  The story is poorly executed in the very crucial sense that there's very little true drama, no intensity, no suspense, no humor, no heart, very little action.  In short, the story lacks the absolute critical elements (or ingredients) that go into good story-telling and consequently the show was not entertaining.  The only real story seemed to be the supposedly-friendly-acting-but-really-sinister aliens (aka the Visitors or the Vees) have some super secret evil plan that a handful of humans and "truly friendly" aliens are trying to reveal and stop.  That single lone storyline takes up the entire season and it flimsily and boringly drags on and on and on for the entire first season with a few vapid sub-stories thrown in.  So the season was really boring since the story never seemed to progress, mature or truly go anywhere.  Watching it was frustrating.  And making matters worse is the fact that all the characters are boring and uninteresting--the FBI agent, the Priest, the hammy over-the-top Mercenary-type, the friendly "black guy" alien--are all boring.  The writing is so weak on this show.  The acting is bad.  The SFX are bad--I've never seen worse green screen SFX shots on any TV show.  For a truly good SCI-FI TV re-make, check out the re-do/re-make of "Battlestar Galactica" (Seasons 1-3).  That was an excellent re-make of an older SCI-FI TV show.  This remake of V is a colossal disappointment.
Don't like subtitles in my movies.  Most Asian movies turn me off completely..  They are not my idea of entertainment
I really liked this movie and wanted own a copy, what I got was a press release.  I am a little annoyed that this is all I got.  I'm currently looking at how I can delete it from my library.
i do not know who in the family was watching this one no one will admit to having watched it.
I used to like this guy. But the show is not funny not funny not funny. I did not bother seeing more than one episode and I doubt I will see another one. I could not even finish the first one. Really surprising.
This is what happens when a comedian burns out. Dunham's entire thing is his puppets, with which he insults his audience and gets away with it.  On a personal comedy-club level, this is acceptable. Once commercialized with music and fake laugh tracks, this show went to hell. In Dunham's case, since his entire show is based upon puppets, to come up with new material, you have to come up with new puppets. The scenarios that he has come up with...visiting real people and businesses and warping out obnoxiousness for humor's sake...is NOT funny. Let's not forget Dunham is JNew W*rld Ord*r and his denigration of and overt racism for the White Christian and Muslim races is nothing short of criminal! You see what his race of people REALLY thinks about other races on the planet! His stuff is NOT funny and he's reached the end of his rope...perhaps he'll hang himself with it!
"The Jeff Dunham Show" is a Comedy Central offshoot of Jeff Dunham's live shows using the familiar characters Walter, Achmed, Bubba J, Sweet Daddy Dee, Peanut, and Jose Jalapeno. In this seven episode season, Dunham introduces his characters onstage in front of an audience and then goes to a clip of them out in the real world trying to interact with other people.Watching the show, the format is VERY similar to the Dave Chappelle Show where he would interact with the audience and introduce segments and then go to the clip in a sketch comedy sort of way. However, the difference between Dave Chappelle and Jeff Dunham was that Chappelle was really good at this. When Dunham takes his characters out in public, the audience is supposed to believe they are real people and other actors and celebrities talk to the puppets. For example, Brooke Hogan is set up with Peanut on a date until Peanut "eats" some guacamole laced with nuts that he is allergic to and Achmed intercepts the date to put the moves on her. We see the characters' feet, dancing with other people, shooting guns, all sorts of things.If you like these characters and think they are funny on their own, than this show will probably work for you and you'll enjoy it. The magic of the previous live show format was that everyone marveled at Dunham's ability to DO these characters since ventriloquism isn't easy and there was always potential for him to start cracking up too much or making a mistake or Achmed's arm falling off which would increase the hilarity of any given bit. Taking the "live" quality out of the format with everything being pre-taped in these segments means they could have used as many takes as they wanted to finish a scene, so it just isn't as impressive as when it is done on the spot. Also the scenes themselves just aren't written that funny anyway.The concept of Jeff Dunham having his own show sounds great, but this format does not work for his brand of comedy and talents effectively.Bonus Features:Behind the Scenes shows the making of sketches of Achmed joining the Marines and also Achmed's funeral. Jeff Dunham is smart enough to know that Achmed is one of his most universally liked characters due to his talking in a wittle cute voice and varying inbetween that and temper rages. These segments aren't more than a few minutes and include some Comedy Central Promos.The unaired sketch is with Sweet Daddy Dee, a character I don't even remember from other specials I've seen from Jeff Dunham. He apparently gets to wear lots of chain bling and slang. His cut scene is Sweet Daddy Dee helping Germans get rid of an acapella group singing in the attic. Yes, the attic. He turns them into a Bavarian singing group to save them and when the Germans still don't like them, Nazi and "The Sound of Music" jokes abound. A good choice to cut.The bloopers show that his live bits introducing scenes often had to be retaped, especially when he starts coughing. He often forgets his lines and starts laughing and stuff goes wrong with the puppets getting their hands stuck on walls.
I guess I'm the odd one because I found it to be rather stupid - sorry, couldn't think of another word to describe my feelings about it. I decided to fast forward through, hoping to come to something that would be interesting, funny, good.... Just when I thought it couldn't get any stupider, the girlfriend shows up and voila, it got stupider. Even the ending, which was supposed to be a "gotcha" I guess, just didn't have any juice. Was also difficult to see Meg Ryan, whom I'd always enjoyed, with the beginnings of messing up her face. A pathetic and somewhat creepy story.
When she is informed by her husband of thirteen years that he is leaving her for another woman, Louise does what every self-respecting woman in her position would do: she conks him over the head, duct-tapes him to a chair, and threatens to hold him prisoner till he comes to his senses. Thus, for an hour-and-a-half, we're forced to watch as two self-indulgent crybabies - one a cheat, the other a raving psychotic - thrash out the details of their relationship in a tone so grating and mean-spirited that before long we're ready to send in our own hostage-negotiating team just to bring an end to all of our suffering.Despite the presence of Meg Ryan, Tim Hutton, Kristen Bell and Justin Long in key roles, "Serious Moonlight," directed by Cheryl Hines and written by the late Adrienne Shelly (both of "Waitress" fame), is a hopelessly contrived, endlessly off-putting dark romantic comedy (a la "The War of the Roses," albeit without the courage of that film's ending) that, I guess, is supposed to be every cheated-on spouse's idea of the perfect wish-fulfillment revenge fantasy (even if the fantasy winds up going awry in the end). But the claustrophobic setting, the sadistic tone, and the sheer unpleasantness of it all make it an excruciating experience to sit through. At one point, Hutton seems to be speaking for the audience when he states, "It's like torture." That's about as astute an example of built-in self-criticism as I've ever come across in a movie.
Mind you, this review is coming from someone who could care less about the STAR TREK series and films. I went along with a few friends to see this, and while I really enjoyed the first forty minutes, the rest of the film was rather weak. I didn't care for any of the characters. Maybe it's just me. Science fiction is my least favorite genre. I can say this: the acting was well done. I was surprised by how good they were. Bravo to the actors. As for the rest of the film, well, lets just say I won't be seeing it again.See it if you must. Trekkies will get a lot more out of the film than I did. In fact, I'm sure they'll have a blast.
Not what I thought it would be...name is a little misleading. Perhaps I should have thought about it before selecting it for review.
Very disappointed wouldn't recommend it at all! It downloaded good but other than that it isn't worth any ones time!
This looked like an advertisement and not a movie or entertainment.  I simply could not watch all of it as it seemed a complete waste of time!
Wow, what a pile of trash this show turned out to be... I guess obnoxious, sexist, chauvinist, offensive, disgusting, neanderthal humor is not my cup of tea, I would call this a guttural deeply embedded teenage boy fantasy goop comedy wannabe. I regret even watching the single episode of this trash. If you like this kind of show, have fun, but be warned it reaches way under the gutter of impropriety for its kicks... you've been warned. The series is rated "M" for mature of audiences... what demographic are these folks pushing for? Definitely not "Mature" that's for sure.
I like action movies, etc. , how ever this attempt at launching another (Batman) falls real short of being believable.  I tried watching several episodes but could not get over the feeling of it being ridiculous.
This series was not as funny or interesting as I remember it to be.  I was disappointed.Why is there a minimum word usage
The description for the Eclipse is 100% completely *wrong*.  This is NOT a suspense- it's a romance with subtle elements of drama.  We were all fooled into thinking this was some kind of horror story involving a ghost writer being tormented but it's anything but.  We were also fooled into believing there would be serious discussions involving what it feels like to actually witness a ghost for real and how the human mind feels after witnessing such a traumatic event.Instead it's about a ghost writer who meets a woman who shares similar interests in ghostly activity and they gradually fall in love.  Of course there's another guy in the picture, who's apparently a boxer.  Well the two guys hate each other and are secretly jealous over the woman without actually coming out and admitting it.  Instead we discover that the boxer basically believes the ghost writer is a stalker, while the ghost writer believes the boxer is a drunk.There's only two segments that are worth your time.  One takes place about an hour in when the ghost writer opens his bedroom closet and a scary event takes place in the floorboards, and the other is the fist fight between the two men above.  That's it.  The rest of the storytelling is meaningless and painful to watch.It's a shame too- this movie looks like it takes place in either Ireland or the gorgeous countrysides of England which are *perfect* locations for a horror setting.  Instead it doesn't even try for a supernatural setting.  I recommend skipping it completely.
There is no mystery in this movie what so ever; there are no ghosts; there is nothing supernatural. Just ignorance. Everyone has lost someone that they love but to randomly toss in a couple of fakey slightly scarred head shots in spots that make no sense (e.g. in the car seat next to you; under some stuff in a room) or a couple of brief ghostly apparition scenes lasting a few seconds that do nothing - please! That any of these mysteries are part of illusionary compensation for losing someone is beyond belief. Also, to intermingle and confuse the one story line with another with an artificial good guy - bad guy - cute girl love triangle seems to be added to appease a certain viewing demographic but has no other function in this supposedly "spine-tinglingly" supernatural thriller.Finally, what does an eclipse have to do with the fundamental plot/story of the movie?
What a horrible bunch of garbage. Did you read Julius Caesar in high school. Well, even if you hated it, this version of it is way worse.
I did not get past the first 5 minutes.  It is absolutely the worst acting, the worst script,, the &#34;dirtiest filming by perverted camerament&#34; and probably perverted directors.  It is too bad that Hollywood cannot seem to get its head out of the cesspool of degenerative morality. This is not recommended in any way, shape or manner. I suggest Hollywood come out of the closet and admit it is only interested in pornographic, tasteless, sophomoric scriptwriting.
I agree with other comments about how this video is not good for the family to watch.  Moral values of this film are very poor.I did not even get very far into the movie before seeing way too much sex and nudity. I would not recommend this movie to anyone with moral values.
Corny plot,soap opera acting!!! Very poor production,will not watch any further episodes.Do not bother unless you are interested in &#34;Dallas&#34; in different costumes !
South Park is wonderful!  Comedy Central's censorship and cowardice is deplorable.  Maybe someday Comedy Central will realize the importance of art and the first amendment.  Until that day, I am sure as hell not giving them money for this blu ray.
This was probably the best season so far. Luckily I saw 200 & 201 when they were aired on TV (censored of course) but the fact that they are censored on DVD is complete BULL****!!!! I can't believe that Comedy Central released this DVD and still censored it.Usually I buy the seasons so I can watch them without commercials and UNCENSORED but I'm content with watching this season online for FREE. I returned this DVD to the store the next day. Comedy Central doesn't need my money anymore.
Yeah, I know it is a cartoon but still it conjures up he real thing when I watch it. i only watched part of the first episode. Had to stop since I did not enjoy the subject manner and also the style of the cartoon was not on par with my other favorites. Just was not interesting to me.
This tv show is so bad it is virtually unwatchable. The characters are horrible at acting and stupid. The plots are boring and uneventful. And it is not the slightest bit funny. This show is nothing more than the average boring generic sitcom trash that is on nickelodeon these days. Don't waste your money.
Okay, had to turn it off.  I did start skimming through scenes, trying to find some shred of intelligence, originality or even just thought...but all were sorely missing.AWFUL movie.  Don't waste your time on it.
In ZOMBIE FARM,  FBI scientists have developed a chemical agent that helps in their interrogations of suspected terrorists. Unfortunately, the drug has a wicked side effect. It turns people into -all together now- flesh-eating zombies! Not surprisingly, zombies are created, go on a rampage, and eat the living. Then, the water supply is contaminated w/ the stuff, causing further murderous mayhem! There's even a zombie mailman on the loose! Luckily, the local muscle-bound, psycho has lots and lots of guns! Oh yeah, there's a group of cannibal hillbillies running around as well. They eat rats. If only they had eaten the sole existing print of this &#34;film&#34;...
This movies was okay if you're really into zombies and watch every zombie movie that comes out. I've seen a lot better.
Im all for low budget, b-movies but this one didn't even seem to try. Acting is poor. The sound and sound mixing is terrible. The premise is good but the execution couldn't have been worse. With zombies ALL AROUND YOU, how is it that these characters never paid attention to their surroundings and were constantly caught off guard&#8230; Theres a certain level of stupidity portrayed in these movies that's forgivable and tolerable but this movie takes the cake&#8230; can I give a rating lower than one please?
Because we don't like it because it has rain because I did not like it didn't like that show no.
Apparently these Mystery Science Theatre movies all have a built-in front row of &#34;hecklers&#34; in them. they weren't funny, just annoying and distracting. if it hadn't been for that I might have watched it, but kept fast-fowarding it thinking they would be gone but no luck. How stupid.
As a Jew I was shocked by the bigotry of this piece of trash.  It's been a long time since I've seen such crude stereotyping of us.  This is not a well-written finely observed comedy.  The anti-semitism isn't strident, but couched in a series of lame jokes.  At one point of emotional breakthrough, the muslim main character purposefully punches out a rabbi while he is praying.  It's hard to imagine that Muslims would be happy with this either, as the main character is certainly made out to be woefully uneducated about other faiths.  What a piece of dreck.  (Look it up in an Yiddish dictionary!)
Both the film and the subject. I've never seen a group of more dysfunctional and dangerous people ever. Not worth the time. Who wants to know about people of this ilk anyway. Yuk.
It doesn't get any better throughout the entire movie. The characters are so flat, one-dimensional, and I didn't care what happened to any of them.
My daughter and I struggled all the way through this  . . . movie. It was almost impossible to understand the dialogue. We had to look up the summary online to even know what was going on. We spent a good part of the time saying to each other, &#34;What did he/she say?&#34; I love movies with character and plot development; but if this movie had those, I must have missed it. We dismissed the review that said it was boring - need four more words - boring, boring, boring, boring. They were so right. The only good part that was noted was Colin Farrell's lovely accent. If only the movie had had a good sound engineer!
Background: A Selkie is a mythological sea creature that can become human.This movie consisted of the following stereotypic formula pieces tossed together to form the script such as: single divorced alcoholic fisherman; disabled daughter; dysfunctional mom and step father; suspicious town folk; homespun priest; Selkie brings good luck to the fisherman and daughter; criminal element added as a threat to the Selkie.Overall this Selkie interpretation seemed disjointed and shallow; lacking emotional depth and mystery. Not as good as "The Seventh Stream".
Are you f'ning kidding me?! this is an excuse for hipster parents to seem cool. I am sorry nothing in this show has every brought me, my kids or the world joy. I put this on the other day for my 1 and a half year old and my 5 year old. My youngest watched it for like 5 minutes and vomited, and the older one begged me to turn it off, HE BEGGED!!
my kid put this on, but i would not pick it myself, you don't really learn anything from this show, just crazy characters doing goofy stuff.  i rather my kid watch something where they learn, like dinosaur train or sid the science kid.
So you want me to believe that all these animals live together? and one is a 3ft ant? Now my kid is like I dont want giant ants eating us dad, his grandfather was killed by ants (in the war) and his uncle was killed by his Aunt (he does not understand ant/aunt yet) anyhow he watched this and now he has begun to wet the bed... thanks.
The content was more adult oriented and way over my kid's head.  WHy would they market this towards small kids?
We found it difficult to get into - didn't seem to be building the characters in an easy way.  Also some of the accents were hard to decipher.  Probably just not our cup of tea.
I'm sorry but I couldn't get through the first episode. I was just too morose. The character development was hideous.
I only now just started watching Pretty Little Liars.While they are currently on something like season 4 I believe, I had trouble getting halfway through season one. What a ridiculous show. I started watching when nothing else was on. Even that isn't reason enough to continue. My complaints with the ridiculousness and inconsistency in this show are to many to list. The stupid decisions these girls make border on insulting to the intelligence of the audience. No matter what the target viewer is. The romanticized relationship between an English teacher (whom would be at the very least 24) and his 16 year old student is just irresponsible.  I can't image any parents thinking this show is ok viewing for their young teens or any adult finding this entertaining.
Wait, there is an Asian character in the show?  Is she the main character? No. Oh so it is like every other show about snotty evil white people.  I'm bored. Really really bored of this stuff.  I don't even see pictures any more.  It's just a blur of white people, credit cards, and soft porn.  I keep hoping to see something different but nothing ever changes.
Intriguing at times, but  the smart people sure are dumb. Startied out liking the first couple episodes, but the lead analyst investigating the conspiracy is so haphazard, he would have been killed early on. And why would a filthy rich widow investigate her husbands death alone and continues to investigate even after a direct death threat. The show and plot were just very weak and unbelievable.
You don't really care what happens to the characters - - everyone is so flat.  The main character frowns a lot, looks at the same object over and over, no emotion at all.  Somehow I watched the whole thing, waiting for something to happen.  You never think &#34;I can't wait to see what happens&#34; because you don't really get involved if everything is so disconnected.  I can't imagine there being a second season for this.
The series started out OK, but after three episodes, I lost interest. Hard to figure out just what the point is and how the characters interact. Not much suspense, particularly at end of episodes to keep the viewer coming back. Yawn.
Series gets high marks in intrigue, character development, and acting. The path of its story is believable, even plausible for 11episodes.  Then suddenly we are expected to believe that a handful of old, white males are controlling the fate of the free world by manipulating those who are sworn enemies to the &#34;west&#34;.  Soooo, the world we see in Rubicon is in sharp contrast to that we see depicted in &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; (supposedly true events set to drama). Either it takes exhaustive intelligence resources, years of analysis, and unexpected good fortune to finally make breakthrough in finding the most high-profile terrorist in the world-- or, as portrayed in &#34;Rubicon&#34;, the whole material world is controlled-not by an industry, or a conglomerate of industries- but a few conspirators. Such an outlandish assumption REQUIRES adequate explanation. Otherwise, the story is an insult to those fighting our battles- and their loved ones. No wonder this series stopped production when it did. The storytellers wound themselves up so tight in their own trap, there was no way to continue with anyone to follow.
I don't know where to start because it was that uninteresting. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else, you'll be more entertained with anything but this show.
I used to enjoy Futurama, but not anymore. It is almost like Matt Groening is saying how far left can we go. It is amazing to me how anti-christian this show has gone. This eposide is just anothe rexample. I still watch the show sometimes, but only on TV. I will not pay for this show and I turn the channel when it starts to get to be to much.Sad to see Futurama destroyed like this.
I REALLY HATE IT BECASUE I DON'T LIKE IT THAT WAS REALLY SCARY AND WE DO NOT LIKE IT THAT WAS OK
I don't like it all it was very great that was for adults and was not beautiful and that is not pretty
Elijah Wood is repugnant in the sex scenes. He should stick to playing elfs.  The script and plot are boring and badly executed. There are some fine actors stuck in this awful mess. Don't waste your time.
My big problem with this film is that it simply does not flow. It's like a composition that meanders all over the place and does not fully explore any thesis. Characters do things which one simply wouldn't do in real life. If I was a graduate student at Oxford, I surely wouldn't drop the "F" bomb on a Don whom I want to become my mentor. Romantic relationships appear "out of the blue." Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time. It's a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at, but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly, other than her looks, Ms. Watling doesn't impress much either. Hurt spends his time pontificating and the whole thing is a jumble. Don't bother with it.
Have you ever known someone that thought they were just the cleverest mind in the circle - that had that self indulgent, narcissistic belief that they and they alone could create or solve the most convoluted brain teasers. OK, well maybe some of those attributes. Well, this movie was the film incarnation of that person. Just a predictable boring studio's pointless production of contrivance.
We opened this because the storyline sounded provocative - a mystery at Oxford.  It was not very intriguing starting out, but...willing to wait (sometimes a story has to &#34;warm up.&#34;)  This one became purient-plus (I realize that there is not such word, but how else to emphasize the content of this movie), and must admit we cannot give a full review - we turned it off.  Guess we were naive, for such an open sexual exhibition was not something we would have expected (unless the movie were rated R or xxx - which this one was not.)  We would say that it was right up the alley for a voyeur.  Suggestive is one thing, but this was eversomuch more.Therefore, can say if you enjoy visual sex, this is the movie for you. If not, would advise you to look elsewhere.
After watching it for 15 minutes with my wife, I turned it off.  It was just too confusing of a plot and I have heard enough of the new morality philosophy.  ugh!!!
I couldn't watch past 30 minutes....actually, on the 15th minute I went to make some tea which didn't help, by the way. The acting is just terrible, not believable....skip it, it's not worth it. I can't believe you had to pay 9.99 to watch it on demand when it came out originally.
This sounded good but it was bad. The gratuitous sex was unnecessary, and the overacting wasn't pleasant. The story didn't seem plausible either.
Unenlightened drivel, acting high brow.  Full of foul language throughout, as far as I know (I couldn't finish the last fourth of the movie because I was so offended by the continued foul language and intolerance of religious persons).  I was hoping it would get better s it went along, showing the professor and his students were mistaken in their beliefs.  But alas they never learned the truth because they did not even want to believe there is truth.  What kept me going for as long as I did was seeing how these atheists act and think.  It did remind me of the bullying done at universities to Christians.
Fell asleep......Fell asleep......Fell asleep......Fell asleep......Fell asleep......You need to find and direct better shows. As a Harvard , Yale film student this is a C grade
I never made it to the first commercial break. This is a stupid vapid show. You can easily skip this one.
Way too cutesy and not very intelligent. Not believable. I guess I need some grit in my tv watching. Watch Alias instead.
If I could give this show a less than zero rating, I would. The lead character is obnoxious, rude and just made me want to hurl something at the TV screen. I can't beleive I wasted $1.99 I can't tell you how much this character annoyed me. I watched the entire episode because I thought it would improve. It didn't. Don't waste your time or money on this junk.
I saw the reviews on here and read some internet posts about how great this show was, so I bought it. I'd seen a clip of the show on the internet and thought it was interesting, but the lead just gave me bad vibes. Watching the first three episodes last night, I just couldn't take it anymore! Callie, his love interest, is totally annoying. She is a nurse who also goes to medical school and has a son. Jim is a know-it-all punk who always magically has the upper hand. There is no explanation at all for why or how he outsmarts everyone, he just does. The characters is very smug and unlikeable. Maybe he appeals to narcissistic Generation X and Y types, but not me. Furthermore, Jim doesn't have any depth. He is in jerk mode all of the time. He's not even vulnerable. This is the worst written show on TV!The character is just not believable as a cop. He acts like a rich prep schooler. I believe that he is supposed to be middle-class, but the writers probably can't even comprehend how to create a middle-class character, so they based one off of their own privileged lives. It's almost like they couldn't stand writing Callie as just a nurse, so they made her a nurse who is trying to be a doctor! Now she's classy enough for the show!I got bored during episodes. The shows I watched began with a murder, then just became disjointed as time went on. Jim would investigate, meet up with Callie, make sarcastic comments, then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly. The Carlos Gomez character is the only interesting one that comes across as human, but even he has no chemistry with the lead.I just couldn't stand the show anymore and I put it up for sale. I really don't recommend it.
