Mysteries are interesting.  The tension between Robson and the tall blond is good but not always believable.  She often seemed uncomfortable.
Funny, interesting, a great way to pass time. I usually enjoy standup comedy and is this is a good show for me.
I love the variety of comics.  Great for dinner TV entertainment because of length of each episode.  Many of the featured comics have gone on to even bigger TV specials so it's great to see some of their earlier material.
I enjoyed the first season a lot. The 4 main characters are very funny with their self centered ways. The second season they added Danny Devito  (Frank Reynolds) as the deranged father figure. Now most of the story lines revolve around him. Not as funny. Maybe it's better to just leave well enough alone.
I was pleasantly surprised with this "out of the box" series.  Good writing, good acting, laugh out loud situations.  Devito showing up in the second season gave it a little boost as he's always dependable for turning the mundane into the hilarious.It's basically about 3 jackass friends in Philly who own a bar and get themselves into offbeat situations.  What I liked best is that it is not the clice venue for the young and the beautiful.  It often hi-lightes the old and the ugly and in doing so cultivates a good portion of the laughs.Worth you time and money....bg
funny thing. My brother's been trying to get me to watch this show forever. As it turns out, I get the videos of the day, everyday, and one was Charlie Day giving the commencement speech at his alma mater, Merrimack college in New Hampshire. it was then I realized that its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, was his show, and he's from New Hampshire where I'm from also.of course, this is what prompted me to actually start watching the show. I really enjoy it, it almost seems unscripted. The best part is, it's on Amazon Prime for free. How can you beat that!
While I had kind of given up on 24, this is a good return to form for the series. It starts with the assasination of previous president Palmer and as the season advances we see how Jack, who has come back from the dead for many, is confronted with a group of russian separatists who have gotten some nerve gas. The way the story unfolds gets slightly too straightforward from the middle of the season on but it is still quite exciting stuff. Kim comes back for a short period also.
(BEWARE, SOME SPOILERS BELOW)Man, this is really a violent, dark and totally avoid of humour show. But's the beuaty of it: there shows around about very differente themes.The proposal of 24 hours is to give you non-stop action, non-stop twists and, also, a lot of bloodshed. It's interestin also to see through the shows the incredible amount of highly trained, superbly financied and intelliegnt people willing to do harm to good old Uncle Sam, be them American, Muslin, German, Rusian... Also, the terrorists portrayed in the show are capable of mobilizing killer squads in less time than it takes to say "Killer squads"... But, suspension of desbelief is something required to any show (if we wanna just see reality, just check the news, not a show!), since they respect tha canon and "mitology" described by that show itself. In that respect, 24 is respectul to itself.I'm also one of those that consider Season Five the best season of them all. There are so many ingredients. Kim Raver is acting better than ever... the rhythm is breathtaking all the way (although the death toll is incredible high, even by thwe show standards - to kill Almeida, David Palmer, Michelle, Edgar Stiles, all of them in one single season... uau...)Yes, I denitely think this is the best season of 24 until now.
I enjoyed nearly all the seasons of 24 and this is probably my third year I have watched them.  So excited they are bringing the show back though it may be somewhat different.  I enjoy dramas such as &#34;24&#34; and &#34;Covert Affair&#34;.  Good luck to the 24 actors and crew and hope the new show will do well.
It was  Good and funny I enjoy it it is worth watching a family movie Just enjoy  very light  Enjoy
Well, I enjoy them for many reasons. i remember Mark Harmon when he played football for UCLA. He made the right career choice instead of getting banged up and damaged from the NFL he is raking it in with all of these hit series year after year.
Season three opens, with Gibbs going after Kate's killer, Ari. And to try to throw alot at us, NCIS gets a new director, Jenny Shepard played by Lauren Holly. Now Shepard and Gibbs do have some history, since both were partners at NCIS at one time, also. To proclaim Ari's innocence, is Massade officer Ziva David. And I'm sorry, I didn't like her then. And I don't liker her now, She and pretty much all of Massad is built up like they are the only agents that are extremely tough, they're unstoppable. So Ziva and Jenny try to convince Gibbs that he's wrong, and Gibbs even makes the only logical argument against Ari's innocence. That if he were innocent, he would turn himself in. So, after much arguing, he gets Ziva to follow him. And Ziva kills Ari in Gibb's basement, And we get each persons view of how they saw Kate in this episode. Now, I would have inserted Paula Cassidy to the team after this. Since there was some obvious chemistry between her and tony, but no. We get Ziva, and she is built up like I said. As this unstoppable, lean mean killing machine. The best of the best, and I'm sorry, but she's abrasive and annoying. And I still have a hard time accepting her to the team, Gibbs magically trusts her more than any other member of the team. season three is a good season, and Ziva is the on;y reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Although season three does end with almost getting blown up, going into a coma. Waking up from that coma, and thinking it's 1991. And we get to meet Gibbs's mentor, Mike Franks. Which leads to gibbs trying to stop a terrorists attack. Only the generals won't allow it, and Gibbs ends up Quitting NCIS. All in all, season three is still awsome. Like I said before, my only problem is Ziva. The introduction of a new director, and then Gibbs leaving.
Season 3 is much easier to use because CBS Video has splurged on the Play All function and subtitles.  I started to like NCIS with the introduction of Cote de Pablo who looks like a cross between Winona Ryder and Salma Hayek.  This is the season with the "homos on the train" line.
This series has it all in the &#34;crime&#34; solving genre:  Great cast, humor, story lines and gadgetry to keep you coming back for more.  Especially enjoy the new addition replacing Kate's character.
I love this show!  It is interesting and is a show I have great fun watching with my dad when he has time off.  The characters are funny and the banter is excellent.
This is a great example of the &#34;Dr being stuck in ancient earth&#34; theme that shows up over and over in the decades that follow.  Other than the time travel there is not much science fiction here.  It is very interesting to see the Dr interacting with his &#34;crew&#34; and how he is more like the captain of a ship rather than the more active character that he becomes over time.  Probably the most interesting thing about this episode is how it shows the cultural mores of the 1960s.  If you enjoy ancient TV this is a gem.  If you are expecting anything like the modern Dr you probably want to skip ahead a couple decades.
I rated this a 4 star because the film was grainey.  I suppose this is the best it could be after all of these years.  What a treat you start learning about Dr. Who's start
Season 12-16 are getting the same review.  Tom Baker (my dad's favorite) fits not only the role of the Doctor, but also time in Earth 'real time'.  The introduction of the sonic screwdriver, New companions which continue to defy the command 'stay here!!' Short episodes make this a great binge.  The cerebral side of the Doctor as well as 'the classic Dr.smile' grow into the story line.
The Ark in Space is a great story.  It has everything you need for classic SciFi: aliens wrecking spaceships, teleporters, life and death decisions with the human race in the balance and of course the 4th doctor.  It is all here... unfortunately the rest of the season is missing from Amazon.  Sigh....
Compared to today the special effects are comical, but that justs adds to the fun of watching these old shows
In episode #17 (part 1) listen for a bonus at the 2:26 mark, give or take a second.  That being said, Tom Baker's Dr. was the best until the new 2005-present series.  Historically in real time this is a 'post Star Wars' timeline.  Keeping to the look and feel of Dr. Who was getting lost as the 80's progressed but this is still in the good phase of the show's run.
While some of the special effects are so old they detract from the story, Tomb of the Cybermen is still enjoyable to watch.  Troughton as the doctor is great because he shows the snide humor that shines in later doctors.  Sadly because so many of the oldest episodes are missing we don't get the back story of the doctors companions but we do get to start to see some of the origins of the Cybermen mythos.  This is great fun and a must for any fan of the doctor.
if you like Dr. Who it is well worth watching to see some of the history of the show.  It really is too bad that they don't have more of these classic episodes.
I've lived in Boston for many years and have driven on these roads since the day they opened. After ten years, this video is a very interesting look at the past, and the promises vs. the reality of what became of the Big Dig project.Ironically, or perhaps prophetically, the film begins by showing a section of new tunnel (at time = 2:06). This is the EXACT LOCATION where (on July 10, 2006) the ceiling collapsed on a car, killing passenger Milena Del Valle. The heavy concrete panels were glued in place with epoxy cement that had not been applied properly. It was ultimately determined that ceiling panels weren't actually needed in that location, so today, the ceiling that appears in the video is no longer there.Such was the theme for most of the Big Dig's design and construction. Too many things were "never attempted before",  "biggest in the world", "cutting edge", and/or other custom-designed or unproven technologies. At the same time, the well-connected engineering and construction contractors deliberately made things more complicated and expensive than necessary, so as to maximize their own profits. One notorious example of this became known as the "Ginzu Guardrails". Instead of using industry-standard round pipe hand rails in the tunnels, an engineering contractor ordered custom-designed stainless steel hand rails with sharp vertical edges. Besides being much more expensive, they earned the "Ginzu" moniker for their ability to slice through accident victims like a knife! Today, many of the original hand rails have been destroyed in accidents and have not been replaced; other sections have been deliberately removed because they are too dangerous. As was the case for the section of ceiling that collapsed, these hand rails were not really needed at all.Of course, it's not all bad; the I-90 extension to the airport has been a great improvement. The Ted Williams tunnel (a.k.a. the Frozen Head tunnel) was one of the first sections to open and the quality of construction is much better than all of the other tunnel sections that were built later. Unfortunately, most of the tunnels under Boston were built very poorly and most disturbingly of all, were not properly sealed to be watertight. In the winter, the leaking water forms huge icicles and ice patches that require application of large amounts of salt inside the tunnels. The large volume of water; combined with the freeze-thaw cycles and corrosive salt effect; was not something the tunnels were designed for. Consequently, the concrete and steel in the tunnels is deteriorating much more rapidly than expected. In another ill-advised design, the aluminum tunnel ceiling light fixtures were attached with steel brackets. Two dissimilar metals in a moist, corrosive environment are always doomed to corrode, and sure enough, in February 2011 the fixtures began falling into the roadway. (they're now temporarily held in place with plastic tie straps, but must all be replaced) As if the initial construction cost wasn't bad enough, the ongoing maintenance costs of the Big Dig will only get worse as the shoddily constructed sections continue to fall apart.I could go on and on about so many other things, but the bottom line is that the cost of the Big Dig was way more expensive than expected and way more expensive than necessary. So much money was spent on this one project, that there was nothing left for other highway projects in Massachusetts, or for the mass transit projects that were initially promised as mitigation for the environmental effects. For most drivers in Boston, the traffic is just as bad if not worse, but instead of being stuck in traffic on Boston's old elevated Central Artery where at least you had a nice view, now you're stuck in traffic in ugly, filthy, crumbling tunnels.The film ends with another ironic quote at time = 33:03 - "Nobody in five years or ten years is gonna remember the cost, they're gonna look at this thing and say: 'what a beautiful job' ".It would be laughable, if it weren't so very sad.Note for road geeks: Time = 24:05 has a very old aerial view of the Charles River crossing, showing the original elevated ramps that connected the Upper/Lower deck to the Tobin Bridge. Time = 24:42 shows the City Square tunnel under construction in Charlestown, before the loop ramps and Leverett Connector bridge were built.
Some are better than others but overall I enjoyed these. In many cases I was surprised at the enormity of effort, design, and equipment required to do these big jobs.
Love to see where men build and keep striving for better.  It's nice to live in a day when things naturally progress.
It would have been much better if the program shows the specific details they are talking about, instead show the faces of the people speaking about the project.This is a TV show, not a radio.
Not the best show ever made but you do learn.  I would love more in depth info but I do understand there is only so much that a show can divulge.  But I will say you will learn a lot and some episodes are done very well others not so well.  But hey give it a shot you may have an engineer in you waiting to get out.
Interesting and kind of educational. Though the filming isn't the best possible at all times, this is a great show for those of us who wonder about what's true and what's not. I highly recommend for everyone who's curious, and those who like scientific explanations for things.
My grandson ask to watches this all the time.  He is a big fan of this show.  The streaming is excellent so the picture quality and sound is clear.
I like Dora. Both my kids like to watch this show. The music and lessons taught are very helpful. All the interaction with other characters are great and telling Swiper to stop swipping is hilarious, Love all seasons of Dora.
We purchased this season for our daughter who loves Dora using the Amazon Instant Video app for Wii. We have no issues with play or image etc.Unfortunately, my husband and I cannot stand Dora. She sets our teeth on edge. But our daughter loves Dora so we put up with the show. I don't feel that my daughter has gotten much educational value from Dora, to be perfectly honest. She's learned more from Ni Hao Kai-lan, Yo Gabba Gabba, Little Einsteins, and Team Umizoomi. I only took off one star for this since Dora is entertaining for toddlers (admittedly the target audience, not parents) and for some reason kids love her.
My 18m/o loves this show it teachers her friendship, Spanish, and how to solve problems. It is age appropriate too.
my child loves it.  It is the ABC animal episode.  We don't generally like Dora but this specific episode is really cute and keeps my little guys attention.
The grandkids really love Dora the Explorer and is a very good way to learn beginning Spanish a language that they will probably need later on in life.
My two-year old daughter LOVES this show.It's interactive: it engages the viewer to repeat a set of instructions, dance, and shout at Dora's nemesis, Swiper, "Swiper, no swiping!" The cast includes Dora, Boots (her sidekick), the Map (it gives directions to help Dora on her journey), the Backpack (provides a toolkit to resolve any issues), and Swiper the Fox.The show is also educational because it teaches viewers a Spanish word or two during the show. Think Spanish 101. In fact, some people I know brush up on their Spanish by watching a few episodes before taking a Spanish quiz in class (yes, Dora's pretty thorough).The storylines are predictable, yet they are always entertaining to my two-year old. Not a day goes by where she isn't yelling at the TV, "Swiper, no swiping!"
Age appropriate cartoon packed with learning for my little ones. great job with the show options amazon prime. well done
My kids love to interact with Dora. Both my one year old and 3 year old learn with this show.
This video downloaded ok. It did have to buffer it once but I'm not sure if it was my iPad or what but it did great after that, had no problems and I would recommend this video to anyone with little kids!
Two year old likes it, but it is very hard for an adult to watch more than one or two episodes without pulling their hair out.
On our third round of Dora with our youngest and it is still great. Going to miss it when they are too old to watch. :( The blend of math, patterns, comprehension and problem solving is so key to development at the young ages. Dora is great.
The quality is as good as can be expected from a 10-year-old cartoon, but it plays smoothly.  One odd complaint--the Nickelodeon &#34;intro&#34; is MUCH louder than the rest of the cartoon for some reason, and that's consistently true across all of the Dora and Diego cartoons.  When watching you may want to adjust the volume down (or mute) until the intro is done to save your TV speakers and possibly your ears.  The cartoon itself is cute and well-structured for younger children, that eventually understand what Dora is asking for and the order in which things happen on the show.  My 2-year-old girl loves it and would watch an entire season straight through if I'd let her.  It's the first cartoon like this to really capture her attention for an entire episode so that alone makes it worth the recommendation for younger children.
My two year old loves this show. I personally find it kind of annoying, but it wasn't made for adults, was it?
I'll admit, this is not one of my favorite episodes. This episode was not great, but it was okay. It gave you a bit of a background look into Valla and her family. The showing of Vala's father in this was very nice, as we don't know much about her, besides her being a thief before. Also, this was a good opportunity to see Landry and his family a little closer. However, the funniest and most favorite part of mine will always be the ending. Probably one of the funniest scenes in the SG-1 series. I feel so sorry for Teal'c. Good episode.
IT WAS RELLY GOOD I LOVED IT, WAS FUNNY AND PLENTY OF ACTION&#62; I WOULD WATCH IT Again Just Enjoy
While the writers gave us a new enemy in the Ori it also felt a little redundant to do so somewhat since they already were notified that the series would end here. It felt like the writers were hoping that the backers and producers would renew the series for this new saga but after ten years it was time to give the series a decent finale and while you do get the finale it felt a little weak for what the series was.If you already have the other past seasons and for the price of this set I'd say go ahead and add it to your t.v. show collection while not on par with the past eight seasons it still has for the most part an intriguing story and cast to make you watch the season through to the end.
Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show's legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can't point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I'm a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn't mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black's real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I've long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black's Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season's opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha's father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I'm sure there was the temptation of a "Big Ending," but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn't the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn't the most ground breaking.  And it isn't likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used "Science as Magic" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.
This is a spin off from the movie Star Gate with Kurt Russell and James Spader.  The series starts up where the movie left off.The shows were well written, and the acting was good.Of course Richard Dean Anderson gave the show its' sense of humor. Give the show a try.  Based on science fiction it was the cast that gave Stargate SG 1 a 10 year run on TV.
The 200th episode was pretty dumb, and there were too many episodes that got away from the ongoing theme (the Ori), but it was still pretty good, especially for 10 seasons.  Glad they could wrap up the Ori in the follow-on The Arc of Truth movie.  Stargate Atlantis is still the best of all of these Stargate shows.
and everything in between during the 10th season of "Stargate: SG-1". By the way, this ISN'T the end of SG-1 as two direct-to-video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines. During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori, the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Vala (Claudia Black). The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up, new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder well known to sci-fi fans from "Farscape")and Vala (Claudia Black anther "Farscape" alum)providing the show with an additional injection of energy. Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well. Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are (with the exception of a few) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times. The stand-alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on "The X-Files" and "Farscape" these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes. Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina (represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected)where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode. As a long time "Farscape" fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance, they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7. Nothing could be further from the truth. The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neil. The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis (Davis' character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine)who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars (Fred Willard, Robert Picardo a regular on "Star Trek: Voyager" started appearing in season 9) helped spruce up the last season of the show. It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers. Most of you won't notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc. The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8. I'm sure these will show up on Blu-Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one (and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks. They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track), deleted scenes, featurettes in the Director's Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc. We also got the usual assortment of photo and production galleries included as well. There is a trailer that for the first of the two Stargate direct-to-video movies "Stargate SG-1: The Ark of Truth" (the second one also coming in 2008 is "Stargate SG-1: Continuum" involving time travel and reportedly will feature Richard Dean Anderson).The 10th season varies but overall it's a good one that SG-1 fans will enjoy.
This film was a minor letdown after reading all the five star reviews.  There's nothing intrinsically wrong with the film.  My theory is that after years of being out of circulation it's reputation exceeds it's actual artistic worth.  Everything here is aces, though.  Good direction, atmosphere and writing.  The acting is superb with the stolid Robert Mitchum leading the cast.  I particularly liked Steven Keats' gundealer and Richard Jordan's duplicitous fed.  I think we've been spoiled by the high quality of films in this genre with Sidney Lumet's "Prince of the City" and Martin Scorsese's "The Departed".  Recommended without reservation but not as enthusiastically as some.
An essay by David Mamet turned me on to George V. Higgins, and, completest that I am, I devoured all his novels.  He is the smartest dialogue writer I have ever read.  Last year's &#34;Killing Them Softly&#34; got the wit, zing, and poetry just right, and the delivery by Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini was  amazing.Robert Mitchum is more realistic in his approach, so, while the dialogue is not delivered with the great timing of Pitt and Gandolfini, his physical presence is completely believable as the low-level mobster, Eddie Coyle.Otherwise, kind of plodding.
"The Friends of Eddie Coyle", adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins, is exemplary of the kind of film noir that was unique to the 1970s. It shares the chaotic noir world with films of the 1940s, but protagonist is fast being rendered irrelevant by a rapidly changing world where even corruption isn't what it used to be, and he knows it. It's fitting, then, that the protagonist should be played by an aging Robert Mitchum, conflicted hero of more than a few films of the classic noir cycle. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a hood who runs guns for the Boston mob. Caught in a recent trucking job set up by his bar-owning friend Dillon (Peter Boyle), Coyle is looking at a probable 3-5 years in prison. He can't afford to do the time, so he considers snitching on his gun supplier to a federal agent, Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), but the feds are more interested in a recent string of bank robberies.Eddie Coyle is a man from another era. He ponders how much and whom he is willing to betray to keep himself out of prison. He paternalistically lectures his young gun supplier (Steven Keats) about how rough the business is and the importance of caution and reliability. Eddie is playing by some old rulebook that is no longer applies. He doesn't realize he's being played by just about everyone. He catches on too late to how the game of cops and robbers is currently conducted. "The Friends of Eddie Coyle" was an ironic title for a cynical and depressed era. Made the year the Watergate scandal broke, it's hardly surprising that law enforcement is portrayed as no more ethical than outright criminality. Shot on location in Boston, director Peter Yates' style is unadorned but includes a lot of procedure -how guns are obtained and banks robbed- that enhance the film's aura of authenticity.The DVD (Criterion Collection 2009): Spine #475. Bonus features are a Stills Gallery of 22 behind-the-scenes images captioned by director Peter Yates and a feature commentary by Yates, recorded in 2009. This is one of Yates' favorite 3 films of the 25 films he directed. He talks about choosing the locations, the cast and performances, including a lot about Mitchum's work on this film, his own "style of reality and simplicity", and the filmmaking process. Also included is a booklet featuring an essay by film critic Kent Jones and a 1973 profile of Robert Mitchum from "Rolling Stone".
The story lines and acting are superb in Season Three of Stargate Atlantis.  The best thing about the series is the varying episodes emotions from humor (Tao of Rodney & Irresistible) to sadness (Sateda & Sunday).  I really feel the actors are comfortable with their characters and are willing to explore more.  As always, I love the extras.  The behind the scenes and the commentaries are always good.  This is definately worth the purchase.
At first I was hesitant to start watching the series because I really liked SG-1 and didn't want to be disappointed. After watching the first season I was hooked.
I just finished watching the third season DVD set, and while Stargate Atlantis is still my favorite Sci-Fi show, I was rather disapointed.Here's why.(Warning!  Spoilers below!)First, story arc failure. I was expecting a huge advancement in the story arc concerning the Wraith, but it just didn't happen.  Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn't seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I'm dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the "weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode "The Naked Time" and wasn't it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of "ancients" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the "ancients" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn't an "ancient" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn't that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There's so much that could have been done with them that wasn't.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there's Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he's still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there's the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I haven't seen any of season four.  Here's hoping.
While this series hasn't reached the level as its predecessor overall the series does grow in entertainment and quality per episode, especially as we get some screen time with some of the other background characters in the series as well.  While the Wraith remain the primary enemy on the series we also get some intrusion from past enemies as well from G'aould to the Replicators as well as some cameo time from some of the SG1 team members too.  While Shepard is no Jack O'Neill he has started getting his own personality it seems that fits the series well and while the super model leader Teyla still feels unneeded she has become somewhat less annoying in the series as well.  If you have the Stargate series I say for the price these sets are going for that it's a pretty good bargain to add the five seasons of Stargate Atlantis to the shelf as well....
Good series  Very happy that William Fitchner joined the crew. He's such a good actor and adds a lot to the show.
From beginning to end of season 2 Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) are on the run from the police and government agents that want them dead. The other convicts lives are on the line as well since all of them have been ordered to be killed. They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother. To show that these guys aren't messing around, season 1 regular Veronica (Robin Tunney) is killed violenty at the end of the first episode of this season.William Fichtner plays Agent Alexander Mahone who we think just wants to catch them but it later turns out that he has been ordered to kill them. Plus that's not all that makes this guy a threat....he's extremely smart and always seems to know what Scofield's next move is going to be. Which is another thing that makes this season so thrilling. You never really know what this guy is going to do next or who he's going to find next. I was hoping he'd find and kill T-Bag (Robert Knepper) but that sleaze ball makes it through the whole season. I don't wanna see this guy die because Knepper is bad at playing him or anything. I wanna see him die because Knepper is fantastic at making you hate this worthless piece of garbage. He's a rat that kills innocent people and slizzers his way away through most the season.Paul Adelstein as Agent Paul Kellerman is back after Scofield and Burrows. But he makes some important decisions as the season goes on and turns out to be just what they need if they want to clear Burrows' name. So there's a lot of character development going on in this season. There's a lot of running going on this season but since this show has great writing it's always engaging and you never really know what is going to happen next. So it's not just a whole lot of brainless chase scenes through the whole season. It's always exciting and has you at the edge of your seat. Plus there is still some scenes where they are captured and have to figure out how to escape. Hell this season has everything really. It's really a must see!
Just finished watching it - bought the UK version last week.Good but not as good as season one.Some lame weak writing there.More like a fugitive show than the very unique original first season.Great acting again from Michael, Linc and the crewPlus some good actionso I recommend buying it
Generally I'm not a fan of procedurals (shows without a continuing story, where each episode stands on it's own and isabout 'procedure'; legal, medical, etc), but this is as close to an exception as I'll get.Give credit to excellent writing, directing and acting, and having supporting characters that are rich and really addsomething to the show. When it's at it's best this can be downright terrific, bringing me to tears more than once, andmaking me laugh out loud a few times too. It can be very, very smart.While the 2nd season represented growth, mostly by focusing even more on our running characters and their ongoing stories,it can still be hit or miss. Every 3rd episode or so is really special.  That's a higher batting average than the first season.The other episodes are still good, almost always watchable, (one or two really don't work), but often you can see the twistscoming a mile off, or the jokes get a little stale.The show is at it's best when the episodes are really about the often funny, sometimes heartbreaking inner lives ofour running characters, and not simply about brilliantly (and inevitably) catching the bad guy/gal. Or when it's dealingwith the more human side of forensics - the grief and pain of those left behind. That's when this well made show moves waybeyond 'clever crime of the week' status.
The show is fast paced and a bit thin on story but it is still fun and better than many network shows.  Bones is based on the forensic science unit of the Smithsonian Institution.  The show always has a murder that the show has to solve forensically and the relationship between the workers who seem to work 24/7 adds some spice.  The stories of the Grave Digger and Brennan's father are my favorite.
Fortunately, the second season of BONES mantains the high standards achieved int he first season.The chemistry between Bones and Booth only improves. Also, the additon of a new female head chief (Cam)for the Jeffersonian team was a clever idea and worked nicely. This, adding to intriguing plots, superb support roles by Ryan O'Neil and Stephen Fry, scaring villains like Eppes and the guy that buried BOnes (the first case to not be solved - probably until further episodes!)and the "love angle" with Hodgins and Angela conspired to make this great television.
Season 2 explores the relationship and the background of the show's characters. Their relationships are tested by trials, tribulations, killers trying to get them and trying to save each other. This is a really good show. It is well written, interesting and captivating. David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel have great on-screen chemistry. Dechanel portrays "Bones" very well. She is quirky in all the right ways.
Building on the momentum of its first season, this Fox series continues successfully combining the morbidity of forensic investigation with the intrigue of budding office romances.Spicing things up, an old girlfriend of Booth's, Dr. Camile 'Cam' Saroyan (Tamara Taylor) becomes Dr. Brennan's boss ("The Titan on the Tracks"). Initially uncertain they can work together, they soon hammer out a workplace agreement, creating a truce.Ironically, this hard-nosed boss's life later becomes endangered after she inhales a toxin in "The Man in the Cell". It creates a little drama in the workplace--and for viewing audiences--while she is recovering.Booth also has a personal problem of his own to deal with during this season His ex-girlfriend is letting her new boyfriend spend time with their son--whom he is very protective of ("Mother and Child in the Bay"). Boreanaz does some of his most convincing acting as the 'concerned parent of a young child'. I am shocked that the writers of this series haven't promoted it through more balance of Booth's parenting."The Girl With the Curl" obviously drew it's inspiration from the still-unsolved Jon Benet Ramsey case. Brennan and Booth have to figure out who killed a child beauty queen before tragedy strikes again, and are visibly concerned. They've seen all kinds of stuff on this job, but learning what children undergo to be considered 'pretty' really pushes their limits. They are further surprised to discover the actual identity of the killer.
Dragged out in the beginning. Was interesting to a point. The others I have said are a bit better. Event, Defiance, and Falling skies where better. Hope that helps. Looking forward to seeing more of those and grim. This has the cast, just needs better to the story line.
I remember seeing part of this miniseries.  It is a good one and worth watching.  Interesting plot and concept.  Plus the acting is really good.
Overall the mini-series was well handled and held my interest right up to the end. The end, however, was more of a stopping point than a wrap-up as it left most of the important questions unanswered.This one may be good to-rent for those who are die-hard science fiction fans but will have a limited audience in others. I enjoyed watching it once but will probably not watch it again.
British actors do a great job with this unusual alien invasion story.  What is it like?  Well, don't expect state-of-the-art special effects; don't expect elaborate costumes, spaceships, or aliens.  Rather, you will find a delightful British cast who makes the story line work, because you like the characters.The storyline?  It starts with WW-II when a strange craft and "being" crash... but very soon we are transported to out current time period and must figure out what happened with the WW-II discovery.  I won't share much more of the detail of the story except to say that aliens have come to invade...both good and bad aliens.Note well: it is a short series, but I was involved in it after the second episode.  The storyline builds from episode to episode, as does the excitement.  For anyone who likes Sci-Fi and also for those who like good acting, this series is worth the watch. It isn't spectacular like "Falling Skies" on TNT, but it will pleasantly surprise.  I give it 4 stars.
I have given this 4 stars for only one reason; it has an excellent ending in the tradition of the best classic science fiction tradition. That's what really saved the series for me. It's not a huge time investment, and it's worth watching despite the terrible acting (even the good actors are appallingly bad) and the bizarre plot (it's as if the writers wanted to cram several completely different plots into one short mini-series, leading to a real mess). If you love classic science fiction I think this is worth a try, but if you stop before the end you'll probably be left disappointed, as in all other regards this is a 2-star show.
I wish it had continued and gave more back story on the bad aliens and the good aliens that sent the Lieutenant from WW2 to warn them. It did prove Einsteins theory of relativity was correct. The show would have made a great television series. I won't give any more spoilers. Happy watching
I like scifi.  Looked for series 2 but wasn't available.  I'd like to know what happened to her and her colleague!
Am enjoying it but wish that more of the scenes were better lighted.  Hard to see sometimes.  A range of accents makes adds to the interest.
Starts out as what you may think is a typical alien film. But, as you get into it you may find yourself enjoying the unexpected turns. I would have given 5 stars if the effects were just a bit more realistic.
This season slowed down a little bit compared to season 4.  Intensity was there, but as the season progress, less chaos between episodes.  Opening was cool in Brazil.  Season closer wasn't that hyped, though the story was good.  Highlights:  Delko almost dies, Horatio saves a stripper, Wolf gets fired, and nicer looking cars. . .
Well one after another, I enjoy them all usually. The lighter ones give me a break from the intensity. That can help, especially watching before going to bed.
The first two episodes' guest stars are Eyal Podell and Brandon Barash - both sleeper stars biding their time in the land of Daytime Television aka soap operas.
I have not had a chance to view this DVD yet but it appears to be in good condition.  Thank You
Season 4 of NCIS comes off as more a labyrinth than "The Season Of Secrets" as CBS promoted it.  The main characters all seem to start in different areas--Gibbs in Mexico, Tony as Team Leader, Tim no longer the "Probie", Ziva being Ziva...but as the season rolls on, all the lines start coming together.  Jethro's return from Mexico isn't exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard, and Ducky Mallard's indifference to Gibbs is puzzling.  Tony is in a serious relationship (Or is he?), and it's driving Ziva to distraction.  Tim has suddenly come into money--lots of it, evidently.  Abby is falling for a little person.  Ducky's assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action (Initials, folks) upset at NCIS.It's a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes; mostly pleasant but some not.  Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer (Though not to the team)--enough to allow himself a relationship.  Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up--some--and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker's private lives flipped on him by Ziva.  Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in "Dead Man Walking", but Ziva starts having "Tony issues" that don't slap her in the face until the end of the season.  Pauley Perrette's Abby is as she ever is--the attempt to give up "Kaff-Pow!!" was classic.  David McCallum's Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year.  Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira's sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides, and made up for the missing "head slaps".But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season.  She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3, and gave her a very uneasy edge.  The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate, but as the season went on, Jen's personal stake--and what it could cost NCIS--became apparent.  This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters.  Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson--Hollis Mann, the CID investigator who got Gibbs' attention--and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down.  Joe Spano's usual visits as T.C. Fornell, the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight.  But Muse Watson's Mike Franks--Gibbs' team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS--was a treat; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules (Wonder where Jethro got that from?).  We lose Jessica Steen's Paula Cassidy in "Grace Period", and that's a shame.  But Armand Assante's was insidious and slick as "The Frog", and David Dayan Fisher's turn as Trent Kort--the CIA operative in with La Grenouille--is also notable.In it's run, NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action--the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1, the return of Ari leading to the two words ("Sorry, Caitlin") at the end of Season 2, and the uncovering of Jethro's life story in Season 3.  Season 4 becomes about Jenny's  investigation/obsession, and how it affects the whole office.  It is aninteresting and ominous turn in the series.  It does require the viewer to follow along closely, but in the end, all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle.
THis season is better than the sixth!! More story is given about Grisham and Sarah. The miniture killer was strung all the way through the season. It was great! It seems like the show is going to continue to get better. The ending is left with a cliff hanger and that is the only negative.
This season's writers and the regular actors continue to produce exciting and engaging stories and roles to yield another interesting season. It may not be the same caliber as the previous ones but it continues to provide entertaining episodes and peek my interest in the characters development (and love interests).
A friend of mine recommended that I watch this show. I love the characters plus it has a little bit of everything, action, romance, 'smarts'...
It's always difficult starting a review you know most people won't like but here is goes.What I really like about numbers: it makes geeks cool, no hot steamy scenes (ie family oriented), main characters are decent people, it isn't gory, good story lines.The main thing I don't like about numb3rs is that it' missing some vital connection with the characters. Because I can't stay involved with the characters I tend to notice the poorly played / directed moments in the show. I also wonder about how reliable the technical stuff is, I've goggled some of the smaller thing (that I thought were cool) and can't find them or they don't pan out. I wouldn't worry about any of that if while I were watching it I had enough emotional involvement to care if one of the characters died but after 3 seasons if a main character was killed off I'd just wonder how that would change the shows dynamics.One other thing that drive me a bit crazy is that the show acts like the FBI can't even use the bathroom without "Charlies" help. I understand its a tool to show how vital he is but he gets 911 calls and guilt trips from his brother before it's necessary, like at the very beginning of a case.So, while I recommend this show, especially for family viewing and believe it's well above average, I still can't say it's great.
I bought it and it is on my computer... I love the ingenuity of these men and the children who went with them.  This was a great and inspirational story of survival and the continuity of life, the good life, the healthy life.  The actors expression was quite believable and I say it was very well done.  Thanks Amazon.
Dexter is an interesting watch. We get the outside looking in as a monster tries to live camouflaged among its unwitting prey. Along the way, we see many layers of psychosis and neurosis flayed away. Maybe there's more to Dexter than is immediately seen.The story for the first season bares only the most simplistic resemblance to the first novel in the series. Though I've read the book and watched the show quite a few times, I would be hard-pressed to pick one over the other. The cast is amazing, and the intro sequence tells you everything you need to know about the series.The special features for the DVD set falls to the abysmal side. Slim pickings for commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, but we get a handful of other Showtime series episodes. I don't know about you, but I bought Dexter to watch Dexter, not to watch episodes of the Tudors or whatever else they threw into the DVD set. And they did all this sans English subtitles (which matters to a guy like me, being partially deaf).The only thing worth while about this set are the 12 episodes of Dexter. If that's all you are shopping for, go at it. Me, I'm looking at getting the series on BD and hoping for better material. But the show alone is so good, I can't rate this lower than 4 stars.
What a clever premise!  A sociopath with serial killer tendencies is spotted at a very early age by a seasoned police officer (while the child is up for adoption).  The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how "normal" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.  My ONLY issue with this series is the foul, gutter mouth of Dexter's sister...it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.Really good television.
Don't get me wrong, its an entertaining show, and at 20 bucks, you should definitely grab it.  To compare it to shows like Six Feet Under is absolutely ridiculous though.  The idea of Dexter being a sociopath is not exploited to its full potential, IMO.  Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it, then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks.  This is a good DVD set though, I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer.  What can I say, don't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you won't be so disappointed.  For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter, AND two episodes of Brotherhood, and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature.  Not bad considering that people were lining up out the door to fork over 100 bucks for The Sopranos not too long ago.
a relative recommended this show to me, and I'm glad she did (because since I don't subscribe to Showtime)...I wasn't aware that this series existed, until recently.  Thankfully, Netflix took care of that little problem for me.Dexter plays a vigilante of sorts, a hero with a very dark side...he gives justice to those that the criminal justice system can't find or put behind bars.Michael Hall is a great actor, balancing a killer on the one hand and a likeable, lovable professional forensics expert on the other.....as he interacts in his various relationships.The show has comedy, drama, tension....it had just about everything...I guess one would label this a "dark comedy" type of series.  Very dark.All the other characters in the show are interesting and fun to watch, and we see the dramas played out in their life through the eyes of Dex.This is a truly original series that hooked me quickly with its stories and interesting characters- highly recommended!
If you don't start out liking it keep on watching it gets better. Below are my ratings of each individual season.Season 1: 7/10Season 2: 8/10Season 3: 6/10Season 4: 10/10Season 5: 9/10Season 6: 9/10Season 7: 10/10Season 8 (the final season) is hopefully good.
Coming off some serious withdrawals from both Six Feet Under and The Sopranos (the only reason I subscribed to HBO), I took a "stab" at Dexter. It took a couple of episodes for me to warm up to the character, but I did.I soon found myself rooting for a serial-killer who works for the cops which, to me anyway, means the writing is pretty good. The setting of post-Miami-Vice Miami is a visually interesting backdrop - although a little too much at times. Dexter has my interest and I'm devouring DVD after DVD as fast as they can be delivered. So far, it's scratchin' my itch for a solid cable series.
OK, so the show has some major flaws, its not well written, nor particularly well acted. Dexter is still entertaining and very addictive. It is definitely a &#34;god, its already 1AM, ok , just one more episode&#34; show.Taking a step back after watching it, Dexter is way too capable (getting evidence from the garbage disposal in 3 minutes?), the plot lines are 'predictably unpredictable&#34;...but all the same, put the blinders on and enjoy, I did
I guess my biggest complaint about DEXTER is that it isn't nasty ENOUGH.  The premise if phenomenal...Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night.  By channeling his impulses to kill in a "helpful" way...he is actually a hero.  I know, I know, anyone who kills is bad...but seriously, the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves...killers who knock off children and other innocents.  Dexter is doing the world a favor.  And that's the problem...he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink.  There's no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.But don't get me wrong...the show is a blast nonetheless.  From it's super-saturated Florida colors, to its sly & witty narration, the show is top-notch and very entertaining.  Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER.  While his performance isn't exactly a tour-de-force of evil (like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for example)...it is a lovely, inventive performance.  He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling...and because we know he's faking, we're kinda in on the joke.  We can be "amused" along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.The only true "dark side" to Dexter is his inability to love.  He has a girlfriend, but only to help himself look normal.  He is very good to her and her kids, and the poor girl (damaged from a previous, abusive marriage) just adores Dexter in return.  But he doesn't really have feelings for her, and this colors all their scenes together.  This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter's killings also had.The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks, showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father, who happens to be a cop.  James Remar plays this part so well...it's probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had.  It's a small part, but he brings great strength to it.  And great love and concern for Dexter.  You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids...Remar's character is the ultimate example of this.Also, the opening credits of the show are AWESOME!!  Creepy and clever.So, while the show, to me, isn't perfect (I would prefer it a little darker), it is still HUGELY entertaining, well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I think you'll like it a lot.  If the basic premise turns you off...then don't even bother watching!
If you're reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall ("Six Feet Under") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his "urges" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It's a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn't an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it's kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama "Brotherhood". We also get "Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to "Dexter" because that's what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven't listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series "The Tudors" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that "The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won't be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn't indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter's father a police officer recognized early on his son's proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his "skills" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he's not normal and he also knows he doesn't fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something "better".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.
"Dexter" is built on an intriguing premise: a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers.  Kind of a twisted play on Freud's concept of sublimation.  The series didn't initially appeal to me, but overall I'm pleased that I stuck with the first season.  Michael C. Hall plays the titular character, a forensic expert in blood splatter.  He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders; one of these cops is Dexter's adopted sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop (the now deceased Harry Morgan) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial.  Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency (and inevitably murder), Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances.  Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal, such as dating, to help him hide his true nature and go undetected.  Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer, with a season long plot involving Dexter's fascination with the "Ice Truck Killer."The series features excellent writing and direction, which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic.  The acting also is top-notch.  Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable (so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion, superficial charm, and violent impulses.  We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface, kept in check only by his adherence to his code.  It's a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder, and the series isn't afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening.  The supporting cast is also terrific, with C.S. Lee scoring as Vince Masuka, Dexter's lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case.  Likewise, Sgt. Doakes (Erik King) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays.  I also enjoy the work of two "Oz" veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter's complicated Lieutenant, and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista (perhaps Dexter's closest "friend").Although I enjoyed the show, there were a few things I disliked about the first season.  Debra's insecurity is highly grating, and the actress gives a twitchy, affected performance.  Dexter's flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile.  The first few episodes were difficult to watch, and Dexter came across as quite brutal; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows, but the character became more "human" in subsequent episodes.  Finally, the last two episodes of the season, which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case, were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending.  Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed, there's enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD.
Season 5 takes a turn with the introduction of Forest Whitaker as LT Jon Kavanaugh.  Prior to his departure, Kavanaugh had been tasked by Captain Aceveco to find the dirt on Vic.  Hellbent and determined, Kavanaugh does his best to do so.I don't know whether it was his character, his acting or the side story, but I didn't like the introduction of Kavanaugh to the series.  Sure, I believe many think the introduction may have been needed, but the subplot was often way too distracting.
This season was good, but not up to par with previous seasons, partially because it was only 11 episodes long.Synopsis of the season: Jon Kavanaugh (Forest Whitaker) has been brought in to check on the Strike Team. He goes after Lem and tries to get him to turn on the rest of the team. The main story is basically the team trying to keep Lem out of jail. There's also some cameos of Anthony Anderson as Antwon Mitchell. Also, Danni is pregnant, Billings has become Captain, Julian is partnered with a new trainee, and Claudette and Dutch's relationship is strained due to a secret she is keeping from Dutch.
Vic continues to walk on thin ice and make it to the other side.  A fond farewell to Lem.  We will miss you in Season 6.
OK, there are a few episodes in this season that are a little much.  The social/political satire is still as strong as ever but the episodes are stretching more to make their points.  Instead of being absurdly funny and clever, some of these episodes are just absurd and go out of their way to say, "Look at me, look how shocking I am" ("The Return of Chef," "Smug Alert!," "A Million Little Fibers," "Stanley's Cup").  Still, this season offers what I believe is the greatest SP episode of all-time and maybe the best thing I have ever seen on television: "Make Love Not Warcraft."  This episode is so well-done in animation (yes, excellent SP animation) and story-writing that I cannot praise it enough.  Plus, it includes music from one of my favorite singers ever: Paul Stanley!  Then there are the excellent two-parters when Cartman goes to the future (Mrs. Garrison and that scholar guy are hilarious!) and  "Cartoon Wars" where SP takes on Family Guy with references to other animated shows. "Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy" takes the female teacher/boy student love affair controversy to a level only SP can. The positives outweight the negatives here but it's not perfect, so I can't give it 5 stars no matter how much I love the World of Warcraft episode. The cover of the box (Target edition) is awesome.  You see the SP boys fat and pimply and, by tilting the box, you see their World of Warcraft characters.Disc 1:"The Return of Chef"--Controversial episode that got back at Isaac Hayes for leaving SP when it tackled the Scientology issue. Hearing old Chef audio clips, the SP boys notice something has changed drastically in Chef after his return from an adventure with a mysterious club.  Yikes!"Smug Alert!"--People of SP start buying hybrid cars and find out they're threatening the planet with emissions of another kind.  The beginning of this episode with Gerald acting all high and mighty in his hybrid was great.  I thought it was going to be another excellent episode.  At the point where the forest ranger explains what's going on to Stan, things went downhill.  Here, the episode tried a little too hard to make a statement.  It is very contrived."Cartoon Wars Part 1"--Fear engulfs SP when a Family Guy episode showing an image of Mohammad threatens holy war.  While the nation buries its head in the sand (literally), Cartman goes on a mission to cancel Family Guy and Kyle tries to stop him."Cartoon Wars Part 2"--Pre-empted for a Terrance and Phillip television special...just kidding.  Cartman finds out something shocking about the writers of Family Guy.  I'll admit that show makes a lot more sense now.  The Muslims' retaliation was going in the right direction but ended up going the way of "The Passion of the Jew" which is unfortunate because it became stupid instead of funny."A Million Little Fibers"--Towlie promotes his memoirs but hits a snatch...er...snag when he lies to Oprah Winfrey.  This episode is way over-the-top for my tastes and is not re-watchable.Disc 2:"Manbearpig"--Al Gore is super serial about a new threat to the planet.  Can the man who invented the Internet save the earth from the vicious Manbearpig? Wait...isn't manbearpig an endangered species?"Tsst"--Mrs. Cartman has had it with her out-of-control son but, after failing on several nanny reality shows, has to resort to hiring a dog trainer.  One of the better episodes of this season."Make Love Not Warcraft"--The best thing I've seen on TV, period.  Brilliant! It's interesting that here is one of the few times Cartman is a good leader who isn't a jerk to everyone...except Butters, of course."The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce"--An unwelcomed sight in the boy's room somehow leads to the unlocking of a 9/11 conspiracy.  We get to meet the Hardly Boys who seem to be hardly ever not hard.  The funniest part of this episode is how Mr. Mackey keeps hounding on finding more than a cake in the urinal."Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy"--A teacher at SP Elementary is having an affair with a student...a very young student.  Meanwhile, Cartman gets some real "authoritie" as a hallway monitor and treats his job as if he is a certain television bounty hunter.  His assistant Beth with the big knockers is hilarious.Disc 3:"Hell On Earth 2006"--Satan wants a Halloween party just like the Super Sweet 16 parties those snotty rich girls on MTV get.  Meanwhile, the folks of SP keep summoning Biggie Smalls back to earth.  A ho-hum episode. The Three Stooges take-off with Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacey doesn't do it for me. It just doesn't make sense as Bundy would never hang out with those guys.  Plus, Gacey would want to kill children, not adults and Dahmer would be killing young, dark-skinned men."Go God Go"--Mrs. Garrison is against teaching her class evolution until a handsome atheist scholar is hired to teach her class.  Meanwhile, Cartman can't wait for the release of the Nintendo Wii so he has himself frozen but his defrost took longer than he anticipated.  Tears came to my eyes when Mrs. Garrison described evolution to the class I was laughing so hard."Go God Go XII"--Cartman is stuck in the future where there is no religion and, therefore, no war...yeah right!  I like how they say "science" in their slurs instead of "God" or "JC." When Cartman calls himself in the past it is hilarious!  He finally gets to encounter his awful self but, of course, doesn't learn anything from it."Stanley's Cup"--To get his bike out of impound, Stan coaches a peewee hockey team that includes a player dying of cancer.  This episode tries too hard to be heavy, but I guess that was the goal, er, point.
This season is not as good as other seasons, but it's still alright. One of my favorite episodes is when it's HALLOWEEN and Satan is throwing a big Sweet Sixteen party and acts like a spoiled rich teenager. Also Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny deal with the death of their friend Chef, stop Manbearpig, try to get a Family Guy episode pulled, defeat a nerdy gamer on World of Warcraft, and stop Ike from having sexual relations with his smokin' hot teacher. (Nice!) All this and more happen in SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON!!!
this was a well written account of the concentration camp of auschwitz.  Withoudt making it overly grapic, it showed the horrot of what went on and the people who made the idea work.  It covers the beginning of the effort to rid the world of Jews and other undesirables and continue until the trails after the war.  If you have an interest in this subject, you will find this once of the better accounts.
This is a very interesting documentary regarding the infamous Nazi camp.  I didn't know that the camp was used for anything other than the containment and murder of Jews, Gypsies and other people that the Nazis believed to be inferior.  It was well worth the time to watch the series.  I will probably watch it again at some point.
Having been there as a child to visit, I wanted to see more of the history of the halocaust.Some things you need to remember.
This Agatha Christie mystery had an American actor (or a British actor portraying an American).  I was intrigued with the women's fashions, as well as the culture.  The premise was interesting as well - a murder at a &#34;disadvantaged youth&#34; home, which also happened to be a grand mansion.
A good story line and good acting.  It's a good thing I don't have to wait for a whole week before catching the next episode.  I was working nights when this was originally on TV so never got to watch it then.  It would have been very hard to wait for a week before seeing the next episode.  This series is very addictive.
When &#34;24&#34; was on weekly we didn't start to watch it at the beginning and then often forgot to watch it, so it was hard to really get into it. BUT now that we are able to watch every episode from the beginning and in order without interruption have we loved it and are watching it again.
I liked all the seasons of 24 because of the fast moving action, never bored, always something happening. I would recommend it to anyone who like action movies.
I gave it this rating for many reasons, it was a good season to watch and it keeps the viewer interested.
I give Season 4 of "24" four stars not rated relative to it's own normal standards, but in comparison to everything else on TV.Simply stated....... even during a weak season like Season 6, "24" is still better than most other crap on TV these days.In other words, even at it's worse, "24" is better than most modern shows at their best.So many other shows on TV have become simple one trick pony and non-stop sex joke one liners that they have no substance except the cheap laugh.No wonder we now watch very few modern shows outside Court TV crime shows and exist primarily on DVD collections of past shows like........ Cheers, Wings, Silk Stalkings, Seinfeld, etc..etc..
After two years in a Chinese prison, Jack Bauer is returned to America in order for C.T.U. to get the location of the man putting off bombs. Jack finds out it's all for nothing and escapes to help save the day. Throughout this day, Jack teams up with terrorist who wants peace, there is an attack on President Wayne Palmer, the Vice President wants to bomb another country, Jack must find 5 suitcase nukes, stop his dad and brother, help his nephew, and a whole lot more! This is one of the better seasons. One of the characters I don't really like at first is Tom Lennox, then later in the day, I start to like him. Then, I don't really like Vice President Noah Daniels, but toward the end of the day, I kinda like him. If you love 24, and Jack Bauer, you'll love 24: DAY SIX!!!
This is worth getting alone for the second episode "The Deadly Dolls" guest-starring the great Vincent Price.  While the plot is similar to so many other Voyage episodes with the crew being taken over by aliens desiring the Seaview's nuclear reactor, the combination of Vincent and the hysterical Nelson and Crane puppets make this one an absolute pleasure.It is interesting to ponder how great Voyage would have been had it continued the combination of sci-fi and James Bond-type episodes seen during its second, and best, season.
Heck, what a change of course!Season Three of Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea altered dramatically the tone of the show. Gone were the clever plots about spies, Cold War, nuclear danger, secrete agents. Gone is the Nelson Institute location, different things like Veneza, etc.Admiral Nelson is onboard the Seaview in all episodes, and now the focus are aliens, monsters, mermaids, werewolves, mummies, dead Nazi agents, plant men, wax men, you name it. The Seaview "rock and roll" like never before, it's a miracle it never gets destroyed.Gone is Riley, in comes Patterson.Season Two is the best for me, it will always be. Bu Season Three has its moments and, in general, maitained the good reputation of the show as a guilty pleasure show. It was in Season Four that thing went downhill drastically.
I was not a fan of SUPERNATURAL after its first season, and indeed I'm not a huge fan even after Seasons Two and Three.  But there is no question that that show made some major strides forward in its sophomore and junior years, deepening the storylines and finding new and innovative ways to structure episodes.  Because one of the biggest problems with the show in Season One was its episodic "demon of the week" narrative structure, the show grew far more interesting and engaging.In these two seasons SUPERNATURAL also became a far more playful show, willing to engage in self-parody and capable of poking fun at itself.  In a way, this mimics the way that one of the shows that has most influenced the series, THE X-FILES, grew.  That show for the first couple of episodes was almost unceasingly serious.  It was a great show despite this, but it really took off once -- especially with several extraordinary scripts by Darin Morgan -- when it began mixing in comic episodes.  Season Two of THE X-FILES saw a mildly comic (though mainly jut flat out weird) scripted by Morgan, late in Season Two about circus freaks entitled "Humbug."  But the first out and out laugh fest was another Morgan script, "War of the Coprophages," in which Mulder and a scientist named Bambi do battle against cockroaches.  (Darin Morgan only wrote a half dozen scripts for THE X-FILES, but four of those would be among the ten best X-FILES episodes ever, one of them the Emmy Award winning episode "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose," which is one of the finest TV episodes of all time, garnering an Emmy not just for Morgan but for guest actor Peter Boyle.)  Certainly THE X-FILES seemed to be an even greater influence on SUPERNATURAL in these two seasons than in Season One.  One Season Two episode, in which Sam and Dean give offer Bobby differing accounts of events calls to mind THE X-FILES episode "Bad Blood," in which Mulder and Scully give contradictory reports of events surrounding vampires in Texas (along with a sheriff played by Luke Wilson -- both episodes were among the dozens of TV episodes or movies loosely based over the years on the great Kurosawa film RASHOMON, which details four incompatible accounts of events in the woods in medieval Japan).  I don't know how much of this can be credited to Ben Edlund (creator of THE TICK in all his forms, as well as a writer on FIREFLY and ANGEL) joining the writing staff.  But in every way the writing in these two seasons showed a sharp increase in sophistication and flexibility.  The scripts in Season One were stiff, uninteresting, and frequently just flat out boring.  That was rarely the case as the show progressed.  No doubt part of the improvement stemmed from the producers gaining new concessions from the CW, which surely allowed them to stray away from the standalone, episodic format that so thoroughly hampered the show in Season One.I frankly found just about every episode in Season One of the show to be completely forgettable.  But several episodes in Seasons Two and Three stand out.  For instance, one particularly good episode in Season Two does some great twists on the genie legends, with the help of an excellent guest performance by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Tricia Helfer.  That episode is emblematic of the new maturity of the show.  I can honestly say that I was not surprised (nor scared) by a single thing that happened in Season One.  It was almost intentionally predictable.  But in Helfer's episode there were some truly interesting twists and surprises.  In just about every way, the show got better in these two seasons.I'm still not what one might term a major fan of the show.  Even after three seasons it is a fairly conservative show.  It certainly has done little to redefine the horror genre and it has not expanded the scope of horror or fantasy in the way that either THE X-FILES or BUFFY did.  Still, there is a great deal to say for a show that is excellent even if it is not innovative.  And I admire any series that gets better as it goes along.  I received the first three seasons of the series as a gift, but I frankly did not think I was going to continue with the show after finishing the three sets.  But now I both plan to buy Season Four come this September and DVR the show upon its return this fall (it will be going against a very similar show with what is surely a pretty substantial audience overlap, FRINGE -- why do networks do this? -- the only then that FOX assures in doing this is that both shows will get lower ratings than they might otherwise -- still, FRINGE is a show I really love, so I'll keep up with SUPERNATURAL via DVR).  Hopefully I'll enjoy Season Four as much as Seasons Two and Three.
Special Features: "The Devil's Roadmap", "Webisodes", three commentary tracks, gag reel, deleted/unaired scenesThere was no witchcraft involved in the success of "Supernatural". The show benefited from top notch writing, direction and performances with just the right dash of quirky humor to offset the horror elements of the show. The second season of the show picks up right where the first ended. Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) have located their dad  (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and have the fabled gun fashioned to kill demons in their possession. The trio confront the Demon that killed Dean and Sam's mom only to find it leaping from person to person finally possessing their father almost forcing the boys to kill him. Driving the Demon out of their father the trio escape with the gun believing that they can still track down the creature, find out why it has harvested children with special psychic abilities and how it plans on using them in its "war" against humanity. Then a truck hits Dean's 1967 Impala. Sam is injured but alive and Dean is on the cusp of death with internal injuries. John makes a deal with the Devil or, in this case, the Demon they were pursuing--take his life for Dean's. Before he dies John whispers something to Dean which will resonate throughout the rest of the second season.We get three commentary tracks on "In My Time of Dying" (director Kim Manners and actors Ackles & Padalecki), "What Is And Should Never Be" (writer Eric Kripe) and the first part of the season two finale "All Hell Breaks Loose" (Kripke, Manners and writer Sera Gamble) along with deleted/unaired scenes on three episodes."The Devil's Road Map" is exactly that; a map of the United States showing where each episode takes place in the country You can click on each spot and see material from John's book with writers like Whitley Striber discussing the various monsters. We also see behind-the-scenes footage of the writers/producers discussing the creation of various episodes such as "All Hell Breaks Loose". These are essentially featurettes on each episode and they are kind of cool.  We also get Jared Padalecki's original screen test on videotape. The quality of the screen test is typical for home video cameras as it was really never intended to be shown. It's kind of cool to be able to contrast his first take on the character vs. the final performance from the pilot episode and subsequent character development over the course of two seasons.We also get three "webisode" featurettes including "The Inside Scoop with Ivan Hayden/VFX Supervisor" discussing the visual effects of the show, the overall look of these effects and how he approaches integrating the visuals into the show. "Inside the Writer's Room" which also aired on the "Supernatural" website during season two features writer/creator/producer Kripke, writer/producer John Shiban and producer/writer/director Robert Singer where the trio point out that the show uses Urban folklore as the basis for most of their episodes. Sadly we can't see the board with story ideas behind them. We also get glimpses of some of the storyboards including plenty of clips from the second season. "The Inside Scoop with Chris Cooper" is the final webisode included and features the prop master for "Supernatural" who discusses "all the toys" that the cast use on the show. Cooper discusses some of the fun stuff he gets to create including the guns and devices that Dean & Sam use. The amusing gag reel rounds things out including a very funny scene where Padalecki has a practical joke played on him during shooting."Supernatural" looks extremely good overall with nice color reproduction and detail. There are some digital artifacts and the images do blur a bit when there is rapid action on screen (which could be due to the fact that the show is shot and mastered in HD although it largely captures the "look" of film) but on the whole the show looks quite good.An exceptional second season with only a few dud episodes, I'd highly recommend the "Supernatural". The show has hip humor that manages to capture much of the fun elements that made "The X-Files" so memorable (and hard to reproduce as the failed but interesting "Kolchak: The Night Stalker" from 2005 demonstrated). As with the previous the discs are housed in a fold out case with a brief synopsis and credits for each episode.
Such an awesome series.  Too bad it ended without closure, though.  Makes me leary of watching new series, because that seems to happen a lot.  Loved Veronica throughout the series, however, she was a little over the top in this last season with the&#34;cutie pie&#34; behavior.  But, overall, wonderful series.
Sad that it's the last season. It's a great show. I love the characters. The show can get pretty dark, but also very realistic. Looking forward to the movie next year!
- Veronica (investigating Piz's car, from which his moving-in stuff had been stolen): "It doesn't look like they jimmied their way in."- Piz: "It wasn't locked."- Veronica: "College campus. All your worldly possessions. Where are you from? Brigadoon?"Nope, Neptune in Cali isn't exactly as  magical as Brigadoon. Neptune, like most places, hides its share of festering secrets and nefarious intents, which keeps busy the hardworking Mars Investigations agency, staffed by Keith Mars and his ever resourceful 19-year-old daughter Veronica. So for this 3rd and final season, we again say hello - and bid farewell - to these folks up in Neptune. With high school flush in her rearview mirror, part-time shamus, now full-time college student Veronica Mars turns her sardonic attention to life at Hearst College. But some things simply don't change for our feisty heroine. She still helps out her dad in the gumshoe department and still suffers an exhausting relationship with her emotionally fractured bad boy of a boyfriend, Logan Echolls. And she still touts a rep for ferreting out, and digging in, and nosing about. And, since she does get results, she's soon up to her neck putting out fires and solving campus dilemmas.Some plot SPOILERS follow.VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is still very good, but it's the weakest of the three seasons. This time the main ongoing story arcs revolve around Veronica hunting down a campus serial rapist and sleuthing another baffling murder. On a smaller scale, her mystery plate is heaped with servings the likes of a stolen team playbook, some missing tapes, an accusation of plagiarism, a vanished heiress, a secret society, a holdup at a costume casino party, etc. So add that to her freshman woes. And, being Veronica Mars, she also doesn't take long to alienate an activist sorority and a raunchy fraternity, as well as the weasely assistant of her criminology professor. But at least her crime solving is made easier by her gigs as Library Helpdesk girl and as the photographer of the college paper. And she's always got her buds to lean on, Wallace, Mac, and Logan, even if their onscreen appearances are sporadic (just one reason this season isn't as good).But the show's not all about Veronica (it's just mostly about Veronica). My second favorite character in the show is Keith Mars, and he has his own messes to muddle thru. Logan continues to have his own issues and comes close to overdoing the tortured soul thing; Wallace juggles basketball with his mechanical engineering aspirations; Weevil is now out on parole (from his misdeeds in Season 2) but must maintain a job; and Mac, well, she's still shy. Meanwhile, Veronica's clique widens in the forms of the happy-go-lucky, kinda dull Piz (Wallace's roomie) and party girl, kinda dull Parker (Mac's roomie). So, hello, new loves and old loves, and there's even a hasty wedding. As usual, it's a blending of heartbreak and mystery and life lessons and surprises. Just life in Neptune.SPOILERS end.So I managed to blast thru all 20 episodes (plus extras) in one sleep-deprived - but worth it - marathon viewing session. Something to be said for watching your favorite shows on dvd instead of television, the dvds lending an instant gratification and an immediacy which suck in the viewer even more. Having said that, not only am I bummed out about the series's abrupt demise but pretty upset that there wasn't even a proper ending to the series. Again, only 20 episodes here, with the last one leaving its audience hanging off a cliff. Not cool, CW.Two paragraphs now about the plentiful bonus stuff, which can be found on the 6th disc (there are 6 discs in all in this set). Most interesting and quite bittersweet are the two segments devoted to what would have been Season 4: one's a 12 minute clip giving us a feel for what the next season would've been like (Veronica in the FBI), the other has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show. Both segments, to me, feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff (ie: the town of Neptune, the school backdrop, Veronica's father and circle of friends) had been taken away. A whole new mess of characters are introduced, all of whom I felt a bit hostile to.Under the banner "Going Undercover with Rob Thomas" (and with his sycophantic right hand man Dan Etheridge) we get 9 ho-hum featurettes: "Main Titles: Why the Change?"; "Rob's Directing Experience"; "Favorite Guest Star Moments"; "Veronica Mars: Mean Girl" - in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3; "The Politics of Veronica Mars" - concerning the negative reactions to the show; Thomas goes over his "Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments" and his "Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments"; "Do-Overs?" - scenes of which Thomas wasn't too fond; and "Highlights" - more of Thomas's fave moments. Then 24 minutes worth of 16 unaired scenes with Thomas's intros; a 7 minute gag reel (best was Enrico Colantoni's many takes of "I finally got the police report on the ****'s suicide"). The Webisode gallery offers 5 clips, the most fun of which is Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell Q & A-ing each other. There's also a guidebook which breaks down the episodes. A ton of extras here, so I shouldn't gripe; yet I wish Kristen Bell and cast had done an interview or even an episode commentary.For three years VERONICA MARS has delivered the goods, consistently bringing it with the clever and the funny, with the heartwrenching angst and the occasional melodramatic twist. Once in a while, my thoughts were even provoked. Along with the crisp plotting and snappy banter, the show presented relationships that were complicated and fluid and real and multi-faceted mysteries which perplexed. But by this season's end the show had kind of broken away from its normal pattern, that of each episode being pivotal and acting as chapters to one cohesive storyline. The last five episodes instead tended to be self-contained ones, and that's when the show really began to feel fractured. There are less gems here than in the first 2 seasons, although most of the episodes are still darn watchable. If I had to pick favorites, three episodes instantly spring to mind: "Debasement Tapes," in which Paul Rudd guest stars as a rumpled, near alcoholic rock star living off his old glory; "Postgame Mortem," in which a moping Logan ends up babysitting a cheerful 11-year-old girl; and episode 20, which ends the series just as things begin to get darn good.In the acting department, Jason Dohring (the ever moody Logan) again stands out. Enrico Colantoni continues to make a case for his character Keith Mars as being the best dad in the universe. My most cherished moments in the series have to do with Veronica and Keith doing their daughter-dad thing. There's just this amazing level of understanding, caring, and humor between them, and conveyed wonderfully by Bell and Colantoni. Whenever they're in a scene together, the world is good. And, as always, Kristen Bell, playing that spunky, tenacious girl detective, effortlessly carries the show.But, well, the show's done now, and the superb cast scattered, with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring, to MOONLIGHT. But it's still gonna take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain: "A long time ago, we used to be friends." VERONICA MARS, you see, it was a very good show. And, to echo Keith Mars on his daughter Veronica, "I find her nosiness charming."
Good third season. The only thing that happened at the end is Logan and Veronica didn't end up together, which I was waiting for. A little disappointed. But then I decided to watch the movie.
This show is fresh and smart and always had clever idea for new cases and stories yet it was canceled ?? When Smallville which is sorta just dragging on these days is going on to it's 7th season. But hey at least that's way better than 7th Heaven which at least isn't coming back. Why can't the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it. I got into Veronica Mars the most this season, so it really bugs me that it got canceled. Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural, so why would they have to cut this show too ? It was actually good even if Veronica could act just a little too much like an overly goofy version of Buffy. It was still a really good unpredictable teen detective show and beats a lot of the crap shows that actually weren't canceled this year!
For fans of the old Veronica Mars TV series, everything will fit like an old glove.  I had never seen the series, but I still enjoyed the movie a whole bunch.  Good for a rainy weekend afternoon.  Doesn't require a lot of deep thinking and no messages to ponder at the end.  Just a good old fashioned murder mystery.
i enjoyed her in high school a bit better.  Though the show still is enjoyable and i would recommend nice fun show that is not completely dumb as many are today.
With high school now completely behind her, Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) heads off to college.  In spite of her best efforts, she's stuck in Neptune, attending Hearst College and living at home with her dad, Keith (Enrico Colantoni).  As a result, it's really no surprise when mystery and danger find her again.Veronica's well earn reputation and the person who can solve the unsolvable gets her involved in one case after another.  Who is behind the "Welcome Wagon" and steals new student's stuff?  Who would kidnap a monkey?  And where is the missing member of the board of trustees?Unlike previous seasons, there are two bigger mysteries.  The first involves the serial rapist on the Hearst campus.  And the second one begins when college dean Cyrus O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) is found dead in his office.And we can't leave out her personal life.  Her on again off again relationship with Logan (Jason Dohring) creates problems, especially since friend Wallace's (Percy Daggs III) new roommate Piz (Chris Lowell) is also interested in her.  With all this going on, will she ever have time to study?Unfortunately, this is the final season of a show I fell in love with right away.  The mysteries were sharp, requiring concentration to follow every week.  Yet the clues were there.  Veronica has a sharp sense of humor that is wonderful for lightening the mood of the usually dark show.  The relationship soap opera, while at times annoying, never got too bad.  And all the acting was top notch.Having praised it, this is my least favorite season of the show.  And it's not because there were two shorter mysteries and a couple stand alone episodes.  It was because the adult tone, definitely always present, became even more pronounced.  Of course, that's what you'd expect with rape being a subject for half the season.  Even the details of Veronica's personal life made me uncomfortable at times.As a result, I don't recommend this show for young kids.  Older teens and adults will absolutely love this sly combination of wit and noir.
I have Enjoyed all of her series very much good cast of characters and good show themes. writing is great
I chose 4 stars because this is a really good television show but I am saving the 5 star rating for a knock your socks off show. I really enjoyed it and if I had the option I would give it 4 1/2 start.
My household discovered this series about a month ago.  We'd never seen it when it was broadcast.  We found the cast, actors, and story lines interesting and, considering the relative age of the series, not dated.  Season 3 retained most of the original cast but added a few new ones.  Veronica is now in college but attends few classes.  She spends most of her time solving big and little problems for her friends.  If you like this type of TV you'll like Veronica Mars.  A side note:  Season 4 was planned, trailers produced, but never happened.  Season 4 trailers can be found online.
Veronica Mars was not my first option if something better is on, but nonetheless it was a good production and I enjoyed it when I wanted some escape - and my favorites were not on.The abrupt ending of the series was an "oh no!". I knew it was coming, but I still cannot believe that the plug was pulled on this show. It had its charm and the plot was getting thick and then....and then....kapowie!!
I am a grandmother. I really loved the TV series and watched it for the third time on Amazon to prepare for the movie. I was very pleased so many cast members returned to do the movie. I think they all liked the series also. Why did such a fine series disappear from view? I don't get it. What they have on now is a big marathon trying to say that all girls have sex by 14! Well bull to that. Watching Veronica Mars, it made virginity serious and precious. When she was raped at a party, what woman would not feel her loss. The relationship with her father is a rarity in American viewing. She was raised by a single Dad who loved the heck out of her and expected her to love herself. He supported her, but also guided her. Bring her back. We need this series. Thanks for the movie, but it only made me want more of the story.
My wife is a huge fan of this show and she really loved the movie.  I was a casual fan and was able to enjoy the movie with her. Her biggest complaint was that Logan was so skinny and sickly looking. The team Logan roots run deep for her, haha.
Good quality picture, no problems...makes me wonder why I did not watch the series when it was on network tv
I am 50 and not in the majority demographic, but I have a teenager and I love watching Veronica mars. I envy her and her fathers relationship. I envy her father for having a teenager that is so together.Anyway, I loved the show, did not watch it while it was on. Binge watched on amazon, then watched this movie on amazon too. Great concept for delivering the film to fans.I think any casual or serious fan of the show would get their money's worth with this. It gave me a warm fuzzy feeling. It was very loyal to the series.
It's been some time since the show ended, but the movie does a fine job of pretty much picking up right where the show left off. Many of the recurring characters from the television show have small appearances, but the focus of the movie rests squarely on Veronica and Logan. Like many of the episodes, the &#34;mystery&#34; is revealed in the closing moments in fairly quick order. The mystery, while important, is not the point of the story, the characters are. The mystery is simply the delivery vehicle.The pacing of the movie feels somewhat rushed, but that may simply be due to the number of acknowledgements of the original series that it tries to fit into a mere 100 minutes of movie time. These little glimpses of what has become of Veronica's past life are not entirely necessary. They are there for the fans. But since this was a fan-funded project, it's entirely understandable.One need not have any clue about Veronica Mars before seeing this film. It is capable of standing on its own. However, for those watching the film without first having watched the series, it may come across as a bit shallow as there simply isn't enough time to get invested into what happens with each character, leaving the mystery the sole reason for watching the film.
It was good to see all the characters grown up. Good story line and the movie sealed the TV series. Veronica and Logan end up together. I like happy endings and this did it for me.
I own the whole TV series from 10 years ago. I loved her character, a great female role model for the teenage/young adult set. She's smart, resourceful and I love a good detective story because I'm a super sleuth myself so I felt a kinship with her character. I could totally be a detective. While chicks were watching vacuous reality OC shows back in the day, I was more into watching the smart girl kick butt and solve mysteries. The movie was fun to watch for someone who obsessed over the TV series, but probably not for someone who didn't watch it 10 years or or who vaguely remembers the story lines. It was fun to see all the regulars again. The movie was a bit contrived and dorky but I loved it anyway. I would watch the next one if they made one so we can see Veronica and Logan be in love and live their lives together. Also, did Gia die? That wasn't clear.
I saw most, if not all, of the TV series when it was on.  I loved the show, Veronica's sass and the father-daughter relationship.  Having said that, I wasn't obsessed.  A little sad when it departed but I can say that about a lot of shows that leave too early for my liking.  Admittedly I was glad to get back together with the old crowd and I remembered most of the characters.Veronica (Kristen Bell), now involved with good-guy Piz (Chris Lowell) has recently graduated from law school and is on the verge of accepting a job with a prestigious NYC law firm.  But she's drawn back to richy-bitchy Neptune, CA when one-time bad-boy paramour Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is arrested for murdering his pop singer girlfriend.  Oh, and it's her 10th year high school reunion.  Against her better judgment, Veronica can't turn Logan down, presumably to help screen defense attorneys.  But it goes further as she digs deeper and deeper into the crime.Thanks to some fine dialog written by Rob Thomas (also directed) and Diane Ruggiero, Veronica is as snappy as ever when it comes to retorts and one-liners.  Logan, outside the murder charge, has redeemed himself and is now a Navy Lieutenant.  His best friend Dick (Ryan Hansen) is still a goofball and a key to solving the murder.  And I'm always glad to see Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, Veronica's moral compass.  Those familiar with the characters will likely swoon over the movie.  But even newcomers (like my son) should have a good time.
&#34;It's a one time deal, a farewell tour if you will.&#34; After giving up her private eye life, Veronica (Bell) is on her way to becoming a lawyer. When she starts to celebrate after a great interview she notices that someone she went to high school with has been found dead and her ex- boyfriend Logan (Dohring) is accused. She decides to go to her high school reunion and help Logan clear his name, but her old life begins to take over and she forgot how exciting the life of an investigator can be. I will start this by saying that I have never seen the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect. After watching this I wish I had seen the show, for two reasons. One, so I had a little more back story for each character and two because I really enjoyed this and would really enjoy seeing more of it. Someone that has been a fan the entire time will probably really love this. People like me who have never seen one episode will also really enjoy this. Overall, funny, exciting and very fun to watch. I recommend it. I give this a B+.
I know this was a true labor of love for everyone involved!! What an effort it must have taken to get so many of the original cast members back for a movie after all of this time. Great show and a GREAT MOVIE!!!
This movie is really only for fans of the series who need a fix. It isn't the best Veronica Mars storyline ever but if you're a fan you'll eat it up. Admit it, you know you want to watch it.
OK, sort of a spoiler. I had heard of Veronica Mars for years, but because I had a night job I was never able to see it. Then came Miss Mars to Amazon Prime. I binge watched, got caught up in the story and hated the fact there was no resolution, no ending to speak of. Did her promising career with the FBI pan out? What about everyone else she was close to in Neptune? Questions, speculations, then rumors of a movie to clear up those loose ends. Now here it is in all its glory. Some of it will make you angry, some parts will bring smiles and maybe some laughs. But it is raw Veronica, a little older, somewhat wiser, but still our girl/woman. I could see possibly a sequel, the door is open, new questions asked some resolutions maybe not as resolved as they could have been, but that is/was her life. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you enjoyed the TV show, you'll enjoy the movie as well. One thing, if you don't already know Miss Mars, go watch the TV show first it helps.
Point one: this is a very good psychological thriller, full of clever plotting and well played intrigue.Point two: This is part of a huge lifetime opus of Sidney Lumet's work that I am only beginning to savor and enjoy. Am I lucky or what?And the main point: Why isn't Beau Bridges in every movie all the time.Yes you love his brother Jeff. We all love Jeff. But the secret is if the two decided to have a charisma-off, Beau would just stand there and smile and he would win, hands down.I could watch three hours of Brau Bridges chuckling and grinning and lounging around with Robert Preston as the affable Dobbs and feel like it was time well spent. I'm transported back to a more civilized era.And the add James Mason casting shadows and angst everywhere and you've got yourself a show.And if you ever want to see that magic in action, this movie should be the first place you go. Tha man does gymnastics for crying out loud, in slacks and a tie and without missing a beat!Please enjoy!
A former student (Beau Bridges) returns to his old Catholic prep school after ten years, this time as the new Gym teacher, Mr. Reese. His free-spirited approach is in sharp contrast to the dire mood he finds, especially from the sour Latin teacher, Mr. Jerome (James Mason- LOLITA, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH). Reese quickly discovers a dark secret among the students. For some reason, simple pranks have escalated into dangerous acts of brutality. Just what has Reese stumbled into? After allying himself w/ the kindly Mr. Dobbs (Robert Preston), Reese tries to solve the mystery behind the almost ritualistic violence. Can they get to the truth before someone is killed? Meanwhile, Jerome seems to mentally disintegrate before their eyes. CHILD'S PLAY is a deceptively calm film full of macabre atmosphere and sacrilegious imagery. The fiendish finale is perfectly bleak and disturbing...
There are good actors and good writing and a concept that does not get much air time- consequences for our actions.
The second season gets a little too far away from Earl's list and onto some unrelated adventures but still a lot of fun.
Love Eddie Izzard, good to see him straight acting, proves he can do it. Minnie Driver is great also.& supporting cast.
This is not run of the mill comedy. It has sacrasim and wit. I can watch several in a row. That is a major test for any comedy. Half hour increments can seem entertaining. Watching several of the same show in a row is the major test. This one stands up.The actors are superb.
The Riches is the most recent TV show I've been watching, and I have one question. How in the world could they cancel it!? More people watched the premier of The Riches than ever watched an episode of the Shield or Rescue Me. It's also got to be one of the most creative shows I've ever seen! The show centers around the Molloy family, a family of modern day gypsies. Today is a big day for them as the matriarch of their family is being released from jail, after serving a two year sentence. A big party is thrown for her and all seems well in the Molloy family, but things aren't what they seem. The Molloy family is forced to leave their camp. Wayne (Eddie Izzard) is not going empty handed though. Before leaving he cracks the camp leaders safe and takes a substantial amount of money. Once on the road, they run into another family from camp, that had been oblivious to what was going on. It doesn't take them long to realize something isn't right, but before they can confront them, the Molloy's take off and a big highway RV chase begins. During the chase a passing motorist and his wife are killed. The man and woman are Doug and Shrine Rich, and they are on their way to a new home in Eden Falls. Doug was a savvy lawyer, who made a fortune at the expense of others. On this day he and his new wife were on the run also, moving away from everyone and everything they've ever known to move to a new state and into a new house they bought on the internet. Thanks to paper work in the car, Wayne Molloy quickly realizes who these people were and where they were going. It is then that he decides it's time to stop traveling the country and settle into a nice, normal, "buffer", lifestyle. Living in Eden Falls as Doug and Shrine. Along with their 3 kids, the Molloy's try to adapt from being a family of travelers to a family of wealth and stability. The show is amazing! There are so many twist and turns, cons and jokes, ups and downs, It's so well written, with an outrageous cast of characters, and most important of all, a storyline I promise you have never seen before!  The show was cancelled by FX in late 2008, but both seasons are available, and according to Wikipedia, Eddie Izzard and the show's creator are currently working on a full length feature film. If you want something different crossing comedy, drama, and action, then I'd say The Riches are for you!
This seemed so ridiculous at first, but halfway through my husband and I were hooked even though we both agreed that intelligent people could not be fooled this long.  Also, we would never have friends like these folks in our lives.  They are too immoral.
I didn't know anything about Sarah other then her famous Jimmy Kimmel song about "Matt Damon" & "Ben Afflect", and a small interview in "The Artistocrats" which made me think she may actually be a hilarious female comic that doesn't just do jokes about how much better a woman is over a man... so seeing this show on DVD for a low price, I figured i would have a look and see if she could make me laugh... and yes she did!The show is like Seinfeld in the way it's about nothing, but I never did like Seinfeld and never will, but the Sarah Silverman Program I will be watching for many years to come. It stars Sarah and her sister, they live in place, they have 2 gay neighbors, a dog, and coffee shop, people call her on the phone, she likes cookies and her parents are dead. That's about all there is to it, the rest of it is just some funny little story of the week to go around it.I think Sarah's gotta be the top female comic in the world today, and very underated, so check out her show if ya want, other wise, why are you reading this? Go away then.
Liking this show depends on how much you like Sarah. I think she is a funny gal, so I like the show. The show is full of potty humor and she does have a very good "off the wall" supporting cast. Since there are only 6 episodes included in season 1, I won't be buying this set unless it drops down in price a little. I can't wait to see season two!
Really makes you stop and think what if this really did happen in our world what would you do.  Very interesting, has the since of community in it.
I like watching Jericho very much and look forward to viewing each new episode. It's all about small town America pulling together in time of disaster with lots of twists and turns. Very entertaining.  The editing of this TV series could be better. Lots of blank time in between where commercials were but not sure how that could be remedied.
My husband and I enjoy watching in the evening on Prime via the Roku. No commercials, only watch what we want to watch. This series is pretty entertaining. Nice to compare what we would do versus what the town has done.
It's hard to watch how childish people are.  How we humans get through a disaster, baffles me.  99% of the sheeple just complain and steal and complain, no one rising to the occasion, everyone yelling my brother my father my sister my children, parochial.So I don't wonder this series only lasted two seasons.  The mirror, hurts.Most poignant in the first episode is the narrow-minded mother who accuses the mayor of not knowing what it's like to have your kid 'out there', when in fact Jake is 'out there', and his dad the mayor, doesn't know if he's still alive.  But he has no luxury to think about that, to cry, to worry.But oh, that mother thinks she's supposed to yell at the mayor, to be a good mother.  Instead, she's not only a bad mother, but a bad human being, heedless of anyone but her own ego.  She obviously doesn't even care about her kids;  because if she did, she'd be trying to help, not yelling.Hope someone will redo the series, for we need to see how hypocritical, parochial and ill-prepared we are, to assemble and think through a crisis, always expecting someone else to handle it;  always uninterested in the big picture, uninterested in doing something ourselves, always ready to blame someone else, never paying attention.It was always 'cool' to pay little attention in school.  Only the bad guys run things.  To be disinterested in anything but one's narrow circle, is supposed to be a virtue.  Yeah, and this is what we get for such bad attitudes.So this series really focuses on WHY war occurs.  Dark lesson never learned.  Which you know, because the music is totally at odds with the theme of the series.  Hence only four stars.
i enjoy the blend of tension with everyday life. this is a solid plot background for that kind of mix.just one question: wth happened with Heather?!Emily and Jake just seems so...trope.
The first season was, in this reviewers opinion, the best television ever made.  The second was virtually unwatchable.Pros:The show is like "Picket Fences"PilotmeetsThe Road Warrior. You get the small town dynamics of folks who have generations of family and a lifetime of history then just to keep the storylines from getting too girly you have the whole post apocalypse thing going on.Likewise, there are the moral decisions that people must make. What is the correct action to take? What are the rewards and punishments for that action? In the end, the answers are ambiguous, just like life, but the struggle for moral truth - with all the history and entanglements that folks in a small town have - is almost as compelling as the struggle for survival.While I'm sure it wasn't intended, the series is a powerful endorsement of Federalism. A strong city government maintains order while the federal and state governments collapse. The fact that the city government succeeds is in large part to the small town history of relationships.Cons:If history teaches us anything, human society is surprisingly resilient. While things like Katrina, the Great Chicago Fire, and/or the Great San Francisco earthquake have caused localized destruction of society for short periods, within a few weeks or month's life reverts to normal. Social norms are resumed and law and order return. In WWII Germany and Japan, despite the general destruction of the nation and mass hunger, society more or less functioned.The U.S. is a country of 300,000,000 plus. It is geographically huge. I don't think 10 or 20 atomic weapons would result in a complete destruction of society. The plot addresses this by saying that Jericho was in the middle of nuclear fall out zones but spared due to unique weather patterns. Still, I would suspect that what is left of the United States would mount a heroic rescue effort of these isolated pockets. It just might take a couple of months.The whole CIA/terrorist storyline really doesn't add anything to the best parts of the show and actually distracts from it.Most of the corn in the U.S. is not edible by humans. It is grown to feed to livestock or to turn into corn syrup. I suspect that there would be a lot more hunger in Jericho.Realize that Kansas is tornado country, but found the number of people who had their own backup generators and stockpile of gas a bit unbelievable.Overall, if you can get past the parts that seem unrealistic, Jericho - especially the first season - is as good as network television gets.
This was a very good series and the characters was great.  The story line is great and their is plenty of action and suspend.  You do not know who to trust and trying to keep order is a must.  It is a sci fi and a thriller with plenty of action.  You can see in this series who people may react to a nuclear attack.  This is a present day civil war within the United States,
Pretty good series.  There's not that many episodes so don't get too attached.We liked it.  Typical disaster plot.  Enjoy.
It started out a little slow but the actors and the camera work really pulled this together. After about the fifth episode I was hooked and looked forward to watching the next episode. It was well done except some of the flash backs weren't necessary but all in all I recommend it.
This show depicts events that could possibly happen although I pray it never, ever does. It is well acted and am wondering why it only lasted two seasons.
Give current events this is an interesting story line....Gives you something serious to think about...Survival in an unthinkable situation...However...I think the town is taking the situation way too calmly..but they don't have anyother  choice but to do so.Suitable for teenagers and up I THINK ..
A well-developed series that will likely appeal to viewers who like books such as Stephen King's &#34;The Stand&#34; and current television series like &#34;Revolution.&#34;
You need to give it a chance, like about 5 episodes. The acting is good but the theme music grates on my nerves. It is harsh and has way too many horns between episodes, but the music in the episodes is right on and the characters are well cast and act their roles well. I don't know how many seasons this show was on, but I'm enjoying it.
first few episodes pretty interesting. but as the season moves forwardthe plots are not as interesting and dont develop as much as they could.
As usual, there are some characters you will like and others who you will love to hate.  So far, so good.
The tv series is enjoyable but not very believable.  Disasters certainly bring out the stupid in people.It was nice to see a show that didn't have zombies.
Kind of low budget but an interesting premise. It was too bad it was canceled. That said this show suffers from what a lot of post-apocalyptic shows suffer from, there is no set end date for the show. It's a great story but with no hard end date they just keep adding plot twists with no conclusion.
This a great show, fast moving, and exciting, had many surprise endings, which made jump right to the next eps.
Generally a good production. Realistic depictions of nuclear weapons and radiation effects. Also pretty realistic depiction of EMP effects (older vehicles without computerized electronic ignitions able to run etc).And then I just like some of the players in whatever role they play.
Very realistic situations...no aliens or vampires. Makes you want to store up and makes you realize how quickly you can go from much to none.
The show was an interesting concept and took a while to figure out who did the dirty work. The acting was a bit over the top...
I just started this series but so far, the acting is good, the story believable and the setting interesting so will be watching to see if it follows true to form. Thank you.
Kinda hokey at first, but better as it grew.  Got to be pretty &#34;real&#34; I thought.  Watch season two, don't know why this ended so quickly.Good for a binge on rainy dull days!
Main actor, however is too predictable.  He is too easily emotional and reacts that way.  I know, it's the script for effect.
I was fairly familiar with the history behind King Henry VIII; this dramatization is really entertaining.  I am in the middle of season 3, and still enjoying it!
Out of all the reigning monarchs of England and elsewhere whose lives would have made a smashingly entertaining soap opera, that of Henry VIII is generally acknowledged to be at the top of anyone's short list. The man certainly had a way with serial monogamy, and as such has kept writers like Philippa Gregory, movie-makers, playwrights and the BBC busy for decades. Make that centuries, for even Shakespeare had a go. One would think there isn't another blessed thing that could be said about the much-married monarch, and yet Showtime has managed it. And they haven't even gotten up to the point where he had finally and irrevocable divested himself of his first wife and married the second - in the process almost casually wrenching England out of the orbit of the Catholic Church. This season just sets the stage and establishes the personalities.In one way, this reminded me rather vividly of the movie "Elizabeth", in that it combined psychological acuity with considerable historical inaccuracy. Yes, there are all sorts of inaccuracies, merged events, death of historical personages that did not occur for years after the events depicted here, deaths that did not in the least happen as represented here, and strikingly divergent  visualizations of personalities - not least of which is Henry himself.This is not the usual Henry VIII, a heavy-set and peevish middle-aged man; here he is vital, young and passionate; a sort of rock-star king, as charming as he is - perhaps - a sociopath. He is the sun around which the whole of his court and government revolve. Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks nothing like the historical Henry. However, he conveys the arrogant attraction of the man and his single-minded pursuit of his desires, whether it was victory on the tilt-yard or in a diplomatic convocation... or to be rid of a wife who could not bear him a son. One has the sense that yes, Henry VIII was probably very much like this; charming, mercurial and dangerous to cross - and that his court was a snake pit of seething ambitions and relentless plotting to gain his ear and his favor.Eventually Henry would be also be rid of anyone around him who dared to tell him "no", and that is what is the larger drama in this first season: the downfall and disgrace of his most trusted adviser and chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill) and the setting aside of his proud and able wife, the Catholic Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) in favor of the younger and presumably fruitful (and Protestant) Anne Boleyn. This is the point which has been reached in the series finale, although for my money, the most noteworthy climax was that moment of quiet horror when Thomas More (Jeremy Northam) and another councilor seemed to realize that there was absolutely no one left at court who would be able to reason or coax Henry out of the disastrous course that he had set.Of the extra features included in this set, the most interesting is a look at series production and sets, and a tour of modern-day sites in London associated with Henry VIII's court.
Love,  the show, even watching it for the 2nd time again. Jon Rhees is a smoking hot HenryVlll, and the era costumes are awesome.
While its not very accurate as has been stated.  It is good however to see the King be himself and the energy that he brings to the character.  The customes and sites seem to have been well done also.  I'm however not a big fan of explicit disregard for his wife and daughter despite Henry's "caring" about her.  It might have be the thing to do at that time but it irritated me everytime.  He was in a room with his wife, the Queen and the mistress Anne is there as well.  He's suddenly so in love and can't live without her.  He wants to divorce his wife because the marriage was supposedly not legal.All of sudden after all the one nighters with women he probably can't even remember or name if put to the test.  His focus should be more on running the country and all the other issues that the people are having around him, not chasing after a woman (that has more skeletons in her closet than a cemetary).  While i enjoyed Johnathan Rhys Meyers acting in in this for the most part and he's very likeable guy.  I can't help but hope that the story picks up for this series.It has some promise and i hope that the Tudors can deliver on that in the 2nd season.  I'd like to see more about the Queen, her background and other relevant issues that Henry went through during his time.
I had forgotten how well acted this entire series was. Watch the entire series from the beginning it will renew your faith in the acting community. This series is far better then most of the movies that are put out today.
I just finished viewing the first season and i have to admit its a great costume period drama.  It does drag in some places and the acting can be a bit over the top. That being said its a solid B+ mini series.
Considering this particular period was so filled with change, twists of fate, rises, falls, and nearly every other device found in great dramas, I expected better than a seeming focus on the sexual antics of the characters. Otherwise, very well done and for those who don't have good background in the period when Henry VIII was King of England, it should hold your attention.
This show takes an exciting look at a crucial time in history.  If you can get past the sex scenes, the show does a great job showing this complex time in England.
Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.This immensely poular series is interesting. I like historical dramas. However, my problem is that there's no historical summary prior to the series, as there is in The Borgias. A historical summary of past events leading up to what occurs in the series is most helpful, so I was somewhat lost as to who is who and who is doing what to who and why. That being said, this series is intriguing.
I had read an article on Jeremy Irons who I guess stars as an older Richard and decided to start from the beginning. Glad I did.
Though the series has taken some liberties with historical events and omitted others, this is still an entertaining drama. Henry at times became quite annoying with his tantrums, and his habit of casting aside those who anger him or no longer hold his interest while historically accurate made me dislike him as well. That said, I don't imagine we are supposed to like him over much. The side dealing of scheming and the power of the church back then made for good drama. All in all I enjoyed it though the sex scenes I could have lived without. I'm not prudish in the least. My dis like is more in the form of boredom. Yawn, yet another sex scene when I'm more interested in plot development. I love history, and while this shows a made for good television history instead of the more accurate events, it was fun to watch. One example is that Henry the 8th son didn't die as a small child at all, and it wasn't the sweating sickness that killed him. Those who must see things as portrayed accurately will be disappointed.
its better than most shows on tv but that's not saying much. its not very historically accurate from what i can tell but it's interesting to watch
I just finished watching the entire first season of "The Tudors." When the show first premiered on Showtime, I watched the pilot episode and never bothered to watch it again. I thought the show was visually appealing, but way too melodramatic and historically inaccurate for my taste. However, I recently read a fascinating book about Henry VIII, and I needed something else to satisfy my Tudor fixation. I watched all the episodes of "The Tudors" On Demand in less than a week, and I really enjoyed them.In order to appreciate this program, you have to be willing to accept the show for what it is. Yes, the majority of the characters and plots in the show are based on real historical events, but this is a cable television series, and of course things are going to be changed to appeal to a larger commercial audience. As a result, all of the people in King Henry's court are much more attractive than they probably were in real life, and there are some major alterations to historical timelines. Still, I'm impressed that the producers actually did get so many things right with the show, and overall, it's very engaging to watch. The pacing is exciting and fast...perhaps a little too fast, in my opinion. For example, Elizabeth "Bessie" Blount gets knocked up with Henry's illegitimate child in the very first episode, and by the second episode, she's already giving birth. I wonder how long "The Tudors" can realistically continue to air with such a rushed chain of events.For the most part, I think the casting of the show is excellent. I've never been a big fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers until now, but his portrayal of Henry VIII is intense, dramatic, and exciting. Sam Neill is brilliant as the two-faced Cardinal Wolsey, and Natalie Dormer is perfect as the bewitching Anne Boleyn. As far as the characterizations of these famous characters goes, I think Henry VIII has been a bit one-sided in Season 1. I'll be interested to see how Meyers tackles the role when Henry finds himself betrayed by the woman he nearly sacrifices his kingdom for. It would be nice to see a more emotional side of Henry. Also, I think Anne has actually been pretty likable so far...hopefully she'll become a much darker character in Season 2.Overall, I enjoyed "The Tudors" much more than I thought I would. It's entertaining, and people who enjoy learning about this period in history will definitely get a kick out of it. I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of Season 2.
A really grasping tale of young king Henry VIII is a story based explicitly on lust and deception, lawlessness and arbitrariness still well inherited into valid law and order to date somewhere in the modern-looking world.
Rome has clearly inspired Showtime to produce this miniseries in 10 one hour parts, portraying Henry VIII's more youthful and vigorous days.  The timespan is a small one, from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon, to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn... so we only get to wife number 2 - plenty of scope for sequels, but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.As it is, the key players here are Henry VIII, in his low 20's, fighting fit and clearly horny (there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season).. Cardinal Wolsey (played with great presence by Sam Neill) the corrupt but efficient First Minister, and Sir Thomas More, the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances, well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.It falls short of Rome's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama - the scenes of `Real' England, the bars and backstreets, are only rarely seen, but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times.  Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty, may well have helped accentuate the drama.Having said that, and despite a few forgivable departures from history, this works well as a refresher on Tudor history, and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.Kudos to Showtime, and I await the next series with bated breath..Extras are modest, but rewarding - a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets, and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London, all moderately interesting.  A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition, but is lacking.Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series - a cunning plan, and a welcome one.
What Showtime's historical drama The Tudors lacks in historical accuracy, it more than makes up for with it's wonderful production design and well chosen cast.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as King Henry VIII, whose sexual appetites are only matched by his desire for power and to ultimately get his way.  The only person in his court that matches his desire for power is his closest advisor, Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill), who Henry's subordinates Brandon (Henry Cavill), Norfolk (Henry Czerny), and George Boleyn (Nick Dunning) seek to remove from power.  Involved in their plans are Boleyn's daughters, specifically Anne (Natalie Dormer) who catches Henry's eye and becomes a thorn in the side of Henry's wife Katherine (Maria Doyle Kennedy).  The performances are great, the production is grand, and as a whole, The Tudors is thoroughly entertaining and engrossing.  It lacks the epic feel that say, HBO's Rome, manages to weave; but the potential here is high for the show to become something special indeed.  All in all, if you're looking for pure historical accuracy, you won't find it with The Tudors, but instead you will find an entertaining historical drama that delivers the goods.
I wish I learned more about the English monarchy back in the day when I was in school. I may not have been interested back then but I am now. Learning more about these events and a possible storyline, fictional I'm sure, does make it entertaining. What more can I ask from a TV series?
As a fan of period movies, I could not miss the Season 1 of "The Tudors".  Henry VIII, King of England is known to most as a man who broke from the Catholic Church to become Head of the Church of England and marry six women. Such infamy secured him a place in history, but so was the fact that it was his daughter with Anne Boleyn - Queen Elizabeth I, who was one of the most benevolvent rules of her time.  In any case, season 1 has four DVDs that will entertain you for almost 12 hours.  Perfect time to watch it would be this holiday season.  I was suprised that series had so much sex in it but also the twists and turns about historical background for Henry's decision-making and his pick of the closest advisors on his court is something I wanted to understand better.  Writers do get sloppy towards the end of the series and the language is not as sophisticated as one would expect it to be on the Court of one of the greatest kings of his time.  I find Jonathan Rhys Meyers to be excellent in his role, but perhaps too young to play a king married for 20 years to Queen Catherine.  Maria Kennedy who play Queen Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England is graceful and dignified.  Unlike the actress Natalie Dormer portraying Anne Boleyn.  Ms. Dormer is too coarse and unsophisticated in her role for a someone (like Anne Boleyn)who was witty enought to keep Henry's interest for so long,speak fluent French after being at the French court for many years.  This portrayal of Anne Boleyn is not befitting of a woman who was a mother of one of the most influential queens of the british royal history.  Court politics, intrigues and the switch of loyalties will keep your attention.  The lessons learned are the ones that apply event o today's modern times and that is perhaps the one more reason for having this series so popular.  I cannot wait to see season 2.  Costumes and jewelry are breathtaking.
I am enjoying the Tudors very much. Some acting could be improved but overall the action is exciting. It is entertaining.
Great cast.  Surprisingly substantive and high production quality.  Showtime always felt like HBO-Lite to me and this series is a direct competitor to Game of Thrones without the dragons.
Like so many series do after a few years, Season 6 starts feeling too much. Granted the whole series is extremely intense but now I'm starting to be disillusioned with the many character and he episodes are becoming a bit choppy and sometimes meaningless. Still great acting and gritty drama, but it feels like a next to the last season for this series.
With Season 6 we find Shane in a conundrum over happenings from Season 5.  To make matters worse, Shane and Vic are at odds.The writing is still tight but the camaraderie between the Strike Team is very, VERY loose.  In the end, Vic and Aceveda form an alliance that benefits each other -- for the time being.Even though at this point the series has run the gamut and is heading for an end, it is still 'must see' viewing.  Like a soap opera of life unfolding in front of your face, The Shield and Farmington Division are part of an effort for FX to provide very sharp work to the masses.Great job to those folks who were believers of the network before it had a chance to fold.
This season is good, but not great. That can be attributed to the fact that there are only 10 episodes for the season. It mostly deals with the fallout from Lem's death at the end of season 5. Because season five was also short, only 11 episodes, this season should just be considered a continuation of that.The first couple of episodes wrap up the Jon Kavanaugh storyline. There's also a new leader for the Strike Team, Kevin Hiatt, the San Marcos Murders, Vic searching for Lem's killer, Julian is promoted to the Strike Team, Dutch not meshing with Billings, Tina teaming up with Danny, Dutch trying to get with Tina, Shane cutting a deal with the Armenians, and a new bad guy behind the things going on in Farmington.This season was good, and probably would get a 5, but compared to the first 4 seasons of the Shield, it just wasn't in the same class.
I have been watching this series for a while now.  I always heard good things about it, it is amazing how much corruption is in the series.  The end is near and the series goes out with a bang.
Alex character in this show is good.  I didnt like the lanaguage on the show. But did watch season 6. Just a like to much violence for me that is why I only gave it 4 stars.
entertaining,it amazes me how the lie keeps on getting covered and uncovered.not many dull moments in this series and it is good to watch some of my favorite actors in earlier roles.
This collection contains most of the Hope movies of the 1960s - some of which I saw when released in movie theaters. Unlike his earlier 'Road Shows' these movies are all in color and some have his side-kick Phyllis Diller. Only a couple are ones I consider sort of funny (I'll take Sweden & Boy did I get the Wrong Number). I got this collection because my husband is a Bob Hope fan. But, he watches these shows a lot less often than he does his 'Road to -- wherever shows. In fact there are a couple of this collection he has not yet watched.
"Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number" is my favorite Bob Hope film. I have loved this movie since I was a child, and now MY kids watch it over and over. Phyllis Diller on a motorcycle is a sight to see! Just give it a chance....it's a great lighthearted, fun movie that isn't the usual Hollywood "dirty word and perversion" fest. There is some mild innuendo going on, but it's tame compared to what is on modern "family" shows these days.
I enjoyed watching this show. It isn't as good as a show like Law & Order: SUV. This show kept my attention. If you like police shows, you will probably enjoy this show.
