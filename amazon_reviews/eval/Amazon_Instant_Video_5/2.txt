I had big expectations because I love English TV, in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring. It didn't appeal to me at all.
he's OK. His humor consists mainly of varying between a Vietnamese accent and a smooth articulate presentation of ironic situations.
hope they start changing the plot a little faster, never seen so many pole changes in one show in one week
I used to watch this as a kid. We could only get it when the atmospheric conditions were just right and the tv antenna was turned to just the right direction to get the one station that played this at 10pm. They would show this as a double feature with Dark Shadows. It is fascinating to see how much has changed in how we treat each other and how tv is made.
The first season of "The Outer Limits" was the best. Sure the second season had some classic episodes (among them "Solider" and "Demon with a Glass Hand" which inspired James Cameron to come up with "The Terminator". I'd give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue. Why? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time. They haven't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don't get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving "The Man Who Was Never Born" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was "The Outer Limits" as its best. Also we get "The Galaxy Being" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in "The Sixth Finger" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human."The Zanti Misfits" like much of Stefano's work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get "The Borderlands" and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like "Human Factor" but almost everything here is terrific even if we're only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on "The Outer Limits"? Because MGM is convinced that you'll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they've split them up. Heck, the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs. Nope. These are dual sided as well.So what do you get? 16 episodes--half the first season of the series. In August you can get the second half of the first season. I'm at a loss here--why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package? The only reason is so that retailers (such as Best Buy) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again. If you're going to do this at least give us some extras (a featurette on the visual effects, vintage interviews with the late Joe Stefano or Leslie Stevens, commentary tracks with Suchow discussing the making of the episode.The show deserves 5 stars but Sony/MGM deserves 0 stars for this reissue. Get this instead.The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1
Man, things were going great for the most violent prime time TV show ever (less the killing of Curtis - one of those moments where clearly the writers simply wants to shock the audience or need to get rid of the actor for some reason). Things went downhill (in my humble opinion)after the Fayed plot was solved. By "downhill" I don't mean disater, because a show of this magnitude, where each episode has so many differnt scenarios, shot on locatiosns cenes, special effects, etc, rarely is mediocre. You get the feel that the everyone involved is giving their best.What I mean by downhil is the above mentioned people (cast, producers, technical guys, writers) giving their best for a flawed premise. The Chinese / Russian plot was so farfetched, so forced, so  unplausible. After all, the advantage of obtaining some secret technologie about your enemy is useful since he does not know that you possess his defense technology! Also, to see Audrey Raines appears only briefly and as a "zombie" was a bad call.Well, that's it. Anyway, I think the show still did not jump the shark, but this will happen soon.
Just finished watching season 6 on DVD. (I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already) Dumbest ideas ever in 24. Fox should definetely fire the writers! There got to be more qualified people out there?Don`t buy it. Rather buy season 5 (which was great)
Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here, I don't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is. So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don't flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them. So, they in turn, gave up on the CW.All speculation aside, VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season. The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact, but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts. The ratings that they're suffering aren't because of quality of show, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we're watching... and unfortunately, we're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore.
Wait, Veronica is a freshman at imaginary U!  Not being a fan of the original Veronica Mars series, I found this one hard to swallow and even harder to engage in.  Maybe old fanboys and girls will enjoy seeing their favorite characters &#34;aged&#34; for this new series, but as a newcomer I found little to like or engage me.
You know the plot. Trashy kids being trashy. The &#34;good&#34; ones are the &#34;poor&#34; ones. The rich trashy kids are just &#34;bad&#34;. Another movie to help the retarded careers of this TV show's actors. They are all old and washed out. But they still try to be hip and cool with their texting and foul mouths, sex videos. Sorry if you can't route for the heroine of the movie it clearly isn't worth watching.
There's a scene in Misery where the author writes what he thinks his nurse/tormentor wants to read and suffers for his presumption. Her main problem is the fact that he cheated when he explained that his heroine was alive, but there was also the fact that he was second guessing his audience. Instead of writing something that he could be proud of, he wrote something that he thought that the audience wanted. In many ways, the decline in quality of Veronica Mars reflected this issue. In the third season of Veronica Mars, Rob Thomas veered away from the season long arc and the feminist context and chose instead to focus on shorter story arcs and one-off episodes that didn't tie into the arcs. Instead of making the show easy for potential new fans, Thomas disappointed the existing fans.There was also the issue of the heroine graduating from high school. The teenage detective angle worked better when the setting was high school and there was a great metaphor about tying in hard boiled mysteries with high school where no one really is what they appear to be. Buffy recovered from the same setback, but just barely.This movie tries to go in the opposite direction of the third season by making a movie that is solely for the fans but retains that same desperate &#34;LOVE ME&#34; vibe that wrecked the last season. A little fan service is nice. It's cool to see Mac and Wallace again. Veronica working to solve the case and manipulating the police force to do it is fine. It's even nice to see Veronica and Logan fall into their old patterns.Ken Marino has established himself in comedic roles in shows like Party Down and Children's Hospital so why not bring back Vinnie Van Lowe.Yet, a little goes a long way and too much just becomes aggravating. Do we really need to get Piz again? Especially when he is still the nice guy that Veronica basically ignores. Does Madison have to be a one-dimensional villain ten years later? Weevil shows up to AGAIN end up on the wrong side of the law. Krysten Ritter appears and then reminds everyone who she was in season 2. The only strange moment of restraint in the movie was not bringing back Adam Scott as the teacher who had sex with a student even though the movie revolves around Carrie Bishop who accused him of rape in the Mars vs. Mars episode from season 1. When the ten year reunion has a tribute to the dead classmates, you almost expect it to take over the movie since there were a lot of dead high school students on the show.With all the fan service, the director and writer forget to tell a compelling story. It's a two hour episode with references that require the Veronica Mars wiki to fully get. Unfortunately, as you are referring to the Wiki, you are getting spoiled for the rather pedestrian mystery - which should already be obvious since it follows the &#34;really popular cult actor shows up in a minor role&#34; pattern.This isn't a bad movie. It just isn't a very good movie.
Once again TV Types get it WRONG Lying is Lying is LYING .... and so the whole premise of a person becoming better TANKS ... watch the rest on the internet for free .... don't support these writers ...
I found these people to be liars, crooks, backstabbers and cons,yet they are portrayed as heroes, that just does not compute getreal they are crooks plain and simple.
I tried three times to watch this series, but I cannot get past the first episode, where the main characters (who remember, we are all supposed to be able to relate to)lie, cheat, steal, assault, bilk, pilfer, pickpocket, participate in vehicular homicide and then escape to a life of the super-rich. No, they all should have just been caught, arrested, tried and thrown in prison, end of series.I love Eddie Izzard as a comedian and as an actor, but this series simply crosses my ethical lines; you do not make heroes out of villains, you just don't send that message to the world, unless you make it clear that what you are promoting and supporting and suggesting EVIL as a justified way of life. Just because they are part of an even worse criminal element, that does not forgive them for their actions, which they never have to face, that does not give the producers the right to present an upside-down morality play as if it were OK to just kill someone, take over their life, impersonate them, and go about your business as if nothing evil happened, or that it wasn't your fault.So I'll just prop the soapbox up over here and quietly walk away, while you figure out why you want to watch bad people get away with bad things.
This programme surprised me as not veryy funny in lots of ways. By trying to be as offending and gross as possible, Sarah Silverman actually achieves the opposite: she bores us to death at times. There is a great lack in consistency in the writing which makes it very difficult to watch any episode in its entirety.
I love this genre but just could not get into this series.Girl leaves town with no gas in the tank, bar full of people ignoring the firetruck as it blasts out a warning that the radioactive mushroom cloud is coming in 45 minutes, the only two cars on the road within 10 miles and they run head on into each other? Who writes this stuff?
I think Jericho has some great actors.  Unfortunately the story really isn't as great or as accurate as the writers want you to believe.All these cities have just been destroyed, and yet, more often than not, the people are remaining extremely calm in the small town, and actually having unrealistic conversations about what their future would be like involved in relationships and whatnot.If over 20 cities had been destroyed, setting my sights on my future would be the *last* thing I would be thinking about- just trying to survive should be important enough.  There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else.  Not these emotional scenes that in real life would never happen.There's some nice twists from some of the main characters, but it is pretty hard keeping up with everything, and understanding what's going on can be a difficult enough task.  Still, it's not a bad show, but it's not the best, and it's kind of overrated.
Yet another &#34;apocolypse&#34; show written by &#34;big city dwellers&#34; who have a total &#34;city centered&#34; view of EVERYTHING.Let me start by sayiing that the premise of the shows &#34;disaster&#34; is not too bad.  We are drawn in by being left guessing as to the nature of what has happened.This is where it wanders off the path.  The small town of Jericho is nothing more than a minature version of New York or LA from other movies.  with the exception of one or two &#34;farms,&#34; EVERYTHING ceases to exist at the town limits.  A character is either &#34;of the town&#34; or an &#34;outsider&#34; and that is it.It is plainly obvious that the writers have never spent any time in the real world, outside of a big city.  Rural America does not work like this.  Small towns blur.  The town limits rarely really limit the towns themselves and they often sort of blend into nearby communities and they really do encompass surrounding rural areas.  This is not europe and the local twons here are not, and never were, the local strongholds, complete with castle.No, while the initial premise of this series is well thought out, the mechanics of it are way out of touch with the reality of life in rural America.  It lost my interest in the middle of the first season and I can readily see why it died so quickly.  Big city dwellers would have no interest, whatsoever, and real rural citizens are just going to take one look and turn it off.  It could have been done much better.
The Jericho premise is fresh and interesting. But I just finished watching the pilot and I find that the story line is weighed down by the poorly developed characters and a lot of cliches about small town America. It is entirely peopled by "aw shucks" "salt-of-the-earth" folks. The kind of people you will never meet in the real world, not even in Kansas. Maybe the writers should visit fly over country to get a better sense of what they're writing about.
I just do not like the main character.The only person who seems to like him, is his Mother.His ex-girlfriend hates him, his brother is furious with him, his father is dissapointed with him.Nobody (actors, seem to have a clear line on who they're supposed to be).So far, after 7 episodes,for the first Season, I don't know who, or what anyone is either.Is the owner of the general store, just a stone beetch? Is the IRS auditor just a stone beetch?There is so much good TV. I do not have time to try to figure out what the writers of this show were trying to get across. In my opinion, they had a dart board in their office, and threw darts at it, to see which ones stayed.I'm definately, not willing to watch 18 or so hours of this floundering program.
This could have been an interesting series if not for the turgid script and the banal soap operish love triangles.
I started off liking the show, but it soon lost my interest.  I found much of it to be rather maudlin.  The series is just not very well written.
I see now why TV is considered a wasteland. This TV show is stupid. These TV producers have a formula, then the produce a TV show, like Jericho. And where do these immature male leading characters come from? The guy is 32. He acts like he is 12. Sad.
What show are the rest of these reviewers watching? I was excited to see this after reading the reviews, but barely made it through the first two hours. Incredibly boring, like a lavish network soap with all that implies. The history is sketchy; if you're going to twist history, at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time. Then again, I don't watch tv, only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good. Guess that's not the best way either! Oh well, I found The Office (the funny version) and Arrested Development that way, so it can't be all bad. Didn't work this time, though.Pass.
I watched this long after I should have quit hoping it would become redeming in some way but it kept getting worse.  I would not recommend it.
I don't care for this version of BG. First, Boomer and Starbuck are women they should have made them men. Don't get me wrong their should be women fighter pilots but because they were 2 of the main characters practically every episode was about sexual intrigue, jealousy, and who's sleeping with who this week. Secondly, they use bullets instead of lasers. My guess is the producers did this to save money on special effects. Third, the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they haven't even cured cancer. A society enlightend and advanced as this(at least 100-200 years or more advanced than earth) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and/or outlawed it. Almost every actor was a drinker, smoker or both. I suspect tobacco companies and alcohol beverage companies paid the actors and probably the producers under the table to smoke in the series. They also would have cured cancer and almost every other disease. It looks like they were practicing 1940's medicine.
Season 2 through the first few episodes of season 3 which I consider part of the season 1-2 story line were great.  Season 3 the writers missed the mark by a large margin.  I just finished forcing myself to watch season 3.  The first two seasons I couldn't believe I had missed this show when it was on, after season 3 I'm speechless at the waste of time it was.  All sorts of character development which should have been woven into the first two seasons, and only warranted being short flashbacks and segments of the better shows to fill in some blanks as to why certain characters where the way they were, but to waste a season on it?  The whole farce of a story around the man who allowed the original attack and became president only to have him walk free?  I've wanted to personally put him out an airlock since episode 2 of season 1 and they finally get his butt on trial and let him walk?  Its not a letdown, it is maddening that I wasted the time.  I understand Season 4 picks up and gets back on track thank god.  Bottom line is except for the freeing from New Caprica the rest of season 3 was not worth watching.  All the background on the Admirals marriage, and the character background should have been boiled down to 10% of the first two seasons, not stretched through an entire season 3.  Oh, and let's just have a season where the enemy just goes away and focus on labor unions and peoples dysfunctional childhoods.  Frak them all.
so i truly enjoyed the first two seasons of Battlestar...truly awesome, military sci/fi show, insane sets, great plot, good acting and those Cylons. all great....the end of season two had some difficulties. alot ALOT less action and more crying. lots of crying. lots of drama. lots of forgetting the entire purpose of the show.season three is where ive ended my battlestar lust....i truly cant take Starbuck anymore, whiny brat...could care less about her romantic interests nor her false bravado.entire spisodes went by with nary a mention of the Cylons.....which, lets be honest...is the best thing about the show.it seems they lost focus or they changed course to appeal to the more 'dramatic' aspects while shelving the 'sci/fi' alltogether.terrible mistake.... i fear season three is when i say frack off Battlestar....you had a AMAZING thing going.
We only watched a few of the episodes because though we like what Glenn Close has done in the past, we found this series very difficult to follow with the confusing flashbacks and the subject content was not to our taste.
Very depressing the entire time, yes it's suspenseful and has a great cast, but there wasn't a silver lining or even the smallest joke.
This show has too much blood and killing!  I don't like the fact that the show is always going back to the past which creates confusion at times.
I love Damien Lewis; he was awesome in Band of Brothers. But everything else I've seen him in since, has failed to win me over including this new show which I wanted to like. His character (who gets out of prison for a murder he didn't do after 12 years,)is a cop who is quirky and spouts zen phiolosophy to his gorgeous partner all day. Either you like the main characters 'quirky' personality and will get into the show; or you won't which is what I experienced.In addition the flash back storytelling style grew tiresome quickly; Robin Weigert as his Captain and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome's Wife (Jennifer Siebold)both good actors, play very unlikable characters. In fact only Adam Arkin as Damien's ex-con financial advisor, is 'normal' and enjoyable to watch here. A big disappointment as a summer replacement show; get "Burn Notice" instead--it's great!l
I felt that the new show &#34;Life&#34; was interesting. The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime. He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department. He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted. His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict. She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still, I found that the show was not compelling. I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little. Everyone loves a good mystery!Dani Reese's (the woman agent) emotional responses were confusing. On one hand, she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode, protecting him. She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others. She is a recovering addict. I would have disclosed Dani Reese's addiction history maybe a bit later. The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well, if he was going for the quirky Zen guy. But, the way he speaks (an attempt by the writers to make him interesting) is not that compelling. He has no censor and that's ok. But, the writer's attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews (the main character played by Lewis) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress, why they would recast her is beyond me.
If Katie Sackhoff had been hired to play Jamie Summers and if the writers had all been fired and replaced by people capable of actually writing good stories, intelligent characters and compelling stories this might have been a great show.  But she wasn't, they weren't and it most certainly was not.  I also sincerely wish Hollywood would stop casting pretty over talented or even suitable for the part.  Very disappointing.
All the parts were there for a truly fine series.  Good actors awesome budget...  well ok maybe not all the parts.  The story lines while interesting were executed poorly and the special effects just didn't do justice to the show.  What really stuck out to me as unacceptable were the fight scenes.  Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new "strength".  In the fight scenes she couldn't fight here way out of a wet paper bag.  One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise, no broken bones nothing.  When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing.  She can take a punch better than ALI ever could.They say the writers strike condemned this show to one season.  I really doubt that.  I would not purchase a second season.
With so much real quality television around, I suppose it's inevitable that some just don't quite make the grade.  And in an age when writing on television on TV is reaching such high standards, it's a shame that in the end it's the writing that lets this down.It's also worth remembering that if you plan to purchase this, it is only EIGHT episodes - yes, that includes the pilot.  So Jaime Sommers is in a car accident, gets her limbs, eye and ear replaced with superior bionic parts by a covert group who go around saving the world each week.  Hangers on include her younger sister who lives with her and knows nothing of her secret life, and later, a boyfriend.  And for character development, well, in 8 episodes, that's all we have time for, folks.  Think of it as Alias, with added bionics, minus any of the charisma.Acting is fine - Michelle Ryan hits the required notes of all American woman, and woman who you believe can throw a punch, but somehow never quite convinces of having the superior IQ of the character - again, mostly the writing and not her fault.  Miguel Ferrer is the boss, to add Hollywood clout.  Let's face it though, If Miguel Ferrer is who you turn to to add clout.. well. Need I say more.  One of the highlights is a story arc with Isaiah Washington who turns out to be the most believable character in the series, and a delicious cameo over several episodes with Katee Sackhoff, from Battlestar Galactica.  Since the producer of this series also brought that series to the screen, it is especially disappointing that it is on story and writing that this series stumbles.So we have a fairly hum drum series which relies completely on its high concept, and lacks pazazz.  All the same, it's worth remembering that 10 years ago this would have been a welcome addition to the TV schedule... it's not a bad series - it just has such strong competition these days, that why wade through sloppy scripting and lazy character exposition?
Where's the humor?  I get this is a popular show and several people told me they liked it but it totally fell flat for me.  I suffered through one episode and then tossed the DVD into a black hole.  HUMOR: D minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus; WHEN WATCHED: 02/08/2011.
If "House" had an actor of lesser talent than Hugh Laurie, it would have been off the air after season 2.  By season 3, the shows were becoming formulaic and themes were being recycled.  Unfortunately, the solution was not to fire the writers but to back-burner the primary actors.If the writers and producers had a bit more imagination and courage, they've got great characters and situations they could mine more deeply; instead, they chicken-out, content to skim the surface.Season 4 pushes the viewer's willing suspension of disbelief past the breaking point.  Chase, an intensivist, becomes a skilled surgeon and Cameron, an immunologist, becomes a senior ER attending?  Really?  And they still want to work at the same hospital as House?  Really?And then there's the ridiculous "reality TV" style interviews to replace House's team.  Sure, it fits with House's love of games, but really?And, finally, while House nearly lost his friends, job, and freedom for Vicodin in Season 3, his Vicodin addiction seems to have virtually disappeared in Season 4.  Really?Vote this season of House off the island.  It deserves NO IMMUNITY.
First off, I've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades, and they've all had some things in common, and they've all had some differences. Most of them steal from the original (Bram Stoker) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources (such as Anne Rice) because vampire canon, such as it is, was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice. I loved, loved, LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV show, not the movie) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show, as was its spin-off Angel.That said, I disagree with most reviewers who've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel. It is not. The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires, not the pantheon of assorted trolls, demons, and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated. Also, the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight, the short-lived (3 seasons) CBS "Crime Time After Prime Time" early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto. Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight, in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the "monster" he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development, plot devices, and historical flashbacks/backstory. Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman, with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger, death, or some other terrible outcome (the human being "turned" vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath); thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other's lives (plot device), and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same, er, species (living or undead) (also plot devices). And, like Nick Knight, Mick St. John prefers not to drink (eat) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood, Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood. Moonlight, in those respects, is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight. (After this point, there are SPOILERS, so you may want to stop reading now...)However, there are some clever differences: Forever Knight's big, bad sire vampire LaCroix, who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his "gift" of eternal life (and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship) has been replaced by Coraline. Coraline is Mick St. John's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who'd lived some 500 years, sired Mick (made him a vampire) on their wedding night (in 1952), and enmeshed him in an obsessive, addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually couldn't. He never wanted to be a vampire -- he didn't even know she was one when they married. She made him a vampire against his will, without asking him or getting his permission. Now, of course, he has "trust issues." She, from her perspective, gave him a "gift" of eternal life -- freedom from death (sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight!).Coraline crossed a fatal line, however, when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little "family" (sounds familiar, eh? rather like Lestat, Louis, and Claudia in Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire). Mick, by this time (1982), was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective (it is implied, though not directly stated, that he "does good" as a PI because he feels guilty about the "bad" he's done as a vampire). It was in this capacity that the girl's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes don't kill vampires, they just paralyze them. Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe. Mick, in his PI role in the first episode, finds the distraught mother's little girl, rescues her, stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her, and sets the place on fire before locking her in. The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family. Thus begins Mick's distant "relationship" with Beth Turner, who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire, a mostly online magazine that's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox's character Lucy edits on FX's show Dirt, except it's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism. Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight, "No Such Thing as Vampires," Beth, now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions (but news-whore tendencies), winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers. Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA (with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef, a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring, formerly on Veronica Mars).I didn't watch this episode on CBS. In fact, I didn't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS' web site of full video, Innertube. I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin's eye-candy good looks, I've always loved the vampire genre, and I dearly loved Jason Dohring's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars, so I knew I wanted to catch the show. But I wasn't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing. The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche-ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he's on it because he's got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin. She also isn't your typical stick-thin, anorexic-looking TV actress; the girl's got a little meat on her bones. So, unlike many of the women on TV, she actually occasionally looks like a "real" woman. Finally, (5) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode, however, was straight out of B-movie (or is that B-TV) hell. I thought, "Eh, that was was pretty; I'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better." I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back, too. But I wasn't expecting much from the show based on the first episode. I figured it would be my guilty pleasure, something I'd watch as "webisodes" and not much else.Surprisingly, it's getting really good. This has a lot to do with improved writing, developing backstory, intersecting relationship triangles, and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline. It's still eye candy, but I don't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV. I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox. I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this. But the most recent episodes (we're up to episode 9 now) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick, while also increasing the tension between Mick's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef (Jason Dohring) and the unhappy, secretly self-hating Mick, who longs for a cure for his vampirism, some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick "went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster" has only improved the show's "grab" factor. The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn, but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon. And there's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well. There are some very sexy (though still network-TV-permissible) scenes on later eps and I'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake: like Angel, Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them, as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight, and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires. It's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human, and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two (or three or four) evils, or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making. They're still vampire shows, and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not "serious" literature. But as Battlestar Galactica fans know, it's not the genre that defines the shows, it's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective, this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all, and neither is the second. But the show is coming along, it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode, "No Such Thing As Vampires," and the second Moonlight episode, as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following (more entertaining and less contrived) episodes.
While the first two seasons were very successful, the third season is awful. THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut. The problem is that the show was really very good. Until, at first Earls goes to prison, during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse, a lot worse. Also, while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really.
The reboot of Battlestar Galactica was ultimately a failure.  It is most unfortunate because the elements of greatness were there.  The overarching story was a good one and I was interesting in individual plot lines throughout.  The chief problem was characterization.More and more often as the series progressed, characters were written to do things both against their previous nature and against all common sense.  Both of the Adamas became simply laughable with over-acting the norm and erratic -- unbalanced? -- behavior expected.  I wouldn't trust Bill Adama to rearrange my silverware drawer, much less command a ship.  His always-to-excess drinking alone would have disqualified him from command, a trait shared by way too many of his crew.Mary McDonnell was the series best actor and I wanted to like Laura Roslin.  While a better leader than Bill Adama, she was also ultimately unworthy of my trust.  So, too, was I pulling for Kara Thrace and I really came to enjoy her portrayal by Katee Sackhoff.  Ultimately, I have no freaking idea who and what she was and could muster litter care.  And that was the problem in a nutshell with the series.I just ultimately didn't care whether or not they found earth or survived or lost to the Cylons.  The characters on balance were not very likable and were certainly unworthy of my admiration.  I said in another review of the series -- season 3? -- that the humans were so lacking in worthy quality that it might be better for humanity to be wiped away.  Ultimately, I think that the only character I really would have trusted was Athena and overall, I liked the Cylons more than the humans.  I realize that Ron Moore was trying to create a story where the lines were blurred as to which side should have been seen as the heroes and that is admirable.  It sadly just wasn't executed well.  When you simply stop caring about the characters and a need to finish what you started rather than a burning desire to know what happens in the story drives you forward episode-to-episode, you know a story has gone off the rails.I bet -- I even hope -- that the concept of Battlestar Galactic will be picked up again in a couple of decades.  There is a good story to be told.  It just wasn't this one.
Good title, great cast with a sick story to tell. After reading several of the reviews, decided to watch this and evaluateSPOILER ALERT- If young male rape and its consequences is what you seek - then this is your movie! Perhaps if I read more reviews I may have picked up on that. Shoulda passed on this one.
I gave this series two stars to be kind.  It has very little if any redeeming value to it.  Those that like to see borderline pornography may enjoy he series but I am not one of those people.  I am surprised that David Ducovny , who has played good roles would even consider this series.  Well if I say any more I would cease to be kind.Knight68
This weekend my wife and I tried watching First Season DVDs for 2 shows we missed out on when they first broadcast on TV -----  Californicaton and Mad Men.While Mad Men ended up being very impressive both in style and writing, Californication seemed to be nothing more than an attempt to get laughs and reactions thru shots of nudity, foul language and body function jokes.After 3 episodes it did not seem to get any better from our perspective, so we hit the EJECT button.
To much nudity and sex with a kid involved. Story lines are weak at best. You know he's going to lay the girl as soon as they meet no surprise there. The girls are pretty and built but a woman wouldn't really let her daughter be subjected to such a life. If you want T and A and lots of it watch the series. Other wise there are much better series to watch.
not good for your children to watch too much sex and bad words and bad plot it has no learning of any good habits
My mom who is 79 years old, loves this show and so does the rest of my family. It makes me depressed. I think the differene is, that my mom has always lived in the cozyness of the middle class so all this is new to her and frankly very far removed from reality as she knows it. I have on the other hand lived in poor neighborhoods most of my adult life. I have seen metheads, crackheads, tweakers, junkies, you name it and dealers on daily basis, the havoc it rages on whole communities. I have lived with this violence and seen it with a completely sober mind.When you live in a place like that, the saying goes "that these people are quite the characters, but have no character". When you live with this you develope a strange mixed feeling of empathy and disgust for people in the drug culture. Sometimes you just become num. I remember one time, walking on my way home an involuntary thought struck my mind as I passed some crackheads smoking, to my shame it was "human garbage". I was instantly horrified of how desensitized I had become toward my fellow human beings. The hard part is, that you get to know these people personally the longer you live among them so they are not just some strangers anymore. You run into them all the time. The dealers are not without a respect altogether, because when a new one comes around they say "No she's not like that, leave her alone".  Sometimes they laugh cuz the new guy mistook a  "strait" person for a customer. However you always have to let them know you are cool so it's a better choise to let them know you a little, that you don't judge them, so they will trust you and leave you alone. Neighborhoods like that are very dangerous and you don't want enemies.I know all the scum bags, the little guys that are trying to make a buck selling dope, the corrupt cops, or more like the cops who are so sick of it, they don't want to deal with it. Sometimes they can't do anything because the jails are full. Seriously.  The sadness and ramifications meth brings are horrific. The ignored children. I have seen it all and some of the people in the show are quite real to me. I know all of these characters. I know for example, its supposed to be funny that they are cooking meth in the basement while the realtor is showing the house, but to me it's not funny at all because it's too linked to what I have seen in reality and its anything but funny. I think the 1st season was more than enough addition to my reality. I highly doubt that I will watch any more of it. Sorry mom, you and my niece can keep talking about it, I am not interested.I guess if I was a straight laced and pampered in a way where I've never lived with this kind of reality I would find this funny and interesting. But I haven't and I don't.
I never got into this series. I wasn't sure if this was a parody or a drama so I gave up on it.
As promised, the acting, cinematography, and general production values are top notch.  But like the Sopranos, I find the content toxic and depressing.  There is already a pattern of a buildup of tension and a narrow escape.  This chemistry teacher is going to have to come up with more complicated strategies to pull off this double life.  But he seems to have a sociopathic disregard for the lives he's destroying even as his own body is wasting away.  I'm simply not up for 40 more hours of covert drug manufacturers.
In the not too distant future where George Bush has somehow fluked his way into another term as president, a chemo-virus has broken out in a small town. The Z-Squad is sent in to eliminate the problem, but a member of the squad gets infected and flees. He manages to to find refuge in an underground strip club, which has also been deemed illegal by the government of the future. The soldier takes a turn for the worse and finds himself a member of the undead only to take the club's biggest star as his first victim. She continues to dance and the odd thing is...the customers love it. Zombie strippers are the new sex appeal. As the money piles up, so do the victims. Will the chemo-virus continue to spread and if so...how will it be contained?First of all, don't be confused. This is movie is one of the cheesiest films ever. I almost turned it off several times and I honestly can't tell you why I'm reviewing this thing. The sad thing is it's like a trainwreck in slow motion. You can't look away from it once you start watching and you have to see not only how it's going to end, but who's going to make it out alive. Not that you really care, but you wonder whose really deemed worthy of surviving said trainwreck. It is ludicrous, ridiculous, and absurd...but it's amusing as hell.How ridiculous is it? Let's see...strippers being turned into zombies and becoming super strippers, zombies being sexy, having the most stereotypical Mexican janitor...ever, the casts biggest names being Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund, special effects you'd find in Xena: Warrior Princess, a Christian stripping for her nanna, Jenna Jameson shooting ping pong balls and pool balls out her...well...I'll let you see that for yourself, angry dragons, and foamy chewbaccas...the list goes on and on. I'm sure I missed so many more. The sad thing is that despite being the cheesiest of cheese and being as bad as it is, there's still a few good things buried under the cheese. It's kind of like an enchilada made with cheap cheese. All the cheap stuff is on the outside, but there's some good stuff on the inside. The most obvious being that there's a lot of nudity in this, which is good because it'll probably be one of the only things that'll keep anyone watching. Robert Englund's over the top performance as the germophobic strip club owner is pretty memorable. Also, the make-up effects are surprisingly good at times. The special effects are horrid, but the make-up is actually better than you think it'd be.In a film as ridiculously cheesy as this, I can't blame anyone if they turn it off before it reaches the half hour mark. The thing is though if you stick with it, it's actually enjoyable because it's so bad. It's cheesy, it's amusing, the acting is so bad that you'll be quoting it for days, the plot is pointless, and it even has a weak attempt at a twist in the ending! My point is that it's a bad film and I'm not defending it, but if you manage to sit through the whole thing...you may find yourself enjoying parts of it like I did.Rating: 4/10(most people will probably rate it a 1/10...if that)
Zombie Strippers(released April/08)stars one of my fave actors,Robert Englund(forever Freddie Krueger in my heart),as the only real star amongst this  company of amateurs and up and comers.It has been my misfortune of late,if you have seen any of my recent reviews,to be watching movies lately with less than stellar value,shall we say.Add yet another one to that list.*sigh* What I thought would be a low budget indie film,with some real kick to it,turns out to just....a low budget indie film.The jokes and situations are totally lame,old and stereotypical.To give you an idea and a good example of the latter,a Mexican janitor is loading up his gun and with each bullet he carefully puts in the chamber he utters"Pancho Villa....Montezuma...Caesar Chavez...Cinco de Mayo...guacamole...".Yeah,funny,funny stuff,right? Mr.Englund does a fine job as the owner of the strip club,who is deathly afraid of catching "something" off of one of his girls and just loves his money.The strippers themselves I thought also did a pretty good job but the "comic relief",such as it is,comes in the form of the opening act,the hippest but dumbest and street wise bunch of Marines you have ever seen.None of them had the acting chops to pull off a send up like theirs,even if they had tried...oh yeah,they were trying.Sorry guys.The plot finds a laboratory become infested with zombies.The marines are called in to eradicate them.They do their job,but in the process one gets bitten and flees the building through a basement window(great security).That Marine in turn heads into a nearby strip club and infects one of the dancers.That dancer/stripper infects another dancer/stripper,and so on and so on.Before you know it the ones uninfected WANT to become infected,as the infected ones are getting all the attention from the male patrons.And oh yes,the strippers,after their dances,each take a patron into the back and proceed to eat them.The remains,either heads,bodies without heads,bodies with heads,etc.,usually re-animate and they lock them in jail-like cells in the basement.Doesn't every strip club you know have jail cells?Owner Englund at first is beside himself with what is happening,but before you can say "bite me",he sees dollar signs.The strippers are soon competing with one another and Englund is raking in the dough.Somewhere along the line,the Marine major/leader finds out about the zombies at the club(he overhears a convo while reading a newspaper outside!).Meanwhile one of the stripper zombies has gone down into the basement and voluntarily let the incarcerated ones bite and infect her.She also lets all of them out and they go a-wandering around the club.The Marines come to the rescue and exterminate the zombie menace.Poor Englund gets bitten and is to be taken back to the labs for testing.The Marines also find one of the lab personel in the club trying to pick a lock(?).He fesses that it was he who deliberately spread the zombie virus throughout the lab.He said there's alot of money to be had in "working for the man".The Marines leave going to do...whatever they usually do,and the lab man has two of his unbitten cohorts come in to clean up the strip club mess.For a low budget film,the special effects(heads being blown off,ripped apart,etc.)are on the whole not too shabby,as opposed to those in Alien Armegeddon,another indie cheapie.The demographic for a film like this would be male,18-25 yrs.,because there is ALOT of T&A; throughout the film,graphic at that(I think they called it nudity,once upon a time).It is this group that would probably love this film,for that alone.Males of ages before,shouldn't be viewing this at all and those after,will,for the most part,see the film for what it is....bad.The only other person to stand out to any extent was Carmit Levit&eacute; as the Russian Blavatski,who was directly in charge of the dancers.At first I thought her portrayal was a bit over the top,but as the movie progressed she seem to settle down and I actually didn't mind her performance at all.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes,deleted scenes & commentary.All in all,despite having star Robert Englund on board for this project,it is an amateurish and lame excuse for a film and it's satire,send ups and laughs fall flat.Mr.Englund does a good job,as do the strippers(for the most part)and their handler Levite',but it is not nearly enough to save this dud.Give it a wide pass.
Pay close attention to the film's title. It is "Zombie Strippers," not "Zombies vs. Strippers." Silly as it is, "Zombie Strippers" is the title of the film starring Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund because here strip dancers become zombies and they dance on stage before the crowd of cheering males in a strip club. I mean it. It is a one-joke movie, of which joke could have been turned into something much funnier than as it is, by someone like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, creator team of "Shaun of the Dead." I only wish that they have directed the film.Jenna Jameson plays Kat, a strip dancer. Robert Englund is a greedy owner of the club, who is more than happy to see the audiences excited over the un-dead dancers (whose dancing gets sexier as the film goes on) even though some of the "lucky" males haven't returned from the backstage.The situation is absurd, but I think it is exactly the point. Unfortunately we need someone who can turn absurdity into comedy here. "Zombie Strippers" suffers slack direction, especially its earlier part where Robert Englund does not appear. Clearly Robert Englund is having a good time, and watching him as the sleazy (and cowardly) owner is fun, but the film is only sporadically funny with too scanty supply of jokes or ideas."Zombie Strippers" is a comedy in which Robert Englund's club owner is named "Ian Essko" and his club "Rhino." I confess I didn't at first get the joke playing on the name of the playwright Ionesco and one of his plays, and I still don't know why it has to be named like that. I was impressed more with "ping-pong tricks." I want more of them.
There should have been some indication that the movie is in Spanish. ..very hard to follow. Hate subtitles. It's tough trying to read and watch a movie at the same time. Didn't like it at all.
Mindless show.  Truly wasting your time.  Not funny and nothing to learn from.  Don't let your kids watch this show.
I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and "Poltergeist" but this episode does not live up to his reputation.  The story is blurry, unoriginal and not scary at all. It is a tale that has been told many times before.  An angry demon of the earth, this time oil under the earth, enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother.  Now years later it's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in. The story has no real clarity, and there is a no suspense or thrills just mass confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer.  It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute.  If you want some originality and horror watch Hooper's Season 1 contribution called "Dance of the Dead" and save yourself some time and money here.
Half an hour into the series I was bored out of my mind. The premise of the show revolves around 2 U.S. Marshalls that work for the Witness Protection Program. The dialogue is forced, the voiceover is annoying, the domestic squabbles are comedic at best. Marshall Mann has zero personality. Bobby D (Todd Williams) is probably the best and only good thing in this show.
honestly the costume is really cook looking for the time period this was made in.The flash is one of my favorite super hero's ever since my nickname was Flash when I did track, so learning a little bit about him was cool but I really couldn't sit for so long through these episodes like 40-60mins each?the only way to watch this and stay sane is to skip threw a lot of parts, there is just too much story, if they re-made this into a tv series now a days and made it like the arrow, I would prolly love it if they made it, if they re-make this now a days I would love to watch it even at 2 hours an episode lolafter seeing how awesome arrow was, I never knew arrow before but once I started watching the tv show wow he is actually awesome, the story behind how he got accuracy and everything is awesome and he's not one of my favorite, im even thinking about buying some green arrow comic books just to see more about how cool he is now. Flash I already got a lot of comics of him lol. but really looking forward to seeing a re-make of this in years to come
Season 4 was almost as bad as Season 1 was good.  I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with, but I will suffice with a complaint list.1. The plethora of plot twists.  Even M. Night Shayamalan would've said enough's enough.2. Bringing people back to life.  I know that they were never confirmed dead, but they were dead enough.  I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.3. The various coalitions.  How many bad guys can you work with just because "you need them."4. The sloppiness of The Company.  Whereas the General wouldn't even say a word in season 2, by season 4 he was a chatty kathy.  He was equally careless with who he killed and how.5. The slipperiness of T-Bag.  T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing: if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag.  He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.6. The Scofield boyscout act.  In season 1 and 2 Scofield's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality.  It made you realize that he was no real criminal, he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother.  By season 4 I was sick of the "I won't kill" act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger.  Ultimately, that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people (i.e. the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull).  The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger... surprise the gun wasn't loaded.  Heck, Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.7. The resilient bodies.  I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast.  I don't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking, but as in their abilities to heal so quickly.  Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes to suspended belief: manhole covers that weigh five pounds, concrete that easily crumbles, abilities to run long distances at top speed, etc.  But, I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified.  From the beatings, stabbings, shootings and other abuse Scofield, Burrows, T-Bag, Bellick and Sucre took, they should still be hospitalized.  Scofield didn't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed.  Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.8. My indifference.  In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat.  I was holding my breath with every close call.  I was exhaling with every escape.  I was enthralled by Scofield's detailed planning.  I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair.  All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4.  I was no longer at the edge of my seat, I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph.  And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4.  Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.The show lost its umph and lost its luster.  There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality.  It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing.  As the writing got sloppier, so did Scofield and The Company.  It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did.  Even the ending was anti-climactic.  The show would have been better off ending at episode 12.  But, being honest about the entire show: how sustainable can a show called "Prison Break" be?
The third season of "Heroes" was a complete mess.  The season started off in a fairly strong manner, with the heroes targeted by the government and having to work together to escape.  However, this compelling idea was abandoned after a few episodes, with the heroes once again scattering all over the globe with separate (and uninspiring) plotlines.  What the producers and writers consistently fail to understand is that the fans of the show enjoy seeing the heroes work together, and not in the same predictable pairings (Ando & Hiro, Peter & Nathan, etc.).  By the end of the season, I really had no idea what the main plotline was and why I should care about any of it."Heroes" started as a fresh, clever series filled with interesting characters, and the producers showed a willingness to add new characters to help prevent things from getting stale.  Unfortunately, the producers and writers really lost the thread by the third season, stubbornly sticking with the same cast of heroes, long past their expiration date.  Particularly frustrating was their stubborn insistence on focusing on Sylar as the main villian; I enjoyed Sylar during the first two seasons but having a nearly unbeatable foe makes the rest of the cast look weak.  Instead of introducing new heroes, each week brought new alliances between the heroes that quickly dissolved before they really could be explored.  One week Noah and Sylar are working together, then they're enemies; the next week Nathan and Peter have reunited, then they're enemies; shampoo, rinse, and repeat.  Keeping up with these shifting alliances was dizzying and tiresome.  Likewise, all pretences of continuity have been abandoned in favor of ending each episode with a "shocking" conclusion.I'll watch at least the first few episodes of Season 4 of "Heroes," as I feel a certain obligation given the time I've already invested in the series.  Also, I do still care a bit about a few of the characters, despite being jerked around by the inconsistent writing of the series.  However, I find that I can no longer recommend the series as a whole to new watchers, which is something I did prior to this season.
The life has really gone out of this show by the second season.  Typical cop drama by the second season, even the Zen angle for the main character is gone.
The stories are all still great, but they added a love interest for the partner and he killed any and all momentum the show had.  He had to have known someone to get the part because he didn't fit in in anyway with the flow of the show or the rest of the cast.
This could have been a great show. But its not. What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small-town America. They get to be "bad" guys, but bad guys within real strict limits. Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs. To undermine the premise even further they create real "bad guys" in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the "good" Bikers can't do.The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos. We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money. Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something. He just comes across as a total wuss.Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang. But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire. The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works. Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they bitch at each other.Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey. When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble. But in Sons of Anarchy, Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk, it always pays off.One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters. There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.I really wanted to like this. And there were some things that I did really like. But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy.
the plot is implausible, the characters unlikable, and the acting terrible. I've tried to watch this show, but it ain't no Breaking Bad nor is it the Sopranos. I think the viewer is supposed to be rooting for the SOA, but actually I just want all of them to go to jail for a very long time and take Gemma, the doctor, and all the other girlfriends and wives with them. Every episode repeats itself. The SOA do something wrong, the police suspect they are involved, it looks they are going to get caught, but then the police do something stupid and the SOA do something clever, and in the end they get away with whatever heinous criminal act they've committed. It is the same for the next episode and the next and the next. Oh and often there is a shoot out between the SOA and another biker group, but every time no one from the SOA gets away unscathed and someone from the other group gets killed. Wow! The police and the FBI/ATF are so incompetent or corrupt that it sometimes feels like I'm watching a comedy. I've made it over halfway through the first season and really questioning whether I should continue. Does this show actually get better? Why all the rave reviews?
soap opera... like anyone needs that?  I didnt care for soaps when my sister was glued to them and I had to watch. I dont care what you put the people in, a leather jacket and motorcycles even cant make that cool. Katy is always awesome though so she save me from giving it a one star!
Not having any prior knowledge of Watchmen I thought this would be fun to watch.  The "motion comic" concept is cool and i liked it all the way up to the part where the women speak.  Apparently they only have one narrator.  Multiple narrators would make this much better.
I love good caper shows, but the casting is almost a total disaster. Timothy Hutton, the black guy and the blond girl are not terribly engaging, likeable or compelling. The black guy, in particular, is utterly unconvincing as the stereotypical black computer superwhiz, and utterly annoying and bland otherwise, sleepwalking through the series. Timothy Hutton has a grandma vibe. But the tough guy is a good pick.I realize dissenting reviews of TV series are the kiss of death for a reviewer, but I have to be honest.
Actuallly didn't finish watching it. Was not engaging enough. Slow moving and the romantic appeal was not evident well into the movie.
Buy the first 4 seasons, rent the 5th season.  Not very good -- terrible scripts.
I like Tim Roth as an actor but in this series his character is not as engaging as it should be for someone of his talents. There is nothing to connect on the human level - no warmth or even cold humor.
I've seen a lot of the documentary footage before in other works.  That part plus the fabulous interviews I loved.  But it was impossible to watch because the camera technique is to jerk the camera around so much that it's hard on the eyes.
Stopped 15 minutes into the movie.  This movie wasn't so bad as it was irratating. The quips from the Satellite of Love crew didn't make up for it.  There is a vast differance between a bad movie and a bad movie that is worthy of the MST treatment.
Mystery Science Theater 3000 is always great for a laugh, but in this case the underlying film &#34;Laserblast&#34; is neither good, nor &#34;so bad it's worth a watch.&#34;
Not the worst movie, But it is very slow and boring. Lena Headey is a great actress, too bad the movie was boring and slow.  You figure out the movie way to early. OK video and audio.
First, Eliza Dushku is not, by any standards, a very good actress (although gorgeous). Her appearances in the Buffy and Angel universe, playing a great character (Fatih), was always a little bit embarassing when she was confronted with the better actors around her (Sarah Michelle, Boreanaz, James Masters, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan).Then, the show itself. Whedon fans will think everything he does is marvellous. But simply it is not. In this first season, there are some episodes that border on unwatchable (my favorite "worst" is episode number 7, "Echoes". Its 49 minutes seemes like two hours). The concept of the show itself is strange: basically, all characters are despicable. Even Echo's handler is evil. Why? Because everyone in his right mine must be intrinsically evil to work in a comapny like the Dollhouse. Heck, the Dollhouse business makes even Wolfram & Hart seem like children playing...The genius guy, Topher, the handlers, Adelle (who coldly puts people in the Attic), everybody is obnoxious just for working for that kind of corporation. And that's exactly what FBI agent Paul Ballard, theoretically the strongest moral person of the show, believes but, tcham tcham tcham!! For the sake of shocking plot twist, and nothing more than that, he begins to work for the Dollhouse ath the end of the season...Also, we have all the usual Whedon trademark talking, trademark alternative rock songs at the end of each episode, trademark photography, etc.. After some time, this gets boring.How this show survived its first season is a miracle.
I was extremely disappointed by "The Great Buck Howard".The Great Buck Howard (John Malkovich) is a stage performer way past his prime.  A mentalist, he bounds up on stage and proceeds to astound his audience with mind reading, hypnotism and other mental games. The only problem is that he now plays broken down theaters in places like Bakersfield and Fresno and his audience, while still very enthusiastic, is aging and dwindling. In his heyday, he appeared on "The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" sixty three times, a fact he mentions repeatedly, and Carson was so taken by the performer that he called him The Great Buck Howard, a title he has determinedly kept ever since. Preparing for his big comeback, his business manager (Ricky Jay) sets up a meeting with a potential Tour Manager. Troy Gable (Colin Hanks, son of Tom) has just dropped out of Law School and moved to LA to become a writer. But reality quickly settles in and he realizes he needs a job to pay the bills, so he interviews to work with Buck. He gets the job and heads out with the performer, making sure Buck's every request is filled, that the venues have everything set up, stagehands are ready to go, and the like. The problem is that Buck still thinks he is a huge star and expects the venues to treat him as such. Buck is very bitter that Jay Leno has never had him on his new "The Tonight Show" and plans a big stunt, guaranteed to kick-start his comeback. He decides Cincinnati is the place and asks his management company to send a publicist. Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt, "Sunshine Cleaning", "The Devil Wears Prada") shows up and begins to set everything in place. But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly, "The Great Buck Howard" misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable. It lacks the right tone.John Malkovich is interesting as the fading star who feeds on his self-perceived fame and glory. Buck trots out on stage at every venue and shouts, "I love this town," and he really seems to mean it. He plays in aging theaters and is barely able to fill them with his aging audience. But they also seem to genuinely enjoy his show. Buck enjoys performing and seems to eke a living out of it and we can't fault him for this.But Buck Howard is not very funny. We have seen this type of character before. Many times. And many of these performances have been more insightful, more daring and more interesting.For "Buck Howard" to work, we need to realize the character knows his career is fading. He doesn't seem to. He enjoys the shows so much, you get the feeling he could perform for one person and he would be having fun. In fact, much of the time, he seems to be trying to make Troy's life more difficult simply to have something to do and maintain his 'great' status.But Malkovich never portrays Howard as being self-aware. If Buck never has any doubt about his ability or standing, are we supposed to either laugh at or with, or feel empathy towards him? He isn't desperate enough and enjoys what he does, even on a smaller scale, too much.Colin Hanks is OK, but he spends most of the time standing to one side, observing everything.Its difficult to tell what Troy is thinking or feeling because Hanks rarely changes his expression. The only clues we seem to get come from his narration. And his narration never seems to stop, rambling on and on. Film is a visual medium, a visual art form, so hearing consistent narration throughout a movie is the equivalent of trying to read a book and having someone consistently shove a DVD player in your face to watch video of what you are reading. Narration is useful and necessary in some instances. It isn't necessary to provide an ongoing commentary about what characters are feeling on screen, when we can't tell this visually. At least it shouldn't be necessary.I can recall two recent examples of narration in film, both bad. In "Vicky Cristina Barcelona", Woody Allen uses an omniscient (and ever present) narrator to tell us the feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes of the characters we are watching on screen. It quickly grates on the viewer's nerves. Worse, the narrator isn't even a character in the story. It's like he is reading us a story as we are trying to watch the same fable unfold before our eyes. The narration in "Buck Howard" seems designed for a different purpose. In many low budget, independent films, a narrator provides a useful tool. They tell us about things, bridging the gap in the stories, saving the filmmakers some money and allowing the story to proceed. I generally overlook this, because it isn't quite so obtrusive into the experience and it often helps enhance the film. In "Buck Howard", I get the sense the narration is designed for the same reasons, to help show things they couldn't afford to film, but Hank's descriptions go beyond this. They start to describe what he and other characters are feeling, thinking, want to do and accomplish. Why aren't we seeing this in the characters themselves? Why do we have to be told this?Hanks is not a very magnetic force in the film. He stands to the side a lot, observing, watching, rarely speaking. When he does, he always seems kind of flat, as though he can't muster up the energy to feel any real emotions. I can't help but think how much different his father's career would have been had he done similar work in the beginning of his career.When Emily Blunt's Valeria shows up, Troy becomes a little more energetic as they begin a romantic relationship. Troy actually smiles a few times and seems to enjoy the companionship.Emily Blunt provides a little bit of fresh air. Valerie arrives in town to help Buck navigate the press corps for his big presentation. From New York, it quickly becomes clear Valerie comes from a different world. She moves faster, registers faster, reacts faster than the people in Cincinnati and seems like a little tornado whirling through the town. As soon as she meets Troy, she begins to flirt with him (she must see something we don't) and he picks up on it, relishing the new relationship. At one point, Valerie can't help but laugh at one of Buck's statements, providing a little ray of sunshine among the group of people who are taking his every word so seriously.Steve Zahn and Debra Monk pop up as a brother and sister designated to be Buck's official hosts in Cincinnati. It is an amusing idea, but the roles don't really go anywhere and they end up simply disappearing.And there is an amusing ongoing joke about a feud between Buck and George Takei (Mr. Sulu on "Star Trek). But even this leads to what should have been a memorable moment and this moment just falls flat. It almost seems like everyone is playing the scene straight.I suspect "The Great Buck Howard" will enjoy a lifetime in obscurity, much like the fictional subject of this forgettable comedy.
You'll hear the phrase "Total Package" so many times that you'll become immune to it.  The fact that it's being used in relation to a child doesn't seem to bother either the parents or the pageant coordinators.From the get go, it's obvious to everyone but the parents that the pageants are a scam.  Everyone "wins" or "places."  The crowning system is some bizarre set of rules where no one really goes home a loser but where the "Queen" of each "division" is also not a winner.  There's a set of "supreme" crowns and a grouping of "Ultimate" crowns which is the "winner" of the entire pageant.  Oh, whatever. It sounds like a set of prizes a couple of five year olds made up.You can't really compete in a full "Glitz" pageant unless you have a "cupcake" dress,  the proper hair pieces, full make up, a fake spray on tan,  glamour and retouched photos and other accouterments but your total prize will more than likely be only $1000.  Never mind that the cost of preparing for a pageant will more than likely run you more than $5000 and lots of prep time.The pageants reward and judge on beauty as it's the only area that cannot be dropped. Beauty is finite and transitory.  The parents are both turning their children into monsters and leaving their children with no usable skills once their children's beauty ages out. The most appalling thing here is hearing the parents justify the waste of time and excuse the emphasis on "beauty."Furthermore, the "modeling" routines these children are taught are both cartoonish and ghoulish.  It's a sick, incestuous training wherein coaches teach them the same ridiculous poses they used as children that in turn make the children look almost clownish on stage and no one stops it. The judges who I can only assume are idiots reward them for it.  I mean, who puts both their fists under their chin and shakes their head like an idiot and thinks it looks cute? Or worse, draws a heart around their face? No one and yet - every child does it.And then there's the age inappropriate clothing.  The less said here the better but these mothers really need to be hit upside the head with a large batch of common sense.And yet... you keep watching because just when you think you're going to stop watching, something worse comes along...
Surprisingly enough this show did not hold the attention of my two little ones. If a show is dull they move on within 5 minutes...and that's what they did. I however love this show!
Up until this episode I had not seen any of season 13 of South Park. To be honest I had kind of changed my perspective of South Park and apart from the odd chuckle, I was beginning to find the show less and less funny. I watched this episode with the hope that it would re-ignite my liking of the show and convince me to check out the full 12th season and what exists currently of season 13. Unfortunately, the episode titled "Pinewood Derby" simply didn't allow for that re-ignition of my liking and I'm sad to say I will not be jumping to the chance to watch the other season 13 episodes.The story focuses around what many South Park fans are constantly asking for; an episode that has Randy Marsh as the main protagonist. This episode focuses around Randy's passion for Stan to win the Pinewood Derby which they have yet to do in all the years it's run. In order to win, Randy steals a magnetic piece of the CERN super collider and conceals it in the car. They win the race and inadvertently discover warp speed which is picked up on by an alien criminal who holds earth hostage while Randy struggles to keep his secret while building a new car.I suppose a lot of what let this episode down was the absence of the other 3 boys. I have never really been a fan of the Randy Marsh character. He's good for a part in an episode, but it's been proven in the past that an episode focusing almost entirely on him simply doesn't work. The episode seems to fall flat in a number of ways. The humour didn't really get me and I only really laughed at the news report showing Randy stealing the part of the super collider, dressed as Princess Leia.
I love southern gothic (like Cormac McCarthy's "Suttree") but this film is missing it's only crucial ingredient...truth.  The symbolism is very clumsy and the adults hopelessly stereotyped.  Like Bjork's "Dancer In The Dark" it had me and then it lost me in an ocean of self-indulgent bitterness.
Not since MONSTER'S BALL have I seen a movie that made we want to conduct a nuclear strike on the Deep South and then hang myself.Since I've been to the south, I wonder if anyting coming out of Hollywood (or Sundance) can be trusted.  To filmmakers, the south isn't a region or a people or culture, but a genre that can only be pushed and mutated into exercises in human depravity and despair.  I'm sure there are people who live horrible lives...but that's everywhere.  And I really don't think another film about addictions, poor white trash, and rape is necessary.  Just me.The acting is good.  The film looks very professional.  The writing...well...life really sucks east of Aspen and Hollywood.
I haven't really watched it very much, just enough to make sure it was appropriate for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She likes it very much and has watched other episodes on her mom's account.
"The Mutant Chronicles" plays like a bad SyFy movie original film. In the 28th century the world is ruled by four corporate entities and nations no longer exist. When two warring factions face off and accidently destroy the seal that keeps The Machine a device that "creates" mutant soldiers that feel no pain and only live to attack and kill, these mutant soldiers start overrunning the Earth forcing people to flee the planet. Brother Samuel (Ron Perlman)recruits war veterans Major "Mitch" Hunter (Thomas Jane)along with a team of other veterans to delivery a explosive device to the heart of The Machine. The only problem is that Hunter and his team must find the key that activates the ancient bomb which is located somewhere within The Machine itself.A low budget for a movie wouldn't matter if it were inspired unfortunately "The Mutant Chronicles" written by Philip Eisner and directed by Simon Hunter, the script and direction are amateurish at best. While the cast is fairly solid it's pretty clear to me that John Malkovich took his brief role in the film for the money (as I suspect everyone did along with the idea of shooting almost an entire movie without real sets). It seems like everyone here had good intentions but they were undermined by a poorly written script, direction that focuses on the look and feel of the movie but not the performances or even assembling capable action sequences.Perhaps the element of camp and the stilted dialogue was intentional or this is meant to be a corny backstep to a 1950's style of filmmaking. If that's the case, you might enjoy it. I didn't.The image quality pretty good.I'd suggest renting before buying to see if this appeals to you.
I thought the plots were weak and the &#34;humor&#34; was not very funny.  The actors did a good job but it didn't seem that they had much to work with.
This is a very strange movie. It is an Independent film shot on a very small budget, the characters are ultra quirky marginals, and there's a sense of wonder if the two will actually get together or not, and what is really wrong with the 'woman', why can't she be in love? But then the whole thing has this strange porn thread that runs throughout the film. And the ending is just plain flat out painful with Tom Arnold as the creep out father of the century. Tom Arnold has now hit a home run in the creep category.The director, writer, and lead female is Marianna Palka. Jason Ritter (John Ritter's son) is the lead male actor. The film meanders back and forth between Marianna's apartment, the video store where Jason works, and Jason's car where he lives. In the opening montage, Marianna walks into the video store and goes sheepishly over to the erotica film section. She quickly chooses four movies. Jason tries to convince her that one choice was a bad one, and she should not take that movie. He leaves off renting her the fourth movie, she leaves with the three films. Jason then stalks her at her apartment building.The film is claustraphobic, the apartment is small, Jason over stays his welcome, the two end up just too close to eachother, the car where he sleeps is tiny. The only place that is somewhat open is the video store. Both of these characters have strange habits. She wears baggies over her hands to open the DVD's, she hates to have her hair washed, she collects trash in her apartment, and likes to act out forcing herself on Jason. Jason likes to tell people what movies to watch, he has a regular job but can't afford a place to live, he is creepy about peeking through windows and shower curtains, and following Marianna around.I had a very hard time believing these two characters. It was as if the director / screen writer was trying so hard to make them both seem strange, like outcasts, outsiders; but yet they were both somehow brilliant and deeply misunderstood. And then there was this annoying constant reference to pornography and Marianna's distaste for genitals, male and female. The fact that the two of them are attracted to eachother, well that was reasonable.Technically, there were some problems. The audio was absolutely awful, the music was way overboosted and the dialog was poorly recorded. This is a film that relys heavily on dialog to build the craziness of the two characters, sadly the dialog was frequently muddy. This was a simple shoot, very few locations or sets; the video store, the car, the apartment complex entrance, and the apartment. The director did not use framing to her advantage at all, Marianne changes fairly dramatically in this story; but yet she ends up in random frame positions. There were many jump cuts that were too abrupt. Moments where incredible detail and slow paced filming, butted up against a jump cut to a much later time. The film had a hard time developing a decent rhythm. One moment the camera is in the apartment, the next in Jason's car the next morning.The DVD includes a few trailers, oddly Confessions of a Porn Addict trailer is included. A gag reel that has the poorest sound recording I've ever heard. This is a not so funny 10 minute reel.At One hour and 25 minutes, the movie is a bit long. The ending beats a dead horse a bit too hard. The film is definately R rated and not at all for younger viewers. Oddly, there is virtually no nudity in the film. Everything that makes this film R is verbal.It just seemed to me that Marianna Palka tried to do too much with this film; write, direct, star in, and over play a not so bad love story. Just not a very well made film.
We ejected this movie after 30 minutes when we first tried to watch it.Then we saw the mostly favorable reviews here on  AMAZON.comSo we tried to watch it again.We lasted until about 60 minutes the second time trying to watch it and finally gave up.I think my wife's exact words were ... "OK, enough already. You have to put something else in to watch.  This is stupid and I don't care what happens to these losers".
113 people on Amazon rate this show a 5 star,.. people PLEASE !This show is so lame,.. I can't believe it is not on Prime.I am sorry I even paid for one season.Pathetic !
I found this series opener full of the usual American empty characters and gratuitous emotion. No substantive plot. Plus, it was constantly interrupted by the Amazon downloading. I did not finish it.
This is one of those shows that needs to grow on you. So far it hasn't found any arable land here. I'm being patient and maybe somebody will sprinkle me with fertilizer in the future.
This series is just alright. The acting is good and the characters are good but it is just alright. It isnt overly funny and it isn't real serious- it is sort of in the middle. I mildly enjoyed to pass the time but I wouldn't pay more than the membership to watch it .
I don't know quite what I was expecting,but this first episode was ok, but not particularly entertaining. It wasn't really bad, so maybe others will like it more than I did.
I love the high school kids, I love the music . . . so much I found my eyes misting up. Ya . . . and I want them to win the Glee Club competition sooooo much.I've fallen in love . . .Hey . . . I'm a vet, I love military history, The Alien Trilogy, The Terminator Trilogy and Battlestar Galactica. I want to see the wall pasted with the bad guys.Can this really be happening . . . :)Note: At this moment I am pretty disappointed. I cancelled my subscription to Glee . . . the pilot was definitely a 4 star in my book. But the following series went downhill, IMO. The music changed, the plot seemed to get muddled and uninteresting. But especially the music . . . totally different. Mostly an obscure collection of semi-modern lyrical. Just disappointing
I love the Terminator Series. And it is FUN to have a bit more of the story to think about and enjoy.  However, there is so little story, and so much video game action, that you really can never stop thinking that you are in a video game, and not "watching a movie with a story and a plot."  To be clear, this is NOT a video game. It is a fan-fiction type of story that was made with animation software that you would see in video gaming software. Everything caries that jerky animation quality common to older video games. Still, this is an actual story of several chapters and it is fun in the respect that you are engaged once again in the Terminator Saga.I would give it a C- for a grade for the story. :(  Slow, boring in places... and it is hard to do that with an action film.  The graphics are really not so good.  Machima is NOT ready for Movie making in my opinion.  The technology isn't there yet.  So, graphic images fall flat.Still, it is fun to see more of the classic Terminator series! (even if there was no real story, and less visual interest.JJ
Not real impressed with a cartoon that has an udder on a male bovine. Typical uninteresting and dull cartoon: snooze
I stopped watching Royal Pains; plots predictable, character development not forthcoming and sidekick brother too 'not bright' and smarmy.  It's a pretty and shiny series with not much meat.  Went back to watching "Law and Order" reruns and the new "Chicago Fire".  I like genuine characters--who risk their lives protecting people, who grapple with serious ethical and moral conflicts.  I like real heroes.
i just could not get into this movie. I wonder why it was  ever made. Do not bother watching it.
Looking for an edgy TV police show, found a very slick, poorly written and acted show.  Lots of potential, none of it realized.
Not a fun series to watch. Too much heavy drama. I guess there are no good people left in the world and these deeply undercover cops are the only blue line left.
I personally think there are better family and educational cartoon shows out there for young children. This isn't a program that is watched very often at our house.
I usually love Robin Williams, which is why we started watching it.  But it was so depressing that we turned it off about 15 minutes into the movie.  It may say hilarious, but the whole time we saw it, there was not one funny line.
I think this is the lowest rating I've ever given a Robin Williams movie. Sorry, but I really did not like much of anything about it except Robin.Lance Clayton (Robin Williams) is a writer who has never been published, and an English teacher at the same school his douchebag of a son attends. The pejorative is Lance's, and it is deserved. Kyle (Daryl Sabara) is a spoiled, foul-mouthed, scheming, brat who is obsessed with all sorts of sexual kinks, among them hanging himself while masturbating. I know there's a technical term for it, and I lost a friend to the thing. It's of course very dangerous, because one can accidentally kill himself.And that's exactly what Kyle did. His father walked in on him doing this almost-hanging thing once, and was shocked, and told him how dangerous it was. Kyle blew off his father's advice just like he blew off everything his father said. But one day he did indeed accidentally kill himself.So Lance arranged the body as if it was a real suicide instead of an accidental one, and wrote a suicide note for Kyle, so that no one would have to know how perverted the kid was. Then one of the students (or was it one of the teachers?) discovered the suicide note in the police records and published it. They had all hated Kyle, but now it turns out he was a gifted writer and a tortured kid. He had only one friend, who was as much afraid of him as everyone else, was not doing well in school, disgusted all the girls, and had a serious case of the hots for his father's girlfriend, the art teacher (Alexie Gilmore).Inspired, Lance wrote an entire journal for Kyle, full of teenage angst, which Claire (the art teacher) encouraged him to publish. They did, and passed it around the school, and made a sensation, and Lance was invited onto a TV show to talk about it, and . . .Oh, I'm giving too much away. It's listed as a comedy, and I suppose it is in a dark sort of way, but I didn't find it all that funny. Robin Williams does his best, but I don't think anyone could have given this film a focus that would hold up to the seriousness of the topics. Yes, troubled teens are a major problem, and everyone wants to try to keep them from committing suicide, but I'm not sure this is the way.
No, I didn't give this a low rating because I want to see Mork and Mindy.  No, not because it has auto-erotica.  No, not because I don't like dark humor.  I gave it a low score because...well...because it just wasn't &#34;hilarious&#34;, &#34;wonderful&#34;, or &#34;bold&#34;.  I gave it 2 stars because I'm feeling generous, but if I go on much longer I will change my mind.
The son of Williams in this film is so troubled and so rediculous he hates everyone and everything in life including himself. But the anti-homophobic [...] he uses in the first 30 minutes of the film is nearly 30 times. It seemed to me it was a film about hating everyone and a kid so far out of control there was no help... Williams must have needed the paycheck to pay for his heart surgery... this film is a bottomless pit of insult and a whacked out kid who mistreats everyone including his dad... and the dad seems to be caught up in his own selfish rediculous life.... is this the way Americans are?? Sure seems it. What a let down. What an insult for an actor to take a role than try to tell us how genuis it was for a homophobic film to be put out... would we say the same if the word [...] was used instead of the fag word...? As a gay male this is something the Catholics would love to see and bigots are sure to give a great review. For me an open minded free thinker... this is a waste of life and time. I gave it two stars for the acting BUT... (and butts come in all sizes) I doubt Amazon will post it.
I generally enjoy "north of the border" movies and am generally generous with my stars.  The antagonist has potential as an actor so keep going fella.  The movie started well and had a good story going for the most part.  For me, it all took a nose dive during that last third of the movie and never recovered.  It wasn't insulting so give it a rainy day watch and post your comments to calibrate mine one way or another...
While overall I found the series to be mostly entertaining there were a few characters who really grated me with their apparent lack of importance to the series story or their characters personalities in the show itself, mostly with the apparent uselessness of Claire and the conniving mother of the Petrelli brothers who you really wished the character Sylar would kill ruthlessly but which never happened. This season like with the third tried to give us a new foil to match the villain Sylar with dubious results but much better then the third season second villain who at the end was pathetically killed off easily,  the fourth season new villain could have been better written but all in all wasn't truly horrible.  If you have the seasons 1-3 I would actually say just stick with those as while you can add on the fourth overall the episodes were pretty bland and though you'll get some more heroes episodes to watch you'll still probably feel a little cheated regardless.
Just continues to go down hill.  I can see why the network did not renew.  A disappointing finish to a show with a great potential.
I ordered this before I realized it is a video comic. I am not a fan of video/digital comics and this is the reason for the low rating.  I did not finish watching it when I realized what it is.
Welcome to the ADD format.  The "episodes" are about three minutes long; two per download.  Just when the story is getting interesting the episode is over.  Not to mention if you want to get really sick of a theme song listen to it forty-eight times more or less in a row.  An interesting story butchered by the desire to squeeze every last penny out of it in this format.
Other reviewers who have called this series 'Melrose Space' have labeled it exactly as I would. I wanted to like the show; the actors and set production on the space ship are really attractive to look at but...its an empty shell when your all finished with the show. I like Ron Livinston from Band of Brothers and he's fine here as is his narration that accompanies each episode. But these astronauts spend most of their time on earth pursuing the opposite sex and acting like stupid college kids when they go to the 'astronaut bar' every night after work. I'm just an 'average' sci-fi fan so my view is when its good--like Battle Star Galactica, its good. And when its not--like Defying Gravity, its not. And one more thing, in sci-fi above all else, you have to get the "alien" whatever that is or looks like, you have to get it 'right', it has to scare you or blow your mind in some way. And in Defying Gravity when we finally get to the 'alien', the threat to the crew, its a 'dud', its about as 'scary' as a piece of almond rocca candy, only in this case the candy is the most powerful thing in the Universe--yawn. Get the first season of "SGU" (stargate universe)with Robert Carlyle--I did, and it was WAY better than Defying Gravity and probably why its second season is showing on TV now!
Trying to address mental illness is very tough in any context and I applaud the effort.  The shortcomings (in my opinion only) are that not all mental health patients should disregard medications that may make them less stressful on the caretakers. I understand the husband agreeing to the absence of medication but I am not sure I like the idea of the children (who were not asked their opinion before birth) having to find coping mechanisms for dealing with a parent who is so obviously ill; I speak from personal experience on the subject.  If the character wanted children than the price of using moderating medication until they are adults (and able to understand the consequences fully if the choice is offered at that time) should have been paid. It is very complex situation and hardly fair to try to cover it in a one hour tv show but at least it brings the conversation forward and, as I said I applaud the effort.  Thank you.
Season One of Lie to Me was promising. The premise was interesting, the plots engaging and Tim Roth is a wonderful actor. However, by Season Two, the flaws that are inherent in a show about someone who ALWAYS knows when people are lying started to wreak havoc. (Hey, why bother with a judicial system? Just have Lightman ask, "Did you do it?")The main problem with Lie to Me is that Cal Lightman is the only character who is interesting.  I mean, what do the rest of them actually DO? There are twenty or so people running around a fancy office suite that is called the "Lightman Group" but where's the group? They've got an intern, Eli Loker, whose job it is to look scruffy.  Although, later he gets promoted to "vice-president" after a year of being an UNPAID intern.  (I should only be so lucky.  And who's president anyway?  Who's on first?) Torres is obviously window dressing.  (She doesn't even have any training in psychology--let alone acting.) And Lightman's partner, Foster, is there to say "I feel your pain" and stumble around on 6-inch stilettos. (To be fair, all the women in the show wear 6-inch stilettos. And don't get me started on the collagenized lips.) And because Lightman is the only person with brains, the writers had to invent juvenile stuff for the other characters to do (i.e. almost kissing, nearly kissing, finally kissing) which didn't require any. Bo-ring.The other glaring problem is that by the second half of Season Two, it becomes manifestly clear that the writers have no idea what they are doing. First, Lightman has to pay off his ex-wife in order to keep her from taking their daughter to another state. (That NEVER happens in real life. With joint custody, neither parent can move the child out of state. Didn't these people watch Boston Legal?) Having paid off his wife, his business is about to collapse. (What is his business anyway? Why does he need all those people? And if all he has to do is stare at a person to figure out what they're thinking, why does he need all that equipment?) So, he gets involved with Clara, who has scads of money but is dumb as a post. (They eventually get rid of Clara because she really, really can't act. She just has these enormous LIPS, which they figured would distract the audience from the fact that there was NO PLOT.) Then, Lightman does something stupid with some Peruvians (who weren't from Peru, by the way. They were home-grown Latinos. You could tell by the accents, and the fact that the Sendero Luminoso has been defunct for about 30 years, give or take a decade.) Now Lightman's afraid of losing custody of his daughter (When did he get custody? I thought his ex had custody). So the FBI agent who hangs around the Lightman Group (doing what exactly?) breaks the law not just once, but several times, so Lightman can keep his daughter. (Although, frankly, I'd give her up.  She's an airhead, and that "deer caught in headlights" look wears thin after awhile. And why is she ALWAYS hanging around her father's office? Doesn't she go to school?) But the agent doesn't get fired, because by now the Lightman Group has broken so many laws it would be ridiculous to fire an FBI agent for impersonating an officer, withholding evidence, obstructing justice...you know, all those little things you'd normally go to jail for.With all the inconsistencies, logic errors and contrivances, the plots got increasingly incoherent, until NOBODY could follow what was going on. Not even the Harvard grad who came up with the idea for the show in the first place. Even if you think you know what the stories are about, you really don't, because nothing the characters do makes any sense...not in this world or the next. (Why get yourself admitted to a mental hospital to have a two-minute conversation with someone.  Why not just go and talk to her?) And when you haven't got a decent story, the obvious thing to do is to keep transmogrifying your main character (all you Buffy fans know what that word means). Now he's a psychologist, now he's a former criminal, now he's Rambo, now he's a gambling addict, now he's an overprotective father, now he's sleeping with that awful Clara with the LIPS god help me ... and then add enough bombs, terrorists, and psychokillers until, you hope, the audience will have completely lost sight of whatever it was the writers thought they were doing when they should have been WRITING.I have to stop, because the more I think about this show the worse it gets . . . and I really like Tim Roth. (sigh)
This used to be hilarious. Now it is simply obnoxious. The series is no longer funny at all. This is mainly due to Danny De Vito. This is a sad development for a series that was extremely funny.
We live in Philadelphia and also like Danny DeVito.  We don't watch network t.v. comedies.  SO I don't know if this is what is considered good, funny t.v. these days.  But this just seemed like going through the motions.  There were a few laughs.  But mostly it was just annoying to watch.
Wow... I can't believe I am saying this.. I am a big fan of this series... but the 3rd season.. BORING.Feel like I wasted my $20 and I am not sure I even want to finish the unwatched shows.Just my .02Yawn.
This is the second time I've started watching this.  I couldn't watch it, too much suffering and sadness.  Nothing that I would recommend.
Great cast - great acting, but ??????  Maybe after watching it another time it will make more sense and all the jumping around won't bug me as much the first time?
Movie lasts less than 2 hours.  Seemed like 3 hours.  Characters and script generally not believable.  This is directorial debut of a screenwriter.  Lack of directorial experience shows.  Excellent cast wasted.
Could not figure out what the story line was. Movie hopped around the lives of several different women and different time lines. I could not follow it and turned it and off after about 30 minutes.
Started out decent. Timothy Hutton really loses his acting ability in this one. He delivers lines like he just read them or someone is holding cue cards off screen. Obviously just made this one for the pay check. Many of the supporting actors seem to have no acting ability either. However, Miguel &Aacute;ngel Silvestre is very good. The dialog lets him down at times but have to give him a well done on his acting. Not familiar with his other movies but will definitely find more of his films.
We stopped watching after the protagonist, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, and his brother's spiky widow, with whom he had been edgily squabbling for a long time, and to whom he had whinged about feeling rejected, suddenly embraced each other passionately and lunged into bed.
I was looking for more of a sneak peak and not so much of an interview with the actors. Not what I wanted.
This is clearly a Thai film! You can tell Tony Jaa and crew got alot more money to make this film compared to the others but it leaves alot to be desired! In most martial arts flicks the fighting barely borders on believavble but this movie goes way past that line. Mainly at the end. It's like Rambo without the guns. Other than that the sequences are a bit jarring and the acting was kinda over the top in small doses. The costumes were fantastic though. I know it sounds like im ripping on this movie but im comparing it to Jaa's previous movie "The Protector"! Now that was amazing. This movie would definately appeal to younger viewers. Perhaps 12-18 years of age? I cant wait for the day when Hollywood gets together with Tony! That's gonna be good!...
This is about a father who is into substance abuse who seems to think it is ok to pass these traits to his kid. It shows how irresponsible the left coast is. We can say what a wonderful performance. Doesn't anyone look at the substance of the show. If you try to live by the golden rule these folks live by the it's all about me. If this is the real world.God help America.
This is the soap opera of sci fi.  One reviewer said it was Battlestar Gallactica mixed with Stargate: I think this was supposed to be Deep Space Nine.  The first episodes were somewhat interesting, yet full of pretty speculative assertions and at least one enormous assumption.  Yeah, the Air Force has put some kind of a puzzle into your video game and if you solve it, they just might kidnap you.  Pretty sure that isn't happening, so put the controller down and get out into the sunshine kiddo.  They also put all kinds of tired liberal clich&eacute;s into the writing.  The guy who beats his kid because of his Desert Storm experience?  Well, they don't know much about actual abuse stats, but that is sort of the way an out of touch Hollywood writer type sees the world.  And by the way, not all black soldiers are abusive, unless we're talking Hollywood.  The worst problem was bringing back O'Neill as some kind of serious bureaucratic jerk.  I wish I could just wash this out of my brain.
I really liked SG-1 and I liked Atlantis even more.  And after watching Atlantis for the second time I decided to go ahead and try to watch universe.  I agree it is somewhat like BG although honestly I loved that series.  This is almost work to watch.  It complicated and annoying and dark.  BG was dark too but it moved right along.  Atlantis was exciting and fun and almost campy.  I could watch it while I did other things and still enjoy it.  SGU demands my attention and when I waste time just watching it it's not fun at all.  I'll try to keep going but if they don't get off that ship soon I'll have to quit.  I'm up to episode "Life" and so far overall the series sucks.  Half way through the season, there is no one moment of joy so far.  I'm going to skip to the last episode of season one and then hope season 2 is better.
Didn't have the fun and quality characters of the original Stargate Series.  These characters were too self-involved, too much unnecessary sex, very little self-discipline.  Overall the characters were not people with whom I would choose to spend time.  the plots didn't resolve themselves satisfactorily.  Was disappointed.
Not worthy of the name stargate.  Mostly a soap about a bunch of petty egos.  very little to do with good  sci fi.....  Got better toward the end of second season but  I had to keep asking &#34;who writes this crap&#34;
I'm all for change, nothing wrong with changing the format up when it is for the better, but who ever thought this was for the better is crazy. It had a few ok moments at best, but all the will they won't they crap, angst and all that nonsense was just annoying as heck. Plus it was pretty much Battlestar Galactica 2.0, as much as they try to deny it, that is all it was.
YAWN! that pretty much sums it up. I watched it on DVD after reading the reviews and it was even slower than I expected. No real science because what they presented as science was hogwash. Boring plots, boring characters. The main storyline could have been a really interesting one but they messed that up completely. Not surprised it got cancelled this show is a failure.
Okay, "we're not supposed to be here"...  we get it.  Too bad the producers didn't take the advice of their own tag-line and reconsider ever creating this ridiculous show.  I wonder how many devout Stargate fans would have been willing to make a monetary contribution to MGM for an episodic solution to SGU. Specifically, if the Wraith were to ambush the Destiny and life-suck these miserable characters right out of the Stargate franchise. Please be aware, this is not Stargate; it's Stargate trying to be Battlestar Galactica trying to be Lost and ends up being just more mindless drama except that it's in outer-space.I'll give ya a couple of examples how this series differs from the other two.  In SG1 there was an underlying sub-plot through most of the series' 10 years, involving serious emotions between O'Neil and Carter which tragically, they were unable to ever satisfy due to military restrictions against fraternization.  SGU flippantly adds a scene in the first five minutes of the first episode with one of the principal characters shagging a fellow officer in a broom closet.  That's one thing about the two original series, having served in the military myself, they always tried to portray the airforce with dignity and as much realism as sci-fi can afford.  Another example is that SG1 and SG Atlantis never really discuss the matter of religion however neither did the writers feel the need to casually insult it and at one time Teal'c even questions his team whether they'd ever read the christian bible, which he had and apparently found to be rather profound.  SGU, on an early episode, cheerfully shows a catholic priest in the role of an abusive, chronic alcoholic.I wonder if the producers ever considered for one second that just maybe, Stargate fans liked a more positive and upbeat universe and for their characters to be compassionate and kind of heroic while not taking themselves too seriously.  Did they ever think that just maybe some people aren't interested in tuning in week after week to watch a group of angry jerks vying for power in a seemingly hopeless situation while being filmed by an apparently, paranoid camera crew.Gonna be completely honest here and say I only made it about halfway through season one because after watching this show for a few weeks I eventually gave up hoping it would all get better and just sank to the ground (kinda like Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes) and railed at MGM: "You maniacs! You blew it up!" etc.
Interesting concept that suffers from uneven dialogue writing and stupid plots.A certain mad scientist gets annoying with his tantrum throwing. Sci-Fi dumbed down right before your eyes.
It's one thing to speculate; it's another to make a ridiculous statement: &#34;Moses was the only person to ever see God.&#34; Wow - hubris, move over! a new low in standards of broadcasting. This entire series has been great to watch (the Romans was excellent, and Martin Luther was too) but I stopped dead in my tracks and hit the stop button on the intro to this one - reading the other reviews, there's a lot to be avoided in this episode - I have no idea what they were thinking when they wrote this, but just bad writing ruined it. &#34;One nation conquered over and over was the Israelites; no people in history were more likely to be forgotten.&#34; What? Plain crap. Bad history. Not true, and it doesn't end there, they go on and on, and do very little objective &#34;history.&#34; Don't dump the series, just skip this clunker!
Like I said don't bother watching this show at all because the acting is so bad. The only couple good episodes are the Beast of Monteray, Dover Demon, Vampires, and the giant centipede one. Overall still bad but those I think are the best ones.
I just watched the very beginning and decided that it wasn't something I would like, so I didn't finish it.
I enjoy watching shows with real evidence proof like forensic files. This show is created poorly with subject matter had to believe. Was deceived by the title.
While "Sanctuary" is a clever science-fiction show, it's never especially compelling.  Much of the time, I find myself falling asleep halfway through an episode.  (If, at that point, I happen to switch to some other time-shifted TV show on my DVR or a DVD, there usually isn't any nodding off, so it's not a question of fatigue.)  Every week, a wild not-entirely-half-baked storyline is thrown out, a lot of crazy business ensues and, by the end of the episode, the whole Sanctuary team is sipping tea in Helen Magnus' office.  While the show touches upon interesting topics such as giant abnormals living in the earth in some sort of collective Gaia-like symbiotic relationship, every week this sort of thing is being fired your way en masse.  Sanctuary blends steampunk, religion (Kali, for one), abnormal myth (vampires, werewolves, etc.), historical figures (James Watson, Jack the Ripper, Nikola Tesla, etc.), science and adventure together and then funnels the concoction down your throat.  It's all a little hard to swallow.  **1/2 out of *****.That being said, I was glad to see the loss of one regular character this season (hint: it's the worst actor on the show) and the introduction of a new one.  The whole Cabal storyline is wrapped up entirely too quickly.Despite my issues with the show, I also watched season 3, which introduces hollow earth into the mix and is an improvement over season 2.
Nice idea for this show -- a real comedian (instead of a vanilla entertainer) leading the audience through a clip show.  But the producers spend way too much time on Tosh and not enough on the real content.
Unfortunately, this show is going in the direction of most of the other fare on tv. It is shaping up to be the evil aliens (who really look awful instead of beautiful) against the good guys (FBI agent, priest, etc., as rebels).  The entire show this time advanced that premise rather than developing other aspects.  I wish the aliens weren't so unrelievedly beautiful on the surface and evil underneath too.  It doesn't leave much room for interesting stories other than good guys vs. bad guys.  The only thing I enjoyed this time was looking at the beautiful alien Anna and the neat way she could try on outfits virtually.  I doubt I will watch this next week.  I think I will stick with FlashForward and Fringe as my sci fi of choice this season.  Save your money.
I'm going to start off by saying that while I love and adore the original sets of V miniseries (V and V: THE FINAL BATTLE), I absolutely loathed the spin-off weekly series. Waaaaay too soap-opera for me.With the advent of smarter and deeper television over the last decade, I was first in line to give the new V series a chance, especially since it had featured so many actors that I had loved from other shows I loved (Elizabeth Mitchell from LOST, Morena Baccarin AND Alan Tudyk from FIREFLY and Laura Vandervoort from SMALLVILLE), and a modern sensibility brought to a great Sci-Fi concept is usually a good thing (see BATTLESTAR GALACTICA).But where the old V miniseries succeeds is every place that the new V weekly series falls short.First, there's character: After watching the first ten episodes, I found, and not for nostalgia's sake, that I cared more about the original miniseries' characters over the course of 3-4 hours than I ever did about any of the characters on this incarnation. There is just nothing there to connect with. Mitchell's FBI/mom character is the only one that has anything to work with and it's just not enough. Baccarin's Anna has none of the gleeful devilishness of the original series' Diana; Scott Wolf's Chad Decker is so much of a non-entity that I'm surprised that he's even credited.Second, the plot: It's pretty much the same as the original, but the V's seem to be bringing more with them. And certainly their weapons are more high-tech. And they've been here before, developing "sleeper cells" which is a change from the original. But in a Post-9/11 America, we sure are awful quick to accept the V's, which just doesn't hold water. And conversely, we're awful quick to determine that there has to be a Resistance against these evil V's... and this is all in the first episode.Third, the action: Where is it? There was never a moment of tension that was more than barely palpable in all the episodes I watched.In the final analysis, I stopped watching not because it doesn't match up to the original, but because it could be smarter and more tense, and it just isn't. I gave it chance after chance, but besides the few moments I thought worked, there were so many that didn't.I never thought that I'd be yearning for the days of Marc Singer, but the new V series does make you more than just nostalgic. It makes you wonder why, when there have been great Sci-Fi shows like LOST, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FIREFLY, that this is a show that has been successful. It's obvious that ABC is looking for its next LOST, but V is not it. Not by a long shot.
The story of V does not adapt well. The dialogue is at parts very boring. The teenage love interest is very, well dry and stereotypical of a teenage drama. The teenage drama often detracts from the main story line. It tries to create a 24 sense of urgency at times, but fails. I could explain more, but bottom line there are far better choices out there. Season two barely made it from being canceled. Do not expect a third season.
BOring.  Weak.  Poorly filmed.  Don't waste your time.  BOring.  Weak.  Poorly filmed.  Don't waste your time.  Don't waste your time.
This account of her life seems quite sanitized, almost like the Hollywood press releases of old; in the days when the studio painted their 'version' of a star.  There were certainly contradictory remarks made by different 'associates' of Crawford, you were never sure if they were friend or foe.  Certainly interesting stories about her early days in Hollywood, but not a lot about her personal life.  Only one of her children commented on Joan as a mother, and she was one of the twins adopted later than Christina and Christopher.  Did the abuse occur?  I think it did.  I've seen and read the accounts of Crawford 'insiders' who were witnesses to what went on behind closed doors.  So, all in all, I guess this isn't a terrible 'Bio', but I would like to have seen something a little more than a fluff piece, but one that really dug in.
I liked Jeff Dunham on his TV appearances but was disappointed in this show.  I guess he thinks he has to have some crude content to be funny.
I have always enjoyed Jeff Dunham on variety shows.  He has created some great characters and is very funny.  Unfortunately the concept just doesn't work.
This is a comedy that is too slapstick for my taste. It's old and it shows its age with juvenile humor that is past its prime. Shirley Temple is one of the students of the teacher, not a main character. Watch it if you want to see Shirley as a tiny waif, but you've been warned.
SPOILERS WARNING....J.J. Abrams has a huge slap coming from me. The reason is simple: I swore to my wife years ago that if I should ever discover an actual name behind the 'pioneering' camera shake, I'd slap him (or her). No one needs to see a film that looks like a frightened tourist's film of an erupting volcano while fleeing it.That is perhaps my biggest beef with this film. Abrams is shown in the mini-documentary actually shaking and/or slapping the camera as he is shooting key scenes. This, along with "the glare" (from stage lighting) is Abrams' big innovation. This camera quivering and vertigo-inducing swooping is why I have wanted to slap him for so long.As to this film, let us speak as we find: this is not even a remake, much less a homage. It is a highjacking. Though the actors are flawless and talented beyond description for their performances here, it is en evil waste. By starting the film with a history-shifting time traveler, Abrams has cheated everyone who sees this, everyone who retains the love of the original series.Having said that, it is a bloody brilliant move. The so-called Star Trek "franchise" was at an apparent end. The TV series "Enterprise" had failed miserably; no one seemed to be in control of the intellectual property of Star Trek itself; fans felt a sort of dying era taking place right here, right now. This film saves us from that fate...or does it?In the distant future, an elderly Spock gets embroiled with angry Romulans since he apparently is responsible for their home planet (Romulus) being destroyed. A surviving faction of Romulans--especially nasty leader Nero--go flying backward in time, and Spock is forced along behind them. They appear 25 years before James T. Kirk is born, and they wait.Kirk's father is captain of a starship. The nasty Nero destroys the ship...and James T. Kirk's father. Here is the bloody marvel and the disgrace: this event has offered us a parallel universe-reality, and from thence the film takes off, going boldly where I wished it hadn't. The elderly Spock is now on a mission to see that Nero is destroyed, which task can only fall to Kirk, of course. Meanwhile, the alternate reality trick goes stale rapidly. Vulcan, along with Spock's mother Amanda, is destroyed (and so is the screen time for Wynona Rider); Young Spock is entangled and enamored with Lt. Uhura; Chekov is a little faerie who is damned good at beaming people anywhere; Kirk himself is a rather gay-looking idiot and part-time drunkard; the rest of the clan is essentially ignored.Abrams and all involved are truly innovative and brilliant. But this film cannot pass without further comment. The ghosts of De Kelley and Jimmy Doohan will never rest now. Too many people still remember them with happiness and the pain at the loss of them. Yet here they are, along with the others, being mimicked or parodied or whatever one wishes to call it. I cannot fathom how Nimoy could agree to star in this, but he did. Who else could play "Spock Prime" as he is credited?My advice is that if you are a purist, don't see this. If you are a curious, adventurous and sacred-cow-kicking fan, see it. Don't miss it if you are a fan of lunk-head director J.J. If you like cinema for its own sake, see it by all means. I for one felt a bit robbed by it all. I cannot begin to imagine what Rodenberry might have thought of this desecration.
Not much to look at. A straight ad. Some pretty sights but not worth the time it took to watch
I was disappointed in that it is a travel advertisement dressed up like a movie. The movie is okay, but I would have not downloaded it had I known.
Too long to get going I did not watch it completely through to long to start up,  these are seals let me see some action
Meant to be a tribute to our troops,... I think.  That it does, but it jumps all over the place blink and you will lose the plot. Really,  there are better films out there don't waste your time on this one.
Seal Team VI is like all other war films supported by the Department Of Defense. The story line is pretentious as is the dialogue created for the characters. There is way too much chest pounding and too little action in Seal Team VI, which relies more on DOD supplied war footage than action scenes created by all involved in making this movie. I was really embarrassed for the producers, the director and the writers, who in their mind's eyes made a homage to the Seal Team program. This film is as bad as &#34;The Green Berets,&#34; starring John Wayne, which was  a homage to the Army's elite unit, the Green Berets. People with service backgrounds should stay away from being creative, and leave it to the professionals. The DOD influence just muddies the creative waters. Only Oliver Stone served up a film depicting his Vietnam experience that proved to be Oscar worthy in his 1986 film,&#34;Platoon.&#34; These other wanna be film makers fell on their face in their attempts and Jeremy Davis, in my opinion, is one of them.
Just did not work for me.  The action was weak, unbelievable.  Writing was not very strong.  Maybe the actors are very popular over seas and that's what carried the movie.  But I would not recommend it to anyone.
I was able to see this film in my home as part of a sneak peak preview this month. Luckily I was able to see the original first as if I had watched this disappointing sequel first, I may never have bothered to watch the vastly superior original. The film is bogged down with a tedious plot that only slows the action down. The stunts are still impressive, but it just doesn't deliver like the original film. Too bad! :-(
I heard about this from my son, he said he just laughs and laughs. I don't. I find the mom character the most amusing, especially when her son said he used to pretend she wasn't his mother, she said &#34;me too&#34;...much like the comedy Arrested Development (I believe she is the same actress). Other than that, I haven't so much as smiled.
How depressing. I'm tired of all these unsolved missing person cases with no resolution. I've seen too many of these sorts of mysteries and want a show about all the people that are found and how the detectives or whoever was involved went about it. The police should bring in a good psychic in some of these seemingly hopeless cases. They might be able to help. I feel terrible for the families and friends who suffer this terrible unsolved loss and it's just too upsetting to watch anymore. My heart goes out to them.
Not so good. A bunch of &#34;smarmy, look at me&#34; crooks and murderers that want to get a little bit more noteriety by bragging about their despicable deeds. Would not recommend.
I LOVE the Poirot moves and David Suchet is Poirot embodied. However, since there are many other reviews that give better information on the content of these movies, I am simply commenting on the quality of the video.For some reason, this specific episode is really grainy. I'm not exactly complaining because I'm streaming them at such a little cost through AmazonPrime's annual $79 fee which is a mere pittance. To use the language of Poirot  :DJust saying... I don't know why this one is not very good quality-wise, and I just watched the previous two in this season and no prob.  It almost looks like old fashioned film.
This series just tries to be witty by playing on tired old stereotypes. Dull, no insight, puerile. There are so many better things to watch these days.
This work goes into how a free woman could marry and stay with a husband who has life in prison.  To each their own.  I wish the two of them the best.  However, one thing didn't sit well with me.The wife wants to have a biological child with her husband.  If Florida doesn't allow conjugal visits, then why would they allow semen to travel across the prison walls?  I believe the Supreme Court said marriage is a fundamental right; however, the same is not absolute about procreation.  Let's face it: most children raised in a house with one income with a parent that will never be free will likely face lots of poverty.  Further, sexual violations and drugs are common in prisons.  What if the man-goo has a disease in it?  What if a woman like Octomom wants to keep having children with an incarcerated husband.  The money it would take to raise these kids would have to come from our state, aka our tax dollars.  Further, I think criminologists could argue that in the same way that the punishment of prison involves not having contact with the opposite sex; along those lines perhaps prisoners forfeit their ability to reproduce.  There are already far more than 1 million children with incarcerated parents alive; they face circumstances that are not easy.  Further, Mrs. Bailey proves that she has a big heart; a parentless child already alive could greatly benefit from having her as a parent, or foster parent.In short, this woman's wish is just NOT going to happen.  It would set a very dangerous and costly parent.  I identify as a political progressive.  I sympathize with the folk in prison.  But this reproducing is just not going to happen and prison wives need to just accept that.
boring.  I didn't even watch the whole set.  I relisted it, immediately. could not get into. the movie was so funny, not the tv show.
I don't really love Little Bear because it looks ok that was so very angry and I really hate this show
Honestly, I generally don't care for romances.  This was a little different from the usual more like &#34;Ghost&#34; was several years back, but more of a wispy ghost than a felt presence guiding events!  Somewhat disappointed by the nuances of the characters feeling their way through loss and unrequited relationships!  The music background was not to my liking, but then we all have different tastes!
The Eclipse (Conor McPherson, 2009)After I hit paydirt with Outcast, the wonderful Scots urban fantasy picked up for US distribution by Bloody Disgusting not long ago, I figured I'd see what else the British Isles had in store for me. Ireland has been a solid, if not necessarily prolific, producer of good horror films over the past fifteen years (viz. Isolation or Dead Meat). The Eclipse, which boasts a cast headed up by Ciaran Hinds (There Will Be Blood), Aidan Quinn (Benny and Joon), and Iben Hjejle (Defiance) as the woman they're both in love with, seemed like just the thing with which to pass a gloomy, snowy Friday night. Unfortunately, it fell quite flat.Hinds plays Michael Farr, a volunteer at a literary festival who is still reeling from the recent death of his beloved wife (Hannah Lynch in her only screen appearance to date). He is assigned as a driver for two visiting notables, paranormal researcher Lena Morrell (Hjelje) and horror novelist Nicholas Holden (Quinn). Holden, an American, is married, but the cat is away, and he's got his sights set on bedding Morrell. Michael, on the other hand, initially sees Morrell as a possible gateway to understanding why he sees&#8212;or believes he sees&#8212;the ghost of his wife, but he, too, begins to fall for her.Ultimately, I believe The Eclipse is an attempt at the supernatural-drama subgenre that the Southeast Asian film market has honed to a fine edge, and that most of the rest of the world doesn't really know exists. It is unsuccessful, though I have no way of knowing whether to blame the original story (by Billy Roche) or its adaptation (by McPherson); either is possible. Another rewrite might have made it a bit more coherent and turned a collection of interesting scenes into a full story, but that rewrite never happened, and we got what we got. You can feel free to give this one a miss. **
I give two stars here only for the soundtrack and for Ciaran Hinds.As for the rest, it really isn't a ghost story.  It's a narrative mess, muddled and confusing, with the focus taken off of the main character and given to two others whose story is not interesting.Too bad it was so pointless.  It could have been much better.
No one could fault the production values. But this movie is confusing as hell. Character decisions, conversations and plot points appear incoherently, without enough explanation or exposition or motivation. It's often hard to tell where things are happening, where people are, why they're there, who they're talking about ... All a disjointed mess. Jet Li does a good job playing a confusing character, though.
I expected like a small prequel or sequel from the original movie but, it was more of  documentary of the actors and their thoughts during the making.
I have now seen the first two dvd's of season three. It's not good. I gave the first two years five stars. It now gets two. Even the music is bad. The theme over the end credits has changed to a fluffy piece.I see the show has been canceled. No wonder.
I'll admit that I only watched a little of this but the violence was beyond my acceptable level so I quit.
Only watched one episode. it was too political for my taste. but i'll give another chance after I finish Game of Thrones.
First program in series was OK but not great. Evaluation will depend on whether we watch other programs in series
I really looked forward to seeing some of what looked like an epic historical series based on the Roman empire, but what I ended seeing was a lot of violence and sex, and that seems to be the major draw of the series.  Of course, a genuine Roman history buff might appreciate it more, and this series does have a certain epic quality about it.I could even cope with Romans speaking with British accents (what are British actors supposed to speak with?) if I had actually found a character or two to care about.  It seemed like everyone was callous and brutal, and maybe that's the way Rome was, but after sitting through the first episode of this first season, I found myself not wanting to watch any more.I'm sure Rome will go on without me, and my best advice is to find a way to "try before you buy" and plunk down a lot of money to find it's not what you expected.
I could not have been more of the thought that &#34;Well, there's an hour or so that I'll never get back...&#34;
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE WITH KEVIN FIRTH WAS OUTSTANDING.. TO MAKE A COMEDY OUT OF A.  SERIOUS DRAMA IN THIS CASE IS UNFORTUNATE. THE LEAD ACTRESS WAS NOT COMPREABLE TO THE ACTRESS IN THE SERIOUS. VERSION.. THE ACTOR PORTRAYING MR BEASLEY WAS EXCELLENT, AND MR BENNETT WAS EXCELLENT. . THE ACTOR PORTRAYING MR DARCY WAS GOOD,  I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE FILM..
Slightly annoying...the typical stuff you would expect from this kind of genre. I wish nickelodeon would put out more original shows.
Fresh water is polluted with drugs we're putting in it, some on purpose and some flushed down.  This movie explores that issue and lets you make the decisions as to how bad it's become.
This movie didn't strike a nerve with me. It seemed to drag. Others may enjoy it tremendously. Suggest you go ahead and watch at least part and make up your own mind.
MST 3000 is often hilarious.  This episode was slow and tedious with a smart and funny barb coming in at a pace of 1 every 15 minutes.  Dull and boring, I'm sorry to say.
I usually love these type of shows but this one is kinda of boring but it is good if you have nothing else to watch.
This flick reminded me of 1984 and THX 1138 mixed.  Same kind of story, but with animation, which was really good, but this one just didn't hold my interest and I fast forwarded through much of it.  Maybe it was just the wrong day for me to watch this video, but to me it was boring.
My son recommended this film but warned me in advance of content.  I should have stopped when I saw JACKASS was involved.  However, I continued.  To think one family terrorizing their own community, living solely on their terms with no consideration for others was glorified in anyway, kind of speaks to the state of our precious home - USA.  If you enjoy JACKASS, you'll like this too.
Neil Jordan's Ondine starring the always dependable Colin Farrell and the enchanting Polish actress.The 1st 3 quarter of the film was captivating with the suitable Irish background and mystery.It fell apart at the final quarter.  It became nothing but a routine eastern mafia smuggling alien to a foreigncountry plot which destroyed all the foregoing mystery and enchantment.A very disappointing recent effort from Neil Jordan.
I wanted to like this film, we don't always get what we want. The cinematography was just so poor, under lit to the point I couldn't see who was talking or what was happening. Dark bars and night scenes can be shot so that you can still see the action but that requires skill and knowledge that was not evident here. Then there is the audio, it sounds as though the microphones were wrapped in wool. Muffled dialogue in the dark gets real annoying in a very short while, especially when the local accent and colloquialisms are already a challenge to understand. I was beginning to wish for subtitles. So much for the technicalities. The direction was just as poor. the pace of this film went from a fast walk to an agonizing limp then fell to the ground and crawled..slowly, painfully. I really don't care to see another scene in another film where our hero  character announces "I'm an alcoholic" at an AA meeting then goes out and sucks down a fifth of booze  straight from the bottle in between lines of anger and self pity! Can you say cliche! The comic relief was..oh that's right there was none. I hate to pick on child actors so I am glad to say there isn't one in this film. The young girl in this film sounded like she was reading and pretending. The woman playing Ondine, Alicja Bachleda, was sublime throughout. She was a living breathing complex creature on many levels. Colin was flat, a character without energy or dimension. I finally decided my evening would be more pleasantly spent trying to breath through a wet towel. Two stars, one for Alicja and one for what might have been.
I'm sorry, but I found this movie to be incredibly boring. Some friends forced me to watch it. Colin Farrell stars as an Irish fisherman named Syracuse who finds a woman named Ondine in his fishing net. He and his daughter, Annie believe she is a mermaid. I wouldn't recommend ONDINE!!!
Reason that I don't like it: the character visuals--there's a robot and a cat, ok. No clue what the other three things are, but the orange one is WAY too much of a "one-eyed worm" and screams of inappropriate visual for a child. That said, the songs are fun, simple and repetitious, so my 9-month-old daughter breaks into a smile as soon as she hears them. I played some of the season selection for her one day...because she liked the songs from their "cameo" appearances in other shows on Nick Jr. I've since found some other shows with songs that make her smile and laugh that don't have a phallic appearance--such as Go, Diego, Go! and Bubble Guppies.  Edited several months later: I still don't really like Muno's appearance, but I developed the notion that DJ Lance is similar to Ronald McDonald (I met a DC region Ronald...very nice, keeps things friendly and non-threatening and upbeat for little ones), and his odd "posse" is akin to Ronald's (Hamburglar, Grimace, Mayor McCheese and Fry Guys roughly = Brobee, Muno, Foofa, Bot), but they aren't promoting eating at a franchise. I still pick other options for my now  toddling child when I see them available, but the messages episodes portray are acceptable. Anyway, that's my "looking back" update.
not a fan. daughter didnt sit still long enought to really get a grib on what this is all about
Boring, bad production values, depressing story. I  couldn't stand to watch these young women's lives being snatched away from them. Way too much blood and guts for me. Just awful.
This sounded like a great series...but the use of gore and blood in every scene was bordering on the pornographic. It seemed as though the close-up scenes of blood and guts were used to make up for a cliche,lack-luster plot. A waste of my Amazon Instant $$$.
London Hospital Season 1 [HD] -After watching Selfridges and Call the Midwives, I had high expectations for this series, but after 2 episodes I couldn't become attached to it. To be fair, I should give it another chance, but I'll give it some time between so I can start over with a fresh view. Take a look for yourself. I'd be interested to know what you think. You might change my mind.
This review has little to do with this mediocre, typical British film.  I rate the video at two stars, max...I lived there for two years, and this is de'javou. (SP?).  This review is about amazon prime streaming video.  I rate that 5 stars.....Anyone having issues with streaming video should look first to their internet connection/provider.  Then, look at your computer system.  I was having difficulty getting a good stream from anyone, (Hulu,WB, and Amazon) and I blamed them all for not providing the stream.  Not true, the stream was there, uninterrupted and in HD.  My provider insisted I was getting 1.5 meg,  I was not, the max I ever got was 664 Kb.  The liar was my internet provider, I should sue them for lying.I bitched about it for 6 mos, and low and behold, a few days ago I started receiving a 2.5 Meg uninterrupted stream.  You can't imagine the difference that made.But that's just part of the story,  I also installed an Nvidia video card, 1GIG, designed for streaming, whoaaa night and day, especially sound quality.  So if you are into streaming, hope this is helpful information.Only negative with Amazon, is they don't encode CC....  That would be a real plus, if they did......
The ideal of it is dumb in my opinion. One of those ideals that works for a game but not a series. Sorry, I watched two shows and I just couldn't get into it.
I'm willing to give this more of a chance, but I don't want to waste too much more time on it.  A boring pilot is all I can claim to have seen thus far, with a simply horrible, irritating sound track.  I hope it picks up.
Really wanted to like this show; love the 4 gals they brought together; Wendy Malik & Jeane Leves in particular from Frazier, and the amazing Betty White you figure it can't miss right? Well, you can. Its the typical scenerio, bring comedy  'All Stars' together and it SHOULD be awesome/hilarious, and it just isn't. Frazier, Just Shoot Me, and Wings were all 8--10 comedy shows in my book, but this new show rated at best, a '2' for me. So bummed! But just like when Kelsey Grammer went from Frazier to his next show "Back to You" (which I thought was hilarious but was a "1 and done" season follow up) it takes more than 'Stars' to make a great show. I bought this brand new and wish I hadn't--cause in a short time it will be for sale used on Amazon for less than half price cause its not very funny--that's my take.
OK. I watched all 4 seasons that are available. This sums them all up for me.This show is about 3 LA women who find themselves in Cleveland, OH, and stay to start a new life. Well . . . that is what we are led to believe. But as the Betty White character states in one of the later seasons the 3 LA women actually are in Cleveland to get "laid" because there is too much competition in LA. The first season was fresh, original, and funny. There was the down to earth do gooder character. There were the supportive friend scenes as we learn of each characters' past. There were the funny outrageous comments from the vain shallow character. And there were the laugh out loud tell em like it is comments from Betty White's character. I mean she calls them out for dressing like "prostitutes" etc. You see all the actress's former co-workers from other sitcoms appear in each episode which is fun.Then you get to the second season and beyond. These seasons plowed up the foundation laid in the first season. I guess they ran out of steam. Or maybe they wanted to sell out and just stay on the air by appealing to the trashy audience that definitely exists and eats up the garbage this show became. The second, third an dfourth seasons were nothing but people jumping in and out of bed with each other, sexual innuendo about everything, people lying and cheating and stealing, and Betty White's character transforming into some sick person's sick joke of a vision of what an elderly funny character would be. The show could have been set in LA for anyone knew at this point as it was just trashy Californians behaving trashy. The weird thing was there was even an episode to mimic Sex in the City. It was definitely Sex In the City--3 women casually sleeping around and then in the end of the episode whining and commiserating about how they have no sanity tho their lives and wonder why. also the 3 main characters just looked old, fat, and tired in the later seasons. One's hair got so light she was almost blond. The others got so dark that they didn't look like themselves. Valerie Bertinelli looks horrible in season 4. She looks like she is having a really bad pregnancy. Even her hair looks bad . . . . But we are supposed to think that all these young fit youngs want to bed her and stay by her side the next day. Not. They sit Betty Whit eon the sofa with her jacket or shirt riding up in the back like she has been propped up for the scene.The later seasons, to me, appeared to be gay centric in humor. Humor that I have heard from hardcore gays and you see in their tv shows and movies. And while watching the credits I saw who was actually directing it and knew immediately where this influence was coming from. I mean even 3 trashy straight women wouldn't go the direction this influence took them.There are these typical "behind the scenes" episodes that appear in each season. They are basically the same and make you think they just want to have a fun-day at work or something. But then again the people who are behind the scenes force their chance to appear in front of the camera. That is VERY obvious. And there are the sickening "we love each other" and "we respect each other" stock speeches. They are just goofy.Anyway the show is typical American garbage TV that can be skipped. Just a show about animalistic behavior created by trained monkeys.
We seem to have mostly got past humor that belittles people of color, women, or gay people.  But I guess it's okay to make fun of older people, and to do so by belittling them. 'What's your favorite medication?' says one older person to another.  'Better call him soon, since otherwise he's likely to be dead.'  Etc.Ha ha.  Not.
Doesn't have all the typical inconsistencies and mediocre dialog as most TV, but this is starting out as a very slow series.  I fear an overly complicated puzzle conspiracy that will only be partially resolved by the end.  That's a big time investment for me.
First one or two episodes were sort of interesting, but then, the sillies set in. If paranoia is your thing, then you will love this. The usual liberal plot of big bad greedy guys who control world events to make themselves richer. Of course the biggest bad guy is X CIA, who else? The &#34;good guy&#34;, also X CIA, is gay (is that saying something about the writers?). The amount of surveillance portrayed would require an army of people to monitor and maintain all the bugs. Any intelligence agency would love to have the super small devices shown, that somehow seem to function without any visible power source.  All in all, very stupid. Hope I don't get a four leaf clover in the mail over this.
Great story idea.  Great ensemble of actors.  Terrible script, editing, WAY of telling the story.  Puts one to sleep, no identification with the characters, no backstory to justify hanging in to watch during the long mimic-BBC pauses with the meaningful looks.  Yawn.A Gary Oldman or Alec Guinness or Ian X (really, any of the 'Ian' actors we all know and love), can hold the viewer's interest, during long Brit-like pregnant pauses and silences, which alike baffle the average audience.  Yet actors you rarely see on TV or film, need something more;  they need LINES, or at least meaningful blocking.  Since these long pauses and silences don't seem to add to the plot at all, and since there is no backstory to establish empathy with the characters, one is left waiting waiting waiting for something to be said or done to justify watching further.Some of the reviewers are all happy about the sophistication in the storyline.  Yeah, but if you're watching paint dry for most of each episode, the sophistication doesn't 'pay off'.  We don't need car chases and shoot-em-ups, we need MORE LINES.  Shakespeare knew that.  So why didn't the script writer, here?  Who messed up this good story?So I forced myself to get through the series.  So I don't wonder why AMC pulled the plug.  It's bad scripting and bad film editing; not the acting, and not the plot.  WAY TOO SLOW, people.  WAY TOO LACKING in lines, subplots unexplored, so of course the viewer will be bored.  Were I a potential commercial sponsor, I wouldn't want my commercials playing during this show, due to its snoozy presentation.  Not fair to the actors or the plot, either.  A story which needs to be explored (whether plausible or not) -- just got wasted.  Pity.FIX IT, please, and redo so the audience can follow along, cut all those long meaningless pauses with headshots, substitute meaningful dialog instead, so the audience can connect the dots.  People like whodunits, that's the most popular story format since the Garden of Eden.Then, you'll get a good audience.
This series just drags and drags____ i lost interest and have not watched the rest of the season. I got about 3/4 of the way through the season waiting for a big moment of some sort to happen. It never happened. I may try to finish watching it
I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched the pilot. The characters and plot appeal, but its so slow. I couldn't help but think &#34;get on with it already.&#34;
Potentially this is a great series, but after a few episodes I felt it wasn't getting anywhere. There seems to be a lack of intensity, with story lines that just drift off. I am sure it will all come together in the end, but I don't think I will stick around since I am not enjoying it enough to wait. However, the concept is fascinating and the acting is excellent.
We like this sort of political/spy drama. We have been enjoying several Scandinavian shows, basically liked the new House of Cards, etc. However, after four eps. we decided to go back to re-watching Justified! We were still curious what the deal with Miranda Richardson was, but otherwise zzzzzz
