This device worked very nicely for the large class that I used it in. It's hard to get everyones answer for lecture-size classes so this made it a little bit easier. The only thing is that the plastic that covers the keys can sometimes come off or have bubbles underneath it. Not too much of a big deal though for someone using it in class, it still works. Also, you have to be careful if you have to register it with your class online because there are a lot of numbers on it and so you have to make sure you typed the right ones in.
This is a good quality case and was reasonably priced. for some reason I thought that this case came with notches to support the Nook but it does not. I wish I would have waited to submit an order later for the case with a stand.
I have enjoyed this cover for a few weeks and I like it. It protects the Nook HD+ very well and the stand configuration is excellent. Another unexpected positive design feature, is that it re-directs the speaker sound towards the user in the open/folded position.I wish it was less bulky and that it felt better in my hands in the open/folded position, where it feels a little awkward.
There are lots of new ideas.  I had never worked in the round before but this book is clear and helpful.
I bought several Zentangle books. I use them in my classroom to help the students get ideas for created texture.
I am already familiar with tangles and was looking for a different format to create them. Zen Mandalas has a helpful layout, clear tangle pattern how to instructions, a picture index of tangles with page number in the back of the book, abundant color, and examples from different artists. A wide variety of color media is explored and shown. I think it is a good reference book to go back to for ideas. I plan on trying some of the novel ideas, like using a cut out snowflake as template. If you want to break out of tangling in squares, give this book a try.
I  use this book and others like it for inspiration to create newdesigns.  I am hooked on Zentangle, though I probably breakall the rules.
I'm a mandala artist and I got this book to be a source of inspiration for whenever I'm stuck or have artist's block. The samples by other artists are pretty good, and there are many small samples of doodles and their variations. I was inspired to use my own black-and-white blank coloring mandalas and doodle designs into them rather than just coloring them in coloring-book style. Also I was inspired to add tangles/doodles over the colors I use in my mandalas.Some information is given as to number, color and symbolism in mandalas, nothing new or complete. There are some inspirational quotes throughout the book.The snowflake idea is PERFECT for anyone who wants to create a variety of mandala designs quickly and easily without using a compass and protractor!
This was my first 'zen' book and I did not know exactly what to expect.  I expected more...I do have to say that....after comparing it with many other 'zen' books.  I thought the photos were fairly small but the designs were lovely,
It is a good book for learning how to draw Mandalas. JUST be patient.... you must feel like 'details' are the game for the day...Nice book.
I like the book. I have never tried to draw and color mandalas before and I certainly never knew about the significance of the design and the colors used. It is very interesting and because I already love to do Zentangles, it was especially fun for me to see. I'm happy to add to my library. It is well written and instructions are clear to understand. Enjoy
Purchased DVD for my daughter who was using her Nikon D5000 like a point and shoot camera. Wanted her to learn about the different shooting modes and the basic operation of her camera. This has opened up a whole new world on how this particular camera works.  I purchased Vol 1 & 2 to get her a basic understanding and beyond.  These are very good videos.
Only two of the three videos was of any real help.  But the two that I did learn from were chock full of new information on using the various modes of my Nikon D5000.  These would also be great for any camera that had a variety of adjustments, like S, A, and P.  Much of the info is general enough that you can apply the info to other brands, as well as P & S.  Very easy to understand and follow.  Not sorry I invested in them.  There is a lot to digest so I watch them every so often and retain something new.
Dfine is a plug-in for Photoshop that makes one of the filter selections a program that removes pixelization and digital noise from JPEG images. I love shooting at incredibly high ISO (what we used to call "film speeds"), and even with my Nikon D200 shooting at those speeds can be a little bumpy. But with DFine, for the less than 80 bucks it costs, I can polish all that noise into smooth images.It works very good almost all the time. I use it often, and I'm glad I bought it.
Overall, the TV Guardian works very well.  There are a few shortcomings, however.1. This model only works with standard definition TV.  There's an HD model available from [...].2. It usually doesn't work with DVDs, because DVDs usually use subtitles instead of closed captioning, and the TV Guardian can't interpret subtitles.3. Sometimes the closed-caption signal is garbled in transmission, and TV Guardian will allow profanity to slip through.  This is a problem with closed captioning, though, not with TV Guardian.Despite these limitations, I've had a very good experience with TV Guardian, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to filter out bad language.  There are newer models available from [...].
This laserdisc boxset of The Golden Age of Looney Tunes was once the best source for the classic cartoons before the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD boxsets were released. The laserdisc set wasn't remastered like the slicker DVD boxsets are -- the prints used were sometimes faded, and there are no extra features included. Instead, it contained 5 laserdiscs with over 8 hours of cartoons, with one disc side dedicated to directors such as Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones. The sets were released by MGM/UA Home Video, and comprise the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons from 1933-1948, which Ted Turner owned the rights to at the time. (This meant that none of the more familiar classic LT's from the 50's like What's Opera Doc? or Duck Dodgers were included. They were released separately on laserdiscs by Warner Home Video.) The artwork on the box covers and insets were far more appealing than the garish artwork presented on the DVD versions.A handful of the cartoons on the laserdisc boxsets still aren't available on DVD as of this writing, such as the cartoons starring an aborigine called Inki, who hunts a Minah bird in several outings. **Also, on the first volume the very politically incorrect wartime cartoon Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips was included!** The set was recalled after Turner received an irate consumer complaint about the cartoon, and it was replaced with Racketeer Rabbit instead. If you are going to buy a used copy of this set, be sure to find out if it contains the offending cartoon or the replacement. (The only way to know for sure is if the seller has viewed the item. The listing on the box still has Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips even on the replacement sets.)
This works exactly as advertised... with a caveat. It will consume several batteries to fully charge your phone. I am using rechargables for that reason.
Wont fully charge it, but will give you juice to stay in the game. Just what I needed. 1 battery gives you about 1/2 hour of power.
I expected to find something light and flimsy, a simple shell of a tube in which to place a battery.  Instead, the design is substantial, with a well-machined steel cylinder topped by a lucite cap into which is plugged the jack and short wire to the Blackberry Torch adapter. The bottom of the cylinder unscrews, and there is a red LED that lights up and that can be seen through the lucite top.  It is a simple yet elegant device, and, to use a fruity metaphor, more Apple than Blackberry in its design sensibility.  Oh, yes...and it works.
This charger works best with Lithium batteries.  It gets really hot and didn't come with any kind of literature but it works.  I noticed that if you leave it plugged into the phone it seems to uncharge the phone battery, not sure if this is what is actually happening since there are no instructions.
Update: this thing only works for a basic kickstart and will maybe get one call.  Don't expect it to charge your phone more than 1-3% at most, even with fresh batteries.  :(I wasn't sure what to think about this impulse buy.  When I put the battery in it started getting unbelievably hot and I had to put it on a cold stone and remove the battery quickly before a meltdown happened.  Aside from that scary part, I just used it today to kick start my metro pcs Samsung phone.  It worked like a charm.  You have to play with the direction of the battery and plug it all into the phone - this time I left it on a marble table and it stayed relatively cool, while my phone started to charge immediately.  Awesome find - just be careful - I recommend using rechargeable batteries and taking them out when you are through charging.
Easy to stack and fit well in small places. They are quite durable and descent looking for the price. Enjoy!
O.K. to start with I would have rather bought a nice widescreen format digital but I just dont have 2 or 3 grand to spend rightnow.I was attracted by the ... price with no tax ...,not bad for a32in. t.v.. I was a little worried by the negative reviews but so farIm more than pleased with this t.v. . The cable system where I liveisnt the greatest but the picture quality on this set is much betterthan the 27in.  I used before, the most dramatic improvement was withDVD's not only is the bigger picture better for viewing but thesharpness,contrast and color are all excellent, I was really surprisedby how good the picture is. Another surprise was the very good soundQuality of the sets speaker system. My previous t.v. was an RCA hometheatre 27in. which I owned for 6 years without any problems, I hopemy luck with this set will be as good. All in all I wouldnt hesitateto suggest this t.v to anyone looking for good quality video on abudget.As for the complaints I read about the gold+ guide I agree itssomething I didnt want either and its very easy to shut off just gointo setup and skip the setup for gold+ and it doesnt show upagain. Tho only complaint that I have and its a small one is that youhave to manually switch between the video and svideo inputs, I usevideo for my vcr and svideo for the dvd, I wish both video inputscould be active at the same time but it only takes about 10 seconds toswitch them using the setup guide so its really no big deal.Barringany reliability problems I think most people would be very happy withthis set especially at the price.
Yeah, it's big.  Yeah it's clunky.  But I've had this PDA now for about 5 years, and it's never failed me.  Not once.  I originally bought it because I thought it was cool (at the time).  Didn't use it that much except to keep a few addresses and phone numbers in.  Mostly it stayed on a shelf collecting dust.  I recently moved, stuck it in a box, and there it sat for another 2 or so years.  Finally unpacked it a week ago, plugged it in, charged it up, and it runs as good as it did the first day out of the box.  I've long since lost the sync cable and associated software so I can't upload anything to it, but it serves my purpose quite well.  Storing contact info, to do lists, appointments, random musings, etc.  The Jot handwriting recognition software works very well too.I've spent the last week researching newer Palm OS, and Windows OS PDA's, weighing the pro's and con's of each and came to one conclusion.  HP built a heckuva unit with the Jornada 420.  I'll probably stick with it for a long time despite it's clunkiness, volatile memory, and short battery life.
I bought this thinking it would be my do-it-all device.  Voice recorder, address book, calendar/to do list, and mp3 player.  It does it all except the MP3 player part.  A reviewer said he loved the MP3 player capability. -NOT-  If you load MP3 files into it, there is no player to play them.  At least Win CE can not find anything to use to play them.  Is the player an add on?  If so, where can I get it.Larry
You can also own one second-hand now at an EXTREMELY reasonable price.  I've had mine for about six months now and it works great!  I love it's mp3 feature, love the color screen, the battery life and the durability.If I could have two wishes though, I wish it was a USB device.  Transferring larger mp3 files from my pc just takes way too long over a serial connection.  I had to buy a compact flash card reader to circumvent the problem.I also found I have a real dislike for Windows CE.  You have this beautiful color screen and it's just too cramped up with windows.  Palm's OS really seems to flow better.  I had heard that Window's new 'Pocket PC' OS had solved a lot of these problems, but I've yet to use it.All in all though, it's an awesome buy for the price!
These disks come in a nice package for all 10, and a seperate little case for each one in the following transparant colors: blue, green, yellow, purple, and hot pink (2 of each color).  The colors are something for  everyone, but I could have done without the hot pink.A minor gripe  about the stickers: they peel off somewhat easily.  And the tiny stickers  are a nusance to put on.Overall, a good buy for the ammount of disks  (10).
First, let's cut to the chase. The Nino is the best Windows CE device on the market.  It's sturdy and easy to use and the new color display is clearest there is.  The Casio device looks as if it would crack if you touched it the wrong way and HP's new PDA is too bulky to be practical.A  constant criticism of Windows CE devices are the multitude of software  options that aren't really useful.  But, I love the voice recognition  software and the digital messaging.  I use it to recap sales calls all the  time.I too had some problems with installation, so I sympathize with the  previous comments.  If Philips has indeed discontinued the Nino, I hope  their replacement is even better.
This little guy is worth twice the price.  The bundled software is great (calligrapher can decipher even my chicken scratch), the sound record and playback capability is a huge plus, and I had no trouble installing it  for use on both of my work PCs.  The only remaining litmus test is getting  it to work with my Mac at home (via VirtualPC), but I won't be heartbroken  if I can't swing it.  This is a great little machine, it's cut out my need  for the morning newspaper, provides me with a huge city map when I'm lost,  helps me track my finances, and even lets me use the WWW with better  functionality than just about any other palmtop PC I've seen.It's  definitely worthwhile.
so i gave it a 4 star.  I thought it took too long to go through all the items in the cleaner dvd.  Worked well with my panisonic dvd palyer.
I purchased DVD cleaner because I was having problems loading and playing DVD movies on laptop.  After I cleaned drive, movies played like a charm, with no problems loading.  Glad I made this purchase.
I cleaned my Blueray player and my wifes car CD player and it works much better. Her CD player would lock up and we would wait for it to reset. I cleaned it and no more problems, good product so far.
I think it's an excellent product, is a very good buy because it meets all my expectations. Highly recommended. Thanks
The optical drive on the 2008 13&#34; Macbook pro wasn't reading dvds and I thought this would help. The problem is still there albeit on a lesser scale than before. So, not a complete was of time I suppose.
my MBP started having problems with playing some movie DVDs (Netflix). Based on some other reviews here, I got this cleaning disk. The first attempt was moderately successful - the disk spun in some noisily fashion and got spat out; no tracks played... Tried the second time and this time it worked perfectly - iTunes was opened and all the tracks available. I went through Intro and Cleaning  track, skipped the tests - my drive works again.Can recommend it as something to try before going to Apple Store, especially if one doesn't have a warranty anymore. Worst case scenario - one can use the disk for other CD and DVD players. No loss.
I was having trouble with a built in card DVD player that was really expensive to replace.  Decided to give this a shot and within minutes the DVD player was working good as new.  Buy it if you are having issues with a DVD/CD/Blue Ray player.
Great cleaner CD -- cleaned all my equipment (CDs/DVDs/computer drives, too),without any problems.  The included sound tests are just space-fillingmarketing trick (so I supposethe cheaper B00000J1QKwould work just as well),don't expect anything "special" out of them except for the price bump-up...
When my macbook cd player stopped recognizing my cds, i went online and one of the suggestions to solve the problem was to buy a cd cleaner.I came across this product on amazon, read the stellar reviews, and decided to get one for myself. It works great for my macbook pro and my cd player finally recognizes and plays my cds. I couldn't ask for more.
Cleaned all the units in my house, I'm satisfied. Very easy to use, talks you through the entire cleaning. Recommended.
before using this product my cd's were skipping,simple to use and corrected this situation. I recommend this product highly to make your cd's sound like new and give your cd player a better sound.
My order, (Allsop 23321 Ultra Pro Carbon-Edge DVD and CD-Drive Cleaner) was right on time and the item is very good.
I bought this item because my MacBook Pro was having some trouble reading disks, and other reviewers said it was excellent for cleaning the laser disk in sugh items with slot drives. It turns out the it was also designed to calibrate and check speakers to ensure maximum sound quality, making it excellent for such items as stereos ad surround sound systems, but overboard for my purposes. All in all, though, I am very satisfied with its cleaning abilities and am glad I can save it for the future when I can use it on other products that maximize its potential.
I had my doubts at first, but that's history.  I bought this to try out on my Arcam CD-72 player thinking, maybe...just maybe...I'd get a few extra sound nuances previously lost over time.  I did and then some.  Further, the tutorial included on the disc is helpful in more ways than one.  Money well spent.
This seems to work, although there is not way to be sure except, perhaps, by inference. That is, if a drive that was not working is suddenly okay again, it probably helped. Best not to set hopes too high as, if you are having trouble with a drive, cleaning the lens may not be the most likely cause of the problem. For the drive we tried it on, the problem persists, and I am now fairly certain that it is the drive itself. So, if nothing else, it can tell you that a dusty lens is or is not the problem. The price is fair. It did not seem to cause any trouble, so is presumable safe. Also comes with a plethora of sound tests, which some may find valuable.
Good product but when you insert the disc it gives you a lot of superfluous information.  Most folks, like me would be happy just putting the disc in the player, perhaps listening to some technical information or music while it is cleaning and then when the disc is finished it just says so.  It should just let me select the other features that are offered on the product instead of automatically prompting me to use them as if I must do those things every time I clean the player.
Before I ordered this DVD cleaner, I read the critiques and one or two mention stop and starts with breaking up. I then ordered the cleaner figuring dust particles must be inside that I cannot clean.The product arrived promptly. After reading directions, while visually and verbally seeing/hearing display commands on tv screen, I noticed emphasis was on the sound be dispersed equally thru speakers of tv and cd players of autos etc.When dvd cleaner finished, hoping for the best I then played one of my dvd's for improved visual reception.  No...the same.  The videos are the Little House on the Prairie series I recently purchased.  Ironically, I tried using an older dvd from rental company and the movie played perfectly.If you are buying this item for helping visual problems, don't buy this.
This works very well. However it is way too long to listen to. It also repeats instructions which drives me crazy.
I have external drive dvd, a 3dbr/d player,a computer w/built in dvd,and a dvd recorder,just install and listen to followed directions. to clean and  be able to optimize each system is great.it's been about a year since i last cleaned them.i notice a big change in my devices.I think i gave this allsop ultra pro a decent test and it passed. good product.
I assume it worked. But I still have the same issues. I think the cleaner work fine, but is not the issue with my DVD Recorder. It plays the same, it just doesn't record many disc (DVD-RW or DVD-R). I don't know what going on with this thing?
I bought a Corolla in the Middle East and found that the CD player wouldn't read audio CDs burned on a computer.  It would read regular audio CDs.  I was bummed.  I decided to try this product since being in this area leads to a lot of dust on everything.  I almost laughed when I took it out of the packaging.  It's basically an audio CD with 5 tiny brushes scattered across the disk--actually all are at the same radius.  I had little hope this would do anything.  The &#34;touch here&#34; anti-static panels made me even more skeptical.  I put it in the drive, listened to the directions, and then repeated the process just in case.  I then put in the audio CD that didn't work 5 minutes before, and voila!  Worked for me!  That CD has worked ever since.
Honestly not too much to type about a lens cleaner.  I do notice a few 1 out of 5 reviews for this and similar products, because the product did not &#8220;fix my broken player&#8221;.  I will not rate it on that criteria alone.  While your player COULD be skipping and misbehaving due to dust on the lens, it could be the laser itself is going bad, or some other mechanical failure.My Experience:I recently purchased two mp3 players to replace my Sony D-NS707F (not going into details, though I did write a review for that as well).  It was not so much skipping, but inserting random &#8220;screeches&#8221; (the only way I know how to describe it) throughout the mp3 CDs that I A) know are good and B) also prior discs without scratches or smudges, would behave the same way.  Not to copy my review of that player, though I do have to say that I see people had it for about 2 months and it started behaving that way for them.  I had it for about 2005 (maybe 2004, but I forgot exactly) to April 2013 with no problem.  It was a victim of HEAVY use too.  I am happy with my two new mp3 players, though I sort of felt bad about the Sony D-NS707... its like an &#8220;old friend&#8221; that has lasted me for years and years.AH HA! .. HERE is where this disc Cleaner comes in.  My initial thought was that they sent a disc without any  on it.  It turns out instead of one &#8220;strip&#8221; (like in my prior, well worn disc cleaners) of brushes, this has a few very small grouped sets of brushes, circling an area of the disc.My first thought about that is &#8220;oh geez, I got ripped off&#8221; (granted that looking around at different places, this seemed to be the average price of lens cleaners, so it is not that big of a deal..).  Here is where my rambling of my Sony D-NS707 comes in.  I am not going to say &#8220;OH WOW, THIS WILL FIX ALL YOUR ISSUES&#8221;... though I have tested it for a bit (not as long as I should have probably) and NOT ONE SINGLE NOISE OR SKIP in even the most problematic disc (prior to cleaning).If it did not fix my issue, I can not say what I'd think of this product.  I 100% did not expect it to &#8220;fix&#8221; anything (note my first paragraph's comment) &#8230;IF this cleaner,  didn't (I am still testing that cd/mp3 player) fix that Sony, I may give it a 3 or a 4 out of 5 and I will not lower my rating, (I am still not sure if my Sony is 100% again or I just haven't reached the point where it messes up yet) if I find that out.  (I am not sure whats wrong with it, so I am not going to blame this product).  IF IT FIXED my issue, I am shocked at the product.  I never even thought of reviewing a lens cleaner before, though &#8230; I do have to say that .. if your player is having issues... ITS WORTH a shot.  Is this any better than one for two or 3 dollars cheaper from another company. I can not say... I did a little bit of &#8220;homework&#8221; and read reviews from others, and decided this seemed the best quality-vs-price option.  Others may work as well, though I would not be against (considering what price it may be), buying another product from this company down the road.I recommend this 100%, but remember it MAY NOT &#8220;fix&#8221; a problematic disc player, though it may fix it.  I am still shocked that my old Sony is apparently (for now) working 100% again.  I have a few other disc and DVD players, and will use this (buying another as needed) regularly to keep my products running at their best.For this price, even if your &#8220;on the fence&#8221; for trying this A) for your working disc players or B) &#8220;maybe trying to to fix one that hasn't been behaving&#8221; &#8230; I'd give it a shot.  Great Value either way.
Many of the DVD's that I was attempting to watch seems to get stuck and after running this piece through my old machine several times I've not had any where near as many issues with either discs I own or those I get from Netflix.
I have one of these at home, and it is a pretty good little TV for the price. I recommend it for secondary uses around the home. And like I said in my title- the reception is pretty nice.
Can't say enough about how handy and convenient this little box is! I was recently transplanted to Georgia...where even a &quot;dusting&quot; of snow makes everyday life grind to a halt. This past winter (99-00), northern  Georgia (and much of the rest of the NE coast) got hit by a severe  ice-storm. In the suburban Atlanta are where I live, downed power-lines  left more than 500,000 homes without power for as long as 3 days! Mine was  out for about 36 hrs. My little GPX 5&quot; portable became the focus point  of my house for the next day and a half! Loaded up with batteries, it let  my son and I keep abreast of how the repairs were going and have tv  entertainment in the evening. Now, my son uses it when he wants to sleep  out in his backyard tent. Picture was sharp and clear with good contrast  and little interference considering that it was receiving on it's internal  telescoping antenna. Battery life was surprisingly long...I think we ran it  for about 6 1/2 hours all togethter and we didn't run out of juice. And the  thing is so lightweight that you can prop it on your tummy in bed and  forget that it's there. Very happy with this little unit...and I'd  recommend that everyone should have one stashed in a closet &quot;just in  case!&quot;
Yea i just got these speakers and hooked it up to my mini home theatre system and its adding in the extra boom, bass, treble, etc that i needed to  rock my house until the day after forever. it's very good quality and i  recommend these speakers to anyone who wants an amazing sound experience!  it gives clear sound which is a must have when it comes to speakers. i give  it 4 stars because i think the price could of been a little bit lower for  these speakers . . . i mean cmon 25 bucks a peice is pretty high!  but  overall its well worth the money if you can experience the sound quality  that it returns!
I like the idea of a dual action stylus...and, compared to the other ones I have purchased and looked at, this has been by far the best.  I find the stylus easier to use and far more efficient...and while the pen leaves  something to be desired, it's very handy for writing down quick notes.  The  sleek design is awesome, and it definately looks good to show off.  I  reccomend it to people who have problems holding the normal thin stylus and  Palm beginners.
This case is great for the IIIx.  Unfortunately, it only works for the IIIc if you remove the flip cover.  I don't go anywhere without the flip cover, so I switched to a different brand of case.
As a dedicated Palm IIIxe power user, I've devoted as much time to finding the perfect carrying case as I have installing third-party software. This is one of the better ones I've used so far, but still not yet &quot;the  perfect case.&quot; The leather cover wears well and is smooth for seamless  putting in/taking out of your pocket. The full zipper closure protects your  Palm, your business cards or paper notes, and prevents your stylus from  getting lost if it pops out of your Palm. I do agree with previous  reviewers--make this a fraction of an inch larger. I don't use the front  flip cover on my Palm, but I know that many people do, and it should be  considered into the computations when designing a case. Another flaw that  makes this not-quite-perfect is the misplaced Velcro that can pull off your  battery cover if you're not careful. You can install your own Velcro if you  want--but why should you have to? When will some enterprising case  manufacturer come up with a clever-clever design that will hold your Palm  secure and safe in a case, yet doesn't involve smacking a great big piece  of fuzzy fabric on the back? There's a mint to be made out there for  someone who does!
The Zippedred Leather Case for the Palm III series is very good. You just have to &quot;break it in&quot;. When you first put your Palm into it, it dosn't cute fit, and you'll have to remove to front cover. And who want's  to remove the front cover. But use it and use it, and eventually the there  is room for the front cover.The case is as I mention good, but why in  the world haven't Palm made it just halv a centimeter bigger?.
A wonderful collection of disks and colorful cases, I can't imagine going back to the standard way again!
As a college professor of Computer Information Systems, I store lecture material, and class problems on ZIP disks for carrying back and forth from my home to my school system and for backup. Until I discovered these cases I often had a ZIP disk wrapped in paper because the original case had been dropped and had broken. These cases are ideal because I can have a ZIP and two 3.5 disks in the same pack to much better organize my materials. Dropping them does not break them. As far as I have found, there is no other alternative. I am now recommending them to my students.
We installed out Netgear network kit over a year ago.  It was a cinch to put together and the components all went together without a problem.  The kit is expandable to four PC's and is suitable for a DSL or similar connection for internet.There are a couple things I'd recommend, especially if you plan to use the network for internet access.  First, you need to understand that the &quot;hub&quot; is basically set up so that it allows one PC to access one computer, or your internet connection at a time.  So, be prepared for waits if more than one of you is attempting to be online at one time.  If you want to avoid that problem, you will want to install a &quot;switch&quot; instead of the &quot;hub&quot; which allows simultaneous traffic to flow at at the same time.  We just upgraded our Netgear network with a switch and it has made all the difference.The other thing-- you will need some kind of routing mechanism to handle the Internet connection.  This can be hardware based (like the Netgear RT311 Internet Access Gateway Router) or software based.  We chose to use Wingate software (available online at their website) and it has served us well.Finally, we had trouble getting a D-Link network card to work with the system, though my laptop's Linksys card works fine.  My advice, if you want to avoid problems, pick up the Netgear network cards.  I've got a spare D-Link card sitting here in my office if you need one!All in all, we've loved the system.  The documentation is simple to follow and the quality is first rate!
I bought this system several weeks ago and could not be more happy with the way that it performs. Every snap, crackle, and pop of a film comes to life and envelopes you. I watched The Matrix after hooking this up and  couldn't keep the grin off my face. The receiver unit is fantastic and  offers a decent array of selections for surround sound options. Anybody for  beers and a movie at my place?My two complaints are relatively  minor:1) The bass box doesn't roll out bass that you can feel. The lows  aren't quite as deep as they could be. I think my roommates are quite happy  with that, though...2) The remote lacks the control of some of the  features on the head unit. It also is not programmable for all of the other  devices that I own. I got it to turn my TV off and on but that's about  it.Keep in mind that setting up a home theater can be extremely time  consuming. Running the wires under your carpet and attching satellite  speakers to your wall can be daunting. While the kit does come with some  cable, it definitely is not enough to wire a larger room.You're also  going to have to purchase Audio/Video cables to match whatever you're  setting up (I needed two sets of A/V cables for my non-Dolby Digital setup  - you may need more).For the money, this is an all-around fantastic  bargain that I would recommend to anybody without a huge bankroll.
My main gripe: When I hook my monitor up to my video card directly, my picture is crisp and clear at any resolution. When I hook my monitor up to the hardware decoder card and then use a pass-through cable to connect the  decoder and my video, the picture looses a substantial amount of  clarity.(My video card is an ASUS RIVA TNT, and I have a 19&quot;  Hitachi SuperScan 751 monitor at home.)I bought this DVD drive because  it came with the RealMagic decoder card. I had read excellent reviews about  the RealMagic, and although I was severly tempted by the Pioneer  slot-loader, I gave into my impulse buying urge one day.I really don't  have TOO many complaints about this DVD drive. Since I'm used to swapping  parts in and out, the physical installation was a snap. (Although when I  added a new soundcard, I realized I had to redo my internal sound cables  unfortunately and use a pass-through externally for audio as a temporary  fix until I get more cables.) I really don't care for the recalibration  process, but once you finally get it perfected, the image is finally fairly  stable.I realize my problem lies mostly with using a decoder card, but  since it comes bundled with this drive, I thought I should share my  experience.
The Diamnond Rio is an excellent little MP3 player. The Software installs easily and is very intuitive when it comes to transfering songs off of cds or pre made MP3s. The interface is also easy to understand. It comes with  an attachment that pluggs into a parallel port that has worked flawlessly  for me. It will also work with your cd attachment in your car (for those  whe still have tape decks.) The only reason for the 4 stars is the lack of  memory. 32MB just doesn't cut it. For the price you should be getting more  than that. Over all, a good product.
Even though the 16mb disk adds more memory i would personaly try the 32mb disk for optmum expansion
This mp3 player is the ultimate in portable music players.  The only thing bad about it is that there is only 32MB on memory in it.  Also the flash memory cards are not that easy to get ahold of from where I'm at.  And I  believe that this item should be shipped anywhere in North America, not  just the U.S!
I just bougth this card and I can tell you it performs great with my favorite games (Unreal, Episode I Racer) an it's unexpensive. great buy.
WHEN I FIRST WAS TOLD TO GO TO DIAMONDMM.COM AND LOOK AT THEIR CARDS, I WAS EXCITED TO SEE AN AFFORDABLE 32MB CARD.  I PURCHASED IT AND POPPED IT IN AND WAS HAPPY TO SEE HOW WELL MY UNREAL TORNY, DS9, KLINGON ACADEMY LOOKED.  IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR MY HALF LIFE THOUGH, BUT IT HAD ALREADY LOOKED FINE.  ANYWAY, MY BIGGEST GRIPE, AND WHY I AM LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT CARD NOW IS I CAN'T RUN CERTAIN OPENGL SUPPORTED GAMES.  IT APPEARS AS THOUGH GLSETUP DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE STEALTH CARD.  SO MY ST: ELITE FORCE WAS DOOMED.
I upgraded from the Riva TNT card and found this to be an excellent card.  I was able to play Unreal and Wheel of Time with no problems, even though these two games are optimized for 3DFX cards.  The only problem I have encountered is my fan has quit.  Unreal 2 will be released soon, and I will need a G-Force card anyway.  Call it good timing, I guess.
I bought this used via Amazon.  Arrived in as new condition within 1 week. The Adapter works fine in NA and Japan, i.e. on 110-120V 50-60 Hz AC mains supply.  If you also travel around Europe/Australia or places with 220-240V, you need to buy a second adapter, probably from PSION in UK.  Other hardware suppliers like COMPAQ supply one adapter, to work in all countries, that automatically senses the incoming voltage and frequency.  The lead is 5'10&quot; long.  I would prefer slightly longer for those hotel rooms that do not have conveniently placed power outlets. Otherwise it works perfectly.
Sadly, my 5 disc CD changer wore out after much use over the years.  When I looked for a new one I wasn't having a whole lot of luck finding something fairly inexpensive.  When I saw this I decided to purchase it even though I have never bought anything refurbished.  After receiving it I hooked it up and it skipped.  I do not know if it was rattled and shaken during delivery or simply didn't work, but I got online and requested and return label.  It was very easy to return.  After printing a label, the seller contacted me asking about the status and offered to refund or send out a new one.  I opted to get a refund at this time.  The seller was VERY prompt in refunding my account AND credited me for the expense of the return shipping.  Even though I do not have this purchase in use, the seller was beyond willing to make it right and offer great service.  I will definitely consider my future CD player purchase through them.
First off this player is not slow, it searches very fast and it sounds extraordinary.  I am a Technics and Vector Research man and have owned CD players since 1982.  The head phone jack and the remote control cons are  minor.  I have never used a head phone jack, on any of my high priced  players, let alone sat over a player with a remote.  Once the music is  playing your moving around and with a five-disc capacity you are too busy  -- &quot;busting a move baby!&quot;
Para resumir mi apreciaci&oacute;n de las 4 estrellas puedo decir a favor que es genial contar con un verdadero PC portatil, en la practica de bolsillo, ya que puedo recibir e-mail con imagenes en colores ideal para mi trabajo y con una buena resoluci&oacute;n.Puedo preparar textos para presentaciones en la empresa ya que cuenta con un teclado practico y funcional lo que le da una gran ventaja comparativa a una Palm. El equipo funciona muy bien, aunque solo unos detalles me gustaria mejorar como la corta duraci&oacute;n de la bater&iacute;a y aumentar la capacidad de su memoria. Sin duda lo recomiendo con estas salvedades.
Most people use their Palms as address books. $... for an address book seems like a lot of $ to me.The Rex is a fine electronic address book (and calendar, to do list, etc.). It fits easily in your shirt pocket and is easy to sync with a PC.The only drawback is you have to enter the data in a PC and then sync it to the Rex - you can't enter data directly to the Rex. This is not a problem for me, but it may be important to some.
We are very happy with this machine.  It came nicely and very safely packaged, was easily set up, and is working wonderfully well.
The first unit I purchased did not work.  Apparently the laser was out of alignment.  I exchanged the unit.  The new unit works great.  The convenience of the JVC CD catalog provided with the unit is helpful.  A  little noisy from disk to disk, using the random function.
I've tried this brand and the Lexar Media brand (which purportsto have 4x speed) and have found no appreciable difference inday-to-day usage.  This seems like a fine card.My only complaint about the New Media Tech cards is that the plastic card holder cases are physically much larger than they need to be and the way the card snaps into the case is a bit of a pain.  If you carry and swap a couple of cards, this is a minor inconvenience.
Hard to find in my area, very pleased with performance in camera.
I purchased the Rio 500 and love it. It is the coolest things since sliced bread, BUT.  I travel a lot for work and use a Win 95 laptop.  The Rio 500 does not support the USB uploads from or to a Win 95 machine.  This stinks.  All in all though, I think that the Rio 500 is a great toy.My wife even  thinks so.
I actually met someone the other day that still rewinds their VHS tapes using their video player. What a fool! It took all my willpower not to spit in his face for his sheer stupidity. Why wear out that all too precious rewind button on your VCR when you can spend good money on this specialist bit of kit that will do the job for you???I'm saving up for the "KNYUV230C VHS Tape Rewinder" which also has a fast-forward function. That way I can go the whole hog and pack my VCR away for safe-keeping.
I have about 600 videos and I am not replacing these movies. So many that are not available on Dvd . So to save my machine This is why you need to rewind you videos.I hate technology. I can`t afford to keep up with it
Its better than the other three I purchased.. at least it will stop.. but the tapes sometimes are wound too lose...
After a month this rewinder is still working well, though a little noisy.  I purchased the same product last year and it lasted only about 10 months before self-destructing.  I hope this one lasts longer.  If not, I certainly won't buy it again.
Great for rewinding those old  VHS tapes. Purchased item for my wife and she stated she would recommend to others!
So far working without problems.  It runs quietly and completely empties the  tape.  Size fits completely on shelf and out of viewing area.
It works well, and is not noisy. It works fast.  It was hard to find one in the stores, so it was great to be able to find them on Amazon.
This rewinder is quite noisy, and does not rewind fast enough as other rewinders, but it does the job and ejects the video when completed
Product works alright except that door could open a little wider to facilitate cartridge insertion. Otherwise product is easy to use and efficient.
It works fine for what it does which is rewind tapes.  It is no frills but what we needed and the price is right. I have had no problems with it so far..
I shopped everywhere including pawn shops, to find a VHS tape rewinder as the recorders I have, I do not want to kill the bearings in them prematurely. I kept looking and calling, etc. for over 3 months. I finally made up my mind to scout Amazon again. I found a good seller with a good price, delivered to me. I had it delivered over 2,000 miles in 1 week, via regular USPS shipping. I ordered it as it was marked as 'new.' I got it and it was new. No damages and was packed good in bubble wrap. I read the instructions while looking over the machine and slid a VHS tape into it to rewind. The push/open button in front of unit you simply push down on that and the unit pops open ready for tape to go in. I slid the tape in, per instructions, gently closed the unit up, a red light came on in the front of the unit by push/open button and it automatically started rewinding the tape. Not real fast but fast enough. when it was real close to being done, it slowed down, then popped open so I could conveniently slide the tape out. The unit is NOT noisy like some rewinders are. I can assuredly say this, that I wish I had bought this unit a LONG TiME AGO! It is very nice.
The rewinder is awesome.  Its not the fastest thing in the world, but it does the job.  I would guess that a tape takes a couple of minutes to rewind.  We haven't had any problems at all and its nice to not hear the VCR rewinding and sounding as if its going to explode.  I would recommend this rewinder for sure if you still have kids watching VHS tapes like we do.
This unit is very smooth & efficient in operation.  Vey quiet, too.  The only catch is that one has to press down the lid just right way or it won't kick on. Once you get the knack for that, it works great.
I have only used this product four times thus far. It is fast and seems to hum along with a lot of enery.
Merchandise arrived on time, was well packed and in good condition.  It is a different brand than we had before and seemed to take about 5 min to rewind a tape which seemed lengthy compared to our old one.  I had ordered and paid for a new, unused item but I have no way of knowing for sure if this one was new or had been refurbished.  Either way, as long as it works we are happy with it.
Like it
won't shut completely at times. Have to keep pushing lid down. Outside of this, I am very happy. Nice looking unit that once it starts, does a terrific job. Would buy my next one here.
This TV has a nice shape and a nice picture.  The remote control is nicely designed with big buttons in several colors.  I've only used it with a VCR  so I don't know about the commercial skip feature that is advertised.One  oddity: pressing the channel advance buttons (forward or backward) cycles  the TV through channels 1 to 13.  So if you're using an antenna instead of  a cable hook-up and you want to step through higher channel numbers then  you'll have to enter the digits for each channel by hand.  A slight  inconvenience, too, is that you must type in a zero first to enter numbers  under ten.  (Pressing a &quot;7&quot; to get channel seven won't work  here.)It comes with an very sturdy pair of rabbit ear antennas (useless  where *I* live but I suppose they work quite well elsewhere). An adaptor is  provided for connecting the antenna to the cable-jack input (which is the  only input on the TV). Be careful when you attach this adaptor: the  orientation of it has to be just right or it won't fit, and the pin in the  adaptor looks a little flimsy. Press smoothly and very firmly to fit it  on.The channel number is displayed, on screen when you want it, with  pastel-colored, soft-edged numbers.  Everything worked right out of the box  (batteries included).This one's a keeper; I definitely like the picture  quality and also the appearance of the set itself.  It's much better than  my VCR deserves, in fact.  If it wasn't for the channel selection quirks  I'd probably give it five stars.
This unit replaces a GE 1CVD5027 that I've had for years and enjoyed until drum motor bearings began to fail.  When compared to my old unit, setup was a breeze.  Unit is quiet and picture quality on 25 inch TV is quite  satisfactory.  Hi-Fi for tape playback and stereo broadcasts thru home  stereo and home brew surround is very good.  I wish unit was heavier.  When  inserting tape, the unit is easily pushed away.  I may attach rubber feet  to alleviate this condition.  Overall, very pleased.
Pluses:  excellent picture with prerecorded movies;  excellent 'gee whiz' features;  good sound.Minuses:  'jumpy' picture on oversaturated recordings;  No LP (middle) recording speed;  poor picture quality at slow  recording speed.Overall, I'm happy with this VCR.  I can't complain too  much about the minuses because the price was so low.I'd like to explain  the 'jumpy' remark:  one of our prerecorded tapes had an irritating jumpy  picture (rapid vertical shaking) during the brightest scenes.  It was not a  tracking issue, and it didn't happen on our old VCR.  It ends up the tape  batch didn't meet NTSE specs; when we exchanged the tape, the problem went  away.  That said, we recently had a friend record something for us on their  VCR, and we ran into the same problem.  I can only conclude that this VCR  has a poor tolerance for oversaturated images.
Terrific value - lots of features at a very moderate price.  Easy to program, whether you use the VCR plus or not.  Picture quality fine in both SP and SLP modes. One inconvenience: no timer button on VCR or remote.
Has lots of excellent features for a 90-dollar VCR.  In addition to basic VCR functions, there is Commercial Advance and Movie Advance. The VCR's functions, settings, and programming are easily accessible in the on-screen  menus. The picture and sound are good. It's low price is more evident in  that tape insertion and rewinding are not as &quot;smooth&quot; as  higher-end models.
The Casio E-11 is definitly one of the earlier PDA's.First of all the the screen is kind of dark.Second of all it is way to bulky for a B/W screen, I mean my dad's Palm IIIXE is like half the size. Still the casio has a digital voice recorder (which is pretty cool) and Windows CE is a lot more like a desktop than Palm.
I have known about Phillips T V all along always good coments except apearance not always futuristic but good quality
I have had this mouse pad before.  It really helps with wrist pain and very comfortable.  The only complaint I have is that it has a very strong chemical smell.  It does fade away, but for the first two nights, my house really smelled like the chemicals.
It could be a little bit bigger but otherwise a good item.
I've got cubital tunnel syndrome, (pinching the ulnar nerve that runs through the channel in your elbow), and this makes a decent elbow rest.  I've been using little beanbag type items, though eventually they ALL start leaking their innards all over the place, so went back to one of these.  A plus to using a mouse pad is the non-slip underside.  Beanbags always slide around without putting them on a piece of dyscem or whatever.
OK
The design is good, but it has terrible smell. It feels a little harder than I think, but after several hours usage, it becomes soft and it makes my wrist relax. Although material looks like worse than before, it's still good to buy.
The pad's good, but the wrist rest is a little stiff and harder than I'd like.  The pad works fine with a wireless mouse.
This pad looks and feels great. They are cheap and worth it. After extended use they tend to start wearing out at the bottom and the covering peels off. It's not a big deal to me though...I just buy another!
Good item except for smell...U must wash it before using...My wrist pain is gone after using it along with Belkin wrist pad
This is not as good quality as my last &#34;gel&#34; pad but it serves the purpose.  This seems to have less &#34;gel&#34; in the center where the wrist goes, but still comfortable to use.
makes using the mouse very comfortable.  A necessity.
It's a mousepad..  Offers comfort and reduces wrist bending.  The gel in the pad helps. stays in place really well
I used to suffer of several wrist pain, since my job requires many hours using the computer, but since I got this product the pain has gone.I definitely recomend it!
I have three of these, two at home and one at work. The black pad tends to get and/or look dirty, while the silver pads look good all the time. Very comfortable, nice support for the wrist. Could stand to have a little more mouse roaming space, but not a huge complaint. Good stuff.
my old one was wearing out so i bought the belkin gel mouse pad and it is just right for my mouse it does not move when you move the mouse good buy
I just started to use this and it still has the &#34;new&#34; feel to it. It doesn't yet have the slickness that I am used to, but that is nothing new with a brand new mouse pad. Once I use it for a while and have it broken in, it should be a good mouse pad.
This mouse pad was exactly what I'd expected.  I like that the wrist support is attached to the mouse pad and the type of material that is used on the surface.  I would recommend this and would buy it again.
bought this for my middle-aged mother and she really likes it. The rest bar is very comfortable and really helps her when she is spending long hours doing family history research.
I had an old Belkin mouse pad that was stained and this is a good replacement for the price. I will say that the older one was made with more high quality material and gel. This one does the job but if you squeeze it you will hear a noise that sounds like crinkled plastic bags in the gel part. Not a big deal for regular use, but just odd and makes the product seem cheap, especially when compared to the older models. Again, not a huge investment and it does the job for the price.
I just received this today and have been enjoying it.  I am at my computer a lot and it feels nice under my wrist.
This is the second Belkin Gel pad that I have purchased.  I use a Logitech trackball and it prevents my wrist from aching.
This pad is comfortable but does not quite work out with my keyboard drawer. Wife does not like it at all.
It is hard to use a mouse pad this small after having used some larger ones. The wrist rest is nice though and this is a good travel pad when needed.
package came on time and is good and soft, I would recommend it. good for your wrist, cause is good especially if you have corrpal tunnel
My go to mouse pad for my main working computer. This is my second one after using the first one for 4 years. Good felling and build quality.
I really like this product a lot and have been using it almost daily since I got it a couple weeks ago.  My only complaint is that it's advertised as gel, but feels more like memory foam.  It's still comfortable though.
This was a life saver. I can rest my wrist on it ,and not worry about getting that CT. I never saw this item before and it was a life saver.I was using a rolled up towel to put under my wrist.I would highly recomend this product, especially if you are worried about your wrists getting sick....
Good product for the price. My only complaint is it is a little small for my liking but overall still works well.
I only had it for a short time,but it's a great mouse pad so far! I would recommend it- specially for the price... i might get a second one for work!
A little smaller than my last one but still gives comfort when I type. I recommend it. You should not be disappointed.
Good product overall.  The gel pad was slightly stiff at first but softened with use.  The underside of the mouse pad has a rubber textured surface which is excellent for using the mouse pad on a glossy surface (e.g. a polished wood desk).  The top side of the mouse pad does exhibit a bit of friction when sliding the mouse, but after using the product for a while it is hardly distinguishable.
The product itself works as intended, no problems there.I give it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 only because of the strong chemical odor.  I can only assume that the fumes are toxic.  I will try to air it out for a few days with hopes that the smell improves.
Comfort for my palm and wrist......after years Of mousing this is great!It is low profile and my palm rests just right on it!
I have a laser mouse and optical mouse. I primarily use the laser mouse, and for it, this mousepad is fantastic. Although its a tad small, it has fantastic precision and comfort.On the optical mouse, however, it is incredibly difficult to use. The mouse can barely track on it at all.However, if you're using a laser mouse, I would recommend this mousepad.
Other reviewers are right. These newer pads are not made the same.  I think the difference is that the wrist rest is now using a combination of memory foam and gel.  The gel is only in the wave area(the dip)of the wrist rest, at least that's what it feels like to me. Belkin can still call it a gel mouse pad, but it's misleading I think.Minus one star because this mouse pad should be labeled Memory Foam/Gel in that order because it has more memory foam than gel.It's still comfortable to me, so it's a keeper.
I am still using it. received it on time and as described.4 stars because I hate the packaging manufacturers are using that requires a blow torch, and some small explosives to get open now, and then you run the risk of slicing your fingers off trying to remove whatever from inside the shell.mouse pad is very nice and seems to help my wrist problems... packaging is hell for people to try and remove that have arthritis or carpal tunnel issues, which would be why you would want this type of mouse pad.
smooth surface, and fit to table stably. it is used everyday, is fit for my moouse.The material is a little hard, maybe softer is better.
Superb support for that part of your hand that connects to your wrist that always starts to hurt after an hour or so on a hard desk. Maybe that's just me, but this fixed that problem. Conforms to your hand/wrist for support without restricting movement, of which there is still plenty of space for on the flat part. Will be using until it wears out, which looks like will be a long time from now.
Helps wrist and forearm fatige. Been using one for over three years and there is nothing better in a mouse pad.UPDATE: using for over six years now. Still wonderful. Just wash with dawn soap and let dry and you are good to go.
Just fine. This is exactly what I expected. I does relieve the pain in my arm and wrist after hours at the computer.
Bought for my wife for loved it. She never used one before but enjoys the arm support when surfing the web.
Good feel, not spongy like so many.  Hump seems a bit higher than I've been accustomed to, but not a problem.
The gel pad is comfortable and the pad isn't too wide to fit next to my keyboard on my desk. It's a perfect size, keeps your wrist comfortable while using the mouse, and I like the shiny, soft black fabric it's made out of.
I initially purchased one of these because it was one of the most highly reviewed pads on Amazon ... and within my perceived budget. Upon receipt I decided to purchase 3 more for my office and home.After a year of daily use (averaging 8 hrs/day), the pads have held well, been comfortable on my wrists, and have stayed impressively hygienic/clean.My only complaint is that the pads do seem to retain any battle-scars/indentations/accidental creasing - I assume I could iron them out, but then again, it is only aesthetic and I wish not to ruin the pad or my iron.
Very comfortable on wrist and tracks wireless mouses to the point. The only flaw is that it easily leaves imprints if you leave something on it to long.
It's a good, well-priced mouse pad, however the gel part is a bit stiffer than what I would have liked.
Everything is perfect expect the strong smell (chemical smell). Regarding the price, it's still a good deal. Everything is perfect expect the strong smell (chemical smell). Regarding the price, it's still a good deal.
This is my second purchase of these pads. They are very comfortable and work great. The material they are made out of does cause them to show dirt easily however. Also at first, the material makes a bit of sound when the mouse moves over it due to the friction. After some use though, the material softens and feels better/gets quieter. These do last a long time, at which point the material will start to bubble up and separate from the bottom cushion/rubber. Hard to beat for the money, though!
This was what I was looking for in a mouse pad. I will say, however, that it has a very strong chemical smell that could be an issue for those with sensitivity to odors. A lot of the times when I use this my wrist will smell like the mouse pad afterwards.
I was concerned that this wouldn't be comfortable but knew I needed support because I was beginning to feel strained in my right arm.  It has really helped that and I no longer feel there is a problem.  Glad I took the chance.  I know I'll never regret it.
The wrist rest has a little dip in it, which allows your wrist to be in the correct ergonomic position. It is certainly big enough.
Using a flat mouse pad on my computer desk puts my wrist against the rounded edge of the desk.  After a while, this aggravates my arthritis in my wrist, which has required me to wear a wrist brace.  My wife has one of the Belkin mouse pads like this, so I borrowed it to see if I would help.It did, so I purchased one for myself.  After a short while, I was no longer bothered by the support for my wrist - the gel pad is pretty comfortable - and I was able to stop wearing the wrist brace.
use it constantly.  only problem is the stitching around the edge can come apart ( have to re-sew).  but a good hand/arm rest. very comfortable.
It works great for my needs. I like the balance of rigidity and softness. The polyester skin is smooth and does not get sticky when warm like other pads I have used.The rubber bottom also does a great job of keeling it in place on my desk.When I read other reviews saying it smelt bad I thought it was just people being picky; but it isn't. When I opened it it smelt HORRIBLE and very strong (hence the 4 stars and not 5). I have had it about 1 month now and the smell has gone away, however if you are within 6 inches of it you can still smell it and the smell sticks to your skin a bit after using it.Overall for the price I have no complaints, but if you are sensitive to smells I definitely recommend spending a little more and getting a better one.
Very comfortable works pretty well. my only complain is that the mouse pad I have slides off it from time to time.  I imagine i can fix this rather easily with a piece of double-sided tape, so minus my laziness this is pretty good for the money
Sleek black fabric, and no company name showing when you use it!  The gel is a little hard right at first, but I'm hoping that means it will last for a long time.  Textured rubber backing means it won't slide or damage furniture.  Good buy!
Love this wrist rest and mouse pad combo.  I need a wrist rest for my slight case of carpal tunnel, but the bead wrist rest and mouse pad I was using always seemed to want to go their separate ways.  This keeps everything together on my desk top,
I've used several pads, the &#34;hump&#34; on this one is a bit lower and more comfortable on the desk top.
This was very cheap... and it works well.. I don't spend a lot of time with my hand on the mouse.. but I do spend some.. and I found my wrist was getting tired and sore.. so I purchased this and the pain went away.. so I would highly recommend itgreat product, great price
Fully functional and just as described.  Easy on the wrist. I have no problem or complaint about it so far.
Paid less than $9 for what is a very good mouse pad.  Provides needed support and appears well made.  Easy to use and mouse glides without difficulty.  I would buy it again.
First of all this mouse pad has been everything thought it would be and more.  I was hesitant with buying it since there were some mixed reviews but I thought I would give it a shot.  The gel is harder than any other I've used, but I've had no issue with that.  If you are gaming and using the mouse for long periods of time, I would probably get a softer pad.  I don't game that much anymore, and for non-gaming I find the firm pad to be great.  When I have played games on it and I use the mouse for hours it gets to be a little uncomfortable (not surprising for any mouse pad, but more so than with softer pads I've used).  The quality seems a little questionable, but I guess only time will tell.  As far as the smell, I can kind of see where some people are coming from on this, but I have to put my nose right on the mouse pad and it has a slight chemical smell to it.  Overall I've been very satisfied, especially for the price so when my wife needed a mouse pad for work I bought another one for her and she has been happy with it too.
I don't see how this item costs this much to make- seems like they are making a huge profit. nonetheless... a good product. recommended.
Most optical mice I've used do not work well on this mouse pad. If you have an optical mouse, you might be better off buying a gel wrist pad with no mousepad attached.
I have big hands and could use a bigger bad but this works well. Really soft and doesn't move around on my desk.
This is a replacement for another brand mouse pad I had worn out.  The wrist rest is essential for me as I have a weak wrist made worse by too much time on the PC.  But this pad is comfortable and has a large are for my optical mouse.
A great mouse pad at a resonable price. Very comfortable for internet browsing and most apps. It is a little restricting for gaming, especially shooters. The main issue is that the "waverest" will keep your wrist mostly stationary (which is good in most cases) therefore not allowing you to move the mouse back and forth as fast. Thats the only reason its a 4 not a 5.
this thing saved my wrist. hands down. pun intended. the gel pad is soft but is also firm. like resting one's hands on a squirrel, were it made of gel and polyester.
For the price this is a good buy especially if your like me and spend most of your day on the computer. The pad has not conformed to my wrist yet but I have only had it for a month. The bottom is grippy enough to not move and very thin all the samePros:Great gripActual pad is thinCons:"Memory foam" still at stock shape after a heavy months usageSlightly too big for keyboard shelve under desk
I really like this mouse pad! I've been using it since the day I got it in the mail and it's very comfortable and keeps my wrist nice and comfy!
Works well with multiple types of optical / wired and wireless mouses.. mices... mice...The Wrist rests - rests well.
Just as the title says, wish I bought this item 10 years ago.I'm only 30 years old and I am having real issues with my wrists already (having spent a majority of my time on computers since age 5).The WaveRest is nothing special, but it does what it needs to do. Relieves pressure on my wrist, and am now using these both at work and at home (gaming).
Comfortable and provides support for an extended period of time. I would recommend it to anyone.
Nothing special here.  The mouse pad is relatively small but it certainly gets the job done.  If you are an average computer user this will work great.
woks fine, no problems at all.  I use a lazer mouse with no issues at all like some others have mentioned. Great inexpensive product to ease wrist pain.
I like it, it works, it is a mouse pad. Not much more to say.4 stars because according to Amazon, 4 stars is like it and 5 stars is love it.I'm not in love with it. Also, the palm rest crinkles, I think the pad inside is wrapped in a crinkly plastic wrap.
For the price the two Belkin ergonomic items I purchased are a good buy.  The are not exactly what I expected, I thought they would be a little more comfortable and softer.  These are not uncomfortable, but the are &#34;structured&#34; and a bit to molded for my liking.  However they are doing the job and they were very well priced!  The mouse pad is probably a little higher on the scale as it has plenty of mousing room on the pad and the rest is suited better to actual natural resting position.  Either way they seem to be well constructed and will last for quite a while if taken care of, not forgetting saving our poor wrists from carpel tunnel or the like! :)
I like the Innovera better.It has gel padding.This one is good. I hate using a computer without a good mouse pad.
I have used this mouse pad for about a year, for someone who is a graphic designer, I use my mouse quite often, along with my tablet. Anyways, sometimes I have pains with my wrist and this mouse pad has most certainly helped me, although the pad will dull away over extended use (my padding has got lower and hasn't provided the comfort as it used to. However, it's been a year since I had this product and for the price, it's much recommended as I may consider purchasing this product again. 8$ for a year long mouse mouse pad for those who game extensively and do graphic arts on the computer on a daily computer in of need wrist support is a steal.
this mouse pad is very comfortable. But if you put your wrist over the edge then your circulation might slow like mine and your hand will fall asleep a few times a day, usually starting a few minutes after you start using it.
I needed a mouse pad with wrist support, that was not to bulky.  It provides some support for my wrist..  My old mouse pad with wrist support and new mouse would not allow me to close my mouse and key board pull out to close.  It you need a not to high mouse pad with wrist support, this will work. My pull out Keyboard leaf has 3 inches of clearance.
This is an extremely comfortable Gel Mouse pad, i love it. But the only reason why it didn't get a 5/5 is because  it isn't very comfortable for gaming. It just gets in the way. But i recommend it for your normal everyday use i.e. facebook/surfing the web it's great. Also like a stress ball. just punch it when you are mad and nothing happens!
I had wrist pain so I ordered it.This gel pad is very good product.Initially you would smell odor but after few days there wont be any!Quite comfortable and firm.
I find myself running out of room to move my mouse around. This probably isn't a problem for those who have their pointer speed set to really fast. My setting is semi-fast. Some may like the wrist rest to be cushier, but I don't mind the little extra firmness. I just wanted my wrist supported. I was previously using my chair's arm rest, so the improvement for the prices is a plus.
I enjoy this product.  It's very soft and comfortable on your wrist it rests on the gel pad.  If the product is durable I think it will be a good cheap investment to help combat wrist fatigue and pain.
my wrist is at rest when using the mouse, so yes, that goal is being met...nontheless, I feel that the gel pad is not as &#34;jelly&#34; as I'd seen in other brands..and most importantly when squeezed, it makes a plasticky noise!, as if the gel was covered in a chep plastic super maket bag...it's weird...but again, the goal I bought it for, which is give my wrist a break, is being met, so no complaints there...I suppose there are better option out there, but I think I'm getting enough bang for my buck.
It's a lot better than a flat pad, however after using for a hour or more my wrist will start hurting. Overall its a good product.
Quality product for the low price point. Just the right height for my liking. I replaced pretty much the same one that I've been using for several years (I lost it in a move) and the old one was doing fine, too!
It does what it's supposed to do. The gel flattens out pretty fast but it's better than the edge of the desk.
It has good resistance to the mouse action and is comfortable and easy to keep clean. I would like the pad surface just a bit larger.
I know it sounds crazy, but I couldn't figure out why none of my Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse 2.0 mice were not working anymore.  (Tried four of them) I happen to set the mouse on my desk and saw the cursor move.. ah-ha!  It was the mouse pad.I absolutely love these Belkin ergo pads and usually replace all of ours yearly.  I just replaced our last year's pads and it seems the new material that works great for all our other mice, just doesn't work with the "Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse 2.0"These were purchased Mid November 2010.I put my last year's Belkin pad for the computer using that mouse and I'm good to go.  Otherwise, they are perfect!
Worth it to save your wrist if you're at the computer a lot, like I am.  (Homework, programming, gaming, browsing, etc.)
It's very comfortable but could be a little longer.What else could I say about a Mouse Pa? Nothing much.
I bought an identical pad 6 years ago and have enjoyed the comfort it affords my wrist. I'm still using it -- nothing wrong with it! After buying a new computer I decided to buy another one of the Belkin WaveRest pads. It looks and feels exactly like the older one but upon removing it from the packaging, the room suddenly smelled like a warehouse full of tires! I've been airing it out for several days now and the smell isn't quite as strong, but I haven't started using it yet. I suspect the odor is a result of it being manufactured in China, but that's only a guess. Except for the strong smell, this is a 5-star item.
Doesn&#8217;t slide and it is comfortable to rest your wrist on. I have a bone that rests on it from arthritis that used to hurt all the time it doesn&#8217;t anymore.
This is comfortable mouse pad.  It is exactly as it looks in the picture.  This is good pad for the money.
This mouse pad is good quality.  The wrist rest if very nice.  If you have a newer mouse, this pad is probably perfect.  Some of the older optical mice, however, may not pick up on the center of the mouse pad.
