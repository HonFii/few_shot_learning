I found a lot of the actual Mandala art examples low in quality and amateurish. The small designs and patterns were helpful and interesting. I think the person who did these is not in illustrator, like the Zen Yoga book which was great and top quality.
I plugged the  "Garmin Nuvi 1690 Standard Red LED Wall / AC / Home Charger" into the outlet and then plugged the other end into the GPS. It seemed as though it was going to work but after the charging icon showed in the screen of the unit for about ten seconds it then went away and was replaced by a "gas gauge" that showed it was booting up. Then after that completed, the charging icon reappeared. This cycled continuously and so after 4 repeats, I disconnected it from the GPS and let it boot up into operation mode and then shut it down. I plan on returning the product for another one and hopefully the replacement with perform correctly!
Even when charged about 24h it still shows that it's charging my Garmin. Something isn't right with this thing...
Purchased this charger to use when I an in the field and away from bldgs or vehicles. It will not even start to charge the phone. It got very hot, but never worked. DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!  The 4 cell Emergency Charger from "Gomadic" works just fine. A little bigger but it works!!! That is the one that will be in my SAR 24 hr pack.
This product worked fine the first few times I used it.  But, the plastic and metal combination are not a good fit..the plastic cap keeps popping out of the metal case and not keeping in touch with the battery and not charging the phone.  There are better constructed chargers on amazon and I suggest looking at them before buying this product.
I got this AA battery powered phone charger, its small and fits great in you shirt or pant pocket. I tried it a couple of times with different brands of AA batteries and the results are the same. it does work, but it only charges a 3% to a 5% and then the AA battery drains compleatly. so really is a waste of money, unless you are ok on only getting a couple of extra secound charged to use your phone, instead of a couple of minutes.delivery was fast and product is in perfect state. But i needed something that can at least give me a half a battery charge (50%) heck i'll would like if I could at least get a 1/4 charge on my phone with this.
I purchased this product, in part due to the high reviews.  However, when I received this product I realized it does not hold CD's tight.  When you put CD's in this organizer, its so insecure youre not sure they're in straight up and down.  They don't click into place.  There are flexible tabs at the top that hold your CD in place by pressure. The problem is they're very soft. There is nothing holding your CD in place at the bottom. So when you grab your CD, they slide back and forth on the bottom very easily, and slip sideways.I imagine they made them that way because as the picture describes, you can grab a bunch and slide them around, inside the case, if you tilt them sideways first.  I don't particularly like this style, because the CD is not in there securely at all and slips around way to easily.  And what I find annoying to look at is your CD's stick out from the case about a quarter of an inch.  This boils down to personal preference, and some people may find this perfect for them.  I like CD holders that hold the CD securely. This gives me the impression its cheap and a bit flimsy.I decided to return mine, but found they charge a 15% restocking fee.  I figured that plus the return mailing fee were not worth it.  I'm giving mine to the Goodwill.
This home theater system is another in a long line of extremely mediocre products from RCA. I purchased a slightly older version of it before I knew anything about home theater. The sound for movies, with dolby digital from a DVD player, is satifactory. You can hear the voices, and most action is reproduced fairly well. The speakers are woefully inadequate when it comes to music. They are made out of cheap, thin wood and just decent materials.Pros:*Does an adequate job of movie sound when fed a Dolby Digital signal from a DVD player.Cons:*Terrible for music*Cheap construction*Only 50 Watts per channel, and that is probably a generous rating.
I was excited about all the positive results but very disappointed by the results I got. I had one Mac laptop, 1 sony home stereo and 2 car stereos that was not working. I definitely expected at least one of them to start working. But I received zero results.If you don't believe me, I recommend buying it from a store that will allow you to return it if it doesn't work.
Tried it on home player.  Skipped or got stuck part way through.  Must of run it 5 times.  Same results.  Wouldn't work at all in my 2002 Silverado player.  Kept getting an error message.
I have 2 DVD players that skip on almost all of my DVD's.  Unfortunatly, this item did not solve my problem.  The price was worth a try, but it didn't work for me.
I bought this because the optical drive on my Mac laptop started kicking out the disks. I read that the cure could be as simple as cleaning the drive, so I gave this product a shot. It worked fine at first  and I was able to use my disks. The next time it kicked out again, so I tried the cleaning disk without success. In the long run I bought an external drive rather than try to open my laptop and replace the bad drive. The external drive works well and I still have the cleaning disk just in case. The disk has tiny hairs on it to whisk the dirt away (at least once). I can use the external drive on any other computer with a USB port. All's well that ends well.
My DVD player says bad disc every time we try to use it. I bought this to see if it would correct the problem, it did not.
A total waste of money. I tried cleaning the CD head as layed out in the instructions. I tried it THREE times and it did nothing.A Total waste of money.
This may be great for a TV DVD player or stereo CD, but it doesn't work in my iMac computer. (2009 27" Intel Dual Core) It loads into the optical drive and then just sits there. The computer doesn't recognize it as a CD or DVD, doesn't open iTunes or DVD player, doesn't spin, doesn't play, doesn't do anything. Amazon was great with the refund, so no big deal, but I don't think it's made as a computer Optical/CD drive cleaner. At least not for mine.Also, just to note, it boasts an "Ultimate 8 brush system" but the "brushes" are just 1-2 tiny bristles each spaced around the center of the disc. Not much of a brush system if you ask me...
It looked, sounded a good product, but did not solve my issues with the iMac. Now i need to take my computer to the store..
This cleaner does what it's supposed to do. My problem is that I really have to play with the thing to get it to shift from one track to the other such as from the instruction track (#1) to the cleaning track (#3). It should have been made to shift automatically and not have to shift manually. I won't buy another one of these.
The CD player in our 2001 Toyota Avalon would only randomly play PC-burned CDs.  It would reject them outright or they would skip once started.  The problem was not the computer's CD burner, as the CDs played on our 03 Avalon's player as well as on other machines.  Manufactured CDs seemed to play fairly well. (We burn Audible books to CD for listening.)  This product did not fix the problem; in fact, there is no difference in the player's behavior for having been "cleaned".  The problem could well be a slight misalignment of the laser or something else, but be aware that this is not a cure for all ills.  Two stars because it might work well for some, and is not necessarily mislabeled - but it did not work for me and I would not recommend it to a friend without a cautionary note.
I have a Numark Dual CD & CDG player mixer that started to take a long time to &#34;read&#34; the CD...I wrote to Numark and they suggested cleaning the heads..I purchased Allsop Cleaner and followed the instructions... It seemed to help, at first, then it wasn't too long before it was as bad as it was before... I suspect that my problem might be more mechanical than dirty....It just didn't work very well for me so I took it to a place that repairs audio equipment and they said that the parts were no longer available so he just cleaned and adjusted the head and said that I should start looking for a replacement. When I got it back, it was just about the same as when I brought it in.. so I'm not sure that anything will help it in my case...So go ahead and try the Allsop, but don't hold your breath....
this didnt help my dvd player at all it keeps saying disc can not be played so until i figure what it is this cleaner didnt work for me so far
My Hitachi DVD player started skipping words after it was playing for over 30 minutes.  I tried this product. It didn't work.
I followed the directions, but it didn't seem to do what it is supposed to do.  Thus, it's useless to me.
The one I have now is a replacement from Amazon and I'm just guessing how efficient it is; but, I can't get it to work a 2nd time...at all.
Did nothing for my Sony DVD Player that randomly stopped loading (reading) discs after 10+ years.  Tried running it multiple times about 10 before I gave up.  Even added cleaner to disc and re-wiped.  Time for a new DVD player probably should have bought one of these cleaners along time ago
With such excellent reviews of this VCR I did not expect any problems...unfortunatly I was wrong.  The VCR boasts a cable box controller that is supposed to &quot;bounce&quot; off your walls to control the box.  This feature did not work with my standard cable box unless the box  teetered off the side so its sensor was directly over the VCRs sensor  (whickh is placed on the left top corner of the VCR instead of the middle).  The setup and program features are archaic and the remote buttons are  awkwardly placed.
Im not quite sure what palm was thinking when it made this stylus. Although it really looks nice, as a pen it is absolutely lousy. It's not much better as a stylus too.First of all, the pen itself is mediocre. To retract the pen is quite difficult. I almost broke it just trying to figure out how it workedAs a stylus, its strange how it works. Its slightly off center so its quite disorienting to use. The tip is not where you expect it to be.Although it was substantially thicker than the stock stylus, it was incredibly light giving it a &quot;flimsy&quot; feel.Considering all its drawbacks i am almost shocked how much Palm is charging for this thing. Its quite outrageous actually.However it does have its good points. The clip fits the stylus silo so you can attach it there. With this pen attached to the V series it actually conforms to the overall shape of the unit. It looks really nice. Also the combination of the silver hard case, and this pen looks REALLY good.Personally i use a multi-pen. It has a 0.7 mechanical pencil, blue pen and a stylus. All on a regular sized pen. I absolutely love it. Its a perfect weight and it looks professional and casual at the same time. Try it out, i promise you'll never use the stock stylus again.
I got a palm vx and i always have it in my pocket with my keys. I got this pen b/c it fits very nicely with the palm.  Since I was bring my palm wherever I go, may as well get a pen with it.The design is great, fits just like part of your palm, but the price is kind of steep. 25 buck here for a tiny pen??, i got mine for 40bucks and felt kind of rib-off.  It only comes with two refills.  You CANNOT get the refills anywhere!!!
When I first saw the Dual Action Stylus, I thought &quot;ofcource, how brilliant&quot;. So I when out a spend my hard earned money on this 30+ dollars assorie, for my loved Palm IIIx.  But was I dissapointed. It's a  bad (very bad), ordinary pen, and just a standard stylus for the Palm. A  complete waste of money. Keep your stylus, and spend your money on a normal  pen instead. (The only plus side is that it looks stunning).
I was disappointed with this item. It looks very cool, but is too expensive for what you get. The stylus is the same size in length as a regular Palm V stylus. It is thicker and has a light weight plastic feel to it. If it had been heavier, a bit longer, and had a smoother pen mechanism, I would have been happy.
The case looks good and its durable.  But, if you use the alarm/appointment reminder or inadvertently turn the palm on while its in your pocket--watch out. The cover presses on the buttons on the bottom.  Even in my suit jacket pocket, with very little pressure on the case, it  will start paging through the calendar, draining the battery.
If you care about video performance, keep on looking. This card is not gonna be the best for today's advanced games. Go with a Voodoo3 or a TNT2, those will keep you &quot;up-to-date&quot; for a while.
Well I don't have it, but a couple friends bought piranhas over a year ago. I'd rather have the Gravis GamePad Pro, which has 8 buttons for 8 different functions. Besides, serial-like connection is kinda out of date.
Despite the fact that &quot;Customers who bought this item also bought&quot; Rio500 players, this case simply does not fit the Rio500.  When the unit is in the case, it is impossible to access the volume  control, and the strap on top prevents connecting the headphones.  Too bad,  because the leather and construction are obviously of very high quality.  I  won't hesitate to buy a Rio500-specific case from Diamond if they produce  one.
It doesn't stay closed well and it is noisy and sometimes stops when done rewinding a tape.It, also, smells, too strong.
I didn't LIke this product that much, every once in awhile It tangles part of the tape.
This is made by Radio Shack , I have purchased others and would not have purchased this one if I had known it was a radio shack product....they do not last . I have to hold the lid down at times to get it to rewind, and then have to watch it to be sure it stops.
Ordered 2 tape rewinders at the same time. One already not working right. Sent back under warranty. Never heard from them nor have I receieved it back repaired or a new onw. DO NOT BUY...they do not honor warranty.
The Ambico VHS Rewinder is of poor quality.  In the beginning, when it finished rewinding,it would automatically open; now you have to physically open it.I would not recommend this product to anyone else.
Philips Magnavox PR1903C is a simple television set designed for the technologically apathetic. It has very few features and very few of the mechanical and technological updates one would expect in a modern television.This television set offers the usual minimum features a consumer expects to find in any television- like adjustments for color, brightness, etc.- along with a few extras, like a language control that allows the consumer to switch from English to Spanish to French, sleep timer, and close captioning. Most all features have to be accessed from the remote control- the front of the television offers no such options- not even to access the menu. Also, there is only one input jack on the back of the television, placing severe limits on accessory compatibility.If there is one redeeming factor for this television set, it is the quality of the picture.This surprised me at first, because the overall quality of most everything else is below average, leading me to believe that the picture quality would follow suit. But the picture is actually quite good on Philips Magnavox PR1903C. The sharpness is very good and I cannot detect any small lines or other problems with the viewing. In this regard, the television set deserves commendation. I can't really find anything wrong with the picture quality for this type of set.Going back to the negative points, I have noticed that this television set is prone to wear out a little faster than others. One sign of wear that is easily noticeable is the button on the front of the screen, to access the power. This button is a large, round button that is plastic in construction and is enclosed inside a round space. When pressing the button in, it is supposed to snap solidly in place but instead it rattles back and forth a little, making me worry that it is going to pop off. Of course, the way it is situated inside the round space, it cannot come out (as far as I know). But the looseness is obvious and it is a little surprising. With the limited amount of times the power button on the front of the television set is used (it is usually powered on/off with the remote control), I wouldn't expect it to wear out so quickly.Overall, Philips Magnavox PR1903C is an unacceptable television set for the many reasons listed above. I like the sleep timer and the picture quality is certainly very good, but the strikes against this television are numerous. There are too many bad points to make it worthy of a recommendation.
It smells bad, and it doesn't work with my Microsoft X10 optical mouse.So, I'm using it upside down.Otherwise, decent wrist support.
The Gel bag feels deflated or not properly filled.I have used others that felt allot better. Could be a defect
I really liked it at first it was nice and comfy on my wrist. After about 6 months the fabric over the gel part started to come loose and it got worse and worse. Now almost the entire "hump"/"Gel" section fabric has lifted off. I give it a 2 because of its durability.
I've bought the Belkin F8E262-BLK WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad to replace my previous Innovera Gel Mouse Pad, which was leaking some sticky gel on the wrist area, due to a small cut that later turn into a big one (my fault).This Belkin mouse pad feels more comfortable, because it has an indentation where the wrist rests. Another attribute that makes it more comfortable is the nylon fabric, which feels softer on the wrist. My previous Innovera mouse pad covered the gel area with a thin plastic material, which felt sticky on the wrist. Plus it didn't have the Belkin's indentation, thus making the Innovera mouse pad harder on the wrist.My only problem with the Belkin F8E262-BLK WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad is that it has the same nylon fabric in the area where you supposed to slide the mouse. When I tried to slide my Apple Magic Mouse, it wasn't a smooth operation like before, requiring more energy and effort to slide it across the area. I guess it's because Apple's Magic Mouse has two parallel and long plastic bars beneath, used to slide the mouse. After many tries, those plastic bars didn't travel well over Belkin's nylon fabric. They slide better on harder surfaces.However, let me address the possibility that my Apple Magic Mouse has been used for a while, on hard surfaces only, which could have turned the two plastic bars beneath less smooth. Or it could be a combination of both: less smooth nylon fabric with less smooth plastic bars.So, if you're currently using an Apple Magic Mouse, please note that it won't slide as smooth on this Belkin mouse pad. At least that's the experience I had, to the point of making me go back to my previous Innovera mouse pad. The Belkin pad feels like it's grabbing the Apple Magic Mouse, as I try to slide it all over the pad area. It's annoying and nonproductive.Disclosure: I'm not in any form connected to the Innovera mfr., and I haven't tried different mouses, from other brands, with this Belkin mouse pad. As a matter of fact, my perfect mouse pad would be a combination of the wrist area from the Belkin Gel Mouse Pad, with the mouse sliding area from the Innovera Gel Mouse Pad.
I will be returning this product.  The second day, my GPS fell out of the mount because the sticky substance no longer held it to the mount.  Ridiculous!
i agree with the other reviews. the have a bad smell that hasnt went away and it has been about two weeks now. there isnt much filling to give very much support and the material is very itchy and annoying. i reccomend teh fellowes mouse and wrist pads. they have much more of teh gel filling and teh surface is smooth and cool. not itchy. and they dont have a smell! not even when you first open it. they seem like much better quality for ur money.
well, its surprising to see a mouse pad which doesn't allow the mouse to move smoothly, not satisfied with it honestly
Yes the title you read is correct... I ordered 2 of these for work and home and now I regret. I could not bear the smell of these pads. I am surprised at the number of positive reviews. I don't know if its my dislike towards this kind of smell. I hated the smell of these... I don't even know how to put the smell into words..However, the quality seemed ok, the gel pad is fine and not hard like mentioned in some of the bad reviews here. It would have been usable for me if it was not this bad at odour. I sealed the pad in a bag with moth balls hoping the smell would change in few days, I will try to use it after few days.
garbage garbage garbage garbage ga  *  Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?* How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it.
I've owned a few of these before, but for some reason the gel rest on this one is different, and not in a good way. It's definitely much firmer than before, and while it's not like resting your wrist on a rock, it's close.
It's hard to know before buying a product like this one if it's going to be soft. I'm telling you it's not. It feels a little bit softer than a table but not enough to me spending most of my time working in front of a computer screen."Gel" doesnt mean memory foam. If you are aware of that you are good to go.
Simply, not what I expected!.. The cushion fails to supply enough support, and the 'mouse' area needs to be increased as well.
I haven't had this long but it's already got a dent a mile deep from resting my hand on it.  I got this because i had bad pains in my wrist and was hoping this would help.  Well I'm disappointed.  I know I didn't pay much for it in the first place but I would have spent a little more to get a better pad.
Although the wrist &#34;rest&#34; is quite comfortable, my mouse doesn't work well on the surface!  It is almost as though the battery is low on my mouse, yet when I just use it on the desk top it works perfectly.  VERY ANNOYING.  I am just switching it out often and wresting my wrist occasionally on the pad.  I would not have bought it if I had known of this problem..
The shiny black surface reflects a laser mouse erratically.  I had to throw another white mouse pad on over top of it, which looks pretty lame, but does the trick.  The wrist support is fine, and the smell only lasts for the first few days of use (or maybe I just got used to it).
I had a Belkin mouse pad like this for at least 6 years, possibly longer, and it was still going strong, in perfect shape when I gave it to my aunt and got myself a new one about 4 months ago.As stated in my headline, I seem to have a lemon this time. The fabric that's supposed to be "welded" tight over the entire surface of the pad like skin has pulled away from about 30% of the surface, and is continuing to do so.I called Belkin - which was no fun, btw - and they're going to replace it ... AS LONG AS I first send them this faulty one, paying the postage. That means I'll probably have to go for a few weeks without a mouse pad. Drats!Because of my experience with the previous pad, I'm going to try again. I figure my chances of getting another lemon are slim. However, if this is representative of the way they're currently made ... well, I'll worry about that bridge if and when I come to it.
Yeah it's comfortable and it does what it's supposed to... but the fumes coming off this thing are headache-inducing. I cannot recommend this product, unless you open the package, leave the pad outside to air-out for a week, then start using it.Gross!
Bought one for home and one for work. The &#34;gel&#34; breaks down in the middle, where it's needed most, and does so in a surprisingly short time. (like less than 60 days)Would give it 1 star, but it's too painful to use my mouse to move my cursor over there since there's so little support from the wrist rest.
Mouse pad is very nice, looks new after 1 year,but the pad is much too hard - and too narrow.It is indented in the middle, across the pad.I don't know if it is better than a plain pad.
Gel breaks down quick and sags A LOT.  Skip this one and fine something better - wish I would have.
I find the wrist pad hard and uncomfortable.  My wrist and hand feel numb after just a few minutes of resting on the pad.  I don't recommend this product.
When I first received this item, I thought it was quite nice. I purchased it in August and now (November) its falling apart. I am disappointed. The part that your wrist rest on, the material around the back edge has come unglued (or however its held together). I don't know if its because I am using it every day for more than 6 hours a day or what. I thought it would last a lot longer. I can not recommend purchasing this item. I would like to, but I can not.
The mousepad feels really good and seems nice enough, but the only issue is that my optical mouse doesn't work on it.  It's a nice logitech bluetooth mouse that works everywhere else, but as other reviews have mentioned an optical mouse doesn't necessarily work with this mousepad.  Be caution before you buy one.
how could they not see the top left corner of the pad is ripped. since when is there a word count requirement to comment on an item?
Sure, this purchase didn't break the bank but I definitely wouldn't buy it again.  The pad made my mouse slip and I couldn't really move it around at all.  So, I just cut the pad off and use the wrist rest.  The wrist rest is quite comfortable.
its just like any other mouse pad. I thought it would be better for my carpel tunnel but there is no difference
I bought this to replace a Belkin Gel Mouse Pad I've had for years.  It's not made the same way at all.  It's much more stiff and doesn't contain the same type of gel at all.  There is a pointless dent in the middle of the wrist support which does not exist on the original, older product.  I can see now, by looking more closely at the photo, that the dip is accurately portrayed in the photo, but I didn't notice when it just looked so much like the older model.  Not worth sending back, but I wish I could find another *original* Belkin mouse pad.
This mouse pad is functional, but the strong rubber odor rubs off on wrist and is not pleasant for my working environment. . .almost toxic.
The mouse pad is good at first, but after a few months of use, the "gel" is depressed and hard. The "gel" portion does not feel like most gels and has more give than I would prefer, I would guess that this is what caused it to become unusable after a short time.
My old Belkin gel pad, after about 6 years of use, had worn down to the point where the center of the gel wrist rest had developed an indentation that was too low to be comfortable anymore.  I was thrilled to find what looked like an exact replacement online; however, upon receiving the item, I was disappointed.  This product advertises itself as a "gel" pad.  My old one certainly was.  The wrist rest was a gel soft enough to conform to your wrist, but still offer support to keep your wrist elevated.  This new product's wrist rest is made of a much stiffer material, and although you can make a depression in it with your fingers, when you rest your wrist on it, the feeling is as if you were resting your wrist on a hard piece of plastic.If you're looking for the comfort that comes with true gel, this isn't the product for you.  I'll be buying another mouse pad today.
I wanted a gel mouse pad because the memory foam mouse pads don't support your wrist.  However, this mouse pad does not work with my optical mouse  (red laser light).  Odd because I have two other Belkin gel mouse pads and they work fine.  Who would make a mouse pad these days that doesn't work with an optical mouse?
It's more like memory foam with some air injected into the center to simulate the &#34;Gel&#34;. How do I know? I took it apart because it didn't feel the same as expected from a &#34;Gel&#34; pad.
I have used mouse pads with built in gel pads before and found them to be very comfortable.So I was surprised that after some light use I was already feeling discomfort in my wrist, which was a surprise as the whole point of the gel pad is to support the wrist and reduce wrist strain.  I decided that well maybe it was just me and went about my business not wanting to admit to my wife that I bought a boat anchor.  To my surprise several days later she also complained of the same issue, so we turned it sideways and now use it without the gel support.  I went back and checked my son's mouse pad with gel support and found his to be slightly softer and allow more compliance, and made this one seem very stiff in comparison.In summary the mouse pad itself has a good surface and works very well with a Logitech High Performance Optical mouse, just didn't like the gel wrist support, so probably not worth the cost.
This mousepad has a good design firstly. However, my gaming mouse was working very weirdly with it. Periodically its sensitivity would change back and forth and its REALLY annoying when playing FPS.
I have carpal tunnel and this mouse pad isn't very firm on your wrist.  It has a huge dip in it and isn't durable for what is made for.  Price was great, but I'll have to replace it within just a few months of recieving it.
I have not previously used a mouse pad with a wrist rest but thought it might be more comfortable.  It seemed that way at first, but after about a week the raised portion develoved a big dent in it that kind of form fitted the heal of my hand.  Still seemed comfortable enough, but then the bottom of my hand became chaffed and it no longer was pleasent to use.
It was ok at first, but the surface gleen wore off quickly and the wrist rest collapsed down, offering not much support after a month or so
Listen to the people who say that Belkin seems to have changed the way they make these. I have a silver Belkin WaveRest pad that's about 10 years old and it's my favorite mousepad. I bought a black one in 2012, and the wrist rest is a little firmer than the old one, and the pad itself is a terrible mousing surface. My optical mouse will not track consistently. The pointer often gets stuck in one spot, and I have to pick the mouse up and set it back down to get it moving again. The black pad I bought this year was less than $7, so I was willing to gamble. I may try to get another silver one before I decide to give up on this brand.
I have used Belkin gel mouse pads for many years and agree with the reviewers who commented that the latest product feels different. I have owned about 10 of these. The old ones have a white "Belkin" inside a white ellipse at the top while the new one has a silver "Belkin" with no ellipse.The old ones were softer under the wrist, which was better for me. The new one is much firmer, which is both less comfortable for my wrist and makes my hand uncomfortable because it is higher above my mouse.I won't be using the new one because it is just too uncomfortable, and I will be looking for a new brand of mouse pad to try.
Sincerely, I've read a number of comments saying this thing is too hard, and as it is not too expensive, I thought I might give it a try. It is definitely much too hard (is it realy gel inside ? It feels more like dense foam or rubber ...)I don't think I will get used to it as the thing is supposed to take the shape of the wrist and not the opposit. In fact, even after half an hour of use, my right wrist is already slowly getting uncomfortable warm and it seems also that the stiffness of that thing increases the friction on the synthetic surface. So I'm already looking for another real wrist rest...
I've had my mouse pad for a few weeks now and the wrist pad has completely broken down inside.. I might as well throw a block of concrete on my desk and use that..  Would not recommend or buy this product again.
The part I rest my wrist on became permanently compressed very quickly. Is it supposed to?
The wrist pad got flattened in less than 2 weeks.  Still useable but not as comfortable as it was when I started using it.
I desperately needed a mouse pad with wrist support, so I got this.  The actual wrist support is good enough, but the rest is terrible!  The material is all wrong, which means my mouse won't track properly: the pointer will either not move or jump all over.  I ended up keeping it for the wrist support part but using my old mouse pad for my mouse.
I've owned this mouse pad twice before, and I have to say... this mouse pad SMELLS TERRIBLE. And I'm not just talking about the fresh manufacturing chemical smell either. This mouse pad gets dirty and STAYS DIRTY, and smells worse over time! On top of that, the terrible smell will embed itself into your wrist, so you can carry the smell around with you!Even washing this mouse pad in the damned sink with scented soaps ONCE A WEEK doesn't do any good. The same smell just comes back, stronger than ever. And I doubted myself too for a while, saying maybe it's my dead skin cells sluffing off into the material. But when I got my brand new mouse pad this week, I instantly recognized the same damned smell on it.Screw this mouse pad. It just arrived in the mail for me today, and I kid you not, I've already ordered a different one. As soon as it gets her, I'm throwing this piece of s*** out.
One star is for how well my laser mouse tracks and how smooth it is for my pinkie sliding on it.The second star is for the width of the pad, it's just barely enough.Minus 2 stars is for the hard &#34;gel&#34;. And minus the 3 star for the caved in part which is caving in more in just a few weeks.I have to look for another one.
I'm still using a similar Belkin mousepad from around 2005 that is the best mousepad ever made.Sadly, Belkin has switched to a cheaper supplier.The quantity and feel of the Gel in the wrist pad is much reduced so the pad is stiff.The old gel pad was soft and supple.  While its not a "brick" as some have said, its definitely not the gel I'm used to.Still a decent mousepad, but not nearly as good before.  Hopefully it may break in a bit over time, but I doubt it.Why do companies do this crap?You make $0.10 more profit/unit but you lose your customer loyalty.DUMB.
It's a mousepad... How difficult can it be right?The palm rest &#34;deflated&#34; after only 1 day of use.  After 3 days it's almost as uncomfortable as the flat desk it's sitting on.  Don't waste your money on this one..
Neither my Wife or myself liked this and we gave it away to see if they liked it. I don't know why we bought it in the first place, Just trying something new I suppose to see what the big deal was about with these things.
I have had one of these for 10 years, and it has withstood the test of time, all it takes is a little brush of the hand to remove some dust and it's fine. It lays flat, and the gel is still just as dense as it was brand new. I bought this new one and have used it for only a few months, and it already has a huge sag in the pad. The pad is not gel, its some sort of airbag in there. Its literally like the middle bag popped, now it sags in the middle and is firm. I gave it 2 stars because it still helps your wrist, but wow, this thing is garbage compared to the original. Get one that actually has gel in the pad and not air that moves around when weight is put on it. Also, the mouse pad part is flimsy and doesn't stay flat.
As others have mentioned, the padded rest becomes uncomfortable after using the pad for a few minutes.  It is simply too hard.Also, with older MS mice, the pad does not register correctly and is unusable.  With newer mice, this does not seem to be an issue.
I got my Belkin Waverest mousepad today and all I can say is what radioactive vat of toxic sludge did these come from to smell that bad? It smell like a rubber plant or melting new tires. Wow. I will try some of the suggestions to mitigate the odor but clearly Belkin went to the far reaches of the planet when using chemicals to create items that your skin will rest on ... is perfectly acceptable. Personally I feel I should wear a glove.
I thought I would really like this pad because of the gel pad.  Unfortunately, the gel pad, while itself comfortable, sits so high off the ad that it is uncomfortable/awkward to use the mouse because of the downward angle from my wrist up high on the pad to my hand .  down on the mouse below.  I guess I am in the minority since most reviewers like this pad.
I haven't had too much of a problem with this mouse pad, but I have to say it is extremely frustrating that it doesn't track laser mouse as well as it claims. I get better traction on anything other than this mouse pad. I am disappointed to say the least and certainly will not be buying any more belkin products.Feels cheap, and the cheaper mouse pads my cheap employer uses work 10X as well. Ridiculous!/end rant
I've also been buying these for years.  Just to confirm, they have dramatically changed the wrist pad portion of this.  It used to be a squishy but supportive gel, almost similar to the consistency of a thick dough.  Now if feels like a fairly hard foam.  It's not nearly as comfortable.  Really disappointing.One tip - adjust your chair height and the level of your elbow, relative to the height as the surface the mouse is on.  See if it changes the amount of weight you put on your wrist, and where the pressure point is - it may be more comfortable.  For me, I like to have my elbow as high as the desktop that the mouse is on.
I have been using it for 4 months now and the wrist rest is totally depressed in the middle where my wrist rests most of the time. It was in good shape and comfortable when I bought it, but not very durable.
I had seen some of the reviews that stated a problem with using a laser mouse with this pad (and other like it i assume).  Well, they were right.  The cursor might move, it might not.  Frustrating.  I now use the pad to lay my gun on next to the bed.  The pad may work well with a trackball mouse.
I had a similar Belkin product that must have been 10 years old.  It got dusty/grimy over time, and the seam around the wrist pad was separating.  But 10 years is a decent life for one of these, so I figured I'd order another one.Received it this week, but haven't been able to use it for more than a few minutes yet.  It has a very strong chemical/plastic smell.I'm not normally sensitive to that, and the first thing coworkers who visit my office ask is "What is that smell?".So for now, it's been sitting outside a few days to air out and hopefully the smell will decrease.I can't even keep it on my desk, after it sitting outside for 2 days.It is lighter weight than my old model, and the wrist pad is less dense.  Straight out of the package, the corners at the top of the pad don't sit flat on the desk, they're curled up slightly.  Which is weird, since the packaging held them flat.I didn't find the package hard to open, there are pre-cut slits/perforations on the back panel, so you don't have to murder the clamshell to get it open.I expect that the chemical smell will eventually evaporate, and the mousepad will work fine for my purposes.But even if it's a 5 star item, I give it 2 stars due to the "out of box experience" of the smell.[Update: After about 3 weeks, the horrible smell dissipated enough that I could put it on my desk.  After 4 weeks, I still occasionally catch a whiff of it, but it's mostly usable.]
I am just looking for a mousepad with a wrist rest.  Why is this so difficult?  I bought this one just because the non-oval shaped mousepad looks to fit better in the space I have available on my desk.  However, when I tried it out the "waverest" which I am assuming is what we should call the indent in the wrist rest area is strangely uncomfortable.  Like other reviews, it's true that the rest is hard and more like a foam insert rather than a gel insert, but the most annoying thing to me is the indent in the rest which makes positioning my hand feel awkward.  I don't know if I can return it since I opened it, but I definitely plan on getting a different one.
Its comfortable but I really wics it was bigger atleast 6inches all the way around. Its ok for the price.
This is nicely made, but my hand and wrist did not like the wrist rest.  The &#34;gel&#34; pad is too firm for my taste, and it's contoured in such a way that it put too much pressure on my wrist.I threw it away and bought a Fellowes PlushTouch Mouse Pad with Wrist Rest (UPC 043859638802) which I like much better.
These things are not well made. The main problem is the &#34;hump&#34; that the wrist lies on is not well attached to the base. As a result the &#34;hump&#34; becomes disconnected from the base. Mine fell apart within about 8 months (albeit I used it very intensely [i.e., just about every day for a few hours a day]). The problem is that it is poorly glued on. Belkin should have, at the very least, used a better glue. Ideally it should have been stitched or stapled on. That way it would not fall off.
I did so much research into which television to buy that would suit my room.  I settled on this model, and I am so sorry I did.  I had to return the set 2x cause of the crooked picture and the degausser on the 2nd tv  went bad.  It looks tempting and I usually love the trinitron family.  But  BUYER BEWARE on this one.  STAY AWAY! I chose to ignore the other reviews  above when I got the tv and I made a big mistake.  LISTEN TO US!  Stay  away!  I hope I helped.
I have had this TV for about 2 years now and serveral months ago I noticed a problem with the cable we had connected to the TV. After several hours of use the picture would develop wavy lines of static that would eventually make the TV unwhatchable. I've tried switching out the cable box the VCR even the coaxial cable the picture still deteriorates after no more than 5 hours of use. The use of the VCR tends to speed the occurence of the problem and can obliterate the picture in roughly 4 hours. Also when whatching cable TV I have noticed ghosts in the picture. I have tried switching cable boxes with the TV in the other room but the problem persits. I would like to belive that the problem is with the cable but after discussing the matter with several of my chums who were pleased with the cable on the next street I ruled that out.I am disapointed with this TV.
Pluses:  choice of 4 rings, good sound quality. Minuses:  The LCD screen is dim and difficult to read and the battery craps out fairly quickly (yes I did charge it properly)
This player is a great way to organize your CD collection, and its wonderful to have 200 CD's at your fingertips! However, based on my experiences with this player, I wouldn't recommend this player, and here's why:1.) Too many moving parts inside the player. Not only does this make changing CD's very noisy, it increases the likelihood of failure. After owning this model for 3 years with hardly any problems, one day it quit playing CD's. After opening the cabinet, I discovered the problem was a mechanical failure was causing the CD's to not completely fall into place to play. So now no CD's will play unless you manually force them into place.2.) The random function is very poor. Even if you have the player completely filled with CD's, the random function will always choose the same 15 or so CD's. The player also doesn't remember which tracks have already played, so it will often choose the exact same song within a few minutes of each other! With literally thousands of songs to choose from, this is simply unacceptable.3.) When you're filling this player with CD's for the first time, be prepared to invest A LOT of time if you want artist/album details entered. There is no keyboard input on this player. All info must be entered by choosing a letter, pressing enter, moving the wheel to the next letter, pressing enter, and so on. I spent several hours entering this info when I first bought the player. Very tedious.If you own a lot of other JVC equipment, this player may be worth it since its very compatible via the CompuLink system. Everyone else, like me, should move on to something else.
When this unit jammed the first time, I took it in under warranty. Now it is jammed again and I am ready to give it to my local high school eletronics class and get a better one.It also skipped a lot for no reason. Another dissappointment: it cant play a random selection of a particular genre or user group. I am very dissappointed in JVC.
I bought this changer over a year ago to replace a Sony 10 disk that had burnt out.  Figured I'd go with a different manufacturer this time.  BIG mistake.  I have NEVER seen a CD player skip as much as this one.  Other reviewers who have mentioned this know what I mean.  I can put a brand new disk in there and it will skip.  I put the same disk in my cheap portable or my car changer and there's no problem.  A disk has to be completly perfect for this player.  And, like someone else said, it does not like CD-R's.  It will play some just fine, but skip more than not.  This is the LAST JVC CD player I will ever buy, and I'm looking to get rid of it already.  Stay away!
You might consider buying this product if you have a lot of patience and are willing to  sacrifice some time and  effort, which you might not have to do if you purchased a competing machine,  Yes, the price is right.  Yes, the  sound quality is  excellent-crisp sharp highs, great tone definition.  Considering the various features available, most of what you read in  the  other reviews is right on the money,  as far as my experience is concerned.  (I don't understand the  fellow that claimed his machine &quot;creased&quot;-don't know  what that means, but  I've warned my friends not to touch my machine since it might &quot;crease&quot; at any  minute).  Now the downside.  I loaded my discs, and when I played them back, more often than not  tracks were interrupted.  This is most disconcerting.  I tried everything I could  think of-cleaned and re-cleaned every disc; even made some CD-R copies (Yes, it does play CD-R's) under the assumption that a &quot;pristine&quot; disc was what was required.  No luck at all with any  of  those measures.  The tracks continued to be interrupted at exactly the same time/place as before the correction-even on the CD-R.  Now here is my workaround, and  so far it appears to solve the interruption problem.  I have another JVC product, a DVD player which  I have used to play my CD's in the past.  I discovered that when I played a disc containing an interruption on the DVD player-and then reinserted the disc back into the JVC 200 player, the interruption was gone and the machine played normally.  If I had known beforehand that this  problem was going to  occur, I would not have purchased this product.  But  as long as my  workaround holds, I'll stay  with it
Like many reviewers I encountered the apparently fatal skipping problems during playback. They started around the time the warranty expired and only got worse. Very frustrating.Years later, after learning what caused a similar problem with a DVD player (different brand), I discovered a fix. I removed the many CD boxes that I had piled on top of the player. Apparently the weight was too much. It has not skipped since!!Aside from that, the player itself/functions and sound quality are decent. Probably would have been 4 stars.
(I write this review and refer to both the SL-MC4 and it's 110+1 disc counterpart the SL-MC7)I originally bought a Technics mega changer for two reasons:1.  Cool features such as direct disc and track acces from remote AND from the unit itself as well as .2.  The reputation of Panasonic and their Technics line.Well, their reputation is a bit mis-leading.  These units did last past their warranties, but not too long after.  The problems I have had with these include: playing the wrong disc from the wrong slot (example:  I select disc 43, and it plays the disc in slot 42.), and when I would select a track towards the end of a disc, and it would skip at the beginning of that track.  Now, it will barely play to the end of the disc.  At 5 minutes into the last track on a disc, it suddenly skipped back to 4:21.I thought this was maybe just a problem localized in one changer or perhaps one model, but then, the EXACT same thing occured with the SL-MC7.As for sound quality, it is pretty much standard.  Don't expect any &quot;super sound quality&quot;.  Also, I have noticed a significant incompatibility with many CDR's.Like I said before, there are some nice features on these changers, but they're not worth the trouble I've had with these units.  It is best to buy either of these changers only if:A.  You don't use it all that often.  (I listen to music at least 3-4 hours out of a day.)B.  You're using it as maybe a back-up changer or some other temporary use.I give this two stars mainly because I do give Panasonic credit for the features incorporated into these changers.  I wish other companies had direct disc and track access from the unit as well as the remote.
Hmmmm. It seems like a safe investment, doesn't it? Technics. Good company. But I've owned mine for a couple of years, and right from the beginning I've had lots of problems. CD's get stuck frequently, and it is NOT a good cd player overall, as some other reviewers here have mentioned, sometimes brand new cd's will skip terribly, so then you check your new album, and lo and behold...no scratch, nothing. And I too have taken mine to a repair shop, where I was finally told, it simply is not a good player. It's not all bad, but these are considerable problems( and if your cd actually does have a scratch, forget it. It's not worth the aggravation you'll go through skipping tracks, even a minute scratch...), and the pretty blue lights just don't make up for it. Don't say you were not warned...
I was happy with this TV for the first 5 years - but that was the total lifespan of the TV.  After owning the TV for just 5 years, the picture would go blank (sound would stay on) for a few seconds and then come back on for a brief period.  It would do this continiously when it was first turned on, and then after about 1/2 hour it got a little better - it would blank out for a few seconds, stay on for maybe 15 seconds, before blanking off for a few seconds.  After about a month of this, the seconds that we had a picture became less and less.  We hired a repairman to come out who messed around with it for a while and not only made the flashing off and on worse, but totally destroyed the color (the color had been normal and was greys and greens when he left).  The TV was totally unwatchable.  We were told that the picture tube was bad and it would cost $1250 to replace it.  The same TV now sells for under $1,000 (although we paid $1600 5 years ago).  Don't buy - there is no lifespan to this TV
got it repaired 6 months before end of 5 year extended warranty. luckily before good guys went out of business! even with that repair we notice green flare at corners and the black at top and bottom of borders are approaching paralellogram territory. in summary this thing just managed to reach warranty lifetime. makes me think twice about buying more expensive sxrd fearing it will also conk out.
I recently purchased this Panasonic SuperFlat to replace anolder - but superb - 27&quot; Sony Trinitron with a largerscreen. After setup and several days of attempting to adjust and balance the color, I found the Panasonic color system to be significantly inferior to the Sony Trinitron color system. The Panasonic colors are supersaturated. The reds are unusually muddy, the blues and greens very noisy, and the flesh tones annoyingly artificial. I also found the resolution (sharpness) to be poor compared to Sony. I would highly recommend seeing a demonstration of this set in action before purchasing. On the positive side, Amazon.com was amazingly cooperative and helpful in allowing me to return this set and exhange it for a 32&quot; Sony Wega, which I learned the hard way is more than worth the substantially higher cost. Thank you Amazon for such great assistance, understanding, and service.
A small simple keyboard demands a small simple case.  This is **NOT** it.  The two pockets with Velcro closures should have been omitted.  The whole idea of a PDA is that it can be put in a pocket where it's always handy -- and a keyboard (slim to start with) is the kind of thing that should fit into tiny crevices, much like a paperback book slides into a briefcase. The goofy pockets catch on everything, and make the case almost twice as thick.  Also notice that they both face in the SAME direction.  It is especially hard to put rigid items in the 'blind' pocket -- and to get them out -- unless the GoType has already been removed from the main compartment. I have thought about carefully cutting the pockets enirely off the case, but I have hesitated to do so... it seems such a drastic solution...  --  This is a classic case of overdesign with inadequate forethought, and (I'm convinced) no field testing. --
I used this little cam to setup a video conference with my brother for Thanksgiving, and it worked ok. But when I upgraded by computer to Windows 2000 Professional, here's the Ezonics response:&gt; We do not have drivers for the EZcam USB and the Windows 2000  Professional OS. We have no plans at this time to have drivers for the Ezcam USB and the Windows 2000 Professional OS -- EzonicsIf you have Win2K, or plan on installing it, stay away from the Ezonics products.
This is a great idea that fully meets its advertised compactness and convenience. However, the quality of the construction is awful! -- a few wire staples is the sum total of the joinery. If you put more than a few CD's in it, it WILL fall apart. It's easy to drill holes and put wood screws in the corners or screw on a plywood base to hold it together, but if this is beyond your capabilities, you should probably not buy this product.
There is not enough information for this product.need to know how much power or watts speakers can handle. distance away that they will work
I choose the rating because the unit was not in good shape, scratched up and I did not like it,  I gave it away.  Thanks
Bought this for my daughter in Hawaii.  Great way to keep in touch with friends and family, right.  Wrong.  She can get in maybe 8 sentences in an email if lucky and only to certain people.  Friends who have urls other than aol or earthlink are out of luck.  Her attempts at customer service have been fruitless, until she told them she was shipping it back to them.  Then there was all kinds of help, but too late.  Frustrating to her and to us.  Now, it comes back to us to try and get our money back on it.  Didn't get a rebate either.  That's another story.
When I received the product I could not log on for one week and still can't, and six customer service helpers later I still can't get on line and four days later no replacement of the old one as promiesed so next is to contact the big boss of cidco and let him know my problem befor the A.C.L.U finds out a Cancer patient was taken for a ride by a big Company ! Think about it!AS to the Product it is better looking than the Landel mailbug I think !
The unit is basically nice albeit not really full featured if you're used to other computer applications.  The server is busy a significant amount of the time, thus auto dialing misses many connections and apparently there is no auto redial if this occurs.  I tried to set mine up over a weekend...right.  After telling me they would put it on as soon as the computers were back up.  Monday they had no record of my account.  When I confronted them with the password I had been given they said it was for someone else's account...so much for security.The zipper bag (free with 2 yr service) has not arrived.  Yahoo service is still awaiting also.Instructions are poor.  Many times when dialing from a hotel, etc. you need to dial a 9 followed by a pause for an outside line.  No pause symbol is given.  I found on my own, however, the unit does respond to standard modem commands.  Thus  ,=pause and P=pulse  etc etc. So don't depend on the manual for anything too important.A good little unit that needs more support.
Okay for the first couple of days this phone worked great, but after about a week it just stopped working all the time.  Like the machine would ring but the phone wouldnt turn on so i couldnt answer it.  I would wait 5  minutes and then it would work.  The answering machine is the only reason  that i gave this two stars it really only deserves one.  So i dont know  maybe my phone is defective but i would not recommend this phone to anyone.
You may miss from the spec sheet (as I did) that there is no tuner or timer on this machine. The converter works well but you will only use this as a secondary VCR.
First of all, this is an excellent mouse.  The only better mouse for gaming is the Logitech Mouseman Wheel, and it's a close race between the two.At least for a while.After a month, however, the buttons on my IntelliEye mouse began to stop registering clicks and they soon stopped functioning altogether.  Microsoft gladly replaced it for free, so I was okay with the whole ordeal, but unfortunately, after a few more months, the new one suddenly stopped working.  I'll probably consider getting the free replacement again, but if it happens one more time, I'm probably just going to forget about it.If you don't mind having to call and order a free replacement every few months, this mouse is a great buy.  Otherwise, have a look at Logitech's line.
Really useful and fits well with a Plam IIIxe.  BUT it is constructed of cheap material and has split apart twice and cracked in 3 different places.  Get some epoxy if you buy this.
I have never been so frustrated with a piece of electronic equipment in my life.  For the price difference between 'classic' and 'plus', you would  kinda think that you might get more than just a freaking freeze frame.  At  this rate, by the time webtv comes out with more pieces of 'better and  better' stuff, (like a harddrive, or maybe something that does not  give...&quot;this site has info that is not compatible with...&quot;), the  thing will cost $6000.  And, not to mention the monthly access charge,  which will(by then) run about $489.95.
want to email, how about chit chat, watch TV (pip), then buy this unit. Want to write a letter, download ANYTHING etc. etc. then buy a computer for $.... I`ve owned this exact unit now for 6 years and over time its become very unrealiable. Can`t access ALL webpages, (some you can`t even read ) disconnects frequently and is so slow. The only good thing about it is its very easy to navigate, thats why I would recommend it for the elderly. Maybe the kids, but to be computer literate in this computer world, you`re better off buying them a computer so they can learn the right way. NO CHOICE for a cheaper ISP
HP made a pretty decent product but dotn expect too much for your money.  Inother words dont expect an upside surprise.  Im not all too impressed.
I've been using a SCSI Orb on both PC and Mac, and have spoken to a PC USB Orb user. The USB on Win98 seems to be the worst, causing problems with Windows Explorer and crashes, and SCSI on Win98 couldn't reformat a disk  using Castlewood's software. (FDISK worked, God only knows why...) SCSI on  Mac is only usable now that 3rd parties have come out with drivers for Orb,  and Castlewood has licensed a good tools program.Microsoft takes a lot  of flak for Windows being buggy, but the biggest source of problems is  badly written drivers. This time it's not Bill's fault.
I have been a loyal fan of Compaq. I owned 2 desktop presarios, one handheld and one palm size. The Aero has been very disappointing. I bought it May 1999, the internal battery broke Labor day 1999. I cannot recharge  it or even turn it on. The only choice that customer service gave me was to  send it back. I sent it back to Compaq, they gave me a refurbished unit  swapping out my 4-month old unit. The new unit will not sync with my PC.  The reason being that Windows CE recognize that it is another Aero with a  different serial number. I spent more than 10 hours figuring out what to do  and move file by file back to the Aero. Compaq did not restore my data and  their customer support is useless. They just hang up on you when they  cannot answer your question. When I try to turn the unit on in March 2000  (last week), the same thing happened again. I called customer service and  they said the same thing, send it back and they will give me another  refurbish unit. Now I tell them that my warranty is going to expire in June  2000, and they told me that if it happens again, it would be $200 to fix  it. I have not had a problem with the handheld (C-Series) and I do not know  what is wrong with the design of the Aero. I told Compaq that $500 is too  much to spend on something that will only last 1 year and breaks down 3  times. I asked for a partial refund and has been denied. I will think twice  now about buying another Compaq.
These are great for one purpose only: protecting your screen for scratches.  Yes, this is what they are intended for.  However, the limitations on the visibility of the screen are extremely serious.  The  screen looks like a completely different device with and without these  writerights.  I didn't like the idea of cutting them to fit the graffitti  area since I have gotten scratches from dragging things in the viewing  area.The biggest drawback of this product is the price.  The recommend  changing the screen protector once a month but they charge in excess of $30  for a package of 12.  What a rip off!  For a basically a clear and  textured sticker, you're paying a couple of dollars a piece.  Seems way  overpriced!  Especially if you change them at the recommended times.  Unfortunately, there are no competitors that I've seen.  I'd probably give  this 4 stars if the price was better.
I agree with most of the other reviews that this product is more hype than  it is effective.  I have serious misgivings about its claims.  The only one  that I would not have a quarrel is that it protects your screen.  As for  the others they are not what they claim.  One the claims are that it helps  improve handwriting recognition.  I did not notice any difference in  accuracy.  The other is that it helps prevent glare.  This I found  completely unfounded.  The plastic sheet reduces the sharpness of the  display and does nothing to improve glare.  The other issue was that the  sticky plastic sheets are very hard to place on the display and frequently  takes many attempts in order to get it in the correct position.  I would  not recommend this product.
Claims to fit Casio Cassiopeias and other Pocket PC PDAs. Had to cut it to fit my Cassiopeia. It does protect the screen well although it does get marked up pretty quickly. As well it is had to get off cleanly and the put another one on.
I think that it is terrible that Fellows put a label at the bottom of this protector. Protectors are great as long as they are not obstructing the view of the screen. Unfortunately, Fellows didn't think that was very important.Plus the bubbles are really hard to get our, but that is the same problem with all screen covers that I have seen.
I replaced a seven year old VCR with one of these. I wish I hadn't. Tapes that play perfectly in my other older unit will not track in this one. The only reason I bought it was because it has LP recording mode. As soon as I find something else, preferably another RCA or Proscan, this one's outta here
This phone is almost perfect.  It has all the features you might want, is easy to use, and priced reasonably.Unfortunantly, it has the smallest range of any cordless phone I've ever tried.  Even 15 feet from the base station my reception isn't perfect.  At 75 feet it is unusable.Two caveats: I haven't checked the manual to see if there  is a magic incantation that's required to get it to work properly.  I have only played with two base stations and three handsets so I may have just had bad luck.
Prints well, good size, scans, etc., but I completely agree that there's a major design flaw with the paper path.  We've been having the same problem at my small office with multiple pages going through at once.  We've tried a couple of different papers, but it doesn't sound like that's going to help.  This problem doesn't make it unusable, just a constant source of annoyance. Thanks a lot HP.
Initially, this seemed like an excellent purchase.  Solid laser print  quality, particularly with faxes.  Relatively easy set up.  Good print  speed.But after one year of personal (not business) use, a problem  developed with the paper tray . . . it feeds multiple pages at once,  sometimes the entire 30-40 sheets in the feeder bin.  This is a real  problem if you hope to receive faxes while away from home.  Be ready to  look at the cover page only.We tried every type of printer paper,  cleaned the rollers, followed every suggestion in the manual.  Finally, we  buckled down and emailed HP's famous customer service.  That was three  months ago, and we still have not heard from them.  Last week, I called the  service number and was told that since the one-year warranty was up, they  would only help me for a hefty fee.  In a fit of honesty, the service rep.  confided to me that HP has gotten hundreds of complaints identical to mine  and that - even if I paid the fee - there wasn't anything he could do.In short, the paper feeder doesn't work.  And, unfortunately, it ruins  an otherwise strong printer.  HP has treated us so poorly that we're now  looking to replace this &quot;lemon&quot; with a Xerox or Brother.
Great product with lousy reliability. I've had the motherboard and the battery-pack replaced in the last 6 months. I understand that the reliability problems led to Psion dropping the product line. Do thus not buy!
Somehow the 2.5 seconds delay for track switching was the decision of some Exec. that never recorded a tune, songs clumped together is what you get if you don't sit thru the recording session with the remote in hand for 74 min. The &quot;disk error&quot; in  middle of the recording with no apparent reason is another pain, when this happens you can trash the disk because it's useless (can't finalize or continue recording). I've played around with it enough so if one way of recording doesn't work I try another till I get it to do what I want, but nevertheless it's frustrating at times.  Really overpriced and not easy to use for any first timer.  But once the bugs are known I still got some excellent sounding CD's done from all sources. LP's, Old Cassettes, etc...  Nobody mentioned in these reviews but some of the CD's tend to skip for no apparent reason, never in the same place. Has anyone else had this problem?RFinal note do your Research or wait for the 5th or 6th Generation Burners.
We received this VCR as a gift 2 years ago. It worked well through it's first birthday, but now it's already dead (or at least dying painfully). Beginning this past May, it began to "ERR" everytime we tried to do anything...rewind, play, turn it on! When this happens it doesn't respond to anything...no remote buttons, no buttons on the VCR. We have to turn it off and back on again and cross our fingers that it will let us tape our shows. The RCA website was NOT very helpful. Their troubleshooting solution was to unplug it for 15 minutes and plug it back in. We left it unplugged for 2 days and it still has an "ERR". When we called to possibly repair it, the guy said it was most likely a computer problem and we were better off to just purchase a new VCR. The repair on ours was going to be pricey.My mom's Magnovox we bought in the early 1980's still works, but our new VCR is dead after just 2 years! How frustrating!If you need one that works well, but isn't guarenteed to last...this is a good one, but if you need it to work more than a year and a half, you may want to look elsewhere.
The case is exelent for keeping my Jornada HP. It get very well hold to the case by the Velcro. The bad news is that the clip holder to the belt is to weak, made of a fragile plastic that tears appart very easily. The center button, of the holder break appart very soon. I recomend to manufacter to review this design.
I've used my RhinoPack 2000 for an iPAQ, a Cassiopeia and a Visor Prism.  In each case the secure straps did not safely secure my handheld.  Ultimately, I sewed the straps closer to the center and it works much better.  However, imagine having to pay forty bucks and then needing to have sewing skills!  As for the rest of the RhinoPack 2000 its storage capacity is somewhat minimal and it is bulky for everyday use.  It's best use was in my suitcase on vacation.
In short - too big and too flimsy to really be considered adequate.I read lots of reviews on this case ..., both positive and negative, and took the plunge and bought the Rhino 3000 PDA case.  There are better options for the same price (see the Handspring folio module case).The main gripe - it does not hold your PDA safely.  In fact, nothing is safe from falling out once you unzip it.  Every time I open it - I have pens, batteries, PDA's falling out.  I will say this - the keyboard stays in pretty good.On the positive side - it is a huge case and holds lots of stuff.  I could even stick my phone on the side pocket and carry a PDA, keyboard, phone and a bunch of other stuff.But it's not worth it - not when there are other cases out there for the same price.And what about all those hooks 'n stuff on the outside.  What are they for?Beware.  There are  better cases out there if you have to carrying a keyboard with your PDA.  Sorry Rhinoskin . . .
After 4 days use, I have to agree with criticsms seen elsewhere about the elastic straps used to hold the PDA in place. With a Jornada 568, and with the screen cover attached, the straps quickly become "stretched and sloppy". Who wants to use velcro patches on the battery pack. This product needs a serious re-design!The Rhino 1100 will make a handy accesory case, but I wouldn't trust an [expensive] device in it. GripGear Designs  makes a superior case, although it is 1.5X the price.
This case has a couple of things going for it: the extra pockets are very nice to have, the construction is solid and the materials are a nice alternative to leather. My main problem with this case is that it doesn't do it's job which is to carry and protect the device inside. The elastic bands lose their pull within a week, and when your device is under them it's very hard to use. Even when the elastic was fresh my Handspring wouldn't stay underneath them.In short, the decision to use elastic bands to hold the PDA are a design flaw that for me killed an otherwise great case. Avoid this one.
Do you really want to order a product that has gotten very mixed reviews  from a company that just went bankrupt?summary: Good idea. Poor  execution. BANKRUPT COMPANY
To be brief this product is great in concept but as most have posted  already the range is limited.  However my biggest complaint is that you can  not access the voice mails directly off the computer.  The only way you can  access the voice messages is through the handset.  This is not acceptable  in today's world.  The product is nice in concept but in actuality it is as  if the engineers were in a hurry to bring a product to market without  fine-tuning.  Bottom line I returned the phone set.  My suggestion to the  Swedes at Erickson is improve the product were you can dial directly out of  Microsoft Outlook because until you can do that this program is a toy.  Secondly have complete transparency so that you can open your voice mail on  the computer and listen to it as well as dial from the computer.  I don't  need a second contact list on my computer one is enough.  Also make the  product compatible with third party phone systems.  Any phone should work  with this product.  My advise is wait tell the product is upgrade if you  are a consumer.
Do I need to say more?  Handsets last six months to a year.  Speech engine has it's fair share of problems with any kind of background noise.The quality just isn't there.  I further understand that the company is out of business.  Doesn't really matter much because they never answered the phone and the website was never available.
I bought this from Office Depot when it first came out.  The biggest problem was the display for Caller ID doesn't show the Name.  Its no convenient since I have $90 Sony and Panasonic cordless phones that have NAME and NUMBER on the handset...  I called Cygnion and they blamed the phone company.  My patience wore thin and I returned it.  Bought the 2.4 gig Panasonic and it does all that I need....
We have been using the CyberGenie Phone system for about one month.  We are using it in a shop office of a moderately large manufacturing company.  I have purchased the phone with two extra handsets and have installed it  using two analog extensions of our digital PBX system.  While there are  some improvements I would like to see, everything is working.  The range of  the handsets are not impressive and I find that if I am going to be out of  the area I have to take my standard cordless phone to pick up calls.  This  is a hassle and if not for the other features would be cause for its  return.The features that I couldn't find in any other phone (except the  joke Microsoft phone!) is its ability to log calls.  We are using the  CyberGenie to give our nightshift personnel the ability to have  communications with the "World" but allow me the ability to monitor abuses  (the only way upper-management would allow a cordless on the shop floor).These are the shortfalls to this phone system that are not evident in  the "fluff" and "hype" of the manufacturers review:Range:  We are using  these phones near high power laser cutting machines.  The base station is  raised to the ceiling of the office.  The range is about a 30-40 ft radius.  Even the cheep cordless 900mhz is able to blow that away.Ringer:  The  ringer even at the loudest setting is not very loud.  I have compensated  for this by having it play one of the available jingles for its ring.  This  allows more time and the alternating tones sometimes will get through the  noise.  I have missed several calls even so.Support:  Pitiful to say the  least!  While I got immediate assistance on the phone the person could not  solve the problem.  An engineer was scheduled to complete the problem  solving.  During the WEEK it took to get a call back I solved the problem  myself.  Be prepared to reload software... that's the phone supports extent  of assistance.The advantages are:  Voice activated dialing.  Ability to  secure the phone via passwords.  Ease of setup and ability to attach to an  existing Microsoft Outlook database.If you can live with the  disadvantages of this phone then it is a nice package, full of features and  worth the money.
On the outside, this looked like a great product. The published range was up to 900 feet; however, when used in fairly friendly conditions, [inside a wood frame home] the max useable range was more like 80 feet - what a  dissappointment. When trying to work with the technical assistance, they  had only minimal suggestions and finally said  &quot;tough luck&quot;. I  don't think they know what they are doing. I will wait for further  developments and perhaps things will improve.
The only thing good about this unit is the sound quality. We've tried 3 cassette tapes in it and it ate all of them. It does not have a digital tuner so if you're changing the radio to a different station you don't know for sure if you have the station you were looking for until you listen awhile. It also does not come with a template for drilling the holes in your cupboard. I made one out of cardboard and everything matched up the first time but I easily could have messed up and had to drill extra holes in my kitchen cabinet.
Not for group or public use.Our set is set up in our front lobby, and we have jokers who come by, turn on the set, play with the controls until they are in the menu, and then we have to call in a repair  technician to get the set back into factory settings.The setup for this TV is not user friendly, P52921, and the menus are hard to read, easy to get lost in, and a pain to return to use.Next is obtaining the user manual from the RCA Website.  Need the manual for that too.Finally is the price.  I have priced several LCD HDTVs at far less than $1400.00
I first purchased this tv and was impressed with the Guide Plus feature.  Everything worked great until about 3 months into owning it.  The picture tube wend out.  It was replaced(under warranty) and had no problems until about 2 years later.The sound went out.  It was completely gone.  At that point my warrnaty had just expired.  There was nothing RCA could to for me.  so I unplugged it and set it aside and used my older Sharp TV (which has NEVER given me any problem in my 10 years of owning it, but the way)  I finally found someone strong enough to help me get it to the tv repair shop when he asks "what's wrong with it?"  I explain the problem, plug it in to show him...and guess what, mysteriously enough it worked again.Then I guess it would be 2 years after that I am watching TV, or the TV was watching me.  The picture starts to flicker. I turn around, it stops.  Tthen within 5 min it does it again.  this time it flickers, then pops, I smell smoke, hear a fizz and the picture is gone.  It has been unplugged for about 2 months now.  To my dismay it doesnt mysterioulsy work when plugged in.I am not sure If I just got a 'lemon'.  I have had the worse luck with this tv than any other electronical appliance in my home.  I will not be purchasing anymore RCA products in the future.So now I am back to using my trusty reliable sharp 25" TV(again!).  works like a charm. No complaints. I think my next TV purchase will be another Sharp.
It's the year 2001 And we have lots electronic ablities. LET'S USE THEM!! I only gave the item 2 stars because it has the look of 2001, but as most of us should know looks aren't everything. If we have these tecnoligies we should use them. Why didn't you put color? Why not put black and white? Well most people these days I would say would enjoy siting down with a bowl of popcorn and watching a good movie on tv. (In color) People like it better because you can see more details. Like what kind of day it is. And what a beautiful blue (Color) the ocean looks today. I don't know about the rest of you, but from my point of view this item gets 2 stars.
The TV was shipped quick and the packaging was in good condition.  Unfortunately, there was a noticeable defect in the cabinet just below the screen.  I contacted the manufacturer and was told cosmetics are not covered by the warrranty.
I wouldn't admit this anywhere else but I am a bit obsessed by cordless  headset phones. I have more variations than I will reveal, but suffice it  to say I have basically tried enough to lead a product development team. My  experience with this unit was at a Best Buy but I didn't have to plug it in  to find its problem. First, there is no reason to put a key pad one the  headset. 1) it makes it very bulky, 2) you can't use it to dial when you're  on it (say for voice mail, getting though to your visa card) and 3) you  look like a bigger fool than is necessary (there is a certain cost of entry  for wearing a headset, but this one goes far beyond the call). That there  is a key pad to on the base to mitigate this problem only ads insult to  idiocy -- why did I buy a cordless headset to begin with?  There are  pretend cell phones for children with better usability design.You can  get the best units for less. Amazon carries the Plantronics CT-901 which is  a great unit for the price ($40). Though not digital (range about 150 ft)  it is very comfortable -- you forget that it is on your head, which is the  idea. This company makes about 70% of the call center versions and it  shows. There are a few other units by Plantronics (the famous c-10) with  superior features but they haven't made it to Amazon yet. My fingers are  crossed.
It's just impossible to hear people well on the headset.  I'm a reporter and I need to hear every word. There are some people I can barely hear at all.  This seems like a rather basic function for a telephone!  If I could return this phone, I would.  The other quibbles are minor - yes the headset is bulky, etc., but I would be happy to deal with that if the manufacturer had put enough thought into it to have a reasonable volume switch on the headset.  Or is there someone out there who knows something I don't know about adjusting the volume?
This card is OK if all you do is play quake 3. If you decide on playing other OpenGL or Glide games, this is terrible. When I got it, i could not play Unreal Tournament on it, one of my favorite games, due to lack of Rave  and Glide support. The so called AntiAliasing is TERRIBLE. There are still  plenty of jagged lines when you play. This is why i returned it and bought  a Voodoo 5. I expected much better from nVidia. I guess 3Dfx wins this  match.
Plextor has an excellent reputation for making quality CD drives. This model is their first IDE unit. I was unfortunate to receive a defective model. First clue was an occasional soft grinding sound when inserting a CD. Another significant symptom is that several times now, the unit locks  up completely while trying to erase a CDRW, had to reboot to even eject CD.  Also discovered this unit will not run under Easy CD Creator 4.02 nor  4.02c. It will run under 4.01. Not sure if this is just my defective unit  or if problem is systemic. After launching 4.02, CD read speed drops to  less than 1X, must close 4.02 and reboot to restore normal CDROM  operations. Have already upgraded to Plextor firmware 1.07, but also had  same problems with 1.05. All problems existed with Win98 SE, Win2000, and  Win Me.
...you might've expected more from Targus. Perhaps this works fine with the Palm devices, but with pocket PC's (at least the Aero 1550)...no way! For starters, it's got an uncomfortable security rail for the Palms, which gets in the way of your Pocket PC. But most importantly...once you get your PPC, credit cards, money, check book, receipts, etc. you end up with a non-practical bulky huge case which is hard to fit almost anywhere. I mean...I use it for traveling, but on a daily basis, I rather use the simple case that came along with my PPC
I have to agree with the 'Awful Warranty' comments below. I had my Aero in my front pocket all day and sometime during the day my screen broke. Compaq also quoted me $185 to have it repaired. If only I had seen the other  review before purchasing this! Other companies like Handspring replace a  PDA screen for free the first time it's damaged. Overall, it's a great  product combined with a disgraceful warranty. Beware!
It worked for three days and then the video stoped.  All I got was sound when playing a video tape.  The on screen programing could be viewed, but no video from tapes.  I would not recommend.  I returned it and I'm still looking.  Good luck!
The minute I took it out of the box I had my doubts.  The case is made of flimsy, superlight plastic.  &quot;But it's what's inside that counts.&quot; I told myself, &quot;after all it's a Sylvania&quot;.  Ran  okay for a couple days, then just snow, no picture.  This was especially  disappointing as the hi-fi sound was discernably better than my old mono  sets, and the light up remote was a real nice touch.  I had high hopes for  this unit--despite miserable performance, I liked enough things about to  almost consider buying another one, in fact, I had ordered another just  after getting this one--will probably try it out real well before I decide  whether or not to keep it.
I've had this television for less than a month and I already have problems with the picture. I'm getting an annoying pinkish blotch of discoloration on the right side of my screen. be wary of buying this one. I myself should have taken the negative reviews into consideration. Do yourself a favor spend the extra cash on a better TV.
The Clio was a good idea, but doesn't meet expectations. The passive matrix screen is difficult to read. The keyboard is small and curved making touch-typing difficult. The unit itself is a bit heavy and ackward to lug around compared to some of the latest (and smallest laptops). With a max resolution of 800x600, images and video look cheap. There are NO output ports on the unit itself - you have to hard-link to a computer even to print! No VGA-out for use with a projector. Not even a PS-2 or USB port! The handwriting recognizer works about 3/4 of the time. That is, in a page of handwritten notes, you'll have to manually correct about 1/4 of the page. It does slightly better on single words or sentences. My recommendation: Take the [amt] that you'd spend on the Clio and add to it the [amt] you'd spend on a Pocket PC and buy a decent laptop.
I bought this about a year ago and love the color and simple look. However, my Palm V slips out of it frequently and the front cover bumps against the buttons of my Palm when it's in my purse. This causes the Palm to start beeping and clicking, which is very annoying.  Overall, it's like most of my shoes -- stylish looking and kind of expensive, but not real functional.
This flash memory card offered good storage capacity per dollar (about $1 per Meg) and works fine in my camera (a Kodak 4800 that I had used with Kodak 16 Meg and Viking 32 Meg cards), but when I tried to download the pictures to my iMac, all hell broke loose. I get error messages saying that there is not enough memory to download the thumbnnails, but no amount of memory reallocation seems to work, and the problems I have been getting are nonreproducible. The person at the Kodak help line was sympathetic but said he could not solve the problem with a non-Kodak product. They offered to transfer my 250 pictures from the Sandisk onto a CD-rom for free once, but I can't do this every time I use the darned card.SanDisk offers no troubleshooting help line.I wish I'd bought a Kodak or Viking card now. Sandisk is also chintzy not providing a plastic protective disc container, as others do.
They look nice, fit the slot perfectly, have a screwdriver and a reset pin... perfect except that the plastic tip seems to be harder than other stylii. Admittedly, I press pretty hard when I write -- but these are the first stylii I've used that leave visible, permanent scratches on the screen! If you write with significant pressure, avoid these or risk damaging your Visor.
If you have VHS tapes recorded in Stereo on the Linear tracks this VCR will only play them back in Monaural sound. All pre-recorded VHS tapes recorded in HiFi Stereo also contain a Stereo Linear track on the edge of the tape. This unit can not default to the Linear Stereo. It will only play the linear track back in Mono. This unit also does not have an LP Record mode.
When I recived the Sumdex &quot;travel&quot; wallet I decided to return it that same day. The wallet, depite how it looks in the picture, is *huge*. I was hoping for something that would fit in the purse I currently carry, and this doesn't. The PDA slot is big enough for almost two, it's stiff, and just plain large. Look for something else unless you are looking for a purse replacement.
My son and I are very disappointed and we feel like the advertising is very misleading.  I bought this organizer for my son as a b'day present.  Since it is listed under electronics, and all of the pictures show an electronic organizer included, we thought that's what we'd get.  Well, needless to say, there is no electronic organizer.  I wonder how many other people were just as mislead as we were; or is it just us?
It's cute, i don't like the plastic one the palm V comes with so i like the idea of a replacement stylus, but this just isn't the one.  For the same price, the Chameleon stylus looks very similar with a metal barrel and better tip as well as has a pen on the other side.This one looks good, but doens't have much else going for it.
The major problem with this unit is that the top is always a little bit loose and needs to be tightened once in a while.Bottom Line: Not really necessary to dig into your pocket to buy this one. It's about the same as the original stylus came with the palm unit.
The Panache stylus may look good but it has 2 problems:  1) It rolls off the table. 2) It sticks out way too much.There's a much better stylus out there from Pentopia: the Chameleon Visor stylus - T11FV  This is made especially for the Visor.  I can't believe that Amazon and many other places aren't even selling this one.  It is really nice.  It has a reset pin plus a pen inside.  The tip is EXACTLY like the one from PDA Panache, but the design of the stylus is a lot better.Advantages: 1) It does not stick out.  2) It has the ridges at the end (just like the original stylus that comes with the visor) so it is easy to remove from your handheld.  3) Because it is wedge-shaped like the original visor stylus at the upper end, it won't roll off the table.  4) It is very light.  5) the cost is the same...
The reason I decided to buy the OmniRemote for my Visor was that I had lost most of my remotes for my electronics on a move recently, and I thought this could replace them all quickly and easily. To my disappointment, I soon realized that all original remotes were needed to program this module.  So I ended up having to go to Wal-Mart and buy another universal remote, program it using the included codes, and use that Universal Remote to program the OmniRemote. What a waste of time, effort and money. The Sony Universal remote I bought was much easier to setup and use, it costed about 75% less, and none of the original remotes were neccesary because a list of manufacturers codes was included. Why the OmniRemote doesn't include such a list of codes is beyond me. The OmniRemote is only a wise buy if you already have all your remotes and you don't want to keep any of them on your coffee table.
I used to have this same unit under the brand name "Emerson Research"  It's a pretty good unit, but it's a very old model.  For the price, you can get a much more modern one from Emerson Research at a local store.
It's almost there.  Personaly I'd like to be able to store the ZIP disks  __with__ their boxes.I'm still looking for something better  though.
My MiniJam has crashed my Visor Handspring Platinum several times (any time I select &quot;Playlist&quot;, for example), and when I asked Customer Support, was told that &quot;a software release is scheduled for today, but as of my last check it hasn't been posted.&quot;Also, it doesn't work when your PDA has gone into sleep mode, requiring you to stop in your tracks, turn it back on, futz with the stylus, and then operate the MiniJam controls if you want to adjust the volume, skip a track, etc. The MiniJam is really nice to work out or just walk around with, but it sure needs a helluva upgrade.
Good news -- This TV is very reasonably priced for the size.  It could save much space in our kitchen.  The under counter bracket has a much wider turning angle than some competitive units.  Picture is bright and reception is good.  Sound is adequate - better than some small units.  The FM receiver is a great added bonus!Bad News -- Connected to an antenna instead of cable the UHF channels show the wrong channel number.  Some TV's have a setting to correct this.  The FM tuner doesn't search automatically or save channel settings.  Thus, it is not convenient to use with more than one channel.  These are both very minor short comings that can easily be ignored.  Unfortunately, the TV emits a very annoying high pitch noise that my 16 yr old son can easily hear.  It is probably the horizontal scan mechanism radiating noise at 15,750 cycles per second.  For this reason we are regretfully returning the TV.
This Tv would be great if all I was going to do was watch tv. unfortunately not. I needed a small cheap TV for my dorm room to hookup my playstation 2. Unfortunately no audio/video inputs. So now i have to buy an adapter, and that means worse quality.
I bought this radio mainly to listen to television while working.With some effort we can find the station but listen to them is not easy.You have to use full volume and this mean low volume to your ears. I have tried others radios and brands with the TV sound feature and they all work poorly. Perhaps a Digital one can deliver more volume but they are expensive. At the price I recoment this PHILIPS since if you are in a quiet room it may be useful.Mario.
A little less than five years ago I bought an AsanteTalk bridge for my LaserWriter 360, and it worked flawlessly until yesterday when it failed completely.  Because the company proudly and loudly boasts a LIFETIME WARRANTY on the product (for original purchasers, of course, not for refurb'd models) on its website, in its support forums, and on other vendors' sites, I thought I'd have no problem getting it replaced right away.WAS I EVER WRONG!All of a sudden the supposed LIFETIME WARRANTY has become a FIVE YEAR WARRANTY . . . and calculated from the date of manufacture, not from the date of purchase!  Something is very wrong here, folks, and based on the treatment I've received over the past 24 hours, I would strongly recommend avoiding this company.
I decided to purchase a Body Glove case for my Palm, because it seems to me good enough to protect the PDA. However, it fall from my hand to the floor by accident, with the PDA inside; it hits the ground by the side, and broken a teeth of the zipper. Now it's hard to close or to open the case. I think that the use of a plastic toooth zipper is a bad disign because those broken easily. Now, after one week of enjoy the protection&quot; I have a hard time open and closing the case. I do not recommend this product, or maybe you will need to get a zipper protector letter. I strongly recomend to Body Glove designer to change the zipper for a metallic tooth zipper.
Good overall picture but out of the box needed service right away could not get picture convergence proper with the auto focus system.
I am baffled by the glowing review, below.  The case exhibits the following deficiencies, any one of which would be enough to recommend against it:When the m100 is in the case, you cannot access the stylus, unless you have a third hand (one to hold the case, one to peel back the rear of the case, and one to extract the stylus.  [This, of course, is a consequence of Palm's ill-considered decision to place the stylus at the rear of the unit.  What were they thinking?]The m100 must be forced into the case with great effort.There is a thick plastic sheet (reminiscent of a spill-proof furniture slipcover) positioned over all of the buttons, interfering with the tactile feedback they provide.When the m100 is in the case, it is difficult to insert and remove the HotSync cable, as the case's seam partially occludes the slot.Avoid it.
One of the reasons I selected the Palm Vx was for its slender and streamlined style.  I liked the way it fit comfortably into my coat pocket without adding too much bulk.With slots for credit cards and businees cards this case represents a great concept.  However, after filling each of slots with credit cards and adding some business cards, the case became so bulky that it defeated the entire purpose of owning a streamlined Vx.Also, I found the loop closure very cumbersome and inconvenient.
I wrote a glowing review about the Toshiba 27A50 but have since had a problem with poor warrany service.  I had to return the 27A50 to the company for full refund after four months of trying to resolve the situation. I am sorry to say considering the problems,I doubt that I would purchase another Tosiba product.
Let me start by saying that the Toshiba I now have is excellent.  My first TWO sets, however, had issues.  The first emitted a high  frequency hum (squeal to be more precise) which made viewing a miserable experience, and the second had severe picture problems.I went through the company's warranty to fix both problems, and after having the televisions out of my house for a total period of six weeks out of three months, I finally received the set I now have.During this period, Toshiba reps claimed: that the only person that should be able to hear the sound would be my wife because women hear higher pitched sounds, that since I already had one television replaced that they would not replace another regardless of warranty, that the problems were caused by me or made up, etc.  All these claims without even looking at the television.  Their servicing agent was miserable.Overall, this was a bad experience to say the least, and although I'm not willing to say that I would never buy a Toshiba again, one should think about their actions before buying.
We received our Toshiba 36A40 shortly before the holidays. After spending most of the day on the phone trying to get through to Toshiba, a technician will be coming to pick it up from our house this afternoon. An overall beautiful picture is marred by several &quot;dead&quot; pixels and a strange, persistent ripple effect in two areas of the screen that are distracting during bright scenes. I'm not too thrilled, since moving this VERY heavy monstrosity in and out of the entertainment center causes damage to the wood each time. The service center says they've had several of these units come in over the past several weeks...and it will be a few weeks before we get the TV back, depending on parts availablity. Ugh.
This Replay unit is a great idea, but the execution falls far short to make this a recommended item.  I have the usual home theater set-up, big screen TV, DSS, DVD, and LD; I connected my over the air antenna and the DSS to the Replay unit.  The basic idea, for those that don't know is as follows:  the Replay is at its core a computer.  It has a modem that it uses to dial out every day to obtain programming information from a central network (in the Replay's case it is free, while for Tivo there is either a monthly charge of 10 dollars or a flat fee of 200 dollars).  It also has a hard-drive that is used to store the programming that is being recorded.  Being a digital process, there is no image degradation after repeated viewing, although it is conceivable and probable that the hard drive will eventually fail and thus render all the recordings unviewable.  Since it is a computer, the Replay unit can search programming, keep a running schedule of shows to record, etc., making TV viewing a more pleasant experience, because it allows the viewer to set his or her own schedule to watch TV.  It also records the channel that the viewer is watching &quot;live.&quot;  Therefore, the viewer can &quot;rewind&quot; the &quot;live&quot; show, pause it, etc.  Sound neat, but the problem is that there are two main alternatives right now, and Replay is the inferior choice.Let me start by saying that I have tried by Tivo and Replay, and although they both share many shortcomings, I prefer the Tivo hands down.  First for the shared shortcomings: 1) Using a DSS system, one cannot watch a program and record another, because neither the Tivo nor the Replay stand-alone models have built-in DSS receivers. 2) Channel surfing is slow because both devices send in either IR signals or use the serial interface to send the channel information to the DSS receiver, so that instead of sending &quot;channel up&quot; it sends &quot;channel 192&quot;Now, the Replay is inferior to the Tivo in a couple of major points.  First, the remote is very badly designed.  There are lots of small buttons cluttering the lower half of the remote, and the major cursor control buttons are these thin curved rectangles that feel uncomfortable to press.  Further, in order to move up and down channels, one has to repeatedly press the buttons, since pressing and holding a button will not result in continous movement.  In other words, if one presses &quot;Down&quot;, the cursor will move one step down, and stay there, regardless of whether the user is still pressing the button.  In most other consumer electronic devices, holding a button will continue the command, so that if one presses &quot;Down&quot; in a TV remote, the channel will change, and continue changing.  Now, this might seem to be nit-picking, but if one considers that the usual DSS line-up consists of over one hundred channels, one can see that hand strain is going to be a big problem for Replay users.  Furthermore, in order to search programming, one must enter the complete search word.  For example, if one wants to record Politically Incorrect, one must enter either &quot;Politically&quot; or &quot;Incorrect&quot;, or &quot;Bill Maher&quot;.  In the Tivo, entering each letter provides a list on the right of programming that starts with those letters - but the Tivo is a lot slower than the Replay, because it has to continuously update the list after every letter.All in all, Tivo has a better looking interface, a remote that is hands down superior in terms of ergonomics, and it is easier to locate programming that one wants to watch.  One caveat is that the Tivo is extremely time consuming to set-up - in my case it took over 12 hours for the machine to be ready to go - my advice, start the set-up at night, and when it has to download the programming for the first time, turn off the TV and let it cook overnight.  The Replay is very quick in comparison, taking about an hour.  This review does not mean to say that the Tivo is a perfect device.  It has shortcomings, but currently, it is the better of the two.
I thought I could just copy the existing hard drive onto a 250GB drive and use it that way, turns out, this is not compatible with anything newer then windows 98. I ended up having to format the drive and install NASlite on it. now it works great, but it's not something your average user would do.
I bought the Mitsubishi  VS50707 Gold analog Projection TV last week on word of mouth on how good Mitsubishi TV's are.Ouch! Should have went with a Magnavox. Cheaper and better  in my opinion. Had one for 7 years and just sold it to get a new TV. The tubes were aging of course - but I thought it had a better picture than my new $2000.00 Mitsubishi! Sure, the overall picture is good. Close-up shots a great! But watching sporting events - one of the main reasons for getting a new TV now - long distance images were terrible! Can't make out Shaq's face! Football season is going to be a drag! Volume control from shows into commericals - look out! It's REALLY loud! Watching analog TV of course you'll see those lines. Wasn't as bad with my previous TV. Even with the tinted protection screen. Customer support on the problems - not good.Going to try and sale it and get a Magnavox. Still got time before Football season starts!
This is a good product - but why not wait until it isreasonably and realisticly priced?You can buy a gameboy color for [less] and  there are about 1000 games for it. This is nothing more than a piece of plastic.If you choose to spend the money then yes it does make games a little better, not all that though.
The Seiko Smartpad is advertised as working with all Palms higher than the III. I have the IIIC.  It does work, however the 4 X zoom feature does not work, and when you enable it, it says &quot;go to our website to see if there is updated software, the 4X zoom does not work with the Palm IIIc&quot;.  There is not a patch for the Palm IIIC yet.  Also, Seiko's customer support is awful, so if you want no support, this is the place to go!
Despite claims to the contrary, this model DOES NOT deal well with CD-R's or enhanced CD's.  I make compilations constantly, and these homemade compilations play on all machines but my Harman Kardon FL 8380. Other irritants include the fact that it takes forever to turn on, and it then must cycle through every CD in the machine before allowing you to play music.  This cycling happens even after you replace a disc.  After a disc is through playing, it returns to that disc if you've opened the machine during the time that disc is playing. The sound is terrific, but the other factors override the sound for me.  I will be replacing this machine even though I've only owned it for 6 months
I use this to play video games, it's pretty good to use but the sound is just horrible! There is this buzz while playing, not a very reliable tv.  The picture is good, all the inputs are there, overall an ok tv. Beware of sound if you really care for it.
I bought this for my mother. It isn't very simple for a non-computer person to use and understand. Connecting it to an "average" t.v. gives a yucky picture, as far as the clarity of trying to read the text. It is considerably slower then a computer...maybe it is my mother's phone line? It also makes a grinding noise....usally at night. :( I added a printer to it for her and every time she has to unplug the AOL TV (due to the grinding noise)...the printer has to be reinstalled. I added her to my AOL account, so I was ONLY charged 15 dollars more a month. If she were to get her own account....it would be 25 dollars a month. Personally, I think that is a racket! The monthly fees should be MUCH lower for those that already have an AOL account. Cidco is only 10 dollars a month....and even cheaper if you pay by the year! I did eventually put my mother on her own account.....long story. She was SUPPOSED to get a month and/or 1000 hours free. NEVER happened! I called AOL support....and well, I have nothing good to say about AOL's support. I am sure you are wondering why I stay with AOL if it is soooooo stinky? :) I have been with them for sooo many years that I really can't change my e-mail address now. By the way, if you take the surveys offered on AOL or use AOL Visa to where you earn points towards free AOL.....you can't use the points if you have an AOL TV and "regular" AOL account. Back to the Cidco 100 e-mail......I did buy one of those later. It is cheaper and a LOT easier to use. Just plug it into your phone line...use AC or DC for power and you are all set. I have had no problems with busy signals (they have added a new 800 number) and no problems with their customer service. If all you are truly interested in is e-mail...Cidco is a much easier and better product.  Cidco also has an address e-mail book...whereas AOL TV does not.
