This cover provides basic protection. The stand functions OK but can slip if not positioned in the slot correctly. I was looking for something solid to protect the device and this gives me that.
I am a tangle devotee and it pains me to say this but I had very high expectations for this book and I was quite disappointed.  Why?  No question that the examples and featured artwork is spectacular. I was really hoping for more how-to information and some guidance.  In that way, this little book was a letdown.  Really not substantive at all as an instruction book.The mandala format has unlimited potential, no doubt about that.  But it's best not to expect any step-by-step stuff from this attractive book.
beautiful but difficult to use. She suggest for you to buy a template for some other place. I don't use this book often.
I just "discovered" tangles (zentangle) and was excited to see it incorporated with mandalas.  So when I went to purchase a book and saw this one, I ordered it too.I was surprised to find typos in this published book.  I've gotten use to seeing them in kindle's inexpensive/free ebooks.. But I didn't expect to see some of the silly ones I found here: hanging comma's (cover), half of a word (p 16).I confess to having stopped reading after noticing these, choosing instead to just look at the pictures and scan the text.  We all make mistakes.  But it's my opinion if you are asking for someone to pay money for something, it should have all the "i"s dotted, "t"s crossed... have someone take a second, third and fourth look at it before sending it off to the publisher.  Yes, I know some get through, but this is a 50 page book that has more pictures than words.. seems like 15 minutes to have a few extra sets of eyes go through it wouldn't be a bad idea.There are some lovely mandalas. But like another review said, they are all already finished works. I was hoping to find more about the process of creating the mandalas and how to combine it with tangles. I did find the snowflake idea to be ingenious!There are lots of patterns and nice layout on how to create those patterns, for which I was happy to see. This alone meets the main requirement I was looking to get out of a couple of tangle books.One more thing I felt disappointed to see... on p. 49 Good Luck - Hex Symbols, I was very surprised to see a Mercedes sign depicted as a Peace sign. They are most definitely two different symbols.. If this is wrong, what else might be wrong too.  This may seem a petty complaint to some, but I find it very annoying.  Just last year I found a knitting pattern for a bag with four giant Mercedes symbols on the front and it was being sold (yes, sold) as a Peace sign bag.  If people aren't corrected, they continue passing along false information.I'm not sure if I'll keep the book just for the patterns or if I'm going to send it back and get another zentangle book.  Right now, I'm leaning towards sending it back.  I want a book (or a few) so I can sit on the couch, or propped in bed, or at the coffee shop and doodle away, without being tied to my computer for ideas.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can get past the silly typos and the Peace sign issue.This is of course, personal perspective on this book and for others they may absolutely love it. It does have lovely finished mandalas, some bits of good info in creating your own, and decent patterns.  YMMV
I was hoping for a little more about mandala design in this book. They spend a full-page spread each on how to divide a circle into successively larger integer numbers of equal pie wedges (which is something anyone who either took any high school math or knows how to use google could figure out easily enough). But there are some beautiful pieces of art and some nice tangle patterns in there, too, so I did enjoy looking through it for general inspiration. I was just hoping for something a bit more in depth about mandalas.
Found the basic tutorial easier to follow and use.  Perhaps because I'm not advanced, these advanced topics moved too fast.  Also, a lot of the focus on print wasn't as important to me as focusing on how to use the camera to get print-worthy images.
Great concept but the device needs lots of work. I know it is not expensive but I believe it needs work. I am happy to pay the money if it has some options. First, no screen or anything to tell you anything, just flashing colors in specific order. Really, in 2013? My mobile phone Nokia x2 is not supported but I think that was my mistake as I did not read the specs/supported device list. I thought you can save the data from different mobiles to this one then add it a new one. Nothing on the manual about that....No firm ware update...I am just happy that it is not expensive..
I ordered this for my husband. The first time he used it the "retractable" part of it quit working. The good news is, it does charge his cell phone and it was very cheap, so it wasn't worth sending back for a replacement. Still, if you are looking for a charger that is really retractable, look elsewhere.
that connector doesn't match an Equinox.  You're talking about the cell phone, right?  Yeah, either that picture is wrong or you are...
First thing you need to know is that it comes with a very short cable..you might need to get an extension cable. Then it works as expected but you are better off using batteries that show their remaining charge because with regular batteries you might get intermittent performance after some time
First of all it does charge the phone but not a full charge, well best I got was %80 full charge off of a Duracell copper/top, should far better with a Lithium AA battery, and one small issue is the plugin port for the wire to the AA battery case is loose but was a easy fix buy taking off the plastic cap off and push in the thin bar that touches the pin and put it back togather just don't recamend on pulling it off repeatedly, don't want it to get loose again.
I'm not saying this is a good product or a bad product, it is just an okay product.  I didn't expect the world, but after my first use I was left wanting more. It seemed like it would charge my phone a lot quicker but after an hour of being connected, it had barely gone up a bar.Plus the connection was not very good, meaning the cord would come lose from the charger or the phone and just stop charging.
Be very careful not to place the battery the wrong way. It will get extremely hot to the touch, the battery will leak, and may damage your phone.
This charge seems to work with the minimum possible workmanship.Materials and construction is very cheep, but it seems to be minimally sufficient.A good cheap bargain, but not a great bargain.
It was not what I thought it would be. I was looking for a battery charger to do the same thing a wall charger would do without paying a hefty price.  This product is if your phone dies or is dying, it will give you extra time to talk on phone.  It's a good product for people who usually forget to charge their phone and need to make a call right away.  I just wished they had a better definition of the product to begin with.
WE BOUGHT THIS RCA TV WHEN OUR TV FINALLY DIED AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 11 YEARS.  WE DECIDED ON THIS PARTICULAR MODEL BECAUSE WE LIKED THE IN-STORE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY.WE LOVED THE GUIDE PLUS FEATURE. WE COULD FIND OUT WHAT WAS COMING ON NEXT, WHAT IT WAS RATED, WHETHER IT WAS A RERUN, ETC. JUST BY PUSHING A BUTTON. SOMETIMES THE GUIDE PLUS DIDN'T WORK AND WE'D HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO UPDATE TO OUR LOCAL NETWORK.  SOMETIMES THIS WAS DUE TO A POWER FAILURE, OTHER TIMES IT JUST HAPPENED.HOWEVER, THE SOUND HAD BEEN ACTING A LITTLE FINICKY AND FINALLY WENT COMPLETELY OUT THE OTHER DAY.  I CAN GET A TAPPING NOISE WHEN I ADJUST THE VOLUME, BUT THERE IS NO OTHER SOUND.  I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED, NOT ONLY BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER TV RIGHT NOW, BUT ALSO BECAUSE I THOUGHT RCA HAD A GOOD REPUTATION.  I THINK FOR ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL, WE COULD MAKE APPLIANCES THAT LAST LONGER THAN A FEW YEARS.IF I DO GET ANOTHER TV, I WILL LOOK FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS A/V JACKS (WHETHER ON THE BACK OR FRONT) AND MAYBE SMART SOUND.  IT WOULDN'T HURT TO HAVE A GUIDE PLUS FEATURE, TOO!  BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE RCA.
The one thing I hate about this TV is the cable guide that pops up everytime you turn it on. It's kinda convient when you want to use it (it's like a TV guide right on the screen) but when I usually turn on the TV I  know what I want to watch. With this menu, however, I can't do anything  until I clear it off the screen. It only takes a second to do it, but it's  annoying everytime I turn it on.Also, the remote is kind of a pain. Like  most people I put the remote next to me when I watch TV. Everytime I shift  on the couch I manage to turn off the TV by rolling on the power button.  Then when I hit the power button again to turn it on, it doesn't work  because I also hit the VCR button. All the buttons on this remote are way  too sensitive.The picture is clear and the sound is great, but the  annoying features that it has is too much for one person to enjoy this TV.
Your store is fantastic,but there is one problem:maybe I'm at fault that I live far away from America.All the products I have chosen are only shipped within the US.I just can admire them;thats all.Anyway if i happen to land the US someday,I will surel visit your shop.
These disks look really cool with the snazzy colors and everything.  They have great sound, but then again it is hard to compare sound with MiniDiscs because they're all so good.  I wouldn't recommend them though because the  shutter is made of a flimsy plastic rather than metal.  All in all they're  fairly good disks.
The sound quality on these disks is the same as on any other minidisc: they are all digital.  Therefore, I don't think these are a good deal next to the $1.50 memorex sold on this site.  If you want cases, i suppose they  could be worthwhile, but I don't think the cases are necessary; it is very  hard to hurt a minidisc.
The only lens cleaning disk I have ever wanted to strangle. The Borg would immediately space her. Cleaning track is track 2, you can skip the rest if you like, it's just a lot of "The Voice" and some audio test tones. Track 2 is listed as 35min, 34sec long, but the "The Voice" comes back at second 29 and instructs us to "Advance to track 3... Now", (Don't do it! You will be severely smarmed.).The cleaning tufts are distributed in a spiral pattern and altogether cover about a quarter inch annular swath. For good measure I scanned in and out across the 35 minutes of track 2 with the time slider in my player,(Winamp).The files on the disk are all .cda, CD audio files, if your player doesn't read CD audio, you won't hear anything, of course, and it might or might not scan across the brushes while it's looking for something playable and might or might not sweep off the lens, but at least you will be spared "The Voice".The small print on the disk itself says put it in the case brush side up (to keep the bushes from getting squashed). (Just in case you skip reading the platter.)
Rated mid- point cause have not idea how product worked due to fact that it was a gift for someone out of state and I will probably not get any feedback from that person. So read other reviews.
I think this product probably does (most of) what it claims to do, but unfortunately it didn't fix my DVD player.  My DVD player has intermittent and inconsistent problems reading/recognizing DVDs (brand new DVDs, library DVDs, computer-written DVDs, all types).  Sometimes it reads them and works fine, and sometimes it ejects the disc and refuses to read it.Hoping that it was just a dirty lens and considering the reviews, I tried this product.  The product disk has a number of tufts of fiber designed (I think) to clean the laser lens.  It didn't work but didn't do any harm either.  My player might have some other problem, then.  I'll save this drive cleaner in case I ever need it for a computer drive.
I used the disk in both my large screen tv/dvd combo and in my portable dvd player. I still get the same type of play on the combo. I really can't tell whether it worked or not because the portable didn't have a problem to begin with.
I was getting a lot skipping from rented and new DVD's. Read the reveiws and thought I would give this cleaner a try. It did not solve my problem, but my high end DVD recorder is in the shop and maybe it's not a dirty lens causing the problem??Product was well made and the sound check is excellent. I think overall this is a good cleaner it's just not a fix all solution.
It worked great on my Mac laptop, and the add-on "audio test" features were more interesting than I expected when I ran them on my home stereo system. I have a two channel setup, but I can imagine this feature would be genuinely useful for people who haven't properly calibrated their home theater systems.But, the cleaner simply didn't work in my five CD exchanger. It ran through the setup, but would not go to the proper track to perform the actual cleaning.  So...Plus: unlike some similar products that (according to reviews) don't work in laptop DVD drives, this one did.Minus: it doesn't work in my JVC 5-disc CD player, which is what I really wanted.
I've owned around 15 or so of these type of cleaning disks, and all but one (Including this one) were about the same. A word of advice, if it says you can do multiple cleanings in the directions, then always do 2 in a row. Because none of them clean as good as they say. This one was fairly cheap though.
After I used it several times, I am still having trouble with my DVD player skipping.  This product seems as if it would be perfect for audio a bit more than video.
I needed a cleaner for my dvd and erroneously ordered this disk, which did work well with my cd player, but not with dvd. player.
My drive is recognized by the computer but NO disk (blank, commercial CD, commercial DVD) gets read.All show (under "properties") that the disk is full, but files are not listed.Apparently this cleaner gives instructions FROM the disk.Will it work if the computer can't read disks at all?  How will I know what to do and when?
Overall the product was good improving sound quality. The problem with it is that it really doesn't do much to improve the performance of the system. The product seemed more directed towards improving only the audio aspect of the lens. Perhaps if it were more versatile with it's cleaning or performance it would get a better review. I used it to clean the lens of my game system hoping to restore it back to a fairly good condition. However, shortly after receiving the product i discovered that it did little to improve the performance of the system fore I was still experiencing skipping and lagging when trying to play a game in good condition. But, I must say that it did improve the audio quality even though I purchased it hoping to improve the performance.
I used it to clean my computer DVD drives. I followed the instructions on the monitor but at some point the system just got stuck in a loop while it was testing the suround sound. I just ejected the disc. Couldn't tell if the lens is cleaner now or not - I guess it worked and I'll keep using it once in a while.
It did not work on a 5 CD changer. We read many of the reviews but no one mentioned that it wasn't appropriate for multiple CD changers.
I used this on two CD players.  One player seemed to have less skipping after running the disc about six times but the other player would not even accept the disc.  I have also tried memorex CD/DVD lens cleaner and that did absolutley nothing for either CD players.  I continue to use Allsop on a regular basis hoping it will eventually clean the lens enough to stop the skipping completely, but I may have to have both players professionally looked at.
This item arrived early and in perfect condition. I purchased this item in hopes it would stop my DVD player from refusing to play DVDs. I followed the instructions but unfortunately my DVD player still pops open after I insert the DVD. It didn't help with refusing to play DVDs but it did give easy to follow instructions.I imagine it would help clean CDs.
It has no effect. The disc does nothing but shop cleaning is close to the price a new CD player. Having used many discs on many different brands there is never a correction. I currently have 4 Sony plus two other brands.Disc that play perfectly on at least three machines wont play properly on another. This speaks to dirty laser rather than bad discs,
We had a CD player that skipped so thought this might fix it.  It didn't so scrapped the CD player because I couldn't find anyone who would even try to fix it but this helped me make the decision.
Didn't solve my problem but glad I have it
Cleaner is easy to use, but first run through did not completely clean my CD player. There is improvement but not totally working yet. I will run again when I have time. The audio test procedure is pretty cool.
I have a 2002 beauty of a car whose cd player recently stopped working. I gave this product a go but to no success. However, this product did a nice job with my dvd and blu ray players at home.
Many reviewers had goo luck with this product; however it did not solve the skipping problem with our DVD player.  Our player is about 10 years old, and it may have reached the end of its expected life.  The product seems well made and it is easy to use.  I will likely use it after our new DVD player arrives.
I have an old CD player when I was using my original CD's they were skipping or would not play. I used the CD cleaner and sill had the same problem. What finally worked was the DVD & CD Doctor.
It was okay, I tried to clean my CD player in my car and it worked for a good hot second, so I thing I have to get a whole new system with speakers
We recently got one of these TV's.  It has a nice picture, but it has about two features, (closed captioning, sleep timer)  That's about it.  The price is great for a 25&quot; TV, but after using it, you can tell why it's  cheap.  My opinion is that I wish I would have spend the extra money and  got a TV with more features.
I wish I could write a review for this TV. I ordered it a month ago and  the shipping company, Nationstreet, still hasn't delivered it! Save  yourself some time and pick it up in a retail store! (I hear the TV is  great!)
I agree with Mr. Howard W. Rhee from Arlington.  The case is nice but it is bulky due to the extra flap in the case.  I wish that H. Packard will remanufacture this case without the extra flap in order to make the HP-720 portability useful.
Try [...] as they do what seems to be a lovely flat case for the 720 without the flap. It costs $75. I know the previous reviews are a few years ago, but this info may help someone.
I like the flip covers for my Palm V better than the many wallet-types out there, because it makes the whole thing more compact for pocket-toting.  However, the stylus-hinge thing on the original (that came with the PDA) had worn down so it wouldn't stay in place any longer (kept slipping out).  This product was the only replacement I managed to find, and I was delighted. Significant differences from the original are that the hinge flap is rubber, not leather as on the original, and there is no tooling (recessed area) to make room for the scroll button, meaning it can press on the button when closed (though it's too new to have noted whether that poses a significant problem).  I sort of like the picture/business card window on the inside, and the price was right.  Whether the plain leather of the original is better than the animal (lizard?) type texture of the leather on this product is purely a subjective judgment-- I preferred the simplicty of the original.  However, this fills a need nicely, and I'm glad to have found it (actually, &quot;them&quot;-- two in a pack for one truly low price).
I like almost everything about this case except for one (near) fatal flaw: the velcro that holds your pilot in the case is required to be attached to the hatch that covers the expansion/memory card port!  I often find that  upon unzipping my case, the pilot has shifted position and the velcro has  remained locked to the hatch, thus REMOVING the hatch.  It got annoying  after the 100th time.  Also, I have big suspicions that this is what caused  my palm pilot to do a hard reset and lose all of my information when I was  on a trip.
I really like the quaility leather used to make this case. It looks and feels great, but I have to agree with previous reviewers that the velcro holding the Palm in place can pull off the battery cover and cause the whole thing to fall out of it's case. This happened almost half the time I opened it to use it. Needless to say, it sits in my desk drawer now. It's unfortunate because other than that one design flaw, the case is made very well.One other thing to consider is that with the leather case on, you can't slip the Palm in your shirt pocket, which can be very convenient.
Does it also do real-time conversion to the output coax, not only to video tape? I.e. if I bring american TV to Europe, can I use it as a PAL-NTSC converter by hooking between this TV and AV source (anthena, cable)?
Ok, if you are interested in this product, I'll assume that you already own a Rio, so I guess I can't try to talk you out of that.GOOD - Small, easy to carry around, cheap compared to OTHER flash memory  manufacturers.BAD  - Expensive compared to CD-R, MD, etc.UGLY - Bad  memory clusters will cause skips over time.Basically, if you have a Rio,  and need more memory, this is the stuff to buy. Don't try and find Camera  flash cards, and figure out how to use them in your Rio. That would not  only be a nuscence, but also would end up costing you more. If you don't  own a Rio, and are considering buying one, take a look at my reviews of the  PMP300 and the PMP500.- E-Mail me at nairos@home.com if you have any  questions -
First off this card is old. I bought one of these in '98 I believe, shortly after I bought a brand new PII 450 system. It has served me well to this day. In fact right now we are playing No One Lives Forever on it without much trouble.One thing I didn't like about the card was that the fan began to make too much noise after about 18 months. The RMA process wasn't too painful but the new card started having the same problem 4 months later. At this time Diamond was no longer in business and I could not get another RMA. On there web site they suggested removing the fan and cleaning it which I did and still do occasionaly as the noise always comes back after a few months.Other than the lame fans, this is a very good TNT2 card. Considering cards using this chip are dirt cheap just about anyplace you look and they pack enough 3D power to play all the classics, I would not have a problem putting one in a budget system with basic 3D requirements. Say a Celeron or Duron 1 gig for the kids Disney games and your System shock, King Pin, Half Life, Unreal Tournament, etc..
While this controller is not as responsive as the newer USB models, it has the advantage of being really inexpensive. This controller is set up just like the Sony Playstation controller and hooks up through your gameport. If  you don't want to spend the money this one is for you.
at first sight, this controller looks great. it's buttons are exactly like a playstation controller. then i found out there were no drivers for it. so if anyone knows where to find the drivers for this controller, PLEASE email me at: MMT1087@cs.com
If you can find someway around the bad look of this CD player then I'd suggest buying it.  However I could not get passed the bad looks, and have returned it to the store at which I purchased it.
My first one lasted two hours after I loaded it, a cd got stuck in the back and actually damaged the servo that spins the carousel around, so I got it replaced with a new one.  After careful comparison with my other cd  players, I'm not too impressed with the digital filters... they seem to  compress or narrow the stereo field a bit too much for my liking.  But for  the dollar value, it's not a bad deal.
I have over 600 cds,because I hate radio.(boring) multiple cd machine with RANDOM PLAY is what I want. I bought a JVC-MC222BK. Plays great.RANDOM PLAY works good.Goes from cd to cd &amp; song to song. The problem? When you  program in select cds. RANDOM PLAY will only play the whole cd,not song  search. I put it back in the box.(where it is now) I got a PIONEER PD-F1007  300 machine. works much better! Plus you can plug two of them together,to  equal 600! The JVC XL-MC222BK is a good player. Amazon.com has a great  price. But it does have set limits hard core music fans will not deal with.
This changer has an excellent sound quality for it's price range. It reproduces hall ambience and depth well, but is critical of poorly recorded material. Although it lacks digital outputs, the integrated DAC performs  well. It tracks all dropout tracks on my test CD up to 2 consecutive of  2000 micrometers each. I prefer the CD jacket album that JVC provides to  other brands' front panel title displays. Most displays are difficult to  read from the listening position. I purchased a second album so that I can  place both the front AND REAR covers above one another on one page (100  covers per album). That way I can read titles of individual tracks without  having to remove the covers from the protective pages of the albums. I also  saved the price of a CD storage tower. Downsides: Difficult to fit player  in entertainment unit due to height and depth. Occasionally rejects  lending-library CDs which have security strips glued to label surface  (unbalanced disc). Rotating these discs 180 degrees when loading sometimes  permits play.
I bought one of these because it was the first one I saw and I wanted a little more capacity than the one that came with my Olympus D360L.  I thought the price was high but I only have to buy it once, right?  Well now  I find that there are other brands for half the price.  Check around.  A  company called Smartdisk makes these and sells them to other companies.  Can you say &quot; cut out the middle man&quot; boys and girls?  The card  works great and I have had zero problems.
This is available as an accessory for the  Olympus D-340R Digital Camera, but this camera can only handle a maximum of the 16 MB version
I just received my unit and had problems with the first five tapes I attempted to rewind. The lid opened before the tape was rewound and I would have to try again. This morning I successfully rewound two tapes. May have been operator error, but I don't think so. If I have any more problems, I will have to return it.
I've used this rewinder about 10 times. It is somewhat loud during use, and the noise when it finishes is a bit alarming, but the tapes have been fine. I only use my vcr to record/watch tv shows, so the tapes I'm using have all been used more that 8 times. Great deal, product works as described.
I purchased this to use in a classroom setting but cannot use it while watching other movies as it makes some noise--not too loud but still loud enough to make it difficult to hear anything else...
This rewinder is a Radio Shack model, not an Ambico one.It seems as if it needs oiling because it does not run smoothily like the Radio Shack model I had for 10 years.Each day that I use it is gets a little better.Thank you.
Purchased two for Children's Hospital to rewind 20-50 movies daily.  One of the rewinders stopped working after only 3 days.  Amazon was great in sending a replacement before I even had time to return the defective one.  I just hope these rewinders last for at least 6 months.  Seems like these soon-to-be-obsolete items can't hold up with lots of use.
Only rewinds a 6-hour tape.  Wouldn't rewind an 8-hour tape.  My old rewinder did both.
This machine is slow and noisy but it gets the job done.  I got this one because of the price and it's okay for the price but don't expect too much.
It works but is quite noisy! Quality could be better. It was bought to replace a bad rewinder in a VCR.
Mine broke after 3 years of moderate use.  I suppose that is commendable in today's cheap and replaceable world.I got a VHS rewinder in 2007 to save wear and tear on my VCR.  (I like to record broadcast TV occasionally, but dislike burning DVDs to do it -- old-fashioned VHS videocassettes save 6 hours of material easily enough, DVDs save only 2; repeatedly rewinding VHS tapes in the VCR sooner or later messes up the rewind mechanism, hence the need for a video tape rewinder).  This rewinder capably rewound tapes better than Mary Katherine Gallagher, Molly Shannon's character in "Superstar" (you'll remember her short-lived job as the rewind girl at Blockbuster), then it started coughing up the tape before it rewound.  So I started putting a medium-weight book on top of the rewinder (Webster's Dictionary) and it continued to faithfully rewind for another year or so.  Finally, one day I plugged it in, put in a tape and nothing happened.  Like Mary Katherine Gallagher's job -- and like Blockbuster itself -- this Ambico VHS Rewinder won't last forever.  Maybe there's no such thing as a VHS tape rewinder that lasts a long time.  This one lasted a 3 years, 4 months, then it died.
I was not aware that this is a radio shack product, I have had several radio shack reminders and they only last a few months.  So far this one is working. But had I known it was a radio shack product I would have ordered something else.I think the ad should have said Amibco VHS reminder by radio sha
AMBICO VHS Rewinder.  Light indicating winder is in use burned out after one tape was rewound.  Works well except for that malfunction.  Not very good qualify controlI believe.
I actually bought the 3284 model which has the 3259's tube with a few extra whistles and bells. The picture quality is decent and the sound is satisfactory but I completely agree with the reviewer who experienced  problems with vertical white and black bars continuously appearing when  using a video input source including DVD players. It's rather annoying but  can be eliminated by reducing the contrast, but you lost picture quality in  so-doing. This is very frustrating but overall, I'm satisfied with the  purchase considering the price. I actually don't have cable or satellite )=  but this TV picks up local stations rather well (much better than my  previous top of the line JVC 27090 27&quot; TV). Anyway, it's a good TV for  the budget-minded but it's no Sony and despite Philips' boastings, it is  NOT a flat screen TV. If you want a decent (nothing more) 32 inch picture  for a modest price- it's a good buy.
I expected the wrist rest to be higher. I kinda want my wrist to hang and not crouch. My hand doesn't crouch as much as on a flat surface. It does prevent the stiffness and pain I get in my fingers after using the mouse for long periods of time. The material seems to intermittently slow down my apple magic mouse. Overall it serves the purpose I bought it for--ergonomics
I like the smoothness of the pad but need it to be bigger.  I needed it to cover the space of the pull out from the desk. My only complaint is that it's not big enough!
It's a very comfortable mouse pad; however, when it is delivered, it has a cut on it. I prefer to receive no cosmetic damage product!
It worked while I had it but I have since upgraded to a hard smooth pad for gaming which has been much better and espcially faster.
Not a bad item, however it would be nicer if there was more room to move the mouse around.
The cushiony part is not that soft.  I like the really gooey soft ones for my wrist.  I'll keep it but next one I want to be softer.
When I first received this mouse pad..I couldn't use it because it had a funny smell that a headache ...I let it air out a few days then I was able use it. I enjoy it now. I use it in my home office.
if you are using your mouse - i think you'll love having a mousepad with a rest but a more expensive one would probably be more comfthis one is OKwe got one from walmart that is a little more cushy
It serves its purpose, but is not comfortable for long-term use like online gaming. The wrist pad is hard causes numbness if I use it for too long. It is sturdy and well made.
Reasonably-priced item, exactly as described; prompt delivery. Compact footprint, does not take up too much space, but slightly awkward to use, hence three-star rating.
What do you want from me. It's a pad. For your mouse. There is no way to mess that up these days. Especially when you get a plain color like mine.
It's OK, but I don't feel any reduction in the stress on my wrist area.  Needs more gel support for my larger hands and constant mouse action.
These take a while to beak in and conform to your hand. I've had a couple like them in the past. My only gripe is the smell. Most mouse pads seem to smell this way for a week or two, it's just the new-mouse-pad smell I guess.I've had this since March 13th. It's Sept. 16th and the thing is about shot a creese has developed accrost the wrist support, so it's not a very high quality mouse pad. I'll be shopping for another brand.
This mouse pad is somewhat smaller that regular one.  The wrist raise is very low which does not help much supporting the wrist.  Still find it painful to use my mouse with this pad.The support is not stiff but sink as you rest on it.  But for the price, I can coupe with it.  This will be the last one from Belkin.  I'll find other brand next time when this wear out.
Just ordered my 3rd of these. The first one lasted several years. The second I bought under a year ago and for some months now the cloth that covers the gel pad has been coming off. Has now become very uncomfortable - hence order for replacement.
We haven't had time to use it and can't comment on it yet. I would think that it would be OK.
My optical mouse doesn't do well on the pad... but I placed my original {flimsy, skinny} pad over it and it works fine...  I still get fatigue, but not as much as before.
Actually it makes a better elbow pad, if they had 2 pads, 1 at each end , it would be better.
I had an identical looking mouse pad from Belkin that had worn out after 5 years.  I bought this one as a replacement and the edges near the top of the pad are starting to peal back and its only been a few months.  I probably will go with a different brand when this one wears to a point when I can't use it anymore.
I love the mouse pad, it's exactly what I needed and functions perfectly.  However there are some very minor issues, one being, the rubbery bottom of the mouse pad stinks of a chemical odor similar to tennis shoes when you first take them out the box.  I've been letting the mouse pad air out for the past two days but the odor is very slow in fading.  This may be a problem for someone who is sensitive to smells.Also, the edges are slightly frayed, which isn't pronounced unless you stare at it, but at this price, I wasn't expecting perfection.  As I said before the pad functions well, my wrists are feeling much better and my mouse functions perfectly.  I would recommend this item only to people without allergies or sensitivity to chemicals.
I like the wrist rest. But this mouse pad did NOT work with my laser mouse. I guess ill store it for someone else.
The material and gel pad are nice. I gave it a 3 because of the size, its just too small my mouse can barely move left and right without moving off the pad.
I've bought several of these from Amazon, so I'm averaging out my reviews.  The original mouse pad that I bought was terrific, I've been using it for years now.  Incredibly comfortable, and it kept away any carpal tunnel issues that I previously had.Those that I bought in the last two years or so, though, feel completely different.  The rest gel for your wrist is stiff and not at all relaxing, and the mouse glides a little too easily for me (makes it harder to control).I'd give the original one I bought a five, it's an amazing mouse pad.  I'd give the new ones that I bought (same exact Belkin model from Amazon) two stars, or a generous three.  I wish I knew why they changed the design.
well, you got what you paid. the big soft part keeps getting smaller every time you use it. it helps a lot though.
This mousepad is really comfortable, a good size (not too small, not too big), but I found that the surface is so smooth (maybe made of neoprene?) that my laser mouse doesn't work very well with it.  Although I can use my mouse with it, the pointer becomes a bit "jumpy" and it is hard to have pin-point accuracy.  However, I suspect that if you have a rollerball mouse, that this would not be a problem (although I have not tested it with one).
The gel pad is a bit too hard in my opinion. The mat itself has a sort of grainy texture that is not ideal for a mouse pad.
In general the product is good. What I didn't like is that the cushion where you place your wrist is not soft enough. I found it a bit harder than others I have tried before.
It is comfortable, mouse works fine on it - but the smell! The chemical smell is nauseating. I wiped it off with a damp cloth, left it overnight in a box with a scented dryer sheet and it still stinks. That's to bad.
The gel isn't pad isn't as nice comfortable as my previous Gel Pad, but it definitely takes pressure off of your palm and wrist for the price.
I love this mouse pad for the price, it's comfortable and works perfectly with my anker mouse.The only problem i had was shipping, it took longer than the reccomended date.
Other review stated that corners do not lay flat.  I only have one corner that is coming up but its not affecting my use.  The worst part about this product was the god awful stench.  It was a mix of burnt rubber and industrial odor.  I had to drench it with febreeze four times before I could finally use it.  That being said it was only $10 and you get what you pay for.  If money is tight this will fit the bill nicely and works very well with my Logitech mice,  but if I had to do it over again I would buy a better pad.  Perhaps then I wouldn't get a recycled tire that smells of carcinogens.
I just received my wrist pad and was really excited with the stress that it relieved in my hand.  But then, I kept smelling something weird, like some type of burning auto oil.  I didn't have anything on the stove, so I realized that it was the wrist pad!!! Yuk!! It was so bad that I had to put it out on the deck to air it out (It's been out there all afternoon and no change.  I'll get it tomorrow to see if if still smells) I really like and need the pad, so I'll just keep it out there until the smell leaves. I'll give an update when (and if) the odor leaves.  Sorry, I can only give it three stars at this time.
It certainly looks nicer and shinier than the older version but unfortunately the gel rest is a lot stiffer and as a result not a comfortable.
I needed a mouse pad and this was the cheapest yet durable pad i could find on here. I like it. It does what it's intended to do, what more do you want?
After less than a month of ownage (pun intended/gamer lingo), there is a very loud, and annoying crinkling noise emitted from the &#34;gel pad&#34; portion of this mousepad whenever pressure is applied to it.Caveat emptor!
While this product gave my wrist some much-needed relief, the mouse pad itself had a annoying depression in it that caused the optical mouse to go haywire. I had to put another thin mouse pad over the mousing area to get it to work correctly. Would probably not recommend unless this was a fluke of shipping or manufacturing.
With the Belkin name and wrist padding contents I did not expect it to flatten down in just a few weeks of use.  I am always fighting to keep CTS in check and this wrist pad will not help the battle. The rolled up towel is still the best bet for me and not the high price of this particular pad.
My biggest complaint with this mouse pad is that the gel part is harder than it should be.  It's not very squishy like you would assume it should be.  It doesn't seem to allow a lot of cushion for your wrist and is more like a slightly softer spot than your desk.  It's also a weird shape.
I use a Logitech V200 Cordless Mouse - Black ( 931380-0403 ) for my laptop, and let me say this mousepad has not met my expectations.First of all, out of the box, there was a slight bubble in the fabric, resulting in an elevated/loose area of the mouse pad. For such a price, I would expect such obvious product/quality defects to be absent.Secondly, after some use/wear (for a few months), the mousepad started to become unresponsive to my mouse. The pointer would start jumping or not respond to certain areas on the mousepad. Also, the mousepad started to become "stickier" and my mouse would not glide very smoothly. And I know this is not my mouse or the computer, because I have tested other surfaces and the mouse worked just fine.The only thing I can commend this mousepad for is that it's comfortable to use.
the product came with a dent in the pad, which it might have been designed like that, but it somewhat comfy. If it had a hard surfaced bottom and was a lot less flimsy i would give it at least 4 starts if not 5
The part where you put your wrist is a little big and it is stiff but soft. Not as soft as I would of liked it. But it does what it does.
I have one of these that is many years old.  It is awesome and has great padding.  I purchased this as a secondary one for work and it is hard, not stitched as well, and just not a good deal.  I'd suggest against it, but I don't really know what I'd re-direct you to.  I love these things for work as it is awesome to have padding.Best of luck in your search, but I would continue your search.
After about a week of laying my wrist on it, the gel pad caved in.  I'm not sure if that was it's purpose, but I was looking for more of a rubbery firm wrist guard.  It's not a bad product for the price so I really can't complain.
This mouse pad works well as far as holding my wrist at the correct angle; however I wished the pad part for the mouse was a little longer as I find that moving my mouse around it sometimes runs off the end.  I have to keep lifting and moving it back on the pad.
I chose this product because I needed something to support my wrist on my home work computer since I've using it much more lately. The gel part is medium hard and it has an indentation to place the wrist. It supports it well, but I would have liked it to be softer like the one I have at work. If you are using it for a few hours a day it is okay. The material is excellent, and it is sturdy. The pad is large enough to move my mouse with no problem. My other family members like it and say I'm too fussy. I guess it is a matter of preference.
While this mouse pad performs well and has reduced my wrist pain, I cannot get over the smell. I have been using it for over a week now and it still overpowers the air around my desk. I don't care how great the product performs when it smells this bad. Maybe it explains the low price...
Turned out I needed a much cushier wrist pad so gave it away as not cost effective to return. My friend likes it however.
The items were not as I have imagined. Although they were new, they were slightly defected in workmanship. I bought them based on price and so based on that I got what I paid for.
The gel pad is starting to collapse in the center. Still comfortable and usable but will update when it comes apart.
It does the job, my wrist is feeling a lot better after a lot of computer usage, but the quality of material is pretty low, honestly feels and sounds like they've encased bubble wrap inside the support. also deformed slightly aesthetically.
the first thing I learned after I opened the plastic package was it had bad smell. But I accepted it as it works well with my mouse and the price is good. I do not feel comfortable with the gel part on the wrist I think I have a pair of smaller hands.
I have sensitive wrists (I type alot and get achy wrists) and for me, the raised rest was too hard (didn't give way enough).  The raised gel rest pushes down easily with fingers, but not when my wrist is needing a rest - felt like wood to me then.I like the idea, and it is probably a good product for some people; it just didn't fit my needs at this time.  For me, the rest would need to be softer and less 'raised' (about half as much).  I ended up turning the mouse pad sideways, so my wrists did not encounter the raised part, until I was able to purchase a flat mouse pad again.
After having used this product now for several months, both at work and home, it's OK.The wrist support area is not great. Both of mine have a dip in the middle of wrist rest area. It's not a soft gel that molds around your wrist.It's ok for the price I paid, but you may want to pay more and get a better quality wrist rest.
I purchased two of these a few weeks ago - one is already starting to curl. Other than that they're comfortable to use - not too squishy and not to hard.
I got this for work and it work fine.. similar product like this at office depot is like 25 bucks
The actual gel on the pad is great however, the edge on the wrist is a little sharp and it irritates me sometimes.  This will be perfect if it had smooth edges.
I have carpal tunnel in my right wrist, so using a computer all day would cause my hand to fall asleep and/or feel cold due to lack of circulation. I was hoping that this would ease the discomfort. It does, to a point. I think that the gel pad on the front side of it is raised up just a bit too high, where it makes your wrist a little uncomfortable rather quickly. It has a smooth finish to it and the mouse seems to run really smooth on it until you get to the right edge. Then it seems to dip and the mouse can't read where it is. It would be nice if it were a little larger mouse-pad as the surface area seems a bit small as well.
The wrist support wasn't as &#34;gelly&#34; as I was expecting. It was really firm and unbending. I'm used to it now but if you're looking for a memory foam gel style, this isn't it.
I've used quite a few mousepads over the years.  This one is nice, has held up well.  But, I frequently run off the sides.I think they should have made the sides more convex than concave shaped.
I bought this hoping it would help relieve my carpal tunnel pain. Not sure it's helped or not? Seems to be well made. For the price, I think it's a fairly good deal.
Its been pretty good, I still get pain in my wrist with the gel pad but its definitely better than a regular mousepad. If you want a comfortable, good, mousepad this is it. Works great with my Logitech mouse.
The gel part developed a sag in the middle after just a few days of use; otherwise an OK item.  The 3M mouse pad of the same kind is of much higher quality.
Its okay but the bump isnt gel like I thought and the pad part seems cheap. I would look for other options if you're reading this review. For the price though I cant complain too much.
I have 4 of these in my office all been good except one.  The cover is separating where top meets bottom.  Not bad to the point of replacement yet but it has been used for over a year now. Not sure how long one might expect them to survive daily office use.  Very comfortable for all day use.
Comfortable.  However, fuming with fumes out of the box.  I had to leave it out for the day (in the shade...) and in the laundry room for the night so the fumes could go away.  Seems ok now.  One major problem though, I have a laser mouse (not a rollerball) that needs a reflective surface in order to work.  The pad is a matte black...so it wouldn't work with my mouse.  I tried another mouse and it worked with that one, also a laser mouse.  I replaced all batteries and tried the first laser mouse and that did not work.  It would work on any other surface, but not this pad.  Both of my mice are about 5 years old so maybe newer models work fine.  So to summarize, it may not work with your laser mouse, you'll have to air it out for a day or two, but it's very comfortable.
It does what it's supposed to to do, give some supports to my wrist. however, a very weird thing, it doesn't work with my Microsoft Wireless optical mouse. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014J05EM. as far as i remember, some reviews mentioned this, and I should have listen to them.It's made from cheap material, ans very stinky first few days. There are many air pop on the surface, and it makes me think it's gonna be broken soon.I still give it 3 stars because it's working now, but not meet exceed my expectations, compare to my old fellowes one.
I was hoping this would solve my wrist issues, but unfortunately, it's just not what I expected. First, it smells like paint thinner or cheap plastic. I even aired it outside all day and that didn't help. I'm getting a headache from it. I'll give it a couple days before I decide to return it. Second, the padded wrist area is not as soft or "gel-like" as I had hoped. It's still better than laying my wrist across the edge of my desk, but all-in-all it is somewhat disappointing.
This relieved the pressure on my wrist (my fingers were going numb!) but the gel is pretty hard.  My optical mouse has no issue working on it and I like the narrow size for my small desk.  It would definitely be a bit small if I was gaming on it.Bottom line - there are better support mouse pads available for sure, but this is fine for the price and a small work desk.
It's really a bit too large and keep falling off the table. IT is well cushioned and is holding up so far.
I gave it 3 stars mostly because i don't like the finish and the fact that the gel rest is sinking in the center. I don't think its real gel inside coz it doesn't really feels soft and bouncy rather its a hand rest which seems like it may have foam base inside. Overall okay but not the best find.
When I opened the package, the smell of the mouse was overpowering. It had a strong rubber odor that was very unpleasant. I'm hoping that will go away soon.  I love the gel wrist pad. There is a little groove in it which my wrist fits on nicely.  The mouse moving on the pad makes a noise like your fingers would make when running over a piece of paper and that is a little annoying. However, the mouse moves smoothly enough.
The wrist rest seems to be filled with some hard substance so that I don't consider it a real &#34;gel&#34; pad as was our older one just like it.  Hence it's not as comfortable, but it is adequate for the job.
I had a previous version of this mousepad that I absolutely adore. I decided to purchase a new one so I can give my old one to my boyfriend. It was a bit frustrating dealing with the shiny material and how it interfered with my wireless optical mouse.I really enjoy the feeling of the gel pad on my wrist and the smooth surface for when I move my mouse.What I first did was dampen the pad a bit, not the gel part. Let it dry for a few minutes. Then I put some vanilla protein shake powder on it and promptly brushed the powder off. I did this as a silly experiment and it actually worked.I no longer have issues when the wireless optical mouse going wonky whenever I play computer games or general use.Good product, but bad idea for Belkin to make the material shiny.
There's slightly less strain on my wrist because of the resting pad, but I'm not sure just how much it's helping.
the mouse wrist support is adequate but, and this is a big but, they need to be wider to allow left to right sweeping motions without having to pickup the mouse and do it one or two more times.
Goes well with the keyboard wrist support by Belkin.  Like my review for that, I do not like the logo on it, but I bought it cause it has so many reviews.  A good product but no better or worse than other mouse pad supports I have used
For $8 don't expect anything too great.Pros:1) Doesn't take up too much space2) Doesn't move around and is not sticky3) The wave rest gel pad is comfortableCons:1) It has an extremely strong chemical smell.2) Makes an annoying "swishing" sound when you move your mouse aroundWould I buy it again? Only if it was $4.
Seems nice, but my mouse is jumpy, the texture is having a hard time with the laser mouse.  I'm hoping the surface will wear down and improve the mouse response.Good wrist support.
You can't see it on the picture but the area where you rest your wrist has preset shallow dimple in the centre.  I expected a rounded pad to contour to my wrist as I used it. Now i feel compelled to center my wrist.  A bit of an annoyance but not enough to return it so therefore it's ok.
Not the best one that I have purchased.  The wrist rest is not solid gel.  Has some spots where the gel is not as thick as others.Have to move wrist around to where it is more comfortable.  Would probably not buy again.
I have a typical logitech laser mouse, and it responds very glitchy if all. I just put it under my old mousepad(shrek) ahha. I got this hoping to replace it, but now it just looks more stupid. Its still pretty comfortable but seems it would only be good with ball mouses or those expensive windows bluetrack mouses.
Looked nice in package, gel was relatively soft. Overall decent buy, may have been a little overpriced. Bought it for a dad's gift, great idea.
I love this mouse pad and when it comes to sitting there and just using the pad, it pretty much does it's job. However, when it comes to visually, it could use some work. The pad attracts dust and lint so easily to the point that I have wipe it down  everyday. Also, the top layer of the pad eventually lifts up to reveal a dull but similar color foam beneath. This may not bother most people but annoys the living heck out of me because it now looks old and dingy.If there were any changes made to those drawbacks, this mouse pad would be perfect for the price. Unfortunately for me it will not do. I will be chugging this one for the Innovera Gel Mouse Pad now to avoid this.
My wrist pain is gone, but my mouse is unresponsive. I actually get better response off my wood desk than with this mouse pad. I solved the problem by cutting the mouse pad part off and just using the wrist pad with my old mouse pad. I don't recommend this pad with an optical mouse. I can not give an opinion with a ball or laser mouse. Good luck.
I purchased this because my desk has a rather sharp corner that was starting to bother my wrists, and purchased because it was supposed to be a gel wristpad.  I have to repeat what another reviewer said, and say the quality is not very good on these anymore.  I don't think the gel pad is even gel, but probably a foam and it definitely does not conform to your wrists at all.  The corners do stick up a bit, but I don't think it will be an issue.  Overall, okay for the money, just really disappointed that it's not an actual gel pad like I purchased.
This Mouse Pad is made by Belkin, and hence there is no question about the quality. It works fine with my laser wireless mouse. The gel pad is neither too soft or too hard.However, I am not very happy with this mouse pad. The mouse pad is medium sized and almost 1/4 space is taken by gel pad. This would be okay for mini mouse (travel mouse) but for a full size mouse like mine, there is not much space left for maneuver.I guess if you have comfortable space on your desk for mouse and if you are keyboard junkie, you may not need this product.The only reason I bought it was because it was cheap and I thought it will help with occasional Photoshop use. I am not using it everyday due to reasons mentioned above.Take some time to learn shortcuts on Firefox/Windows and save that frequent trip to your mouse.
This is one of the most comfortable mousepads you can buy within this price range. But the gel part of the mouse pad started to emit a weird odor after a few months of use. I was wondering why the my hand smells funky every time I used the computer and it ended up being the wrist rest. It still looks new and feels comfortable, but that funky smell is very annoying :(
I have carpel tunnel and I using a mouse pad with a wrist guard really helps.  I noticed that at home my wrist was starting to act up again so I thought I would try a new mouse and mouse pad.  I have had the mouse pad for two weeks. When I first got it I was exicted it was very soft and comfortable and felt like the memory foam on my bed.  Than after a week or so the middle of the wrist guard started to bow in the middle.  Now when I move my wrist it soundls like crinkiling paper being rubbed together.I have a Fellowes Microban at my office computer and I really like it.  It includes a u shape cradle for your wrist built in.  All in all the Belkin is the worst mouse wrist guard i have tried (i also use the one by 3m on another computer that i use frequently).
Worked great with my $2 ball mouse and it's comfortable.Upgraded to a Logitech VX Revolution (optical mouse) and it doesn't work on this mousepad.5 Stars for this if you plan on using a ball mouse, totally worthless if using an optical.
Decent quality, I suppose --, but the shape of the 'wave' rest (which is hard to see in the picture, but it hollows out in the middle - like a 'wave' -- then only supports fully on both ends) was so uncomfortable on my carpal tunnel (where I had surgery several years ago) that I'm giving it away after just a few days. (I would have returned it -- but the hard plastic casing was so tough to open that I had to pretty much destroy the packaging to get the product out.)Perhaps those who don't yet have carpal tunnel syndrome might find it OK... but I just replaced it with a standard (one height) memory foam wrist rest mouse pad by HandSprings -- which for me is far more comfortable than this Belkin WaveRest gel mouse pad.  Disappointing purchase... but the shipment came on time -- so the seller was fine.
Bought one a year ago and the rubber chemical smell was terrible.  Could not stand to even be in the same room with it.  This is my second one and I don't remember the first one smelling this bad.  Put in in a sack with baking powder to absorb order for two weeks and it didn't solve the problem.  I finally just put it out in the garage over the winter, washed it off today,  and it still has a slight ordor.  Great pad and very comfortable, if they would just find a way to make them without the terrible smell.  Has anyone else found a way to deordorize it??
I already have one, but I got this for under my leaning-elbow. That's right, I tend to lean on my elbow on my non-mouse hand it it was causing pain. It's elbow worthy, but the bump on the end is not as plump as the one I use for my mouse.It might work well if you have a tight space between the underside of a desk and the mouse tray on some desks though, so don't dismiss it either. I'm a gamer and a writer, so I am at my PC for hours and hours. I need that extra padding. This should work for most people though.
Purchased this 4 years ago and the tube is defective.  I spent the extra on a Sony thinking the quality was at least the same as my 20 year old Sony(which is still working).  After talking to 3 repairmen, Sony is not what it used to be.  My problem (intermitent short in tube) is known by Sony (so says one repairmen) but is not important enough to be addressed by Sony. The cost of the tube makes buying another brand my best option. Before buying, just try to call Sony Service.
If you want to play cd-r's, this unit and all Technics units can not play them.  Technics support says that none of their players are programmed to play cd-r's.  I've tried, and they skip like crazy.  For regular cd's,  however, this unit really shines.  That's why I didnt give it a one star.
the only problem i have had with the unit is it has trouble with burned cds.  usually if it won't play just burn another copy and usually it will do fine.  i have had it for five years.  it needs more features but for the price it is great.
Good player; reliable.  I like the blue lights.I have the SL-MC6, which lacks the optical output.The analog is acceptable, but the optical has to be better.However, grouping disks is way harder than Sony's.I found it too hard to bother with.  Also have to use the remote control;no support on the front panel for group controls.So I use it as a player of a bunch of miscellaneous disks that I don't careto group in any way.Random play is not implemented so great; a lot of repeats in my opinion.Don't tip it too far backwards or else all the disks roll into theback!  CD Text shows when you play a disk, but there is no way toscroll through the list of whats in the player- which you can do withthe Sony carousel models. Overall I like the Sony models a little better.
I have a CrossPad XP it has a serial port cable with two looks like connections for mouse & keyboard, the connector on the pad does not hook up to USB or it is missing the USB hookup, I see a connector deep inide it but know not what it is?Can the USB part be pulled away from another connecting part? It slides into the CrossPad too deep to connect the USB but it is not a USB connection it has little teeth, the cable has a USB then forks into two small round connectors one of them hooks fine to the Serial Port conversion,it came with it, must be missing the other connector or it hooks up to PC keyboard? Anyone know about this product? I went to the Crosspad XP website looks like the domain is up for sale?
This TV is a good buy, but it would definately be worth it topay a little extra for a TV with component video inputs, as thereception from S-Video is HORRENDOUS on this model.  END
When my new Sony WEGA XBR arrived and I turned it on I was speechless. At first glance, you will be generally impressed by the video and audio. However, give it some time. Sooner or later you will begin seeing what  seems to be digital (pixilation) artifacts on screen and in certain scenes,  you will see distortion in both the vertical and horizontal axis. This is  typically evidenced in closeup scenes that pan from left to right  (wonderful ripples) and is especially annoying while watching a stock  ticker crawl across the screen. And don't bother trying to watch a  &quot;Jeopardy&quot; question. It will jump around the screen. This is NOT  a $2,000 television. As a die-hard Sony fan, it came as a real shock to  find that they are pushing this product out the factory door. Save your  money and look elsewhere! So why am I so kind with three stars? I'm hoping  a Sony rep will see this review and offer me my money back or at the very  least give me a trade with a fully working model!
This case really only fits devices that are the same size as Palm Pilots. Palm devices that are slightly larger - like my Uniden - just don't fit. It is a very nice case, I just wish it fit or that the size was actually  listed on the advertisment and I didn't have to cross my fingers until it  got here - so much for crossing my fingers.
First of all I would give this product normal 4.5 stars, because it is a really good webcam for this price, but I got problems with the driver, which was sent with the camera. So I had to download a new one, to get it  run. But if this don't mind you, you can buy it confident.
My 36&quot; XBR WEGA exhibits video distortion in both thevertical and horizontal axis. Just watching ta stock ticker scrollacross the screen can make you queasy.  Yesterday I noticed that some left justified screen credits also exhibited this wave effect while scrolling vertically. It's a shame that Sony's otherwise superb reputation must suffer by releasing a product that pushes the envelope of technology too far. Also, watch for patches of &quot;dark cloudiness&quot; that extend the full height of the display about 5 inches in from either side. Maybe a 32&quot; model works better, but if I could do it all over again, I'd shop around for anouther brand. I wasted alot of hard-earned money with this purchase, and I'd seriously take Sony up on an outright exchange. Does anyone know who to contact for this?  END
Though I am a Sony Guy, I am always looking for something better. The wife wants a Wega. We both agree the XBR looks better than without. I am excited about more options on the XBR. The light reflextion factors needs more  research, I hate looking at features outside of the feature. As for PIP, it  only works with local TV or Cable. Large and small dishes need a separate  tuner for each picture within a picture. Because of the weight, I think a  stand with wheels and lots of shelfs for the tuners would be my option. The  price has dropped this week, but I'm going to try a place, where if you use  a credit card they take off an additional 15%.P.S. The wide screen  format of HDTV is interesting.
I love Sony, but if there happens to be a window across from your WEGA, you'll regret it. And if your window happens to have wood blinds, you'll see exactly how imperfect the glass is -- especially when something scrolls  horizontally across the screen. Don't believe Sony's claims -- we have to  wait till sunset to watch our WEGA because the smooth glass reflects SO  MUCH light, unlike our previous rear projection Sony. Also, this set weighs  a TON because the glass is about 3&quot; thick on the sides. It's as if  they took a Trinitron tube, set it on its face in a box and poured liquid  glass around it. We bought the 32&quot; and upgraded to the 36&quot;, and  both sets have wavy glass and an extraordinary amount of crawling noise  produced by the the digital comb filter when watching cable. It also has a  tendency to make non-digital pictures look pixelated. If you don't watch a  digital source exclusively in a dark room, you're better off with a much  cheaper curved Trinitron.
It is really amazing about the size of the memory, it even smaller than  what I saw from the web, but the downsize is the capacity, I think it would  be nice to have at least 16MB or bigger so that we don't keep so many  pieces
I read the short description of the product, then there is no Specifications what so ever mention or found to this item.I would like to say for any upgrade around a $100.00 to achieve 300 to 400 MHz and of course enough Ram is sufficiant to run windows without crashing or locking up, and yes, minimum to keep up the moderate gaming apps. What I need is the required voltage settings (Core Volts) and frequency range and multiplier set. Also, the Front Bus speed... Well, that's the bottom line, Oh, one more thing the 'pin' count. Thanks 'trd55'.
I guess you get what you ask for. The RAM is what I expected and performed as I had imagined. Worth the money!
While these can be a very useful device you need to be careful about where you buy and what you buy. Many of the older MIVO 100 can be set up to use any dial up ISP but later ones are locked to Earthlink and it seems they are discontinuing their service. I bought two on eBay for $10 ea plus S&H; - these are the models with the Yahoo function (now abandoned) and I can configure them to my local ISP. If you need support there is a Yahoo group which supports them (search for 'mailstation') where tips are swapped. Models other than the MIVO 100 are unlikely to be configurable as is, although work is progressing on reflashing all models so they can be used as a small computer as well as a mail device. BTW, they also have a send only fax system built in which can be used no matter what.All in all a device with potential . . . . but!
You can get the ivory colored one for a lot less (I got it for about $...).  Is the company trying to get rid of its excess stock?  There is a new model cooking, as you will see at the CIDCO site, the Mivo line which has rounder edges, more &quot;ergonomic.&quot;  Otherwise, it looks like the same features with maybe a few extras.  I don't know if the customer support will be better for this model though-?Good luck and be sure to CHECK THE LOCAL ACCESS NUMBERS before you buy!  (Bug Cidco Customer Service until they annoy you or you annoy them in order to get this information beforehand.) Local toll calls are more expensive than long distance calls these days (isn't that crazy?), so if you don't live near a local dial-up number, you may be better off dialing to another state!  Otherwise, get the JVC HC-E100 which is based on the same concept and has a toll-free dial-up number for $.../month.  The only thing is that it is a rather small item so the keyboard may be difficult to use; hence, the service is called, &quot;Pocketmail.&quot;
I expected more. Minuses: The Jog/Shuttle dial doesn't work that smoothly. The front panel display is small and only displays the time. The remote is large (hard to hold in one hand) and the buttons are small and confusing.  Record programming is non-intuitive and frustrating. One-touch-record and  tracking controls are not on the remote (the buttons are on front of the  VCR) Plusses: Reverse slow motion (thru Jog/Shuttle) Other features (such  as universal remote, front A/V inputs, index and time search, and  high-speed rewind) are fairly standard now days. Overall it's just average.
When my Sony 53&quot;XBR300 went nova and I was told by fourrepair men that it would cost too much to repair...I wentshopping and I came across these reviews. As most of the the reviews said that the picture was the best they have ever seen I thought that I would save.... Now I wish that I had spent the extra bucks and got another XBR300. .... My equipment is top shelf with a Sony DVP-S7700 connected with Monster component video cables and I use a Sony satellite system (SAT-A50, refined with a REPLAYTV. Selecting the picture mode from the presets was not much help as the &quot;Vivid&quot; selection was worthless, the &quot;Standard&quot; was the factory preset, too bright. The &quot;Movie, Personal 1 and 2&quot; modes can be adjusted but getting warmth and sharp is next to impossible, at least on the set I got. One of the nice touches on the V80 was the convergence adjustment, which is automatic. As I don't use cable or the sound from the tv very often I won't review those features. So, maybe it is the set I bought and maybe it is the best I can expect for the price. I did not buy it for the whistles and bells: I really bought it for the monitor (CRT) and that is my disappointment.
Recently,Dolby Digital surround sound has overtaken its predecessor,Dolby Pro Logic. It provides a dramatic upgrade in sound quality and realism over the analog Pro Logic. Initially,very expensive,it is now available in many  moderately priced Home Theater receivers.
I bought this VCR brand new from Circuit City for $299. The features are plentiful and the ease of setup is there.  However, I noticed this model likes to spit the tape back out at me, and will not properly turn off, after putting a tape in.  There's a lot of &quot;noise&quot; when recording in any mode other than SVHS/SP, ie, EP.  I have had this VCR for no more than 3 months and it will not play tapes anymore.  I would suggest to anyone purchasing a VCR to not buy this one.  Although it works great for the first month, it will not work properly after that.
I ordered this as a gift for my brother because it says it comes with everything and the price is great.  Unfortunately, &quot;everything&quot; does not mean what it implies.  The keyboard is not included so now I have to order a keyboard for him which will come later.
got the product quickly. it was a different webtv model than picture.Webtv is just a backup for the backup. order was for a phil.mag. webtv plus mat976a1, recieved phil. mag. webtv mat960a101
When I started looking at PDA's,  I was initially attracted to the Casio and the Jornada because of their color screens and features not found on the Palm machines.  Long story short is that ultimately the PDA I bought was a Palm Vx.  What was important to me was size,  battery life,  and  functionality.  I want a name now!  Windows CE is still slow no matter how  fast a processor you put in the machine - which kills the battery life in  the meantime.  If I'm travelling I have my portable computer to do the  other things that a CE machine can do.  For day to day life,  I don't know  where I would keep a larger CE device.  My Palm Vx has never faltered or  skipped a beat,  the beam feature is great,  there's lots of free software,  and it lasts a week on one battery charge even playing Subhunt more than I  should.  Have you seen avantgo? You can download your news when you  hotsync.My conclusion:  If you travel alot and don't carry a portable  and you don't mind have to carry a charger with you the CE's may be the way  to go.  Otherwise save yourself the hassle and get a Palm or a Visor.
I have a palm V, and I am seriously considering switching over- It would be nice have 100MBs, music, voice recorder etc... Its just that the thing looks so big- not exactly wallet sized.
The two line, multiple headset capability drew me to this unit.  The price is good compared with the Siemans gigaset, but the designers skimped in a few useful areas.  The first is the memory.  The unit's address book holds  only 10 permanent one touch numbers which is far too few.  The CID memory  hold about 30 numbers which is better.  Second the CID display is only 2  lines so it doesn't show both the ID and the phone number on one screen.  There is a cumbersome scrolling procedure but they should have just added a  third line to the display like my Sony.  Finally, the setup and use of the  phone is far too complicated.  I have experience with setting up phones and  other elctronic equipment, yet this set up challenged me.  Overall just a  cumbersome model but the price is right and the multiple headset feature is  attractive.
I want this product so bad I can taste it.Problem is, it appears that it is useless to use it with windows ME. Customers, no matter where they go, seem to have no choice but to assume that if the requirements say the product works with 98, then it will work with ME. The reason is that hardly anyone bothers to mention ME, whether it is compatible with their product or not.ME may not be the most reliable OS but MANY MANY people have it.The situation is ridiculous.
{buy it if you're physically smaller person or 4 kids}Okay Ive had 3. The speakers rock..Cross them with an audigy sound card and they hit you at about 100 watts at ground zero but when your out of chair they sound less than 20 watts. You're IN the game when you are in the chair....But the chair design will make you turn japanese, the floor is more comfortable. Unfortunately it has design probs. IE ya booty will go numb in an hour. The pole from the center of the seat will drive right through the plastic swivels at its base and scrape the floor. All three chairs have done this in less than six months each. The telescope breaks under normal 180 lb male use and compacts to the lowest level. Low rider. Want to guess what a 300 pounder does to it? (thats +135 kilos to our civilized friends) If you are a 180 lb male expect to get less than a year of listening joy.  If your girlfriend decides she doesn't like the way it looks you can always try my approach, put her in the chair and play Nine Inch Nails, "Like An Animal" :-)
I purchased this device mainly because I work for a company that does Windows CE development. It's not a bad product, but it will never get Palm owners to throw away their PDAs.It's full featured, but it's just not a  quick to access the individual applications. I can sync info just as easily  with Office 2000 with my Palm. Maybe if I hadn't used a Palm first I'd fall  in love with the Compaq, but I'm spoiled by the quicker response of the  Palm (not to mention I've been using a Palm Pilot since day one and Palm  graffiti is permanently burned into my brain!)It's also still just a  little big larger than the Palm V, which bugs me. Still, the voice recorder  is a nice touch that the Palm doesn't have. Everything else is just  overkill for me, though.
Got this for my Visor Edge. Fit pretty well and easy to apply. I like the feel of the surface. It does degrade the quality of the display but I think it is worth it. HOWEVER, my Visor Edge crashed whenever I spent a lot of time writing on the screen. Nothing can revive it, I've tried soft and hard resets! Until I peeled the cover off the screen then it comes back to life! So BEWARE before you get this. It may be just down to my Edge.
I was distressed to see this product listed under the Palm IIIc accessories. I have used this product for a year with my Palm IIIx and it's great. So, I tried it with my new Palm IIIc. It really distorts the  display. In fact, if you go to Concept Kitchen's web-site, they say to not  use this with the Palm IIIc. They are working on one for the Palm IIIc.  Hopefully it will be out soon.
Contrary to what some have written, I did not find this product to be  worth the money.  Yes, it cuts glare somewhat and yes, it does protect my  screen from scratching.  However, I find putting it in place straight and  without bubbles to be almost impossible.  Also, my graffiti recognition  rate seems to have decreased since installing the WriteRight.  I think I'll  just go back to using Scotch Magic tape.
This is a great idea for a product. Especially for those who bear down a bit too hard with their stylus. Unfortunately, light refraction can cause some issues when you're writing on the pad. It does help to decrease scars on the screen, but it can also be very frustrating to work around.
I agree with most of the other reviews here. The writeright reducesvisibility of the screen and is tricky to put on correctly, but adds protection and a better writing feel.I too have cut the covers into small strips to cover the Grafiti writing area only. Just too much screen degradation for me to keep the screen covered on my Palm IIIxe. But very useful for the Grafiti area - where most writing takes place.All in all, I wish they made ones specifically for only the grafiti writing area. Also, these are overpriced - but you won't find them cheaper anywhere.
I suggest applying the film to the graffiti area only. On my previous PDA's this was the only area of the screen which was scratched eventually. I put one on my new visor three months ago, and it is still fine. By my calculation, at this rate my current supply will last until 2017. A bargain.
