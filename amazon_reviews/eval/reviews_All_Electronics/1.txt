Very dissappointed in the mandalas - they are all colored in.  I wanted mandala designes with new ideas and maybe a few colored in. I did not want to see a bunch of your completed pictures.
I recived the item a week later, and it only work for a month. Unfortunately I live in another country so I could never cliam for a replacemente
didn't work at all, didn't recharge the phone, i was disappointed because i thought it would be an effective recharger during emergencies enough said
If you purchased the Propel SGH-A767 don't waste your money on this item.  For one thing it DRAINS the battery instead of charging it.  When I compared it to the charger which came with the phone, the adapter isn't even the same.  It's too narrow.  What a waste of money!
Update: Tried to use it a 3rd time and it didn't even connect. New AA and everything. It was a good charger until it stopped working. GO FIGURE! Didnt expect it to stop working after the 2nd time...(Old Review)This is a pretty good backup charger. I put it to the test and ran my phone until it died, then hooked up the charger and saw how much it charged it. It got to about 6% with the phone on standby, which I don't think is that bad considering its being charged by a single AA battery. It'll allow you to use your phone for at least an hour or two depending on how you use it. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:- You can charge your phone anywhere- Its small and light weight- Great for emergenciesCons:- It can get pretty toasty. Not enough to burn your hand though. You can tell the battery is starting to wear down when it starts to cool off.- Sometimes the connection is a little fussy. Its best to hook it up where it wont be moved.- When the battery is about to die, it will turn the charge on and off, which is a little strange in my own opinion.Over all its worth the price if you need to make that extra call but you're stuck without your charger or there's no plug around you if you do happen to have your charger. You can easily use a rechargeable battery with it so you don't have to keep buying new batteries for it. 4/5 stars because of the connection issue it has. Maybe its just mine, but it does its job.
There first time I tried to use this unit, my Droid battery was at about 29%. I plug the charger into the Droid; the LED on the charger flashed on and then off. The charge LED on the Droid flashed on when the charger LED was off, and off when the charger light was on. There was no charging accomplished. I later tried the unit when the Droid was almost fully charged, the charger LED lit and the Droid LED lit, and both stayed lit. I came back a few minutes later, and a message on the Droid display warned that an inappropriate charger was connected and must be disconnected to avoid damaging the Droid. The charger is now resting comfortably in a waste facility in the desert.
I bought 2 of these for my husband and I because we hunt so we are in the woods a lot. When I got them only 1 worked properly, you can see that they are cheaply made which I was not expecting a lot due to the price. But when we plugged them into our phone we constantly got a pop up window saying to unplug the charger because it was not compatible with the phone,and when you close the window it just comes right back. plus while the pop up window is up, which is almost at all times, our phone did not charge at all. Over all I would not suggest this piece of junk to any one.
Phone gives a message about unrecognized cable when this is used and the phone does not seem to charge. I do have to look further on the web to find info about fixing the problem- but I should not have to.
I used it twice before it broke. The connections for the battery were a bad fit as was the cap
Ordered this and it arrived a week later, just in a padded mailing envelope. No paperwork or return information.Was it a used item?  Doesn't fit my Samsung Phone so its going into the trash.  Buyer Beware!
This charger is a great idea, but it will not plug into any of our phones.
So I'm like one of they best when it comes to putting electronics together, and I order this wire looking to make the impossible, possible by taking wired rhino subs and converting them into RCA sub woofer input. My receiver won't hit no type of bass unless its a sub input. I got the wires to work as I wanted to but you have to be completely quite to hear anything meaning these wires don't hold nor push any type of power let alone e nought for what I wanted them for. I had to pick a star but if givin the choice I would of not pick a star at all waste of time
Worthless!  Does not work.  I should have know better.  One AA battery cannot even provide enough power to do anything.  My phone kept saying that there is not enough power to charge phone.
Broken first day, didn't even try to tinker with it just tried to put a battery inside, won't light up red at all, doesn't charge phone, waste of money.
I actually bought two of these, tried both rechargeable batteries and regulars, its red light would go on, but the droid charge light never lit up.
These plain dont work. I bought one for my evo 4g and it said the current was too low to charge it.
First of all this device didn't come with any literature or instructions.  When it arrived I put a brand new battery in it, one I tested in a mini flashlight first.  Last night, I plugged my phone into it when I went to bed.  The red light came on and the Droid lit up.  However, it never showed that it was charging.  Needless to say, when I woke up this morning my phone was dead.  What a waste of my money.
This emergency charger does not work with the motorola milestone. I doesn't have adequate current to initiate the charging routine on the milestone. Responsive seller
It doesn't work. There is a loose connection somewhere and can't get it to charcge my phone. I love the idea and it would have been great if it worked.
This product didn't work for me, but this company I bought it from was amazing to deal with!  They were quick to respond to my complaint, and issued a RMA, and refund as soon as Item was received back.  I will buy from them again as things like this happen.  Kudos to the Store!Mac
this thing doesn't work on ANY Motorola phone (or any other phone for that matter that I tried).  the return policy for this vendor is such that the cost to ship it back would be more than the item.*** DO NOT BUY THIS !!!  ***
I have a Nokia N900 cell phone which goes through electrical power like it was a Saudi Sheik, so I have to have charging ability all of the time.  But there will be times when I need power and don't have a wall charger or other similar device handy and a battery charger like this one would be just the thing to have.  And it would be too if it worked...Taking a 2nd look I should have realized this wouldn't work.  It only uses one battery, which is 1.5 volts, and the battery for the N900 is 3.7 volts.You probably want to look elsewhere.
Unless the cable that was supplied was defective, this unit does not work on the "N" Series smartphones. It does recharge Nokia 6030 (non usb)units with another cable so the basic electronics are not at fault. As shipped (supporting Nokia "N" Series smartphones) I cannot recommend this unit.
Put a AA battery in.  Plug it into the phone.  The battery icon indicates that it is charging, but after half an hour there was less power in the battery that before I plugged it in.  Plugging it in when the phone is on forces the display to light and prevents it from turning off, creating more of a drain on the battery.
Sitting in a drawer since the day after I got it. Charged my phone for 9 hours overnight. It fried the entire brand new battery and my phone was only partially charged. never used it again junk
I got my charger in the mail today and i was excited until i opened the package only to find that it came with the wrong adapter. The displayed show what i thought was a  micromini tip i think i got one for a iphone. Could someone tell me where i can get the right one.  I think this little gadget will work just find once i get want i need
an emergency cell phone charger is a great idea. just don't get this particular product! it fell apart less than 30 seconds out of the box.first, the plug into the cell phone end didn't fit into my cell and the black base snapped.second, the plastic twist top wouldn't stay screwed in with the battery in the metal case.so... i superglued everything back together... and it still doesn't work....
[...]At this time I have had no success in the product working as advertised.Only once did it even light up as if to charge.  At that time,  I had to go ahead and connect to the wall charger.  I've replaced the battery, but it has not even started to charge again.I am going to buy more new batteries and try again.  But at this time, I would not recommend the product.
I purchased two of the so-called 'global phone rechargers', neither worked. Don't waste your time with this item. Gave the one star rating only because I couldn't complete the review without doing so.
The item does not work. I replaced the battery with a brand new battery and left it overnight. The next morning,the phone had lost its charge. The supplier instructed me to plug into the phone until the unit gets hot, and then remove it, he instructed me to do this several times which still did nothing. I complained and was sent a new item. This item gave me the same result. The supplier asked me to send both back for a refund. I mailed them, and have still not received a refund or correspondance.
Waste of money  - never worked even a little bit.Wish I had never ordered it.  Costs more to send it back, so I just threw it away.
Cheap product .cheap price. This doesnot work. Especially if your battery gets so low.There is no instructions. So you cant tell if the mifi is being charged or not.Its better to get one for more moneyvor take the adapter
When attached to my cell phone the power pulsated about once per second and the phone never booted into charge mode. Perhaps it would work for a device with lower current draw but it did not work, as advertised, for my phone.
Either it's just junk or broke before I received it never got to use it nor was able to return it
I purchased this a week ago tried it HORRIBLE! TAKE MY WORD FOR IT! Instead of charging the battery it kills it. Doesn't do a thing! You plug it in it says phone is charging ITS NOT! My battery was 50% when i put it in came back 10 mins later the batter was 42% and dropping. I'm returning mine. Waste of money!
This product is a great concept but a AA battery apparently just does not have enough juice to make it an effective charger. I have a Boost Mobile Samsung Galaxy Prevail SPH-820 mobile phone. I tried alkaline, lithium max and NIHM rechargeable batteries. Unfortunately, none of these worked to any significant degree. It is possible I guess that it may be a compatibility problem with the phone, although the description said it is universal. I now use a 9 volt battery charger which works great. The 9 volts is equivalent to six AA (1.5 volt) batteries however.
This worked only one time and then never again.  I kept trying new batteries and it failed to work.  Had a guy look at it and they said it burned out.  Only one time I used it
solo pude usarlo una vez, pues la rosca para apretar la tapa que sujeta la pila se corrio y no hace contacto y no carga mi celular.si pudiera devolverla lo haria
This product stinks...I bought it and put in the batteries and it worked for about one day.  The next day it started to get so hot and it smelled like there was something burning inside.  It got so hot one day as I was charging it in my car that I had to throw it out the window to avoid burning my hand.  Needless to say I could not return this item because I threw it out.  I don't reccomend this item at all.
Bought this with a view to extend my phones battery life with the Aa battery this thing takes . I tried it out and it lasted a mere 30 seconds , all it's good for it the flash light .
I agree that it is a good TV for the money when it WORKS. I bought this model about 3 years ago.Half year after the warranty expired, the TV suddenly couldn't power up. And I need to pay $120 to change a IC chip. Avoid RCA as possible as you can.
During my first few months of owning this TV, I would have agreed with the other reviewers that it was a great TV for the price.  One month after the labor warranty expired, the power system failed.  The authorized RCA repairman presented me with a $250 repair estimate, which is only [a little]  less than I paid for the TV in the first place (not purchased from  amazon.com), so I have to replace the TV.  I will not be purchasing another  RCA.
I will never buy another RCA TV again in my entire life and also in my after life.  I bought two 32 in RCA TV and in less than 3 years none of them works.  They won't power up, the TV's were in different households and in less than 3 years they are dead.  When I called RCA/Thomson basically what they told me that I'm screwed without any further assistant.  DON'T EVER, EVER BUY AN RCA TV.
Before the warranty period was up, I should have returned this item, but I didn't have an extended warranty.  No matter: the unit would have died in the next (and last) year of the ew, so effectively, the unit was destined to two years' service.  First came the volume control (erratic) then the tray (it became erratic after the first year).  It's almost as if RCA programmed the failure--to what end is a mystery, as I would/will never buy another RCA product.  If there's anything good to say about this item, well, how's this: remember that scene from "Shawshank Redemption," where Tim Burton locked himself in the warden's office and played an operatic aria on the prison sound system?  I bought that soundtrack, which featured Barbara Bonney hitting a note one octave above High C, and my Bose Wave system could not handle it.  But the 8065 could. So, a few moments of joy on that unit.  Too bad RCA didn't relegate this unit to better quality, because I've seen numerous reviews of failure of the same functions I experienced.  The tray's manufacturing could have used a better servo motor, and the digital volume control must have used parts made in Lower Slobovia.  Whatever, the thing fell apart during a time when my other electronic items continue to purr.
I read the comments, I must say that I had no luck with this model RCA RP8065 I bought ... from the outset not to make it work and send it to repair not get the spare is the opital pick-up what is wrong and not know where to buy
i purchased this product from a large electronics store, and not even a year later the laser is shot.  Now all it does is sit in a box under my bed and collect dust.  This product is decieving. The price is good, but not  worth the risk of it breaking on you in less than a year
This is the biggest piece of junk audio equipment I have ever owned, It lasted about one year before it didn't work anymore. Do yourself a favor and spend a couple of extra bucks and buy a quality brand. RCA's audio  products are all cheap junk like GPX, but with the RCA name slapped on  them.
I received this &quot;player&quot; as a gift for Christmas in 1998. Within a year, it was completely shot and would not even read or play CD's, even brand new CD's. It wouldn't play in any mode. I had previously owned a JVC  single CD player for nine previous years and never had any problems. I  don't care how attractive this player is because of the price, it you spend  money on it you will be very disappointed when it fails to operate. And I  didn't operate the player in adverse conditions. Cheap junk. The salesman  tried to tell me that the laser eyes have changed in the newer models but I  still say this player is not worth crap.
I was very pleased to get it in under a week. I would have remained pleased had the thing worked! You look at a ting like this cd player and the reeviews are really split, and I suppose that's becuase the thing is cheap and at that price I think if it breaks in year so what.  But the problem mine had was the exact problem eveyone gets in a year, the player just flashed 'no disc'. This really is enough to get you pretty upset when you've waited a week....
DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT! This is one of the worst Home Theater systems on the market. Shortly after buying it, I encountered the same problems most buyers of this unit have had; (1) Shuts off for no reason, (2) Sound suddenly pops or cuts out all together (3) After time, completely stopped working!THEN, THE FINAL INSULT IS...Once it dies for good,  YOU CAN'T GET THIS THING FIXED! When I took it in for repairs I was told it cannot be fixed unless they buy [an expensive] RCA repair manual.... When I tried to contact RCA, the customer service is TERRIBLE! They offer no support for their product. After being frustrated with the customer service operator I went to the website to find a "authorized RCA repair center" as they suggested and THE SEARCH FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK! ...RCA RT2300 is a nightmare! You have been warned!RCA is known for putting out shabby electronics, and this is no exception! I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER RCA PRODUCT AGAIN!  RCA, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
Dealing with Philips customer service is like pulling teeth...and since I just had a tooth pulled, I know what I'm talking about.  The docking system for the Nino 510 is terrible-50% operational rate.  A crack formed on my  touch screen and grew all the way accross it.  Of course it had to be my  fault (even though Nino is always in my hand or in its case).  When I ask  if 100% of the Ninos coming of the Korean assembly line had no cracks form  in the touch screen, the answer was no.  But anyway, $177 to fix a $300  unit. Don't buy one.
I bought the nino because I thought it was a great bargain.  Well...I guess like with everything else you get what you pay for.  When I took it home and tried to sync it with my desktop nothing happened.  6 hours later and hours of frustration with customer service and we (Phillips cust. service) and myself came to the conclusion that the problem was with the docking cradle.  I brought the product back and exchanged it for another one.  I took it home and had the same problem.  Needless to say I switched to the Cassiopeia and it worked fine.  Anyway could have been bad luck but 3 products that don't sync make me question the product's engineering.  Conclusion:  Pay the extra money and go with a product besides the Nino
This product not only did not clean my Acura's DVD player which was kipping only slightly, it has permanently caused it to mal- function and it is not reading any DVDs of CDs at all. It sure cleaned me out !!!! Don't risk your expensive player with this unreliable product.
This product was really bad. it broke my superdrive of Macbook pro at all, which drove me mad a couple of days. Finally I returned to amazon for refund.Don't buy it.
Might as well save your money and buy a new cd/dvd player. I have an imac and this did not fix my problem.
Most of the sound tracks did not work so I decided to contact Allsop Support.  However, Allsup does not have product support, nor does Amazon.  (even though there is a link stating that there is free 30 day technical support on this item).
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Not only did it not work properly, it completely DESTROYED my DVD player. Now I must purchase a new DVD player!!!
The overhead DVD player in my vehicle was having problems reading discs, had about a 50% success rate, so I figured, like the rest of the vehicle when I bought it used, it was dirty.  I bought the Allstop cleaner, inserted it, followed the directions, and now the DVD player won't play any discs at all.
I try to use this to my GPS DVD--(Old Technology).  Did not work at all...
This did not work for my over 10 year old cd player. It is installed in a hot tub which is why I was trying to clean it. It plays a part of cd and then gets scratchy like its dirty. This cd cleaner did not spin at all.
Tried using this in my Zenith DVD recorder but could not get the disc read - just kept giving a disc error.
Purchaed this supposed DVD/CD cleaner to clean my Sony and JVC DVD Player/Recorders. Saw NO improvement on DVD's and would NOT even load on either of my Pioneer 6-Disc Mag Players. Useless product and big waste of money. I had used Memorex's OptiDisc DC/DVD cleaner previously, but wasn't completely satisfied with cleaning, so was hoping this cleaner would be better based on reviews. But it was not. Do NOT Buy.
I should have heeded the review that stated this is for CD's only. The advertising is untrue. I tried it in my DVD player and after 1 minute it began making a scratching sound. Do not buy this for a DVD player.
Some items repair problems caused by excessive use or lack of maintenance; concerning this type of issue, who knows ....in may in fact work for some.However, I am beginning to realize that once your system displays some type of problem, it's time to replace.I purchased this product along with a backup product (just in case- due to the positive reviews).Sometimes I believe that people just post reviews to kill time rather than truly tell about whether a product truly works or not- which to me would defeat the purpose of "UNBIASED" reviews!I ordered the Alsop lens cleaner for use with a 5 cd carousel mini system. And as a backup tool (even though other reviewers stated it is only good for a short period of time, but it does get the job done whereas others have failed (CD DR. Lens cleaner). My first order came in and I tried to let it run once. Attempted to play my MP3 cd's (5 separate ones) in the "random" setting. They just spun and spun aimlessly looking for a file it could play- NOTHING. I then played the Alsop CD 8 consecutive times just to see if it would make a difference- NOTHING. I threw out my MP3 CD's assuming they may have gotten scratched or damaged in some other way. Prior to  reaching my garbage, I decided to try the cd player in my bedroom- playable (same 5 MP3 CD's in "random" setting) without any problems. Just to be sure, I burned 5 other MP3 cd's then tried to play them on the original Sharp 5 CD carousel mini system- skipping, pausing every few seconds, stopping and automatically trying to locate another track to play (150 MP3's per Cd times 5 Cd's- 750 total songs to choose from and no more than 2 songs would play, but not without skipping or pausing several times. I tried with 2 MP3 CD's just to rule out loading too many files- NOTHING. I then resorted to my backup solution (what I thought could only be used a few times at best but at least reviewers said the product worked whereas others didn't- NOTHING. I returned them to Amazon and they offered to send me replacements of both products to see if it was just a bad batch of products I received. I thought... it's worth a try. Tried the same exact process with each lens cleaner- nothing!I could care less about maximizing my sound quality through some idiotic series of test tones, etc. I dj; I am well aware of how my music should sound. I can't understand why these companies just can't focus on the intended issue the product was purchased for.3 brushes, 8 brushes, carbon edge- this all means nothing if it is not effective. Want to impress me? sell a product that does what it says it should do and is marketed as such! I wish I could give this along with the other product I purchased a -5 simply for trying to impress with a bunch of unwanted features yet not concentrating more on the intended purpose. Hopefully I will have better luck burning my MP3 files to DVD. After all, 24 bit D/A conversion beats .......what.......... 1 bit via CD format?!
Claims to be a DVD lens cleaner, when in actuality it is only a CD lens cleaner.  Most people don't know that there are 2 specific lasers on each unit, 1 for reading dvd's and 1 for reading cd's.  This one had no cleaner for dvd laser and had only functionality to clean cd laser.
The DVD player at home is skipping and pixillating with new and older DVDs, so I was looking for something that might clear it up. Reviews suggested this was the very thing. It was not. Once in the machine, it simply played the same voice message over and over and over and over that the device was wonderful - but nothing else happened - ever. I will return it and look for something else. This might or might not work fine for CD player, but my issue is with a DVD player, so back to the drawing board.
After using this product, my multi file cd player does not work at all.  I have never experienced any problems with the unit.  I purchased the cleaner for preventative maintenance.  Now I am left with an expensive useless piece of equipment!
I purchased this item in hopes of cleaning 3 CD players & 1 DVD player.  I used it in our 99 Honda Odyssey cd player & now I either get ERROR or when it does decide to play, it only sounds normal for a few seconds before becoming 'scratchy' and unrecognizable.  I have tried numerous cds after using this product with the same results.  So, now I am faced with spending MUCH more than the $10 paid for this product to replacing the entire CD player- that was working prior to using the ALLSOP Ultra ProLens Cleaner (it just needed to be cleaned). Needless to say, I did not use it on any additional systems.  I am not happy about this outcome & would NOT recommend this product.
The T.V. has a tendency to shut of by itself and to get it to turn back on, you have to hit the side of it really hard. The left speaker also doesn't work and the input in the back tends to make a fuzzy picture. I  wouldn't recomend it, but it's up to you if you want to buy it.  To try and  solve this problim, I took it to my local T.V. repairman and he said that  it could not be fixed. His words were &quot;Its just the result of lazy  workmanship. People just don't take the time that they used to when making  their products.  U.S. workers, for the most part just don't take the pride  in their work that they used to.&quot;  He just left the shop, griping and  grumbling.  So unless you want to be lectured by your T.V. repairman like  I was, dont buy this television.
this poor choice will haunt me until i can stomach buying a new VCR.  the user interface, remote or otherwise, is terrible.  compared to my older SOny, i've made a horrible choice.  very hard to program simple recordings.  won't even default to today's date, time, and channel.  sad to say you get  what you pay for.
People who appreciate the funcionality and durability of the Palm unit, rightfully expect that other items put out by Palm (3-Com) should be of equal quality. Obviously, 3-Com is overwhelmed with success and is already forgetting about quality. This pen may look great in the picture, but reality is often stanger than fiction, the fiction being that this is a reliable product. If you want a good pen, look to a quality pen manufacturer like Cross. They have a pen called the DigitalDuo Writer. It is very practical, functional, and durable. 3-Com would look much better if they did their homework before putting out substandard products.
...I was looking forward to a heavy duty, well constructed useful item. This wasn't it. As in the earlier review, it looks kind of cool, but feels like a drinking straw in your hand. It is so light as to feel hollow, doesn't feel like it would stand up to a stiff wind, let alone daily use. Shame on Palm for producing such outstanding products, and then putting their name on a piece of garbage like this. This only receives one star, because Amazon won't allow less.
It's incredible how Palm co. could create this type of pen.  It is very nice.  It looks fabulous on my palm V.  I works fine, the only detail is the function of the pen.  When you trun the stylus to bring out the pen, it  feels as if you can turn it all the way and break it a part.  My stylus in  fact, after two weeks of usage broke and I had to try to fix it and saw the  whole inner functions of the pen.  It is made all out of plastic, but not  the hard good one, but instead the type of elastic, cheap plastic.  I  finally fixed it but i'm fully disapointed with this product.  I still use  it because the functionability of having a pen on my palm helps a lot.  Before you buy it, you better take a look on it... feel it and try it.
I really wanted to play DVDs at home and read some quick reviews and have had good experiences with Creative Labs prior.  I was quite disappointed.Until I installed the dvdr3wup.exe drivers, I always had to  switch to 800x600 before running the Creative Labs software as suggested in  the manual.  Even after loading the software it seemed to be more stable  when running in 800x600. It usually crashes if you try and fast-forward  right after playing a movie.  Just hitting buttons seemed to crash it  regularly so I would always avoid hitting any buttons.  Having Norton  Antivirus running at the same time causes crashes.  Even being that  paranoid, it still crashes!  I am unable to watch certain movies all the  way through.  It always seems to crash on chapter 3 of Ladyhawke and in  several places in American Pie and will not let me watch the entire movie.  When watching 12 Monkeys when it hit the last chapter it started playing  chapter 4.  I had to specifically chose the last chapter to see the end of  the movie.Creative Labs phone support hangs up on you, and they don't  answer e-mail.  This product has really hurt my opinion of Creative  Labs.I have two friends who also bought this product and had the same  problems I had.  We have all switched to Pioneer DVD drives with slot  loader and RealMagic Hollywood Plus decoder cards and are much happier.  I  can not count the times the DXR3 crashed on me in the 3 months I used it.  In the two months I've been using the Holywood Plus it's crashed on me  once.The quality is poorer than my Holywood Plus or Toshiba 3109 when  playing movies.  However, the loopback quality on the DXR3 is better than  on the Holywood Plus.  If you look closely on the Holywood Plus at  1280x1024 or above the text is a little fuzzy.The user interface in the  player is horrid in comparison to the Holywood Plus.
VERY poor after sales service, EXTREMELY slow Drive, Possibly the most cumbersome, poorly designed user interface for the player I have ever seen, and no windows 2000 drivers (waiting 4 months), leaves me wondering how  creative managed to get where it did.  On a positive note, when I got this  for the first time, I was impressed by the picture and sound quality  (accept for the drive which manages to interfere with the sound card  (awe64) ).  And the cambridge speakers I got with it are the most brilliant  speakers I have ever heard.  I completely recommend the speakers (4 point  surround).  I eventually have taken the Dxr3 card out of my system, and am  looking for a better alternative, as I recommend you do.
This is not one of those stories of the bad experience with the a defective product, and it took months for a replacement. It's the answers and solutions I get from tech support for this that are really bad.The product itself was great while it lasted. When I first bought it I had a PC with Win98SE installed. It ran fine, picture quality of DVD movies was just a little scratchy (but negligible) from my monitor, but crystal clear on my flat screen TV. This product also played other formats like MPEG & DAT, which was nice to see on my TV. I was having a great experience and thought highly of this product, UNTIL...I bought my new PC with WinXP installed,... guess what? THERE ARE NO DRIVERS AVAILABLE FOR 2000 or XP!!! Sure they got Beta drivers out... but they are pretty flaky and cause your computer to lock up or not respond. These beta drivers could also cause MCI plugin errors, which basically means you can't use the product at all, except as a regular slow-speed CD-ROM. What annoys me is when you are about to download the beta drivers for the product, there is a disclaimer that says they will not provide any tech support or be liable for any damage the driver causes--download at your own risk, basically. What annoyed me more is, if you ask any technician at Creative Labs when the driver will be released, the answer is, "We do not know." ... "We don't know." ... "We aren't sure yet."When was Win 2000 released? And they still don't have a driver for their extravagant, overly-advertised DYNAMIC EXTENDED RESOLUTION (dxr3) decoder board? It's a wonder how they sell their products. I mean they show off their "new and improved" PC-DVD products every year or so, but they only work with Win 95/98/ME?? It's not like 2000 or XP was suddenly released without warning. Let the world run on Win98 for the rest of their lives to watch DVD's since Creative never knows when their drivers will be released.If I had recieved a better answer rather than, "I don't know," maybe I wouldn't be so harsh on the tech support.
This is one product that we need a &quot;0 Stars&quot; optinon on how do you rate this product, its absulutly horible.  I got it to replace my VooDoo3 2000, thinking it would be better with more video ram, no, it was flickery, and slow, my desktop had lines all over it and i couldnt even run games. Do not buy this card, get a Geforce 2 or some VooDoo.
I purchased this card, mainly for price and lack of research.  I plugged it in.  It does do well for video, for high resolution display, but it cannot deal with 2D games.  It butcherizes them...I mean bad.  In fact, one game would't play untill I went back to the old 4mb Vcard.  The games it  did poorly with were Axis and Allies,and Army Men 2.  My son won't let me  put it back.  Anyone want this card cheap? When you upgrade card it  shouldn't fail on older software.
Anyone out there who is looking for a card that performs even decently well, don't buy THIS one, please!  It BITES!  You can't get diddly for frame rates in any games that don't support Direct3D, and it's OpenGL support is apparently non-existent.  I can't help but feel bad saying this because these fine people here at Amazon are trying to sell it, but I feel  like I have to warn you.  I bought this card for $69 OEM, and it's scarcely  worth half that.  Most 8MB video cards perform better than this one.  If  you are looking for a dirt-cheap video card, you can do a lot better than  the Stealth.  Possibly a Voodoo2 1000.(The V2 1000 with 12MB of graphics  memory performs better than the Stealth with 32MB! ) But if you can afford  it, buy a Voodoo3 3000.  BUT PLEASE,  don't buy a Stealth.  You'll never forgive yourself if you do.(Edit - 17 Oct 2008)It's been almost 9 years since I bought this doggone card.  I'm 26 years old now (I wrote the original review when I was 18... can you tell?) and I still kick myself in the arse whenever I read this review.  I still can't believe I bought this dern thing.  There were people left and right telling me not to.  Ah, but I was a kid and didn't have much money.  I eventually replaced it with a Voodoo3 that I had to save for months to buy.This card still stinks... 9 years later.  If you find one for 5 bucks on eBay... DON'T BUY IT!  Go get a latte at Starbucks!
back a long time ago when I had this card I would get odd colored clouds and everything in Asherons call...obviously an old outdated card now..get a geforce 4 TI, or if your looking for a good card at about the same price, a Geforce 2 GTS
I have had this card for less than a year now, I am getting sick and tired of putting up with it.  The card is extremely unstable around any of the latest Direct X applications.  My system freezes up in any kind of video type application.  I probably restart my system at least 20 times a day.  Upon start up the screen will freeze.  Or occasionally I will lose the card altogether on my system and have a blank screen through boot up.... I am a total gamer, i recently bought Tribes 2, and unbelievably cool game when my card doesn't freeze.  Tribes 2 runs Direct X 8, which when introduced to the Stealth III was not runable 9 times out of 10...
Amazon has the audacity to hawk this as a "gold box" bargain for [money amount]on 01/29/03.  This was a good graphics chip in 1998.  Worth about [money amount]today for a basic system.  Since this card, we've seen the TNT Ultra, then the Geforce, Geforce DDR, Geforce 2, Geforce 3, Geforce 4 and now Geforce 5 subsequent generations of cards.  Bottom line?  It's grossly inadequate for any newer games.Let the buyer beware!!
I had a Viper V770 (non ultra) put in my machine when it was built in 1999.  It was a good card then.  Diamond sold it's graphics card devision, and this card has no factory support for windows XP.  Only generic TNT2 chipset drivers are available for XP.
Geezus, where did they find this one?  Diamond isn't even an independent company anymore.  The Viper V770 Ultra was based off of the nVidia Riva TNT Ultra chipset, this chipset was used before the original GeForce came out.  They are now way beyond this chipset.  I don't know any reason why anyone would want to buy this very old card.
The card and technology are OUTDATED! Diamond Multimedia is OUT OF BUSINESS! It was good back in the day (1999), ...you can get a brand new ...card with twice the RAM and TEN times the power... DON'T BE FOOLED!!!
This is 32 MB. THIRTY TWO. If you buy this, you are insane. You can probably find this elsewhere for a tenth of the price. It's outdated technology, and I'm suprised it hasn't been removed from this website (or had it's price significantly lowered)
This card is not compatible with the HP Pavillion 6330. Despite the cliams of PC compatibility it did not work for me - my computer never recognized it. I went to the PNY site and found out that other products are correct, you might want to do the same before you buy this.
i have owned this controler for 6 months, i can`t use it because i have no drivers? to run it in my system!  thankyou!
I guess I am not along when i say i would really like to rate this game  pad, but can not use it. it seems i need the driver to run it on my  windows98 system. I have tried all the trouble shooting and my game port  works just fine when i plug in my Gravis flight stick but does not  recognize the game pad. does anyone know where to get drivers for this  thing?
First of all, the directions on the website are better then in the booklet you get. The ones in the book skip over steps and basically make it very confusing, to even the experienced gamer.  When I finally got mine to work, the only buttons on my controller that even worked were the direction keys, so I'm returning mine. I never even got to use mine other then making a character walk around, which is boring because I couldnt jump or do anything. I should have went by the other reviews and stayed away from this and just spend more on a better one. Well now I know, and now I have to waste another 2 or more weeks to send mine back ... just to get ...refunded. Let the good times roll.. :(
I saw all the other reviews before purchasing this. What I really wanted was a stylus that was better than the plastic junk that came with my Cassiopeia. And, I thought that this peice of junk would actually fit into my PDA. This is what I was led to belive according to the Casio web site and this site. Well, it doesn't fit, and it won't fit into any PDA, unless you have a PDA the size of you head. It's a complete waste of money. It's cheaply made, and cumbersome. A wooden stick would do better, for writing on paper or your PDA. I can't stress to you enough, DON'T BUY THIS JUNK, unless you enjoy wasting (money).
After giving this system as a housewarming gift, I've been deeply disappointed (and more than a little embarrassed) by the results.  The sound was great, and this very full-featured system was both compact and  elegant in looks - a prefect fit for the condo in which it was being used.  All of that merely adds to our disappointment that the system can't be made  to work at all.Upon delivery, one channel played intermittently and then  not at all.  A replacement base unit arrived very quickly courtesy of  Amazon.com, who helped us diagnose the problem.  The replacement worked for  a few months, but began to fail piece by piece and was entirely out of  service in just a few months.Harmon Kardon factory service has had the  unit for at least two full months, yet they say that they still don't  &quot;have the parts&quot; to fix it.  Maybe that means they aren't  building them any more - which would be good news for unsuspecting  consumers.
The display is excellent - it's a good size and the backlighting makes it legible in most conditions (although having the backlight on really chews up the battery power).  However, there appears to be a design flaw in the  case.  I purchased my 2010c in September 1998, and within 2 months, the  plastic hinge on the left-hand side fractured, making the unit unusable.  I  returned the unit to the Compaq service facility, who replaced it free of  charge.  In May this year, the hinge on the second unit fractured in  exactly the same place.  I'm going to ask Compaq to replace it again, but  the warranty will expire in September, so if the third one breaks, I'm out  of luck.  This is a high-end product with a high-end price tag: this kind  of failure just shouldn't happen.
I have been using a Sharp Wizard for quite a while, but was attracted by the small size of the Rex. I thought for $50, which included a docking station, I couldn't go wrong. WRONG! The Rex is fine if phone numbers and  appointments are all you care about. The &quot;To Do&quot; list is pretty  much useless, unless you enter everything in the software that comes with  the Rex. But what really irritates me is that you can only put in one memo  at a time! The True Sync software lets you have different memo folders: for  example, I had one with French translations (from the Franklin site) and  one with passwords. But they won't go into the Rex at the same time, unless  you mish them all together. Then it's impossible to find anything, because  there is no way to do a search. That sounded so dumb and useless to me that  I called the Rex people, but that's the way it works. That makes the Rex  useless for me. It will be in the auction very soon.
Bought this player for my wife as Christmas present and it has been eating CDs ever since.  It has been to service to be fixed and started eating again almost immediately.  Caveat Emptor! P.S. I didn't buy this online.
I had this unit for just over one year. During that time, it malfunctioned five or six times. Each time I contacted their customer support(over 20 min.average to get someone on the line),they had to reprogram the unit. Shortly after the warranty had expired, the reciever shut down completely. The customer service rep. told me that since the warranty had expired, I would have to send the unit to their repair facility along with a check ... to repair the reciever. Needless to say, I put the unit where it belonged... in the trash.
I received my CD changer as a gift for my birthday,and every since I have received it, it hasn't worked properly, I put up with it because it was a gift, but now I have 200 of my favorite CD's suck in it. I would not advise  anyone to purchase this CD changer.
I use an Olympus C-2000 Z Digital camera. (Buy one from Amazon. They are great.) I use 8 mb Smart Cards and read them into my computer with Toshiba's Flash Path.  (Uses your standard 3 1/2 in floppy drive. No cables  to a serial port! No unhooking mouses etc.)This New Media Smart Card  works fine in the camera, but is not compatible with Flash Path. For me,  that makes it useless. New Media sells its own card reader that you have to  hook up to your computer port.  Flash Path's method is MUCH better.Maybe  there is some way to make it compatible. My e-mail address should accompany  this review.Bob Wisne
To the people who gave this rewinder a good review: Did you actually pay $ 140.00 for this thing. A tape rewinder is a $30.00 item, at most. And that includes profit. There is NOTHING you can put inside a simple rewinder(I've taken them apart. It's a "rubber band drive"), to make it cost that much. You can buy a DVD / tape PLAYER, for that price and those are loaded with electronics. Let's not even talk about the one for $ 170.00
getting the rewinder was a hassle, and when it finally arrived it would not work. All-in-all I was not happy.
The Ambico tape rewinder was a gift to my mom since hers was dying after 15 + years of use.  When she received the rewinder, the cover would not close and the tape rewinded the wrong way.  I called the company and tried to explain the situation. The phone representative would hardly give me a chance to speak.  She never apologized for the product's condition.  I asked not to be charged for the shipping of the returned package.  Her response was that any other company would expect me to pay for shipping the product back, that they are a small company and could not reimburse me for the shipping.  Not only did I receive a product that doesn't work, I paid almost as much to get it shipped to my mother's, and was expected to pay for the shipping of the product back to Ambico.  I'm wondering if I do, would they give the same broken down product to someone else?  The customer service was horrible.  What ever happened to good old fashioned customer service.  This thing is going straight in the garbage.  At least it won't cost me anymore money to do so.
Just unpacked it today and would not rewind the first tape I tried rewinding.  I'm going to return it tomorrow.  Also it wasn'tan Ambico but a Radio Shack.
I received the rewinder and it rewound 2 movies and quit rewinding. I sent it back and was treated really well and the rewinder was replaced. However, this one did the same thing - rewound 2 movies and quit - nothing but a high screaming noise.  I decided to quit trying to get one, as they obviously are defective.
I ordered 2 rewinders, and both broke after a few uses.  I'm very disappointed with this item, and won't spend any more money on it.  I am now without a rewinder.  Can you please send me a rewinder free of charge?
Inconsistent performer. Really wish I tried one of the others.I suspect I shortly must do so. No way I would endorse.
I recieved item broken the motor mount was broken and the belt was to loose my husband took it apart and fixed it. it works fine now
This television set started showing signs of problems immediately after the warranty period expired.  The most significant problem is that the unit would not power on.  If you were patient, sometimes you could get the thing to turn on.After about 3 weeks of this, the television set decided to never power up again.  I only had the television for a little over a year, and it doesn't work.The commercial skip feature does not actually detect when commercials are over.  It is merely a timer.  You have to guess how long the commercials will last.  The set will return you to the station you were watching after the set duration of time has elapsed.Also, if you're sensitive to high-pitch squealing (picture tube arc), this television set does emit a louder noise than most.  It was quite difficult to fall asleep with this television on because it emitted a louder-than-usual (compared to other television sets) high-pitched squeal.  This is often a sign of a poorly manufactured power supply -- which is probably the reason the set no longer will power on.For a television set, save the hassle, and get a JVC, Toshiba, Sony or some other brand, that will continue functioning after the warranty has expired.
I purchased in 1985 a Japanese made GE VCR.  It has performed very well over all these years.  I was very disappointed in this Thompson made GE VCR.  The picture quality in SLP was inferior.  I have seen better picture  quality I think in all 2 head VCRs, and this is a 4 head.  The automatic  clock set did not work.  I don't know why.  The remotes buttons sometimes  clicked, sometimes did not, and sometimes clicked and you got double #'s.  I do not know if all new VCR units are this way but this one does not have  a &quot;tape Counter&quot;.  I could not figure out after you set the  program how to tell the VCR to record that day of not.  I did not see it in  the instruction manual.  I am a college graduate and health professional.  I called GE for an asnwer.  They lost my call three times trying to find an  answer.  When I played  the VCR and saw the picture quality I would  overheat.  I asked others what they thought of the picture quality.  They  said it was blurry.  I returned the VCR back to Amazon.  They were very  nice about it.  I would buy from them again.
Sales list indicates Alternate Channel capabilities. This is not listed in technical data.  Does it or does it not have alternate channel selector ?
I bought this to help alleviate some wrist strain when using my mouse. The pad has an existing depression already in the top of it and is not comfortable to rest my wrist on (not soft enough). I also find the pad restricts my movement of the mouse.  I'd return it, but it would probably cost me as much or more to do... so will count this one up to a good try, but lost (fortunately not too expensive). Would not recommend.
Guess I should have read the reviews before buying two of these to replace my aged mousepads at home and at work.  Neither mouse worked when the mousepad was under it.  I think the material might be too reflective for optical mice, though my coworker's optical mouse had no problems.  Mine aren't off-brand mice either: one is a Dell and the other is a Microsoft.  At any rate, it's best not to risk it if you have an optical mouse, in my opinion.
So, I just bought this laptop mouse pad for school because I left my razer mousepad at home. This mousepad is awful, it's made of cheap materials, the rest feels stiff and uncomfortable, and optical mouses have a horrible time tracking across the cheap surface.
Did not work with my mouse. wrist rest is great but, have to keep another mouse pad over it.
Very cheap mouse pad.  I would recommend trying something different.  Mine started to break after only a few months and it wasnt as comfortable as my old one.
the wrist area is  supposed  to be a soft gel  material  but  it  is a  very  stiff  and  uncomfortable material.
i have 2 different optical mouses that work on my old mouse pad but did not track on this one.  Not recommended for optical devices.
The hand rest is sort of comfortable, but it doesn't conform to your hand shape. Reason: This is not gel. It has foam inside it. I didn't like the pad all that much, so I cut it open and well, there was foam inside it. Belkin, please don't lie that this is gel. It's not. I have uploaded two pictures of the pad. One of them shows the material inside the hand rest, which is clearly foam.
like i said before bad product gel just falls apart hurt your wrist.... Just doesn't help ill prefer going with innovera mousepad
Sitting on the table beside me this thing made my eyes water. Sitting in my bathroom it still filled the bedroom with stink. I have put it outside now and I don't know when I'll be able to bring it back in and use it.
I ordered this mouse pad and it is so black it will not work with an optical mouse!  Buyers beware.  Lasers in optical mice do not seem to reflect from the very dark black material this mouse pad is made of.
This mouse pad does not work with my optic wireless mouse. The material is not condusive and the arrow does not track at all with mouse movements - it is not even close.
It remains to be seen if this will go away, but this thin has some terrible new mousepad smell. Something chemical like Scotchgard gone bad or cheap packaging tape. Plus the gel pad seems to have air in it.Otherwise unremarkable.update:Smells like toxic chemicals. So strongly it can be smelled outside the plastic shopping bag it was tied up in 24 hours ago. The smell stays your hand for an hour after brief contact. This is not good. I'm returning this.
I guess I should have looked closer at the picture.The wrist &#34;pad&#34; surface of this product (bought to replace a fraying older model) is totally concave - just as depicted in the photo. There is virtually no support for your wrist as you use this mouse pad.Very disappointed in wasting the money on this item.
I also loved these mouse pads, have used them for years. Like the reviewer above, I just bought a new one, my third, and found that Belkin has changed them. The quality is entirely different and cheap now. The "gel pad" doesn't give, and I don't believe it's even gel - it feels like cheap foam.
I have small hands. I needed the wrist gel because I do use the mouse a lot and my wrist hurts from time to time. This gel is not by all means soft. I pounded it until I got it to go down a bit. It wasn't down far enough. It raised my elbow which in turn raised my shoulder. Because I liked the material of the mousepad, I just cut out the wrist gel, even though that's why I bought it in the first place.So I thought I could just go with the mousepad part. The chemical smell, horrendous. I left it to air outside for a week. Still smelled bad. I finally threw it away. I have changed my review on this product because of the smell. Yes, the quality of the material is good. The non-stick bottom is good. But the smell is so bad I will not buy another product from this brand again.
I saw another reviewer say this, and I have to confirm that it's true... the rubber used in this product has a strong smell. It gives me a headache. I'm keeping it outside in hopes that the fumes will eventually die down, but the other reviewer stated this probably won't happen. I would return it but it's not worth the trouble. God knows what it's made from! Too bad because otherwise I think this would have worked for me.
I do not like to bad mouth products too much but I need to be honest here. I was not happy with this product at all. As you can see in the product description the pad is labeled as "Gel" it was not gel, rather air and foam. further what i did not like is this pad became dirty and musty fairly quickly. Was not easy to clean, i threw it out within a month. I highly recommend the Innovera Gel Wrist pad, about the same price, far better product. It is gel, and much easier to clean simply by wiping it off... good as new!
when i bought this item i was initially pleased with the product and price. however after using it for about a year i can say that i am very disappointed in the quality of this product.... this is the first review i have ever written, the poor quality of this item actually motivated me to write this review... the wrist rest on the mouse pad and for the keyboard caved in, leaving insufficient support to the point where its making it uncomfortable to use. i have problems with my wrists and bought this to help alleviate stress on the wrist from constant typing and mouse use, but its not doing the trick! buyer beware, this wont last the long haul and you'll need to buy a replacement after the materials in the gel &#34;settle&#34; and the support disappears.
Number one entry in the category: worst surface for my Logitech optical mouse ever. The mouse works better on the table, on a piece of paper, on almost anything. So I imagine it was quite hard for Belkin to come up with a surface that performs even worse than those. Congratulations!
This seemed like a good buy, but the hand rest part where the palm goes has literally caved in.. It's like buying one of those never-deflate pillows and getting one that turns mushy after you use it for  a few weeks. This thing is piece of s***--period.
The gel wrist pad collapsed in less then two months of average use.  I am passed the point of return.
My wife hates this pad, it leaves a bad smell on your wrist, every time she uses my computer I know because she removes the mouse pad or she turns it sideways so she doesn't rest her wrist on the pad, lol. If your using this pad on a smooth wooden table it wont stick, which is a pain when your playing video games, I am looking for a bigger mouse pad without the wrist pad.
This mouse actually hurt my wrist and I just threw it in the trash and use nothing now.  I wish there was a company that knew how to make a comfortable mouse pad :-/
Foam goes flat fast, dosent last very longIt didn't cost much so I guess I got my money's worth.
The material is not good for a mouse pad. My mouse makes a noise when moving on it and it reduces the sensitivity greatly. I am returning it.
This pad is comfortable but the seal that keeps all the gel stuff in the pad comes apart easily. I'd recommend looking for something with more durability.Edit: I had to throw the mouse pad away because the seal came apart entirely and all the stuff on the inside started coming out. BAD PRODUCT
The cushion that is suppose to relieve stress causes me a lot of pain after working for for a short duration. I turn it sideways and use it as a regular pad.
Cheap quality. There are other products with best quality. Don't feel comfortable using this.  Currently is being used as a placemat/coaster in my PC desk. Will not recommend to buy this.
I couldn't stand the smell so I returned it. I recommend getting something else unless your computer is under a fume hood.
I should have read the reviews for this item before buying it. I needed a mouse pad with a cushion because after using a computer for so many hours for so many years, my wrist is getting messed up. I saw this and have used Belkin products in the past and had no issues with them, so I purchased it.As others have said, if you have an optical mouse, this mouse pad simply will not work for you. It constantly hangs up, stutters, moves slowly, etc. It just has a horrible surface area for these kinds of mice and after using it for less than a day I'm going to have to go buy a new one locally, because this is completely unusable. Due to the quality of this product, I will never buy another Belkin product again.
I basically bought this mouse pad solely so I could game for hours without my wrist hurting. I like the gel part, but I don't like the texture of the actual pad itself at all. It feels weird and makes a weird sound when you move the mouse on it. I'm just going to stick to my 5 dollar one from target. I can't really complain about wasting money, though, seeing how low the price is. Try spending 10 bucks more to get a decent mouse pad.
Somehow the surface material does not agree with the sensor on the mouse. It is jittering around like there is static clings and I cannot point the mouse to exactly where I want it. So, it is useless! This is the first time I ever have problems with any mouse pad. Unbelievable.
This LOOKS like the original Belkin WaveRest (which cost $8). Looks only. The material is different. Not as fine or nice. The pad? Not as soft and gel like. Too lame. And what's with the bar under the pad? Why is that there? I can feel it under the pad. It's annoying.I still have an original WaveRest from a decade ago. I'm using it right now. The way to identify an original is that it will have &#34;Beklin&#34; in which at the top with a white oval around it... just like the product image above; however, that is NOT what you receive. You receive a cheaper, inferior version sans oval.Sorry, my friends. I am still looking for a replacement (or original) WaveRest. Out there somewhere there is one for sale, and I'm going to buy it. I'll let you all know if I find it.
I have an optical mouse (the most common type these days) and it did not work on the black surface.  The arm rest felt great, but since I don't have one of the older ball-type mice I could not use this item.
I had to stop using this because I started having wrist pain I never had before. I haven't read about this kinds of pads but now I have and I don't think they are well thought out. Maybe for people who only use the pc for a few minutes a day.
This mouse pad is horrible.  If I could, I&#8217;d give it no stars but you have to give at least one to leave a review.  I&#8217;ve used this exact Belkin style for years and have never had a problem.  The mouse pointer hardly moves, when it does it&#8217;s erratic, and there is something on the pad that makes the mouse drag on it.  I went and got my old one out of the trash and I&#8217;ll use that until I can get to a store.  It&#8217;s pretty worn and looks bad but at least it works.
But now its finally dead, so I got a replacement. Be weary, this product has been replaced with a smelly, cheap imposter. I will be returning this product. I should have listened to others saying this exact same things.
The gel pad, the main reason for buying this product compressed to half its original depth in under 90 days.The discounted price (this now sells for about 65% off original retail) should be a giveaway to potential buyers.I'm looking for a replacement, possibly one with a 'bead' fill.Conclusion: The pad is the poorest quality wrist rest product I have used. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
I  usually love everything I buy from Amazon.  I, like a fool, purchased two of these.  I could not imagine anything being wrong with a mouse pad.  First of all, there is an awful odor to the item and second and most important of all, my mouse does not seem to be working on the pad.  Yes, before you ask, I cleaned off the mouse two times to make sure it was not my fault.  I tried my mouse on the old pad again and it worked fine.  I am going to send back the second pad.  Very, very disappointed in this product.
The part that supports your wrist has collapsed after very little time and after 2 months I am now going to buy a new one.
I've always been a big fan of this mouse pad and recently ordered a new one for my home office. Like other recent reviewers note, this is NOT the same mouse pad Belkin used to make--the quality of it has significantly deteriorated.- The wrist rest is hard and uncomfortable, and the slight dip in the middle is now essentially a hollow space. If you squeeze it, you hear plastic crinkling inside.- The pad itself is much thinner.- The edges are not crimped to keep the layers together; I can see this peeling apart in no time.- Like another reviewer mentioned, the surface material is also oddly reflective, and it makes my mouse freak out (I use a Logitech Performance MX).Compared to the one at my office (which is years old but still works perfectly), this just feels thin and cheap. Guess I'll be moving on to the Innovera mouse pad now.
I like Belkin products, I purchased this (Belkin Gel Mouse Pad), Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 and Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 for work. I like the mouse pad, but the mouse would not even move unless it was off the pad. I ended up using my old mouse pad until I can find a mouse pad that my mouse will work on. I can't send it back, because the cost to return it back is about the same amount I paid for it. SMH. I wish I would have kept my $8.00+.
This item is terrible.  It looks great online, but after 2 weeks of use, it has a permanent indentation where my wrist rests. I am returning this item for a different one, quality is terrible!!!
I would recommend a different product. This thing smells like burned rubber and gave me a terrible headache. I threw it away and would not recommend anyone buy it.
I bought the Belkin WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad years ago and love it (still using at office).  This product has changed and is far inferior.  The pad is thinner and the "gel" rest is very hard!
I've had a Belkin gel mouse pad for 10 years now, and never once regretted my purchase. So of course when I finally needed a replacement the first thing I did was look up the Belkin line and find what appeared to be the same pad. I bought two of them, one for myself and another for my brother, believing we would enjoy the same quality that I had for so long. When the new pad arrived the first thing I did was compare the new one to my old worn pad.The rubber grip on the bottom is the exact same size and as far as I can tell the same material but that is as far as the similarities go. While the original pad has a soft silky fabric on it's surface the new pad seems to be covered in some cheep nylon like material. As soon as I started using it I noticed minor issues with the tracking on my optical mouse. Additionally, while the original has a soft flexible block of gel to cushion my wrist the new one has it's gel pad replaced by what feels like a hard, unyielding, plastic balloon full of air that, after applying considerably more force than simply lying my wrist on it, pushes up in places in response to be pushed down in others.I for one am going to try and get my money back but should that fail I will be cutting it open to see just what it is that is in this so called 'gel' pad. I warn anyone thinking of buying this to reconsider.
PASS ON THIS Mouse Pad Was Very Cheaply made the gel pad lasted about a week it lost it's shape and it went down in the middle
Something to try before purchasing this item....You know those little plastic &#34;pillows&#34; that Amazon puts in the box with the purchases you make??  Try one of those for this purpose!  Worked for me!  They tell you to recycle them, don't they?  Well, there you go!  And they're free!!
The Gel pad is too hard for my rest. It hurts my rest after a while. I tried for two days now. The pain is getting worse. I will either cut the gel pad or donate it. Don't waist your money for this product.
Oh this mousepad STINKS! Literally. I took it out of the packaging and it smells very strongly like burned rubber or something.  I thoguht maybe it would go away, so I left it out for a day, and the next day I could smell it as soon as I walked into the office, so I sent it back.
I got this product because I wanted something to rest my wrist on. I've had Belkin mouse pads before, so I figure this was a safe bet. Unfortunately, this mouse does not work with my mouse, which is a Microsoft Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer. I thought it was the battery at first, so I changed the battery. Then I've tried 3 other Microsoft mice and none of them work on this mouse pad. Do not buy this!!I would return this product, except the shipping is $5+. I think I will just donate it to Goodwill and write it off. Very annoyed!
The wrist support gel area was concave in the center when I received it.  It's completely unusable as basically my wrist gets stuck in the center.  The pad also doesn't lay flat.  I am very disappointed in this product.
I've been using this mousepad at pretty much every job I've had for many years, and it's worked just fine - from regular to wireless mice, optical and not, and it was VERY comfortable. I finally ordered one for home use, and IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT!At first I didn't see the difference or get what the other reviewers were talking about until I borrowed my dad's old Belkin mousepad - they were right! The OLD Belkin wrist support was much softer, and had a real gel feel to it. The new one is MUCH more firm, and almost like a really firm sponge. It's not NEARLY as comfortable as the old gel wrist support and IT DOESN'T WORK FOR OPTICAL MICE ANYMORE! The surface of it is too sleak/glossy. What a piece of crap. I am using my dad's old dusty Belkin mousepad right now as I am doing this review, and I can move my mouse smoothly and comfortably on it - so it USED to work for optical mice. If it wasn't so dirty I'd probably steal it from him and keep it for myself.So now I have to keep my old crappy mousepad on top of this new crappier Belkin mousepad just for the half-assed, tough "gel" wrist support. Looks really ghetto and not something you'd expect from a $15 dollar mousepad. Pretty disappointed since I used to love these mousepads. Belkin totally went McDonald's on us, and is probably going to lose many more customers. Shame.
This mouse pad smells bad like an awful oil refinery.I let it air out in the basement for a month and it didn't help any.I wouldn't be surprised if the odor is toxic.Mine may be may have been stored in a bad location before it was shipped,But either way they one I have is worse than useless.  Can't work with it if you are just going to end up with a head ache.
I purchased this in January of 2013. Belkin must have changed the gel in this mouse pad. It used to be very soft and form fitting to your wrist. Now it uses cheap foam that is hard and hurts your wrist. My decision to go to the store and buy another gel mouse pad was the fact that my wrist is in constant pain from using this. Do yourself a favor and never buy this product. I just came back from the store. Allsop makes an incredible gel mouse pad that is worth every penny. My rating is only at 1 star because it can't go any lower.
This thing is terrible. I don't like the divot going thru the center of the wrist wrest. And the whole thing is stiff and rigid. I have a Fellows gel mouse pad at work and it's one hundred times better. The wrist rest on the Fellows gel mouse pad is really squishy and soft...very unlike this one. Overall, this is very cheaply made! It's worth it to pay a little more for something way better!
This mouse pad doesn't have enough gel to adequately support your wrist.  I plan to return it and get a refund.
They should ban the sale of this product, emits a toxic olo, I regret having bought.The rubber surface emits a toxic odor.
I purchased this because it was reasonable, but unfortunately it was useless. The so-called jelly support shrunk to a depression bordered by two hardened ridges that cause blocked circulation, numbness and pain when using the mouse. If you do not want instant carpal tunnel syndrome, spend a little more and get a real jelly-filled support.Belkin WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad (Black)
Pad was comfortable and worked well; however, was made in China and had an odor that bothered my sinus. Had to return item for a refund.
It was nothing like I thought it would be its not even comfortable! I could of easily saved my money to get one that is more comfortable.. I just don't like the product
Just got this today, 2/21/12, and it is absolutely horrible! This will likely cause you wrist pain. The wrist rest is hard as a rock and not built well. It also reeks like nothing else and smells heavily of chemicals. I usually trust Belkin's products, but this is a piece of crap. Will be buying different brand from now on.
Compared to my last gel mouse pad, this feels like a rock.  My wrist has been hurting after a week of use.  Then entire mouse surface is cloth (lycra?) as well, which isn't necessary with most laser/led mice being produced these days.  It's just going to trap dirt like crazy.
Other buyers noticed how the quality has changed recently, and how the newer ones do not have the belkin logo in an oval. They also noticed how laser mice do not track correctly because of how shiny the surface is. They are completely true. The tracking on this mousepad is terrible. I'm using a mouse that tracks fine on wood, paper, couches, you name it. This mousepad causes the cursor to move as if I was using a carpet for a mousepad. Amazon has nicer gel mousepads. If you regrettably bought the thing, you can turn it 180 degrees and use the wrist pad that way, but it actually feels like a plastic bag with some mediocre foam inside it. You can actually feel the plastic bag inside if you squish it between your fingers underneath.Personally I would rather have a cloth mousepad that was falling apart, instead of this mousepad. The tracking on it is pitiful. Maybe if you're super lucky, a mouse with a higher DPI laser would work just fine. Mine is a Logitech M305. But please just get some other mousepad.I will update this review if spray-painting the surface improves the laser tracking. I'll bet it will. I don't even mind the potential smell since this thing smells like chemicals to begin with.
This looked exactly like the mouse pad I was replacing, but the the laser optical on my mouse doesn't work well with it and it's been sitting on my office floor since the day I got it... too inexpensive to return.
I couldn't use my microsoft mouse with this mouse pad. The cursor is not running on the screen. I cut it and just using the waverest part. Don't spend your money on this product.
From what I understand, to avoid carpal tunnel you are supposed to use a mousepad like this which will keep your wrist flat while using it.Only the &#34;bump&#34; on this product comes up way too high, causing pain when I try to use it since my arm is held in a weird position- straight up from the mouse instead of lightly resting against my desk.My office gives these to all employees and it took me forever to get an opportunity to &#34;give&#34; mine to someone who unfortunately didn't have one in her cubicle.
This thing is awful. I got it because I was resting my wrist uncomfortably on the desk and causing some carpal-tunnel syndroms in my hand. Using this has actually be WORSE than the desk itself. This thing is hard as a rock and makes my hand go numb immediately. Awful product that I am not happy with.
The gel cushion wears off after a couple days of light use... I highly recommend you buy a better quality mouse pad.
My Logitech Cordless Optical mouse works better on the table surface than on this mouse pad. In fact it works better on almost any surface, including my sofa. A waste of money for an optical mouse.
I was really surprise when the outer cover got slit and broke after just normal use of browsing the web and just sitting on my computer desk.  I had to put a paste on it to attach the cover to the actual platform. So buyer beware.
ok first of all the mouse pad is smaller than you think, which is bad if you are going to game with it.Second, the synthetic material they used feels really nice to the skin and is the main reason why I picked this mouse pad.However, it is easily the worst material possible as a mouse surface. I CANNOT use ANY wireless optical mice on this surface. I tried 3 and the mice stop responding when used on this surface.Also from what I can tell, it causes a LOT of friction which means it takes more effort to move the mouse across the pad. I can actually HEAR the mouse when I move it around.The only positive feedback I can give is the shape,size, and feel of the wrist support. which is exactly what I was looking for.In the end, I cut off the pad area from the wrist support and stitched my old mouse pad onto the wrist support.seriously tho... a mouse pad that doesn't work? wtf?
low quality item..i used only 2 month... broken condition...gone trash can!!!mouse pad inside gel... came out!!!very cheap quality!!!i feel....so bad!!!
I wanted to replace an older pad with a gel rest.  I thought this was a good replacement but the surface does not read my Microsoft optical (wired) mouse.  Not much use to me. Hopefully it will work on my roller ball mouse on my other machine.  Very disappointed and no return because it was opened, of course.
The wrist pad support is foam that over time get stiff and flat.If you want gel, get something else.
Ordered two. Both felt like memory foam. No gel. When you put your wrist on them you hear the crinkle of plastic in side. Not a quality product.
When I put the Mouse above the Mouse pad, the Mouse cannot work smoothly. I tried several Mouses, the result is the same. It wastes my money.
I'm afraid I've gotten cancer just from opening this foul smelling thing.  DO NOT buy this it smells very strong of chemicals and made me sick to my stomach immediately.  I can still taste the smell in my mouth it is so bad!
You can even see it in the picture if you look closely. After a couple days use, the wrist support began to collapse into a U-shape. So rather than providing support, it started creating pressure on the wrist making the pad unusable. I definitely would not recommend.
Please do not buy this product, i read all the reviews of this type of mouses and saw mixed reviews but still most of them have high start rating.So I bought this, Its been 1-2 weeks i have been using this, I SWEAR my whole right arm hurts like hell. My Husband kept on saying that this new mousepad is uncomfortable, but i said Lets see lets see.. Today I was just no feeling well, my arm hurts, my hand hurts my wrist hurts. I have tried to use this every possible way. I remove the mousepad and turned it upside down. suddenly my arm feels better, which means this stupid bump on this mousepad is the thing that was hurting me soo much.I would never ever recommend this to anyone. I don't want to go to the physical therapists or the Brown hand center (for carpal tunnell) in a few years.Forget about a mousepad, specially this one, please use a notebook's cardboard side, work much better and does not hurt.
My old version of this mousepad got worn after 5 years, but I did not realize that Belkin now only produces this inferior one.  It smells like chemicals, the wrist pad is rather hard, and I cannot roll it up for transport as easily (it creates folds in the material).  I returned the product for a refund.The only other similar product I could find was the Ultra ULT40060 Mouse Pad.  So far, I like it.  Best price & reviews at TigerDirect:[...]
This product DOES NOT WORK with a wireless optical mouse.  This is very unfortuante as it has a great ergonomic feel and look (very decorative):(
Since there seem to be some reviewers who are happy with their mouse pads and others who got junky ones that are nothing like earlier models, thought I'd chime in: I got a junky one. Used the older version happily for years, and these are lightweight, and worse, stiff under your wrist.  However, I don't notice a particular smell unless I stick my nose right up to it.  So, I dunno if they're being made by different manufacturers, but junky ones are definitely in circulation as of November 2011.I'm glad I didn't toss my old one out - even worn out and dirty, it's better than the new one. Next time, I'll look for a different brand.
This is not a true Belkin WaveRest but a fake. The jell pad is poor quality foam, not gel. I know this for I have a legitimate Belkin WaveRest also and you can easily tell the difference between them.DO NOT BUY IT. It is cheap for you are getting what you paid for.
I loved these mouse pads, have used them for years. I just bought a new one, my fourth, and found that Belkin has changed them. The quality is entirely different and cheap now. The weight is much lighter (the top corners don't even lay flat), the gel pad feels like a brick, and worst of all the surface is so reflective that my optical mouse does not track properly on it. As mouse pads go, these are pricey (but used to be worth it) and so I am very disappointed to see Belkin cut quality like this and rip off a longtime (now ex-) customer. It feels like they switched to a two-dollar mouse pad that they still want to sell at the old price.
I bought the mouse pad after LOVING the keyboard pad.  However, I hate the mousepad - it's way too high causing the wrist to hurt even more.  I don't recommend the mouse pad at all.
I threw it away after using it for three days. I cannot stand the smell. Quite toxic. I thought belkin is reliable but it turned out not.
It makes using my mouse a dream. Very comfortable position for wrist as well as a very good position for using the mouse
I WANTED SOMETHING TO REST MY WRIST, BUT THIS CAUSED ME PAIN IN MY SHOULDER AND NECK. WISH I HAD NOT BOUGHT IT.
Changing my review.  After using it for a while, I developed TERRIBLE wrist pain.  I never had wrist pain before, and I work with computers.  The problem seems to be from 2 reasons:  A  The wrist support is far too hard and B  The material sucks the heat out of your wrist.You will develop terrible pain.  I stopped using the mousepad, and in a few weeks I was fine again.--Original Review Below--Has Belkin changed these?  Yes.  The new one I got is slightly different from the one I had for like 5 years.  Is it still comfortable?  Yes it's great.  My crappy $20 Microsoft optical mouse tracks on it just fine.Bought one for home and one for work.
