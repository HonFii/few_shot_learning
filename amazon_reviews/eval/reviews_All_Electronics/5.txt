A beautiful cover that feels great to hold in your hands.  It is just a cover so there are no card slots or pockets but this means that there's very little bulk added as well.  A very straightforward, nice cover.
I think that this is a very nice and economical cover for the Nook Simple Touch and Simple Touch with Glowlingt. A really nice cover. I would purchase this cover again. I highly recommend a cover of some kind to protect your eReader.
I bought this for my wife to protect her Nook and she loves it. The poly covering feels great and allows for solid grip while on the go, so no chance of drops. The inside is lined with a micro-fiber material, so it's soft to the touch, which is great for flipping this open and holding while reading. The Nook snaps in to place perfectly and she really has no complaints. It's exactly what she wanted and gets the job done.
I love this book cover.  It is easy to clean on the outside and seems to be sturdy.  I would highly recommend.
The first cover I purchased for my nook hd+ was incredibly bulky and so I immediately began search for a more I-pad-esque cover. :D  This is perfect.  Perfect fit and it adds very little size to the tablet.  Definitely worth the money.
Fits just perfect on the Nook HD+. Couldn't be more happier with this purchase. I highly recommend this case over all for the Nook HD+
I bought this for a Nook. And it fits my Kindle Fire. And the cheap NextBook I bought for the kids at Walmart for $69. Sturdy cover, protects well.
I looked around for a Nook HD+ stand and this is by far the best. First, I really like how it clips to all four corners of the tablet and it doesn't cover the bezel. It also has a smart cover (magnet) so that it turns the tablet on as you flip it open. This is the same product sold on Barnes & Noble's website. The cover looks and feels very similar to the iPad version. It's slim and doesn't make the tablet look bulky. However, the piece of fabric that attaches the cover to the back part/case is a bit flimsy. If you fold the cover to the stand position, it will hold it's shape, but you can't put too much pressure when typing or else it will start to collapse after a while. I've been using my Nook to read textbooks and watch movies/TV, so I rarely have to type anything. It's also not meant to be shock-proof. I think the corners (clips) will absorb most of the shock if it ever falls to the floor at that angle, but don't purchase the cover if you have children that are prone to dropping things as this is not meant to be that protective. Overall, the cover is more expensive than others, but I think it's worth it. I give it 4 1/2 stars (the review only allows me to chose between 4 or 5). I purchased the black stand cover and it looks awesome. HIGHLY Recommended.
Fits just perfect and super minimal!  It looks very well polished and does enhance the visual appeal of the tablet.  Standing function works perfect.
II love it.....LOVE IT.....its completely perfect....its exactly what I wanted... a perfect fit into my very busy lifestyle... great product...
Make no mistake, this is basically a book of blank worksheets.  They are all the same.  That being said, my children love it.  They doodle while we say our family rosary each night, drawing pictures of the mysteries, writing thoughts or prayers or drawing marks for counting off the beads.We think it is an excellent resource for children praying the rosary.  Helps them focus their thoughts.  The paper of the book is very nice quality.
This is a wonderful collection of Russian folk-songs for singing and performing on piano. It's written in both Russian and English. The SN is also well transcribed. Not much else to say accept that if you're interested in Russian folk-tunes...BUY IT!
A year ago I contacted a well-regarded British bookseller, desiring to obtain this score for an opera recently performed at the Met in New York.  They used to (at any rate) have good Russian connections and I hoped thay would keep me in mind for any Russian opera scores that might become available.  My interest persisted and I was glad to find this recent publication offered on Amazon.  Expensive?  Yes.  Worth it?  Probably.  In order to cover the cost of international shipping, for which Amazon allows a small amount, it is probably necessary to mark up the price of the merchandise.  This was securely packaged, and it reached U.S. Customs within a week and a half.
Another wonderful zentangle inspiration.  This book shows how to doodle in the round making designs that look very complicated, but are very simple to do if you follow the instructions.
The one I was waiting for! I needed help in circular tangles and this book delivers a lot more than expected!
This really got me going when I was doing mandalas. I don't do anything as complex as these, but I got fantastic ideas of patterns to use and it really helped me go to another level. A really good and unusual book.
Let me start out by saying that as a general rule I do not care to tangle in color. I think color gets in the way of pure Zentangles. But this is strictly my personal opinion.  Color can and often does transform some images and here it does. Just look at the cover. This is an outstanding example. Mandalas often need color, it's practically mandatory for many, and in this book, Susan out does herself by providing extensive examples and thorough pictorial patterns.The colors she chooses are bold gem colors in most instances. You may care for other combinations and this is fine. The choice is always left to us. But, do not rely on the color chart printed in the book. It is not accurate, perhaps due to the printing process. For example, lime green actually shows up as Cadmium yellow medium which is almost a bright yellow, and the true green presents as a Thalo green-blue shade, on the pictured color wheel. I applaud her use of color in most mandala examples as it makes the different tangles easy to see. She also keeps the majority of tangles simple and easy to follow, aiding skill and providing a good outcome from the start.But, simple is not necessarily so when it comes to her black and white examples and some of the advanced completed color mandalas. This lovely book presents several engaging black and white Mandalas. And, her inclusion of the gorgeous snowflake designs by Carol Ohl, CZT was a wonderful example of black and white beauty.When it adds to the book some simple tangels are explained. But her more complex examples are left for the reader to detangle. This isn't a bad idea here as it provides opportunity for detangling practice in a round design. What I also found interesting was the way she incorporated symbol explanations so the tangler may choose designs that represent their intention. This book should be a spicy morsel for advanced tanglers and beginners too. I am happy that I added it to my library.
I like the method the author approaches toward designing your own Zen Mandalas and the different tangle patterns printed in the book.  I'm happy with this book.
Zen Mandalas  well put together book ,love mandalas gives some interesting ideas ,good for anyone who loves design and colour
I'm a zentangle addict; I admit it.  But I've been uninspired by the basic books that have offered simplistic designs, often that we'd seen from others, with cleverly reinvented names.Zen Mandalas is different. It marries another favorite activity of mine, coloring mandalas, and offers some original and inspiring content that will make you want to grab a pen and some copics and get to work.This is an excellent contribution to the zentangling field!
This is a great book for going to another level of Zentangle.  The instructions are clear, the samples beautiful and the editors information great.
Goes into history of Mandalas, color meanings, and numbers.  Shows what the symbolism is in detail for this art style.It also shows many ways to use the tangles in the mandalas.  Buy it- you wont be disapointed if you like mandalas.
I've used this a lot for doing my own mandalas.  People at ourart guild enjoyed it, too.  Lots of different patterns, ideas.
So much information packed on this book. And creative ideas and inspiration. Mandalas are a great way to express so much.
Have fun with this one.  So many to choose from and they are all wonderful.  Wonderful presents to give throughout the year.
I've always been a doodler... but this book has helped me step it up a notch. great instructions, illustrations and ideas.
Chooen becaue of colors and shapes strong possibleity of creative art and medition.  Great to use ink and water colors
I love this little book!  Being a relatively new afficionado of zentangling and a lifelong lover of all things mandala, this little book with its myriad challenges provides creative spurts of self-expression.  What a wonderful way to wile away the afternoon in being centered and focussed.  Try it...you will love it!
Zen Mandalas is awesome.  The designs are fantastic.  Zen Maldalas is a great book for anyone interested in the art of mandalas.  The ideas and unique designs will be extremely helpful to my work as a high school art teacher.
This is my favorite form for meditation, relaxation and doing art. There is something healing about sitting down and letting ones thoughts roam at will while creating art.
This latest book by Suzanne McNeil is awe-inspiring. I was curious to see how Tangles would turn out as in a Mandala, a huge WOW is in place here. I love what Suzanne has done with the colours and Tangles in mandala style, and how the Tangle patterns always seem to turn into something completely new and exciting, and your hands just itch to try the Tangles out for yourself !! I am so delighted with this newest book. When I sit down to Tangle myself, I always leaf through my Tangle books first [and my small pile is growing!]:-)I also love the way Tangle artists generously give full credit to their peers !So also a tribute to : Rick & Maria the original Tangle founders, to Sandy Steen Bartholomew, and Joanne Fink for their wonderful Tangle Book Input !! Then also to TanglePatterns.com, a newsletter where you can learn online, a great measure of fullblown THANKS to Linda Farmer for all her wonderful work that she puts in getting it out there every day of the week !! WELL DONE LINDA !! THANK YOU  dear TANGLE FOLK !!! :-))))) Kindest regards, L.B.
Great book with ideas how to use the art form &#34;Zentangle&#34;.  I was inspired with many ideas using a mandala and color, rather than just the traditional black and white.
The idea behind Zentangles is to get your brain focused and into a place where you are creating in a mental environment of peace. This book does a great job of it. It is filled with unique tangling patterns and arrangement ideas that give way to bursts of creativity. I've been able to use this on many occasions to change concepts and formulate my own patterns beautifully. Would definitely recommend this to any tangler or other artist.
Just recently got hooked on Zentangles - have always loved mandalas - this is a great way to expand your skills and open up to new ideas.  Also includes easy and clear instructions on how to create the mandala pattern for completing with various Zentangles - including &#34;tangles&#34; to use for edges.  Haven't tried using all the colors as on the cover but still contains many, many ideas to get your own creative juices flowing.  Highly recommend.
I love using Mandalas in my journals... adding Zentangles is the perfect way to mix things up a bit.  Suzanne also adds color to some of the designs.... coloring them in is a meditative process for me.  There are a lot of great step by step diagrams included.
I've purchased a few other zentangle books, and own a ton of mandala books, and this one is my favorite zentangle book to just spend time looking through. If you want to take your zentangle to the next level with color I highly recommend this book.
Beautiful detailed & colorful illustrations with excellent instructions and background on all the elements involved in creating these unique pieces! Good step by step illustrations on creating the designs. Even tells you where to get the stencils to get started.
The zendala patterns are lovely. She gives nice background info on symbols and their meanings in the mandala art form. Irecommend this book to anyone interested in exploring zentangles.
I just love mandalas & am always trying to find different was to design them, this book lead me on to lots of great web sites on zantangles, so mush fun
This is a great way to make much larger Zentangle art.  I love the way this comes together.  Whether you use the same tangles in all like areas, or just mix it up a lot, these turn out beautiful.  I do lots of these, and love the beauty of the finished work.
A great book for ideas and inspirations. It is a welcomed addition to my Zen Tangle library.The pictures are great and it's easy to follow!
All these Zentangle books are priceless for whatever design it is you,re drawing.  I just love this type of  art, because it's fun, makes your mind work, while putting it at ease and peaceful, and the result is a work of art.
This book is a great wealth of information on Mandala's!! From the origin and meanings of different types of mandala's and the meaning of their symbolism to include how to create, ornate and color them. Also offers 60 more tangles to add to one's collection!!!
I love Zentangles, I love Mandalas, combine the two, and Shazam! I'm all in. After all, what's not to like?
tHIS WAS A GIFT.  THEY LOVED IT. this book is filled with great mandalas and examples and is very inspiring for ideas on doing mandalas. very nice.
This book is a great addition to your Zentangle library. Even if you're a beginner, this book has wonderful full color drawings to inspire any artist as well as explore the teachings of the sacred mandala.
Hope to be able to color some of these with daughter.  Coloring is such a soothing activity and helps relieve stress.
This qur'an is great, Alhamdullilah. The seller sent it in a good timely manner, much sooner than the 'expected date', which was great because it was a gift for a family member who was leaving soon.Mashallah this qur'an has many reciters and translations. Great for memorizing qur'an and also good for those trying to learn how to read the qur'an.
This sermon is from the last night of the Southern California Crusade at Anaheim Stadium in 1985. On this particular night the stadium was filled beyond the stadium capacity to a crowd so large that people had to be seated onto the field itself. Billy Graham speaks of the fear of the uncertain fate of the world. This sermon is still timely, and true for today, and holds your attention to the end.
An excellent way to down size a useful magazine collection into a usable and portable media item. Great work by Interweave Press.
Fantastic! A compilation of joy and pain of the second doctor played by Patrick Troughton. Especially interesting is Mr Troughtons years during WWII and the Royal Navy! Highly recommend!
So far, I have watched the DVD start to finish. It is excellent quality and I gained valuable information. I plan to go back through it, step by step for the details.
I love this!  Don't have to worry about all the foul language coming out of my TV.
...then this is the most magnificent way to watch this saga.  Only available on VHS and laserdisc (and really, laserdisc now looks to my eye the way I used to think about VHS a few years ago), this is Coppola's beautiful restructuring of the story.  Missing scenes restored, straightforward chronology (for the most part), and being able to see it more the way people watch a season of "Breaking Bad" (in binges), I would agree with the reviewers who wrote when it was released that this cut finally makes Part III work as a fully emotionally-satisfying ending.  Shower Paramount (or how about Criterion?) with emails and letters to get this released on DVD and Blu-Ray.  It's time!
I couldn't find a charger for my old cell phone until I found this one. It works fine and I am a happy camper.
This is a great buy, came in real handy while out camping, or would be useful anywhere when electrical or car charger is not available. Estimated percentage of charge is 75% in 2 hours or so on a quality battery. Would recommend and buy again!
This little gadget came in really handy when my phone died and because the outlet in my car doesn't work, I thought I was SOL. Then I remembered this little charger that I had placed in my glove compartment, took it out, inserted a AA battery and  -VOILA!!! It worked!! For such a reasonably priced item, it did a surprisingly great job.
Simplicity at its best.
This charger is just not powerful enough to charge the Storm 2, but A Day's Tech Store was greatto work with and provided me with a full refund.
I was looking for charger which can help me in case of emergeny as i travell a lot.Some times i forget to charge my cell phone and I dont wan a miss my callI received it and its simply great Its great while travelling.Only the thing it requires 3 to 4 AA battries to charge my cell phone, as far as I dont miss any call I have no problem carrying AA battries and also its available anywhere.I will refer to my friends
Simple, easy to use, battery powered charger for cell phone in event of power failure. One note, Amazon has quite a number of these listing, each by a particular cell phone number. Search very specifically, or contact seller for correct connector before you order. I got the wrong connector, but seller replaced it promptly when notified (at no charge).
I ordered it from "A Days Tech Store".  The first one I received did not work. However, the seller was very helpful to send me a replacement.  It is a nice handy item.  Specially because with all features Sony Ericsson Vivaz has,  if you use it frequently, the battery goes to low easily.  I recommend this item for emergency charges and "A Days Tech Store" since they are actually really nice people and I am glad to confirm they take their business seriously when it comes to customer satisfaction.
I havae not had to use it in an emergency yet but, it does work and I carry it in my purse. The price is right it is simple to use and will be a life saver in an emergency. thanks Edyth
this jitterbug phone charger lives up to its hype. 0ne aa battery has charged my cell phone to 40% charged. enough to get you thru the night. i highly recommend this pocket size unit.
Love that I have this for when I go camping and no outlets in the walls of cabins...It's great to have in a pinch...Awesome!1
This product was delivered in an amazingly short amount of time, the price was great and so is the product.  I live in hurricane country and if the need ever arose for the ability to recharge my cell because of lack of electricity, it could be life saving.  Am I pleased?  Yup, extremely!!!Eleanore K. LeslieVero Beach, FL
You will need this in case you're stuck somewhere (like on the tarmac) without a power source.  Fast shipping.  Would do biz again.
Item is great but seems to work better with the more expnsive AA batteries - It is very good handy for emergencies
an excellent idea very effective to use ( on the run), i used when traveling really pleased for thisthanks a lot
This emergency charger is really handy.Nice to have something to fall back on,when you can't get a charge.Glad I purchased it.
This is a great product!!  Fits in small spaces and works well.It also came to me very quickly! :)
This is exactly what I wanted--a small alkaline battery-operated device to charge my Blackberry during electrical power outages! Since I only get a little over a day before needing to charge it(and sometimes less) due to constant searching for towers, I needed an emergency re-charger that did not involve running my car battery down. This does the job and it's small! Another biggie for me.
At least once a week I use my BlackBerry Curve 9300 Phone AA battery Powered Emergency Cell Phone Travel Charger / Re-Charger in high grade Brushed Aluminum housing! It saves me waiting in my car while charging my cell-phone battery.I can use it anywhere.My friends with Androids borrow it, then buy their own.
Great price and item(s) perform as advertised.  Very handy when battery gets low and wall charger plug is unavailable in building or outside.
I purchased the Kyocera S2410 as an emergency backup for my cell phone. I was unaware the new cell phone I had purchased had an enormously limited battery life.  If it weren't for this nifty little item, I still would have been stuck at Dulles without the assistance of AAA.  It definitely serves a purpose.  I may purchase another to keep in my glove compartment...just in case.
I use these storage units for my enormous CD collection and I absolutely love them. They are wall mountable which makes it great for finding a place to put them. You can also add units on top or next to other units when your collection gets bigger. The best part is that there are no slots, and instead the CD's fit snuggly in the organizers and can be slid over to creat more room. This is an EXCELLENT feature if you have a huge collection. Since my collection is alphabetized, it is very easy for me to add a new CD to the collection, especially if the CD begins with a letter at the beginning of the alphabet.A very good buy, and I will buy many more as my collection gets larger.
These were exactly what I needed!  They exceeded my expectations!  Helped me organize all my CDS perfectly.  I love how organized they are now!
Very compact, flexible organizer.  No annoying slots, just slide your CD jewel case, single or double, into the friction holder.  Can be stacked or placed side by side.
I love this rack.  The price was really good and shipping was fast.  I already had one like it and was glad to find another one. Joyce
I ordered 6 of these a couple of weeks ago and had to order 6 more. These area great. I have been converting family VHS tapes to DVD and hundreds of vinyl LPs and cassette tapes to CD. The DVDs and CDs fit perfectly! I can pull out a group of CDs at once and not worry about the rest of the group falling over. It's easy to slide CDs from side to side as I alphabetize my collection, and commerical CDs fit right in place next to the slim-line jewel cases. Double CD cases are no problem, either. Also like the stacking capability of the units. Mine are going into a large multimedia unit where my vynils and cassettes used to be. These can't be beat.
This item is just wonderful.  It really help while on vacation driving.  Cd's are easy to remove and reinstall...really need another .  Got so spoiled with this one i get new CD every stop.MOST EXCELLENT!!!
As I file DVDs by year and topic, it is very easy to reorganize the disks.I have them stacked two wide by five high on a endtable, and the organizers can be wall mounted.Each holds 50 thin-case (5mm) DVDs in 11 3/4 " (296 mm) x 6 1/8 " (154 mm) height x 5 3/16 " (131 mm) depth.
If you don't have a large cabinet for your CD collection, these stackable holders are just right.  Because there ore no true slots, the CD cases do not have to be inserted perfectly, and double cases are easily accommodated.  The look good and are space efficient.
I started out with 4 of these 25CD units for work, organizing my CD science journals, etc.  These organizers are a great product.  I then purchased 10 more for my home CD collection, which wasnt enough, so I ordered some more.  I had a bad experience with one of the marketplace sellers after Amazon ran out of the product, but found that [...] sells them (they are the mfg) for $7 each and no shipping cost (same as Amazon).  Shipping was only 3 days from time of order with Allsop; it was slightly longer with Amazon.  I was able to organize over 400 music CDs and since you carry only 25 at a time, it is easy to move them around.  I have them stacked up against a wall 4 high and 3 wide and the stacks were a little wobbly on carpet so I put a shim in the bottom to tip the stack toward the wall.  The only negative is that some of the CDs come in cardboard that is not standard size, so I could not put those in the set, but multi-CD collections fit and it is easy to move them from side to side as you add in at a later time.  I highly recommend this product for organizing a collection of CDs- for work or for home.  They snap securely to one another either by width or even by length (they have "tabs" that fit into one another.  Sitting on a desktop, I have four units and they are very secure and stable.
In the last few years I have gotten back into buying my music on CD's.  Used, like new CD's are now available on Amazon for as little as $.01 plus $3.99 for shipping and are always cheaper than a digital download.  I needed something to store them in and after trying others, these really worked best.  It is easy to put CD's in and remove them.  They don't fall over if the case is not full.  Being stack able is great.  I have four now.  Nice!  Wait till they come up on sale...
Once you have tried the Guide plus system. Youll wonder how you ever got by without it. Great sound and clear picture. Has plenty of jacks on the back for a basic system.
This tv set is excellent for the price.  You get guide plus gold option that allows you to check what else is on with out looking though the tv guide or just flipping though channels and waiting for the comericals to end to find out what is on.  And it has like 600 some lines of resolution I think.  So all and all its a great tv and very original being able to have this guide system which no other brand has. I say buy it!
I was wondering if this was all the tv the advertising on the box had promised.  To my surprise Every feature worked as advertised and the audio compression was most appreciated.  The tv stations in my area  run their commercials about twice as loud as standard programming. This  problem just disappeared with my new RCA.  The Guide + provides a quick way  to see whats on the tube in your specific area, just enter your area code.  It's that easy.  I do wish they would add another rf input but perhaps on  the next model.  That's it....I love it and you can have my tv but only if  you buy your own.  Tom Haley, Uvalda, Georgia.
This is one of the best Tv's I have ever brought. It works just like the box says it does. Now I can choose movies or programs i want to watch without buying a TV guide. When you mark a show you want to watch the TV  will either tell your VCR to record it. Or it will tell you the show you  want to see is on. You will get your moneys worth here
Yes, we all know the RCA name has not always been synonymouswith a quality product.  However, I took a chance on this TV last Julyand have had absolutely no problems.  The picture is beautiful, and the features are plentiful for the price.  In short, I have been so happy that I recently purchased an RCA DVD player and RCA digital surround sound system as well.  Those items have also performed flawlessly.  Simply put, this is again a company moving in the right direction.  Need more proof? Go to your local audio/video superstore and compare RCA's HDTV and digital receivers with the competition's. Like the other products I mention, you'll find similar quality, more features, and a much lower price.  For fellow college students or electronics freaks on a budget, take a chance like I did.  You won't be sorry!
After trying about 6 or 7 different used VCR's it was such a pleasure to have a brand new one, even if they don't make them any more it was a joy!!!!!!
I have had this VCR since it came out, years I tell you.  After all this time, the remote stills works without fail.  The Movie and Commerical advance is still on point and I have no problems with the unit what so ever.  I have made it from college, to three apartments and a move from North to South and it is still running fabulously.  Every once in a while I'll pop in a cleaner and then keep it moving, since I tape a show everyday at 6am for the last 5 years, I have had absolutely no problems with it.  I have to say that the newer VCR versions do not compare.
It is Christmas of 2000 and we need a good CD player for the stereo as our Harman Kardon unit has been borrowed permanently by my brother.As I am the king of cheap, my wife and I and our six children stroll into 6th AVE in W.Paterson,NJ.Right smack up front is this pile of RCA RP-8065 5-DISC CD players on sale for the absolutely rock bottom price of $[..]!!! Yes, this is not a typo! I said $[..]!! Obviously I neither hesitated or balked but rather took full advantage of the situation.No, I did not even audition the unit in the store and probably made my purchase in record breakingtime! Everyone, including my most beautiful wife agreed that this was simply too good to pass up! When I got it home, I hooked the darn thing up to my Parasound amp and Boston Acoustics A-70 speakers.I used the supplied patch cord.Now, I am simply an audiophile with a very trained ear and an open mind.I have found over the years that one should be open to the fact that good components can be had at all price levels.....especially COMPACT DISC players.I also know that quality patch cords can make a budget unit like the RCA play at its best! Sure enough, setting up the unit with the supplied patches was ok but revealed some slightly unwanted treble harmonic as I expected.Replacing the supplied patch with my six foot Audioquest red and black gold plated babies solved the problem immediately! Everything came through cleanly and with much space around the sound.Granted the Audioquests cost me $34 but as I had already purchased them a year before, why not take full advantage of the situation?So I did! Even if I had not owned them beforehand I would still have purchased quality patch cords later on anyway.It has been proven to me over and over by my good friend John Rutan of the now famed Verona Audio Connection just how dramatic a difference these great cables will make! They are also oriented for a directional flow by arrows on the plugs themselves and are quite serious in their performance.The RP-8065 itself has six clearly lit oval shaped buttons located at the top of the deck itself.They are for disc change and direct access to discs one thru five and also indicate which of your CDs is playing.When pressing one of them they flash.The handy little remote works perfectly and our unit itself has never failed.The player has never jammed.This is quite an amazing feat in itself at our household! Sometimes eager little hands that want to change a disc immediately while another disc is playing can send some CD players into a frenzy!- But not the RCA=VERY COMMENDABLE INDEED!! The unit simply will not allow you to make the mistake of trying to load the slot that's in use!Of course there are the usual programmable functions and the random modes including a ten second sampling of each track.All functions operate as they are supposed to.Although the information display is a bit small,the unit itself has a wonderful feel to it and gives the impression of good construction.Don't expect a whole mess of audiophile type outputs on the rear of the player as there are just the basic RCA TYPE LEFT and RIGHT connections.This is a very Spartan but well laid out design.Ahh, but what about the sound itself? It has a slight tendency toward SWEETNESS but listen....at the risk of being scoffed at by the so-called Purists, the proof of the pudding is in the eating! The RCA RP-8065 sounds clean clear and detailed with good resistance to skipping. When used with quality patch cords the unit will give hours and hours of great listening with not a trace of fatigue! My Telarc CD of Stravinsky's 'Rite Of Spring'sounds terrific with great DYNAMIC RANGE.The RCA will definitely give some higher end units a real run for their money! I would buy another one in a minute! As for the overall quality of the unit you can't beat it! It justs keeps playing and playing and never dies.Believe me when I tell you that our unit gets heavy use each and every day! Furthermore, the room it is being used in has no air conditioning or climate control other than a radiator.Here on the East Coast humidity levels can reach quite extreme levels as it did recently this past Summer!! Plus every once in awhile the kids and I accidentally slam into the unit.Jarring it only makes it skip a bit and then it recovers shortly afterward.It can also get quite cold during the Winter.I'm telling you this so that you understand that our listening environment is somewhat hostile to life expectancy of electronic components.Still the RCA plays on ... even on the worst of days!Now if all of this jargon hasn't convinced you yet just how good this unit is, maybe this will-It can handle your ripped CDs from your burner without any problem or sign of distress! Those that have burned their own CDs only to find them incompatible with their stereo's CD player understand fully what I mean.Not all CD players can do this! In fact some purposely block the user from playing these CDs for fear of copyright infringement so beware if this feature is important to you.The RCA is CD-R capable.By the way, this player is still very much available even though my review arrives late to the scene.Even if it has been replaced by a newer model I'm absolutely sure that whatever that model is...is just as good if not better!I really have to hand it to the engineers at RCA.They have come up with a well designed and constructed COMPACT DISC player that will not leave a poor man broke! Henry Kloss would have loved this one! BRAVO!!!!!
I have the RCA RP8070 5-CD Changer, which looks identical to this one, and I've played it hundreds, maybe thousands of hours on shuffle with no problems in the first seven years I've had it.
You can't beat the deal! Excellent quality for the  price. I've bought the Toshiba version and it is great too but had this been available at the time I would have two RCAs.
Looks good and plays great. Why pay more?  I replaced the old Sony player due to its tendancy to skip when the volume went up. I had this RCA unit rattling the walls and never a skip. Buy two and give one as a gift like we did.
As far as I can see it, this product is a powerfull machine and easy to handle. It is of high quality compared to others.
Bought it only because it was on sale, turned out to be a great system.  Had it a year now, no problems with clarity or playback.  Nice features, including a swap-on-the-fly to change discs while others are playing and  lamps on the front to tell you which slots have discs and which don't.  No  more &quot;Where did I put my discs?&quot; in the carousel.Overall a  great CD player and a great value!
If you're looking for a home theater stereo system with Dolby Ditigal/AC3, there are none that come close in value and the RT2300 is loaded with features such as Dolby ProLogic and Dolby 3 Stereo for the true surround  sound!  But what makes this RCA unit an exceptional buy are the optical  jacks for two AC3 devices for Dolby Digital (such as a DSS Receiver with  AC3, DVD player, or AC3 LaserDisc player)for digital theater quality  surround sound.  The sound is outstanding, the hook up is straight forward  and the control is simple.  And while the reciever is rated 250 watts, the  system comes with the 50 watt sub-woofer not shown in the picture (RCA  rates the entire system at 300 watts with the sub-woofer) - and it sounds  really great.  This home theater stereo system is the most  bang-for-the-buck I've seen in a while!
I am truly amazed with this product from RCA.  I was skeptical at what I was going to get for the price....but believe me, I am very pleasantly surprised.  RCA delivers on every feature that is key to a quality home  theater system.  The only drawback is the quality of the speakers.  They  are very good for 50W speakers but like they say, speakers really make the  system.  For anyone on a budget, this system is the way to go!
Just bought the RT 2300 RCA home theater in a box and just love it.  The sound will blow you away with it's crisp, clear, Dolby digital reciever. The 50 watt powered subwoofer delivers great bottom to explosions etc. and  the five  speakers deliver excellent surround sound. I found 300 watts  total power is more than enough for any size home theater setup with no  distortion what so ever on my speakers. Being a dolby digital system, your  satellite TV and DVD'S should sound fantastic with each speaker getting  it's own audio source.  For the money you just can't go wrong with the RCA  RT 2300!
Wow! , if you are ready for the digital sound , this is the system to start with that type of sound. I like a lot because the receiver has a lot of inputs and outputs and the satellite speakers are very comfortable. You don't have to spend a lot of money in a home theater because this is the  best! .
WHEN I RECIEVED THE JORNADA, I WAS QUITE AMAZED AT IT'S CONDITION. IT WAS NEARLY PERFECT AS ADVERTISED, EVEN THE BOX. ONLY INSIGNIFICANT COSMETIC BLEMISH ON THE CLEAR COVER, BUT I THINK THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED SINCE IT'S A USED ITEM. OTHERWISE, THE DISPLAY HAS GOOD COLOR RESOLUTION. SINCE I'M NOT AT ALL FAMILIAR WITH WINDOWS CE, I'M HAVING SOME PROBLEMS, BUT I'M SURE THAT I'LL OVERCOME THEM. ALL IN ALL, IT WAS A VERY PLEASANT TRANSACTION WITH ONLY ONE EXCEPTION. I'D HOPED THE ITEM TO BE SHIPPED VIA UPS. IT WAS SHIPPED USING PRIORITY MAIL, BY U.S. POSTAL SERVICE, & I HAD TO TAKE A COUPLE HOURS OFF WORK & GO TO THE POST OFFICE TO SIGN FOR THE ITEM. BUT, SINCE IT WAS SUCH A GOOD DEAL, THAT WAS A VERY SMALL INCONVENIENCE THAT I CAN LIVE WITH. I WOULDN'T HESITATE MAKING ANOTHER PURCHASE THROUGH AMAZON.COM.........
These are great discs for the price. I've never had a problem with mine. I like the individual clear cases to show off those different cool MD colors. If you're looking to buy blanks, these are a great choice.
Yo nunca habia utilizado la tecnologia del Minidisk,pero ahora que la conozco creo que tiene una gran variedad de utilidades, desde copiar canciones de cd convencionales, hacer grabaciones de voz  hasta copiar mi  mp3 files de mi computadora. Creo que un minidisk es mas duradero y  portable que un cd o una cinta. Ahora si puedo vivir tranquilo con mis  minidisk... Gracias Dios por este invento!
Great product,fine top quality! I've been using MD for about 5 years now and 90% are Maxell MD's.They come in varied colors,good to organize collections or categories.Cool slide case too!Definetly the best portable recording/playback digital media.Sound performance is best(cd like) when recorded with optical cable.You won't miss your tapes!
Excellent PDA, I got much use out of it. The price for these is amazing... you wont find a cheaper, color, internet ready PDA on the market. THis thing is excellent!
I know they recently discontinued the manufacture of these but I still think it's the best PDA for the price. Battery life is great, screen is great (avoid outdoors with most of these except the Compaq Aero). Made the  jump from paper organizer to electronic and I'll never go back! I spent  about 3 weeks researching the right model to buy though and this thing was  it. The first one I Purchased had a defective cradle so I returned it to  the store rather than worry about Philips support. The second one has been  hummming along great for over a month now. I think Caligrapher is overrated  - I've since switched back to jot for the most part for accuracy reasons.
This is the best handheld pc out there. For a mere $ you can do anything that you can on a more expensive brand. It comes with 16 megs of memory, and a touch color screen. For another brand, you would have to spend at least $ more. Philips also uses many programs that are not  on the other handhelds, such as the caligrapher, or voice recognition. Yes,  I've tried many of these things on a desktop computer, and none of them  worked, but on the Nino, they all seem to magically work!  The only problem  is that if you have terrible writing, the calligrapher is not for you. The  only downside to this is that you cannot get email through a wireless  network, but for about $ you can buy a modem and access your ISP from  any phone line, as long as it's not aol, a basic ISP that you can use  microsoft outlook with. Using this handheld pc is so easy that even if you  can't handle a desktop pc, you will be able to easily learn how-to on this  contraption. Any bad stories about this product are not actually about this  product, they are about people who cannot use a handheld pc properly...  basically they would have the same problems with any handheld pc. I hope  you enjoy your Nino, I sure am!  If you have any questions about this  product, or about this post, feel free to email me, my address is listed  above!
Good product ...high quality
I purchased this item when my older-model slot-loading MacBook Pro stopped being able to burn CDs/DVDs, and chose this specific cleaner because of the prior reviews saying it worked OK with others' Macs. It also did the job on mine. One cleaning cycle and the burns are working again after previously having a total laser failure. I am a little surprised that this worked (I was fairly certain I had a dead drive, based on the fact that the SuperDisks tend to die quickly), but it's a heck of a lot cheaper and easier than a hardware install, so I'm happy!
Bought this to help clean a 2008 MacBook Pro cd/DVD drive that was completely non useable. When a DVD was inserted, it would make a noise and spit it back out. I bought the Allsop DVD drive cleaner cd and stuck it in there. The first time it spit it out. The second it last a couple seconds and spit it out but the third time it went through the whole cleaning process. Apple laptop drives somehow are very sensitive and need cleaning. This is a must for any apple laptop owner. Also cleaned all my DVD players.
This lens cleaner is great for both cd and dvd players.  It takes off the static as well as cleaning the players, with its carbon technology. Remember to ground the lens cleaner before using, with two fingers on the shiny part.  Ihope it lasts longer than 30 uses, though
My dvd player was starting to skip/pix out.I orderd this cleaner and it worked after it's 1st use.Aweseome product and easy to use.
Worked for the superdrive (DVD/CD burner) in my Mac Pro. I can burn DVDs again.
My DVD player stopped working-disc errors. One play of this cleaner and it is working fine.  It works!
I purchased this Allsop Drive Cleaner Disk in hopes of not having to buy an external DVD player/burner. I Received it a few days ago, cleaned my Mac's drive, then inserted a DVD I'd purchased and viola, it played like a charm. My DVD drive/optical lens was dirty. That's all it was. The moral of the story? ALWAYS make sure that you check to SEE if your Mac or PC's drive or optical lens is dirty by purchasing a Drive cleaner and using it BEFORE you go out an buy an external DVD player/burner, and even if you need a new external DVD burner/CD player, you've bought a great cleaner which will be on hand when you need to use it to clean your Mac/PC drives.
Allsop CD/DVD cleaners have always worked well for me, and I have owned a few through the years (lost a couple). Seller had fair price and quick ship.  Thanks
Couldn't believe that it would really work, skeptical when purchasing.  BUT IT WORKS!!!!  I ran it twice to be doubly sure that the DVD player was really clean.  Used it on car CD player and there again, like new.
This seemed to work. I think the player needs to be traded for a new one
My CD player would not play at all, used this cleaner now my CD player works fine.....
We bought this cleaner to replace the cheap one (that failed to work) we purchased at our local box store. Our initial reaction is that this one is much better. It certainly cleaned our DVD player in short order and the interface is easier to follow and implement. Worth the extra money.
I had my doubts, as I've gotten a few duds of this type in the past, but this one seems to work exactly the way the manufacturer claims it should.
I bought this because in my 02 Camry the CD player was skipping and sometimes wouldn't play. Used this to clean the laser and now it works!! Saved me a bunch I'm sure. Now I use it in my Mac and other CD and Blueray players. Keeps them operating perfectly. Best investment you'll ever make for your players!
This is a great way to clean your CDs and DVDs and works very well.  I will order it again and I recommend it.
I kept getting an error every time I tried to burn home videos to disc. Got this and used it and back to making discs. Didn't need all the extras that were on it for surround sound settings, but happy with my purchase!
awesome--has8 brushes in a circular shape---resurrected my 17-year old sony cd changer.  has a 17-part diagnostic series--shoiwed me 2 of my speakers are out of phase.
I used this to clean the lense on two DVD players that were skipping bad and it worked.  I had to do it twice on one of the players but they definitely helped a lot.
WORKS GOODTHE BEST I  HAVE USED  DOES THE JOB WELL  A A A A a a a a a a a
Worked like a charm on my iMac. It wouldn't play, burn or eject discs any longer. I feared I would have to bring it in for repair, but the Allsop Ultra Pro carbon-Edge dvd cleaner had it in working order right after using it. I liked how it talked the user through each step. Would recommend.
The dvd drive in my Macbook Pro (unibody) stopped working completely.I took it to the Apple store and for $120 they were going to change it for a new one. I wanted to do some research online before committing to paying that.I went on some blogs and someone suggested trying to clean it first.SO... I bought this cleaning CD and voila!!! My dvd drive works perfectly once again!!! I saved about $118!!!! Pretty good!!
Until i lost a iMac's DVD burner to lack of maintenance (and had it replaced under extended warranty), i never thought much about cleaning my drives.  Then it became a sort of monthly ritual (or weekly, if the drive sees a lot of action).I like the feel of the Allsop cleaning disc (with its TOUCH HERE for grounding and presumably static discharge) and -- more importantly -- the special CD case (with extra room for the brushes) it resides in (which will have to take repeated use) seems well built.The audio channel test uses a steam train moving across the sound-space instead of a narrator's voice changing position, so that's a little change to the ritual.  I just have a Left-Right stereo setup, but the test includes checks for more channels if you have them.
I have a Sony DVD player that is probably 8-10 years old.  I have noticed that even on new DVD's, it was beginning to skip.  I had heard of VCR head cleaners but never knew that there was such a device for for DVD and CD players.  When I was playing my new Season 5 "The Office" DVD and the first one was skipping, I was frustrated.  I took a look at the DVD and made sure there were no overt scratches or dirt on it.  There were not.  The problem kept happening.I decided to go online and Google the issue and hit an audio forum where they mentioned DVD and CD drive cleaners.  After that, I was off to Amazon to do my research and buy the one that had good reviews.Well, this thing WORKS and it fixed my problem to a tee.  I am going to use it on other devices like my MacBookPro and in my car.  The cleaner has a cool set of audio tests that allow you to ensure your audio system is set up and balanced correctly.  Although I did not really need this, I could see how this functionality alone would make the Allsop Drive Cleaner worth the money.  The audio tests were very thorough.5 stars all the way.
We have not used as yet but have when we are ready to.  The reviews are good so trusting it will do the job when needed.
After searching for ways to fix a burn error I continually got on my MacBook Pro, I stumbled across this product.  I was wary of inserting it into a slot drive, but had nothing to lose.  Within 5 minutes I was done with the cleaning process and burning discs again with absolutely no problems.
I was experiencing problems saving files to CDs on my computer so I ordered one of these. It took about 15 seconds to run and the laser began doing its job again. I rerun it occasionally to keep things clean. It works perfectly. Highly recommend. Excellent product.
My Toshiba DVD Recorder stopped working,  I keep getting E3 error cannot write to disk, but I could play discs.  After running the cleaner three times, it started working again.
Worked great. I have a DVD player that kept loading and did not play disks. I ran the Allsop cleaner disk, followed the instructions and now the DVD player works! No more extended loading times, no more disks stuck inside the machine because could not read the disk. This product worked for me, as advertized.
I have a Yamaha 5 disc player that was beginning to announce that there was &#34;no disc&#34; in all of the slots. This Cleaner solve the problem and the player is back to working like new. The delivery was fast.
At first the this CD/DVD cleaner would play to a certain point and stop. But after several more tries, I finally got it to play completely thru. And I must say it do the trick. Now I can rip CD's on my computer again
Primarily used this to solve a DVD drive problem that's been going on my 3 year old MBP. It's a common problem most users run into, and I guess I might as well tried this solution.The drive was reading CDs fine, but wasn't reading DVDs at all. Popped this Allsop product in, listened to the instructions in iTunes and after a bit, took it out. Tried some DVDs, and it was reading it again.Some technology just gets really fuzzy, but this worked fine for me.
I was constantly getting the could not read disk on brand new disks, threw this in ran it and have not had a hiccup since. It worked great
Tried others and have not found better than Allsop. Trusted them for years and they are like a rock in this area.
I had a problem with dust and dirt build up due to a very humid September where my AC had a few problems.  I used this to clean the DVD players themselves.  After I used the Allsop wipes to clean the DVD's all played great. Good product and very inexpensive.
I used the Ultra-Pro DVD and CD Drive Cleaner in my CD player.  I had recently been experiencing some "noise" when playing some newly purchased CDs.  After using the cleaner CD, the noise was gone.  The cleaner also has a nice feature in that it allows you to correctly adjust your sound system for improved sound quality.
I love this!  It cleaned up my disc drive on my 5 year old imac, which had been making a funny whirring noise for some time, and Apple told me to bring it in for repairs.  I decided to try this first, and I'm so glad I did.  I had some trouble with reading the instructions.  They are not very clear.  So I called technical support, and they were wonderful.  It did exactly what it was supposed to do very well!  I just followed step 1 and 3 and that took about 10 seconds.  It's a great product...
Was very skeptical at first. Nobody at tech support even suggested the product. Recommendations on the Internet and Amazon's reviews convinced me to try before expensive replacement of the DVD burner on my MacPro (error message during disk's burning).It took just one run to completely fix the problem. I think some kind of Lens cleaners should be a part of recovery package for each computer.Very satisfied with a purchase, including super fast delivery.
Easy to maintain peak performance of your CD players and or recorder.  Simply follow the instructions and experience like new performance.
I had two DVD burners not working: the superdrive on my Macbook Pro and an external HP drive.  This seemed to do the trick for both of them.
Works just as advertized cleamed our dvd and cd players sup remote to use iturbly  but you do need a
I had problems with my DVD burner skipping areas when burning.  One could see the blank lines on the surface of the disk.  This fixed the problem.  How?  I don't care or know.  It worked.
...But it fixed mine. My nearly 10-year old DVD player was at the point where it wouldn't read any DVDs -- only the message 'disc error' would appear in the display. Sure, as the helpful man at Best Buy advised me, buying a new player would have only cost me about 45 bucks, but I'm the sentimental type (and mine plays 'Region 2' so it would cost considerably more to replace). Anyway, I picked this cleaning kit up, and let it run for a few minutes (I didn't even listen to the audio intsructions) and presto - the player works again, at a fraction of the cost it would have been to replace it.
The DVD drive of my MacBook Pro stopped working. I was considering to have it replaced, but then I bought this cleaner. One spin was enough to get the drive back to working! Totally worth it.
MB Pro CD/DVD drive would not read any dual layer discs. I guess there was something wrong with the lense so I bought this product and it worked like a charm. Put it in for a few seconds and fixed my annoying problems!
My MacBook Pro is around 5 years old now, and recently my CD/DVD player simply stopped working. At first I was sure it was the fault of library DVDs, or fragile discs in general and cursed the day when my hearty beloved VHSs were stripped brutally from store shelves. When the player refused to read ANY disc, though, I thought perhaps the years in a school knapsack, with delicious snacks and dusty books, had taken their toll on my non-tray front loading drive. I went with this Allsop because of the stunning reviews, particularly the Mac successes. The cleaning phase went by very quickly (less than 5 min), so I decided to play the Dolby Sound Optimizer just for fun (obviously designed for a legitimate sound system and not a laptop). Pink Noise is actually kind of catchy AND I learned more about the audio depth of my laptop itself. When the delightfully soothing guide instructed me to listed for her voice to the front, left, right, and back of me, I was surprised to learn that my Mac actually makes some sounds appear to be BEHIND me. Wow! Although that is more of a plug for my laptop I suppose, hearing Allsop push my machine to its audio limits actually was very interesting and actually DID lead to some slight adjustments in my audio panel to make everything perfect. And the last cleaning track puts you in a luscious meadow with a bubbling brook and hoofbeats in the distance - what a great way to end a cleaning session on a previously defunct CD drive! I HIGHLY suggest this product to all of my Amazon friends. On a tangential note, the packaging was wonderfully easy to open, and the disk had little brushy things on the bottom which at first I laughed at, but now stand in amazement at their Awesome Power. Just put a library DVD in, and it started right up (without the takeoff rumblings that used to accompany my laptop trying to read a DVD. You all know what I am talking about. The whirring followed by a whining kind of sound which signals the DVD is a NO GO). Everything one again functions smoothly. So go ahead, try this product. I doubt you will be disappointed.
My Daughters DVD drive would not create a DVD, received some generic write error. Ran this through and then it started working. A lot easier and cheaper than buying and installing a new drive.
i love the way it talks you through what's going on, and what's about to happen, and what you should expect.
Have not had a chance to use it this was advised fto me from a professional on line. hE SAID THIS IS WHAT HE RECOMMEND AS THE BEST PRODUCT
I had a problem with my Macbook pro, which didn't read DVDs, only audio CDs.  I used this DVD cleaner and now it works fine!  I played the intro track and about 2 minutes of the cleaning track, then the 3rd and part of the 4th track just in case.  I skipped the rest of the cd.EDITI had problems again with my cd drive a few days later, and took apart my Macbook pro and cd drive to see what the problem was.  It turns out a piece of plastic was stuck in the cd drive and that was the main cause of the drive's inability to read cds.  Therefore, I can't say that this cleaning disc solved all my problems since a dirty lens wasn't the main cause, but it seems to work for dirty lenses in any case.
My dvd drive on my macbook pro had stopped reading discs.  After using this cleaner one time it is as good as new!
I've used many, many, different CD/DVD Rom cleaners and this is far and above the best yet. The audio guide makes using this a breeze and more importantly, they last forever.
This cleaner is well designed and is easy to use. There is an impressive test verification procedure on the product that works well. I was having a problem with CD's skipping and after using this cleaner the problem continued, however I did find the real cause and easily corrected it. I had taken the PC burned music Cd's out of my 2001 Camry changer when I recently traded it for a newer Lexus ES series and although they played perfectly in the Camry they skipped and cut out in the Lexus. I ran the cleaner with no improvement, but after researching further I learned that CD's created at a fast burn rate can cause this problem. I burned new ones at 4X and problem solved. I am very pleased with the Alsop cleaning disc and will use it to clean our computer drives and DVD players as they need attention also.
My macbook pro stopped burning and reading cds/dvds. I searched online and I read so many things that scared me! So I finally decided to just go by the usual cd lens cleaner and when I read the reviews for this product I thought I had nothing to lose, it sounded much better than opening my macbook by myself! I just received the cleaner and WOW! My cd/dvd drive is alive again! YAY!!! So happy! This REALLY works! Thank you Allsop and Amazon, this was super easy to use and cheap!!
I burn a lot of dvd's and I had notice that I was getting some freezing when I would play them back sometimes. This seems to have fixed the problem.
The CD player on our boat started skipping.  First, only here and there.  Then, the problem became annoyingly frequent.  Bought this, figuring I'd give it a shot before replacing the stereo head.  To my surprise, it worked.  Took the skips out of our CDs.  A month later or so they came back, but I just cleaned it again. Now, I just leave this stowed on board.  I'm happy to clean it once a month.  Even if I replaced the stereo, the new one would get dirty again and I'd be right back in the same &#34;boat&#34;.
Long story short...Bought a used MacBook Pro that would not burn anything. Would spit out almost any brand media I inserted. Took said  MacBook Pro to Apple Store 2 days ago. They confirmed drive needed replacement and wanted to charge me $150 to replace as laptop was purchased in 2006.I can't afford that at the moment so I sought some cheaper alternatives and stumbled upon this item here on AmaZonAfter it was complete, my issue was solved!! It wasn't the drive. Just the lens was dirty and this wonderful little lens cleaner worked like a charm. Wonderfully awesome!!
works great on my computer and video equipment I needed one of these for some time now . did not realize how much a dirty drive could affect the program your trying to run.
We had two DVD recorders that just stopped working. One would skip all the time and you would see visible scratches on the DVD when it came out of the player. This item seemed to do the trick. I would recommend.
This Is The Best Cleaner Out There I Have Used Several Kinds This Out Performs Them AllAnd The Price Was Great
Easy to use and works well as cleaner. I would recommend it to anyone on ease of use. My previous old cleaners back to WIndows 98 needed a replacement.
A few months after I bought it, my Macbook Pro started getting touchy about burning CD/DVDs.  Then, months later it stopped reading program DVDs.  Movies and audio CDs stopped working soon after.  I barely used the drive, though, so I didn't much care.At least, I didn't care until now, when I'd like to upgrade iLife and OS X...  So, I did some research and discovered that the progressive loss of ability I had probably meant that the lens was dirty, and a cleaning disc would be the answer.I looked at all the options available, and the Allsop Carbon-Edge is one of the few that doesn't say "not for slot loading drives."  As long as the disc wasn't going to get stuck in there and rattle around forever, I figured I didn't have much to lose.You go through a grounding ritual with touching little pads before you insert the cleaning disc.  (Probably silly, but did it anyway.)  It spun up, with only slightly more vibration than a normal CD.  And a few moments later iTunes started ripping the tracks. :)  Oops.  Hadn't used it in so long I forgot!Stopped the ripping, played the intro and the cleaning track until it said to stop.  Skipped the rest of the audio tracks.  Works great now!
I bought this as a last ditch effort to fix the CD burner in my BR1600CD multitrack recorder, as it seemed to have bitten the dust. I ran the disk and it fixed it quickly. Been burning CDs all day. Later on I discovered that the CD player in my iMac wasn't playing anything I fed it. I ran the cleaning disk and it was fixed in minutes.There's an introductory track on the CD, then the cleaning track, then a series of test sounds and whatnot to &#34;calibrate&#34; your CD player. I think most of that stuff is unnecessary or at best useful for a few hardcore audiophiles, I don't know. But the 30 second cleaning track is worth the price. Before you toss your CD player, give this a try, it might surprise you. It's important to keep the laser head clean.
Really is great, we used it and notice the difference immediately, the sound is 100 percent better, So glad we bought this.
We own a retro store in a tourist town and we sell a cd jukebox that we've had a hard time getting the CDs to play. We sell retro CDs too so we play them.  Well instead if tapping it and getting frustrated when it won't play, we used this and it's like brand new... A miracle!!  No more taking 10+ minutes sometimes to get the juke working!!  First try now... Who knew if such a thing?  Obviously I didn't til now ... Thanks!
Yes this does work in all pc's, cars, cd and dvd players I've tried.  Even portable ones.  Have not tried a Mac but I assume the best.  It not only cleans (rather quickly) but will do lots of EQ tests with stereo or surround sound systems!  A voice instruction tells you what to listen for and how to adjust any needed sound hook-ups.  Very well thought out product and made well.  A good buy for sure.  I have not tried it on equipment that is super dirty because I take care of my stuff but it seems to slightly improve already clean equipment.
I've tried various other cleaning disks, but none worked as well or as efficiently as this one. The only one you'll need.
after receiving this cleaner i used it in my cd recorder and it cleaned up my device and now it is working as it should. i would recommend this product and i give it five stars.
I really didn't think that a dry Cd cleaner will work on my high end equipment. But this one "DOES" and does it very well. The only problem is, that the instructions or package doesn't tell you the maxinum usage (times) before it becomes ineffective.
I thought it was the rental & library DVD's making my player skip and freeze.  Then I played one we own and had only watched a few times and found it skipped and froze too.  I was either going to break the machine by taking it apart to try and clean it or pay more than a new one would cost to have it professionally cleaned.  Instead, I ordered this cleaner, popped the little disc in and BINGO! problem solved.  I wasn't having any sound problems but I expect it would fix those too.  Would give more than 5 stars if possible!
After saving a folder full of pics to a CD-R, my drive couldn't read the disc.  I put in a DVD to test it and it started skipping right away.  I went to the local office supply store and bought a cheap lens cleaner.  The DVD played a little better but still skipped.  Three minutes with the Allsop Ultra Pro and my DVD played perfectly.  I put my CD in and viewed all my pics.  Must be that carbon fiber technology.I can't comment on the audio performance tests.
This product performed as was expected. It was easy to use and I would recommend it to others as a worthwhile product.
The Allsop Cleaner exceeded expectations.Cured skipping problems, disc recognition problems on my iMac.I cleaned the lens on a ten year old boom-box which would not play any cds.It works fine now. If you are looking for a product that works look no further.
Having a toddler and a baby, I like to borrow CDs and DVDs from the public library. However most of the discs are scratched and my macbook pro is unable to read them. So I gave this lens cleaner a shot and it definitely works like a charm in reading the discs now.
Good product, worked in everything I tried it on. Car CD player, DVD player and laptop PC. Very user friendly
It works as advertised and tunes your entire system. This is the only one to get.
I havent used this a lot yet, but what I have used it for, it worked great.
I burn a lot of dvd's and I noticed I started getting lots of skips and stalls of different movies. I ordered this little cleaner and just put  it in the dvd burner and followed the instructions and it fixed all my skips.Most people do not know that you should clean your dvd after a few hours of playing or burning DVD's.I am going to buy a lot of these to give at Christmas time !
I tried this on my dvd player and it cleared up my problems with skipping and the sound track crackling, I ran it three times and it ran like new.
I had not used the CD/DVD burner in my MacBookPro very much and was dismayed when error messages signaled a problem.  From the articles and blogs, I gathered some useful remedy might be doing simple solutions before taking the unit in for what I felt was an imminent replacement.  A review by a fellow Amazonian sent me on a search to find the Allsop 23321 before any other.  Cleaning disc in hand I reread the instructions fearful I would mess up on the procedure.  Pushed into the slot I was mildly surprised the Allsop was not rejected.  In a flash the process was telling me I was set to go.  My proof was complete when the next time I asked iTunes to burn a disc -- it happened!  I keep the Allsop in my laptop bag... it's too valuable not to.
I was afraid I would have to replace a DVD drive on my iMac because I was getting  read and write errorsI ordered the Alisop cleaner and when I put it in, it resolved the errors. I was trilled.
Had some bad skipping in my disc player, (hadn't used it in a while) put this cleaner disc in and it cleared up the problem the first time.  I ran it a second time for good measure and my player has been working fine ever since.
It did everything needed to correct the problem I was having. Frequently the DVD's would stop and would have to restart. Also I would have to clean the disc with a window cleaner and that worked some times. After using the this drive cleaner all the disc's have played correctly. Also the disc did tune my stereo that is connect to my player and TV. Very happy. Well use the drive cleaner for time to time to keep things working properlyBobby J.
Worth the money-easy to use! Will buy another! Will be recommending to all! I cannot say enough about this product!
The unit stopped the frequent skipping of the CD player in my 2008 Acura RDX which had become quite annoying. Two passes with the cleaner cured the problem.
I used this cleaner on my home stereo. I have had this equipment for over 40 years updating it for today's mutichannel sound.The disk was able to show me  which speakers were not matched to my main speakers and also how dynamic my over all system is! The onboard diagnostics are great. After cleaning I could tell a definite difference in the fidelity of my system. I would highly recommend this.
My 2 year old DVD player stopped recognizing DVDs when I tried to play them.  Popped in the Allsop, followed the instructions and, easy as pie, my player was working perfectly again.  Highly recommended!
I purchased this product to clean the heads on a CD player.  It does an outstanding job.  For those with more complex stereo and surround sound systems, it will help you balance your sound.  It does exactly what it advertised it would.
Very effective product.I like it very much.I will definitely definitely buy it again for a friend as a gift.Sam.
i brought this because my car has two players a single in the front and a changer in the back I burn my own disc's and after time it would not play past the forth song on the disc, after using it to clean both decks my disc's play great.
For self maintenance on your CD/DVD players you can go wrong here.  Depending on your avg use you might only need it once a couple months but since our son is watching a lot of videos to help him learn to read - this makes the player work so much better.
