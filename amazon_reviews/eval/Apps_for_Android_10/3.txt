I did the 7-day trial and was impressed, but am continuing my search for the best music app. Pros: tons of selection (but every music app has that); my account worked on the phone and online (at least for the trial; not sure if that applies afterwards); download to play off-line (while you have the service, obviously); decent UI (I made the buttons larger for in-car use); decent arrangement of genres with descriptions, key artists, key albums, key songs; info about artists is reasonably detailed; radio stations (though lots of music apps have those); tracking of songs played (though that seemed to be online only); recommendations are ok. Cons: songs did lots of skipping/jumping, even when I had 4 bars & 4G, and even online (though songs sometimes continued when coverage was bad); lacks the customization of thumbs up/down that I grew used to in Pandora; playlist UI isn't helpful - it shows a big view of the album of the currently playing song, then the list rolls of the screen, with no view of the upcoming song (you have to scroll all the way down the list); no lockscreen control; online there doesn't appear to be a way to create shortcuts to favorite radio stations; no scrobbling (there are some 3d party programs for online use). Will continue checking out Pandora, Tunewiki (really like the sync'd lyrics, when it works), Slacker, Winamp, Rdio, etc.
Ipad and Ipod Touch versions are much better. App can be hard to navigate at times and seems more like a mobile site than a convenient app.
For those of you who already have a Rhapsody subscription this is a good app to get.  As long as you can connect to the internet you can listen to your music without filling your devices storage space.  The interface is simple to use.  It needs a graphic equalizer and at nothing you can&#8217;t beat the price.
This isn't a bad ap, but I prefer Our Daily Bread and Daily Bible Devotion better.  I do read it once in a while.
It is good but I was looking for more.I could be what you need so give it a try.
Works for the most part if you're reading, but I like to listen to the Bible while driving.  It's nice that it even has audio because none of the other free bible apps I know of offer that.  My only beef is that sometimes the audio works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I guess it's not the app's fault.  Probably has something to do with the Sprint cellular network I'm on.  I would have preferred to have an option to save the files on my phone as opposed to getting them off the web every time I open it.  That way I'd have instant access to it.  I gave three stars however because despite its problems, the price is right.
The app is a good app however it was not good for what I needed the app for. It might wrk for other people's needs.
I was really surprised by this product. You basically get to read a line a day and navigation is very very very very very very hard. Maybe God can figure it out.
I get the point of it, but its just the fact that there is no tutorial.  they tell you what to do but it is.not clear
The one star reviews are somewhat right.  Nowhere do the instructions indicate how to get towers to fire more rapidly.  Build enough power and the game's not too bad.  The interface is still a bit clunky,  but it's not an awful game.  One bonus star for not grabbing unnecessary permissions.
This is a basic tower defense game.It's not the best looking or most advanced, but it is quite functional (at least on the kindle fire).  In my opinion - it could use better descriptions of the towers in the help menu. It's never mentioned that you NEED a power station - or your towers just shoot once...  I think the icon on a tower once it's depleted it's power does a decent job, but that kind of information is critical to gameplay and should be clearly spelled out in the instructions somewhere.I initially went to the help menu because I tried to DRAG my tower to where I wanted to.  It moved amazingly slow.  I figured that COULDN'T be how it was supposed to be.  It wasn't.  The help screen let me know to touch the location where I wanted the tower and then drag it for fine tuning (which actually works well)."ESC to cancel" also isn't of much help on the single button kindle fire.  To cancel placing a tower on the kindle fire, hit the little arrow at the bottom of the screen that brings up your menu, then hit the "back" arrow.Something else I would REALLY like to see is a "restart level" option.  I've placed my towers wrong and I want to go back and do it all again.  I have to exit and save - go back to the main menu, choose the level, select to start fresh.  It would be a lot easier to have menu options to just start over.I like the fact that this game doesn't have crazy permission requirements - but I don't think it's a $2.99 game.
I spent some time playing this game to get to understand how it worked. It is a simple tower defense game and from that point of view it did what it said it would. It featured 13 different maps and it had a fast forward button to play through each attack at high speed. As long as you plant enough power towers to let your weapons fire you will have it made. You can gain enough points to update the weapons and vastly improve their power for killing the bubbles. The flying balloon weapons are nice as they can track the invaders along the route and continuously bring lethal fire down upon the bubbles. We all know air power rules the battle.I liked how the game did not ask for multiple permissions and finally someone listened to the users and stopped all of the intrusive requests.That being said I have to admit I am not much into tower defense games like this one. I played for quite a while but I just didn't find the game to be as much fun as others I have played. For me this was a 3 star game.
This is not a bad app but I think 2.99 is over price.  I am surprised this game does not have music.  Pacman like music could make the game more interesting.
well true or not the only place i &quot;lose&quot; my car is in the sea of walmart parking.... but i need to protect my contacts. i dont need them busting down my door with pitch forks and torchs. would be nice to be leaving walmart and find my car, guess i&apos;ll stick to pressing the panic button. 3 star for the good idea, minus 2 star for the probable violation in privicy. happy free app of the day amazon, now that i will be able to cook, golf and wouldnt lose my car if this didnt look suspicious thanks to the free of of the day 4 days running (the star chart one would even let me read about it from lack of capatibility)
App glitches a bit. You have to remember to set it when you park and with 3 kids I can get distracted. It was hard to get my map back to car from walking view.
$4, normally, for this app?!  If only everyone knew how little coding this type of app really takes they would all create their own.  I&apos;m guessing it took the developer 2 hours to make this and they are now charging $4 a pop.  Unbelievable...
This app is ok, it does what it says. But there are apps that do it just as well for free, search the market. Most people don't need this on a day-to-day basis(at least I hope not). And the couple times I thought this would come in handy, I wasn't getting a good gps signal in the area, after that and a force close, I ended up finding the car by the time I actually had brought up the location on the map. If finding where you parked is a constant problem for you, by all means try this one out. But for most people, the free ones are going to do more than enough.Droid X
This is not what I expected but i can at least tell what is on but the layout is not very good. I use it but the times do not seem accurate. Even when I change the time zone or zip code or carrier.
This app does what it is supposed to. If you want to check the listings its great for that, it doesn't do much else. I would have liked to have maybe show previews. It works well on the Kindle Fire with no issues. It definitely saves the trouble of going through the listings, it's a quick and easy way to find what you are looking for and get a reminder of what's coming up. Basic and functional. I would recommend if basic and functional is what you are looking for.
but it locked up so I uninstalled an reinstalled and now it no longer recognizes my zipcode.  I rebooted my kindle fire and tried again. no luck. used it the entire past year and loved it. too bad it no longer works
this is gone didn't really need this for my Kindle fire. might better suited for others who require it but not for me under wifi connection
I loved this app &amp; used it daily.  You used to be able to pick just the channels you want to follow.  Alas... the &quot;new and improved version&quot; does not save the channels picked.  Yes you can pick the channels but when you go  back into the app all the channels you didn't  want to see are back.  The list is long to scroll thru if you are only interested in a few channels.  I have tried to save numerous times but it keeps bringing up all the channels.  I should have just stayed with the old version.
Not sure how to use it.  I guess if I spent more time I would be able to figure it out
It's nice and user friendly, but when I surfed through the channel lineup a great deal of channels were missing. Ones my family watch.
Don't use it hardly at all.  Quicker for me just to look in the paper.  Need one just for sports...movies, etc.
Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6There are tons of side scrolling shooters out there, and Overkill is just one of them.  Boasting superior graphics and sound always attracts my attention, so I snatched up this title as soon as I could.On my little Epic, I was able to kick in all the eye candy Overkill offered and still maintain over 50 frames per second.  Everything was very smooth, not a single glitch or hiccup.  I even enabled the fast load option and didn't encounter an issue.  Everything was nicely detailed and crystal clear.  Very, very nice.  On the gTablet, things didn't fare so well.  Averaging 45 frames per second, everything did work, and worked just as smoothly as it did on the Epic, but the graphics were *so* not superior.  They are all fuzzy and lacking detail.  I toggled every option in every combination possible and still they barely entered medicore range. Sorry guys, try again.  As for the sound, yeah, it's pretty good.  Clear sound effects and a good background soundtrack.On both my devices, the accelerometer control was dead on perfect.  I like that Overkill recalibrates at the beginning of each level, adjusting itself to how you're holding the device at the time.  This allows you to to play the game in pretty much any position you want.  In game recalibration is also there, to give you a chance to fix things up if they aren't to your liking.  Doing some good thinking, Overkill's dev also put in sensitivity adjustment, which will allow the game to be adjusted to the device and gamer's preferred style of play.  Keyboard/touchscreen controls worked just as well, with nary a missed movement or sluggish response.  Sorry, I don't own a Zeemote, so I was unable to test this function.The game itself is what I would consider a complete title.  Besides running through a storylined campaign mode, there is is a test mode, quick mission mode, and survival mode, all of which extend the replay level.  Multiple difficulty levels can be played, with the difficulty level factored into your score.  The computer AI's lines are only slightly cheesy, and often humorous.  As is typical with games of this genre, weapons upgrades are available and new weapon types appear at different parts of the games.  A complete help section is built in, with links back to the dev's site for yet more information.  Gameplay is action packed, with no laggy spots.  The one thing I don't particularly care for, besides the less than stellar graphics on the tablet, is the use of the screen real estate.  In general, I think all the objects are too big, giving the gameplay a cramped feeling.With all that praise, why only three stars?  Simple - if you're going to make a lot of hoopla about the graphics and don't deliver, that's a double negative for me.  Get that fixed up, and it's a 4-5 star title.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/question
I picked it up as the deal of the day from Amazon, so I couldn't go wrong.  I don't know that I would have paid for it, but for a free game, it holds entertainment value.  I have since deleted it and haven't looked back.
I got a free zeemote and searched for games that used it thus game is fun as heck... its not pretty it is definitely fun
I really wanted to like this app. It works great on my Thunderbolt, the music is fine, the graphics are sweet and fluid, and the gameplay is all I had hoped for from a side scroller. The controls petty much killed it for me, though: no matter what you do, the ship lags behind where you tell it to go, and that means you don't shoot the targets, and you eat the incoming bullets.Trusting the life of my little ship and its crew to the accelerometer is as bad an idea as one would expect, but the only other option is to cloak your ship with your finger: an act that does little to hide you from the enemies, but does a fair job of obscuring your view, making this difficult and annoying to play. And at the end of the day, those at not words to describe a game that will keep me coming back for more. Which is sad, because it has everything else going for it.
Everything about this game appeals to me except for the controls. I generally don&apos;t like motion control but I gave it a fair shot before switching to the option where you control the ship movement with your finger. That was disastrous. For one thing, you can&apos;t see the ship because your finger completely covers it. That wouldn&apos;t be too horrible, but the nail in the coffin was very poor responsiveness in this mode. \nToo bad, really. I think they did a fine job making a great looking side scrolling space shooter, but ultimately if you&apos;re like me, you won&apos;t like using motion control in this format. \n2. 5 stars
Nothing special here. Not the most responsive side scroller out there or innovative. I uninstalled this app pretty quickly after a few days.
Good game.  Plays well on the Iconia A500.  If anything, I&apos;m sick off all the BS about permissions.  Get over it!!  Go buy an iCrud if you can&apos;t deal with it, you big babies.
Screen controls are a little weird being there are no joysticks, but instead you drag where you want to go. There is absolutely a learning curve, but graphics, gameplay, and customization make up for the difference in controls.
Exactly what I said. This game is alright, and has good quality and really is what it says in the description, but it doesn't really have anything special, or truly entertaining. Wouldn't pay for it, but I bought it when it was the free app of the day.
I expected this to be an addictive app, but to wasn't. Which is a good thing. I enjoy playing it on occasion when I need a break.
fun game, but needs a better dictionary. apparently &quot;apartment&quot; isnt a word, among others that ive tried to use but didnt count.
It's a bit like playing Bookworm with the challenge and personality removed. Words can be made regardless of whether or not the touch. It's too easy and never becomes engaging.It's better than the plethora of anagram games. But, the game needs challenge and a hook to bring you back for more.
First its a good game but i don't like the controls the fact that i gotta tap the green arrow every time to summit a word gets old why not a double tap on the last latter of the word i wanna summit.
not bad but got bored pretty fast at least this is better than yesterday faotd bag it which i found stupid in certain aspects
I love word games...But this one isn't very challenging. I cant see why it wouldn't be free in the first place.
The white tiles glare too much.  Softer tones would be nice.  Even though there is plenty of variety, I prefer Bird Is The Word.  It's just more aesthetically pleasing.
I got this app as the free one of the day and it was a great "buy." The timed levels require you to really think on your feet. Nice app for wasting time.
This app contains 3 word games. However, as others have mentioned, there don't seem to be levels. Each game is scored, but high scores aren't saved anywhere. Also, unlike other word games, exiting the app ends the current game, rather than pausing it for later. That is my biggest concern. I like to go in and out of games over the course of days.As it is, it's ok for free. I wouldn't pay full price until they updated this app with some basic features.
first two modes are far too easy.the third mode is enjoyable, but the collapse aspect adds nothing to the gameplay. in fact, i find it distracting.level end noise is too loud, though in level sounds are fine. i don't care for level end graphic, but other art is nice.i got this as a free app of the day and it was worth the download to try it out, but i think i will be deleting in order to clear up some room.
...just not great either.  Glad it was the faotd, otherwise I would never have known how long it would have taken to download, play, and uninstall this little gem. Not much of a challenge, with almost nothing to make out stand out in the already over crowded sub-category of word games.
wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't wonderful either. not something i'd play over and over, but also not something that i deleted right away.
The fact that it doesn't save the high scores kind of takes the challenge away. Gameplay seems smooth and it's 3 games in one, so if you get bored you can try a different game. If you're trying to beat your previous score though,  you need to remember what it is  !!!
I have had this app for about a year and have loved it until recently. It keeps telling me there is and update but then when I try to update it tells me it is unable to update and try later. The 2 times I did it to update it then does the package installer thing. Once that completes, it says Install Failed! I have not found a way to contact the developer to get help and if this is not fixed SOON I will be finding something else!
First, it gives me no problems. Works well, does what it should etc.But, it offers no options or customization that aren't in a few free Home alternative (not listed here for etiquette, but you can find them by searching the market).If you don't have access to the standard Android Market, I can see this being a viable option for you; otherwise, just go with a free one. :-\
I know a lot of work went into this app. It's not a bad app. It just doesn't offer me any feature that would lure me away from the default.
There are some interesting features and the themes are great but it's lacking things I've grown accustomed to having with ADW...like smooth transitions, resizable widgets, FULL customizability and a fairly small memory footprint.I'm not saying it isn't a decent launcher. I'm just saying that I expect more from a paid app than what can be gotten from a free app.
If your going to spend the money to buy this just go to Android market and but ADW launcher EX.As a launcher this does what it says, the setting screen is a little gaudy but simple. The collapsable mini menus suck.  It might also had just been me but it didn't look very high quality.
Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6Oh, another launcher replacement!  Love these, and customizing was the whole reason for leaving the iPhone behind.  I've tried out lots of them, ADW, Launcher Pro, VTL, and more, settling in on Go Launcher EX for my phone and tablet. Along comes dxTop Pro, and I'm ready to give it a go.Comparing against my previous experience, dxTop Pro isn't too shabby.  It has lots of customization built in, including an iPhone-like lock screen replacement.  There are a fair number of themes for it, but many will cost you and there aren't nearly as many as there are for other launchers.  On both devices, the performance felt laggy, not as snappy as what I'm used to.  Flipping between screens rapidly, say from all the way left to all the way right, invariably stalled and required a second swipe to get to the last screen.  Looking that the resources being used, dxTop Pro eats up a good bit more than Go Launcher EX (22-30MB vs 17-21MB). The included screen capture is a nice idea, but had a tendency to stick and shoot multiple shots.  The captured images didn't include the wallpaper, which is a bummer.  Sadly, the screen capture only worked outside of applications.  The folder setup is depreciated from stock, in that you have to manually put items into the folders one at a time.  On the plus side, you can change the folder icon to whatever you like, including photos.To sum it all up, dxTop has a bunch of cool little features but they come at a price.  Perhaps as it matures it will get better. I'll hang onto it for a bit but have a feeling I'll be back to Go Launcher EX within a week or two.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions
Clock widget could use a resolution update. HTC sense is like 1000 times better overall. This launcher could be good after some more development.
No issues. Smooth, functional, customizable. Easy learning curve for operation. Fun and different. I have many apps I use daily; ability to folder huge plus.
I use LauncherPro as my home screen and have grown quite attached to it. But I thought I'd give this one a fair go to see if it was worth considering. If you are tired of your stock home screen then, yes, I think you should give this a look. It seems zippy and allows you a little more customization than some stock home screens allow. The biggest thing that irked me as that it replaced how I turn on my phone (the launch screen, is it called?). It completely replaced it and didn't ask me if it was okay first. Worst yet, I dug around the options and could not figure out how to turn my old screen back on. It was about this time that I gave up on it. Otherwise, I mostly liked what I saw and liked that it offered a lot of options (just not the one I wanted).Worth considering, especially today while it is free, but it wasn't up to LauncherPro status to me.
launcher pro and others are far superior as launchers but its not a terrible home replacement app.  used in two years ago and it hasn't improved much.
Got this for free, just gave it a few days to try out the features before reviewing. The description touts the diamond pattern layout of the windows, and that is the greatest thing this app brings to the table, which I have not seen in any other launcher so far. Makes you wonder why no one else came up with the idea to lay out your screens to minimize swipe after swipe to get to what you're looking for.Unfortunately, that's also the only great thing I see here. The app drawer appears forgotten, lacking the ability to drag and sort, or create folders to group apps in. (GoLauncher does this for free, btw) The interface has a little sluggishness to it, which never helps. It runs okay on my Thunderbolt (rooted and running DasBAMF 1.8.6 Remix), and looks kindof like crap on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 (stock), (but so far, everything else does too, so no love lost here).Then there is the killer, which took this from a four star app to three, and I even considered two because this was the reason I uninstalled: when my phone reboots I get a message several times telling me that Amazon AppStore is no longer installed. I assume this nuisance alert appears because some Amazon service is still starting up, but why should my app launcher care what market/store I have installed? Must have something to do with licensing, but I think this is as unnecessary as it is annoying. Just open my apps and display my widgets, and don't tell me what needs to be installed, outside of what installed with your launcher.
The interface was nice, but my widgets were gone and so were my file organizer links. (I think that was a free app a while ago) A great idea but it need some touching up.
I tried it for a little while. Wasn't too impressed. I'm just going to stick with the stock HTC Sense 3.0. This app had a few features I liked but just wasn't enough to change my mind.
I gave the dev 3 stars to be fair because this isn't a detailed review. I really just wanted to say that I can't stand when devs design apps that make you feel like you're using a knock-off iPhone. I use Android by choice! EVO 3D
I really like the idea of this app and I wish the Dev the best of luck with it, but in terms of performance, I just can't use it. This replacement UI really slowed down my Droid X.After uninstalling my phone also did a random reboot. Reminded me of a dog getting out of water and shaking to get the remnants off.
The Scanner is OK Because it Works fine and Shows me instructions.the Scanner has everything everyone needs to help you not to be arrested.
i was able to listen to local an out of state radio and police scanners. it was fun. i would recommend this app to anyone.
I don't hate it, but can't say I'm completely thrilled with it. It's not always available for listening, Apparently its controlled by &#34;volunteers&#34; or something like that....eh...but it was free, so can't really complain too much I guess.
It works pretty good but damn are police scanners ect. boring to listen to, nothing ever happens and nobody is ever talking besides the odd code or whatever spoke into a scratchy sounding walky talky.
If you live in a larger city this APP might be ok but in northern Arkansas there isn't anywhere even close this will pick up.
Could not seem to get it working on anything local to where I actually live.  Another one of those &#34;seemed like a good idea at the time&#34; things.
It does work but many areas have limited possibilities.  Only a couple of frequencies picked up in my area and the sound quality was poor.  I found this boring after a while and uninstalled it.
works ok, but please state adware in description. ok 20 words - kindle fire fail. sheesh. nice day today I think
I just wanted to see if it works and it does. I took it off because I don't know if it might be illegal in this state as most everything probably is here. Have no use for it anyway. It works and can be adjusted to many different areas at least where I am located. I didn't know so many people were jabbering on the radio so much. I heard Fire, Police and a lot of unidentifiable jabber talk going on even late in the night. An old Ham or CB operator that knew the lingo would enjoy this thing. A friend of mine works in the Fire Department so I will have to find out if I can have this without cops going goofy on me somehow for some reason. Might be useful in an emergency?
The app works, but it gets the radio transmissions from people who are streaming it through their computer so if a &#34;handler&#34; isn't broadcasting or having issues with their ISP then you don't get anything.  It's ok, we use it to listen to the local police and NYCPD.
it works as a scanner, but it wasn't too fun of an app and you have to keep listening for any calls.  I like the online reports that have text history which is faster to review.
It is not what I expected but I have it and it is kind of fun to mess with and listen to. If you are a Scanner Radio person then this is the item you would want.
Have not tried this app just yet but still have it on my kindle.  I am sure it won't be exactly as I thought it to be but sure it will be interesting none the less.
This app seems to be well executed.  Regrettably, only one channel is available for my area.  If I want to listen to radio traffic in other places it seemed to work pretty well though.
they don't talk much in Dade County and I don't know the codes so deleted it from kindle oh well
wasnt as exciting as i hoped,  i took it off after messing around with it for awhile,  not much else to say
I enjoy listning to police/fire/rescue frequencies from time to time but don't care to shell out for an actual factual scanner . Thought this would be an enjoyable option , which it was but alas my immediate region is not available to listen in on and lets face it , who wants to NOT hear whats going on in their neck of the woods ? I did enjoy listening in on some of the international frequencies it offered , Sydney Australia is a great one ! So for that alone it was worth it but don't be surprised if your preffered area isn't available since many of the places across the US weren't offered for listening .
It works, it's great to listen to big cities scanner. The only downfall for me personally is there is no scanners in my direct area I can listen to. I do still turn it on from time to time for entertainment/background noise but woudl definitely be more fun if local scanners were included in it. I've had it for quite awhile too and none in my area have been added to the app. It does have a search bar and you can search for any department/area/city....I'd recommend it, just not if you're looking for your city and if you live in the middle of no where!
when I first downloaded this app I thought I would be listening to MUSIC from detreoit. well I was wrong. it is kind of cool listening to the police talking but it is just weird
It does the job, sort of.  But for being the only ebook reader app for the most popular source of ebooks--namely, Amazon--it is very sadly lacking in features.  Just compare to ebook readers like Moon+ or Mantano and Android, or even ebook readers on obsolete platforms like Plucker for PalmOS (which I was a developer for).My comments are skewed by the fact that I am a scholar in the humanities, and so my needs are for study rather than just linear reading.Here are some specifics:1. The search is unacceptably slow.  For instance, to search my approximately 6mb ebook, it took six minutes on my Archos 43.  Compare that to 22 seconds with Moon+, or about 50 seconds with Plucker on PalmOS on a much slower device (200MHz versus 1000MHz).  Search is the main advantage of electronic texts for serious students of the texts.  Without a decent speed search, there is little advantage except convenience.  And it would be good to have some more search options (phrase, word, boolean, etc.).2. The subpixel font rendering assumes horizontal RGB striping.  This means that the subpixel algorithm fails, producing faint color shadows near letters, in all orientations other than one (on my Archos 43, it works in portrait, but fails in others;  on my wife's Kindle Fire, it works in landscape, but fails in others).  It's not such a big deal on my Archos 43, as the pixels on it are so small.  This is easy to fix: just turn off subpixel rendering and replace it with grayscale antialiasing, or add an option to do that.  And I bet it works badly in all orientations on OLED devices that don't use uniform RGB stripes at all.  (The best would be to auto-detect based on orientation and screen type.  But I don't know if Android includes an API for getting RGB striping information.  On the Kindle Fire's version of the app, though, you could just go on orientation, since you know which way the RGB is striped there.)  Subpixel rendering for the wrong orientation is worse than grayscale rendering.3. More color options, please.  It would take only a few minutes for the developer to add a bunch more color options.  (I know, because I'm a developer for a PDF viewer for Android.)  For instance, green on black is great for reading at night.  Red on black is essential if you want to preserve night vision.  Black on sepia is nicer than brown on sepia.  And why not just let the user customize it?4. I wish the viewer would optionally let you move through the text by scrolling rather than paging.  Paging isn't quite so good for complex scholarly texts, as it's harder to think about a sentence or paragraph that is broken across screens.  Much easier if you can just scroll it so the text you're thinking about fits on one screen.5. There should be an option to eliminate all margins (on a small screen device, one doesn't need more than about two pixels).  The tightest margin setting still has too much margin.6. Optionally, make the main screen be just a list of titles, like on eink Kindles.  Lists with book cover thumbnails make sense only for small collections of books, and presumably you'd like users to have large connections. :-)7. I can't find a way to categorize books.  There should be one.What do I like?- stability- easy downloads- correct formatting- number of books available
I have used this app on both desktop and android and would rate it as &#34;functional, but nothing to write home about. Had to remove it from my phone, but that was because of RAM problems, not the app itself. It does have a few cool &#34;sister&#34; apps that are separate apps working in conjunction w/ it, but the app itself is about what you would expect. May very well work better on the Kindle hardware, but I don't see the point in purchasing a tablet when I have a smart phone, a laptop, and 2 desktops already. I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes & Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them. If you need a decent reader app, this one is just as good as the next, so go ahead and try it out, just make sure to comparison shop.
As an e-reader this app is the Cadillac ( not Rolls) of the bunch. Great content, ease of use, etc.BUT it is not a home library substitute. I feel like it was written by a geek who own two books. I have to go into the PC kindle to find a cookbook or a sifi novel or a computer book and then search the title on the tablet to find the book to read.Your programmers need to talk to that librarian that told them to be quiet in the library when they were eight.If I can't find it, I can't read it.Even the new Fire HD doesn't have collections.  WE CAN'T SHELVE OUR BOOK - FIX IT NOW
It's an eReader app for books you've bought from Amazon, which I'm. sure you already know. For that purpose it works. It could definitely be better though.Amazon needs to sync personal documents as well as purchased books. If this is a mobile platform for my books why can't all my books come over? Some may point out that personal documents have delivery fees, but that is only using Amazon's 3G and this app uses our networks. Also, why not let us target our app instead of or along with our Kindle? This would require us to be given a unique @Kindle.com email address, but it could work.I also want the app to sync highlighted notes / clippings from when I read on my Kindle.Finally, I want to be able to highlight and share quotes from my clippings like on my Kindle.This app works, but not better than Aldiko and definitely not better than a real Kindle.
Ya know what would be great? If I could read my Nook books on the Kindle app and my Kindle books on my Nook app withOUT re-buying them. That'd be SPLENDID. Imagine if you went to the library but had to chose a format, and some books were only available in one, and others only in the other and you had to pay to switch... libraries would close quicker than they already are.
I thought this was something different than what I had, before I realized I already had this on my phone. If you like to read this might be for you.
I was informed it's for PCs and other devices such as phones, and I didn't need this option. So this review is neutral, and maybe useful with those uses in the future, if I ever need it.
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Verizon latest build update.First: The support folks are terrific. Not too much to do with the issue.Next. The new interface is awkward to say the least. Have had to use cloud on my Fire to insert titles for purchace. Records show previous purchase. Then download at no additional cost.  Although they still don't show in the cloud when sync is used.Have used Kindle reader on All my devices including this one without issue until this latest build.Would like to see last format returned.Cloud access issue seems fixed. Uninstall update. Reinstall. Cloud now appears. All books on device need be downloaded againd.
I don't have a kindle.  I  reinstalled this app for the tablet I purchased for my mom. I just don't use it at all and still prefer real books and magazines to the e-versions.
I downloaded this app on my phone.  I wanted a Kindle, but thought I'd try this first. The app is great, downloads are quick.  It does suck the life out of my battery, though.Great way to try the Kindle family before buying one.  Can't beat the awesomeness of a Kindle.
Don't really read unless I have to puts me to sleep. Would be nice if it would have an option for audio book.
I'm just not feeling it with this app. I guess I burned like 10 seconds before I got annoyed. That popcorn burns as easily as your average sensitive explosive.
Good game over all it is hard to get updates to happen. The computer always seems to win and after a while it is boring.
It doesn't cheat.  Play is fine. But the graphics aren't the best and the AI makes the same beginning moves every game. Even still, the game is fun.
Great game, and an adequate app if you know how to play. Some of the graphic coding isn't done that well, such as marbles landing in adjacent slots. Good number system to keep track of play even if the graphics aren't great.
I like this board game.However it is easier to play the board game.My kids and I just couldn't get the hang of this particular game's electronic version.
It's an all right radio player, and there are several out there to try. I tried several radio stations and all of them came in clearly, no problem. I do wish the controls were a little more intuitive, especially when looking for a station. I had to really dig just to find Top 40, which is what I listen to most... as do most people. Also, I wish I could search by location as I'd rather listen to something local or from a specific country. No major complaints, but nothing about this blew me away either. If you are looking for Internet radio, try the trial first before dropping upwards of five dollars on this.
This app is okay. I've only listened to a couple of stations and they're not quite what I expected, especially for a paid app.I tried the Irish Pub station and was really expecting more pub like music. Not everything I listened to was really what I would define as &quot;pub&quot; music, which I would define as something you'd hear at an Irish session.I also tried the Wacken station because I thought it'd have a decent selection of heavy metal. I haven't had time to listen it a lot, but I thought the Pogues was an interesting choice for a metal channel.Anyways, these seem like random Internet channels and I'm entirely convinced that all of them are good. Maybe it's just what I'm into. I'll play around with it more and see where it ends up.
I downloaded this free app onto my Fire HD.  It works well.  But there are better applications for music.  And yes the better app is probablly the one you are thinking of -- ask anyone under the age of 30 something and they weill tell you what it is.
The candle flame grew and now is to the far right of the screen and I can't shrink and center it. Not a bad app
it is a good app all of the flashlights r cool except 1 and that's the candle flashlight is only half of a candle flame on the side of a screen
This is quite a good game but very small to see so I uninstalled it to make room for another game.
I have been winning.  I started at the lowest difficulty and worked my way up.  I only lost one game out of 25, won every game at the highest level.Dinice
the game is fun.  But when you are playing the computer you very seldom win. It seems like the computer always gets lots of doubles when behind and comes back and beats you. It cheats.
Backgammon for kindle. Nothing special. Graphics are ok. If you really like backgammon you'll probably like this app. Again something to play while your bored.
I'm a backgammon nut, I will admitt that the computer seems to have the advantage and seem to always throught the right dice about 99% of the time in it's favor but I still love playing it.
What can I say? I play it when I get bored. Usually never win, but it's fun to try to win.
I like backgammon and it's fun to play against the computer because you are trying to outwit it.  I haven't played it enough yet to give a thorough review.
The dice appear to be driven off a pre-seeded prng, since you can undo multiple rolls and then get exactly the same rolls again. That isn't technically buggy and they can legitimately claim to get a flat distribution over time, but it means players can cheat and therefore so can the computer.Secondly, the AI is defective. It's even worse than one I would write! That really REALLY needs fixing. Badly. It seems to have a lookahead of zero and a penchant for stacking everything on the last space. Either write a better AI (herustics, not fixed moves) or let it write its own (genetic algorithms).
Dice certainly seemed to be slanted toward the computer expecially with the doubles.  It becomes a real expected roll of doubles exactly when needed for the computer not for the player.
I love playing backgammon on the computer; however, the Al Factory Limited Backgammon is slow and cumbersome to play.  I relish a fast paced game and one that only requires one click to move a tile.  This version is okay in a pinch, but not something I would look forward to playing daily.
I have no experience with this type of game, but I gave it a try.  It was fun at first, but I don't think I know enough about this type of adventure to get the full experience.  That said, it's amazing how the app responds to your input...  and can be frustrating, too!
Didn't order this, but you can't go wrong with hanayama metal puzzles. They are all very well made, generally not too expensive, and if you get stuck, SOMEBODY on YouTube will have a video solution.
unfortunately it isn't quiet as good as i remembered it to be.  Having said that it is still an interesting way to waste a few minutes here and there.
This dev can do much better - check the features for the iPhone version. I concur with the critical reviews this has been getting.  This has a decent # of restaurants and the ability to sort by various fields (calories, etc.), but definitely needs way more. It doesn't actually count anything; you can't change menu items to subtract items like mayo(which many websites do); there's no real size selection; it is missing key details like saturated fat, sodium, & sugar; other reviews have noted inaccuracies & that it is out of date on some items; needs app 2 sd card; it should also have a "favorites" option for restaurants & menu items for quick look-up. Clearly an app like this is much-needed, but this doesn't fill the void. Other reviewers suggested My Fitness Pal, Calorie Counter & MyNetDiary apps; I'm going to check them out.
The app does what it says and it has a decent number of popular fast food chains. However, it is certainly not worth $2.99 for a few reasons.Pros: Easy to pick icon driven restaurant chooser. No ads.Cons: Only has 71 restaurants. Once you select the restaurant you get a basic menu driven list like most other apps. Only displays calories, fat, carbs, fiber and protein. So there is no report of saturated fat, vitamins, or other useful info. It only displays one item at a time, so adding up a meal would be a very arduous process that would require pen, paper, and probably a calculator. I could actually go on and on.Summary: Basically, there are a lot of other apps that do a better job, provide more information, are more useful, easier to use, and all around higher quality.
really wamt.to.like this app.  it is loaded with info soni guess i should.gibe ot 4-5 stars... except I cant... No sd card support.  an app has to be fantastic to warrant no sd card support if its going to compete with other apps that do.  3 stars until it aupports.sd mempry
This is fun game to pass the time. It's not very visually appealing, but it will do. I've enjoyed it so far.
This is a puzzle game where you move cars around to get your little red race car out. I like the idea, but it's a little hard to see; I don't know if it's got too many colors and things going on or the puzzle area is too small. Also doesn't have hints.. ugh Or at least not that I've found.
This app is grete with the puzzles and all but it isn't my fab app. It has great puzzles that are just the right challenge but I got bored
downloaded the app because it was free.  Tried it out and it was a fine app.  I just haven't used it for any length of time because it didn't interest me.
I would of given this more stars but couldn't get farther/deeper into the game.LOL Guess you really have to be smarter than what game you are playing...I amobviously parking challenged.  I would think this would keep a young teen busyfor hours!  Colorful graphics.
While this is an interesting variation on a sliding puzzle, it is not something I find all that enjoyable.  It does have nice graphics though, and seems to be well designed.
This is a pretty fun game to play. I usually like puzzle type games. I got bored pretty fast but its a game to pay sometime.
This is a simple, yet fun puzzle game. Many one star reviews state that this game asks for too many permissions, but I do not see that on my version.
sorry, but why does a game, that only involves moving around vehicles, need those kind of permissions? I know a few games that don't ask for anything.
THINK THAT IT IS STUIP THAT I HAVE TO SEPEND HAVE A DAY DOING THIS. IT WAS FUN. MY 5 YR LIKE IT. JUST GREW OUTTA OF IT
My four year old son likes this game but really failed to learn much. He is a bit old for most of the content and since he has been in Preschool since he was 2, finds this a little boring. Less repetitive content would be better and as a few have said, save features would be nice and ability to keep home keys locked out during play so they don't exit accidentally would have earned out another star.
Got a good laugh at a green &amp; the word cream in the living room?? Got 2 blue dots &amp; the word highway in the office, red dot &amp; pilot in the bedroom, 2 blue dots &amp; reach in the playroom!!?? What's all that supposed to mean??? It will amuse my 5 year old, because she wants ghosts to live with us, no she can &quot;find&quot; them!!!;p
I'll give it props for being entertaining, and when I first used it, it freaked me out a little. I heard the words string, star, went, and mind. Not a lot happened so I guess my house just isn't haunted. Haha :)
I think the app is fake cuz I saw dots then they disappeared. Unless ghosts somehow escape detection the app is fake. 3 stars cuz I don't wanna give a bad review in case it is real
it is cool but not real but it is weird bcuz I picked up my bag and it said the word bag. and my dad was making dinner in the kitchen and it said the word kitchen. we have a lot of ghosts in our house. you should try it at least it free
its like going in circles but tugs all it does so its kinds boron but I'll.wait till it does smth in spooky!!!!peace
I work with spiritual investigations and am still on the fence as to whether this program really works. I've had no &#34;words&#34; that have meant anything to me, and at times it sits foreve and displays nothing...but maybe I'm in a ghost free zone :o) Not sure how it is supposed to detect ghosts...but it's a fun conversation piece with others.
me and my little sis just got this app and its kinda creepy. the first word was western and we live in Indiana and it doesn't make sense. the second word was Bush and our uncle is outside now gardening. the third word was forgotten and i don't think i forgot anything. oh well. this is a pretty good app to freak out your friends as long as you don't believe. i dont but i still think its creepy.
My daughter wanted to see if this app was good and she thinks it useless I don't know if I'd recommend it
My sister put this on my new smart phone as a joke. &#34;Joke&#34; being the operative word. We had a couple of light laughs. Not sure I will keep it.
Not for serious ghost hunters, but it is a cool little app for kids to have fun with. Plain, simple app to pass the time for a bored child
that's the question. if you believe ghosts, goblins, spirits etc walk amongst us. then this app may assist you in convincing unbelievers  such as myself.if on the other hand you do not harbor any curiosity towards &quot;life&quot; beyond this waking world, you might be sorely proved correct by this apps lack of clear &amp; convincing evidence.
the dial spins and announces random words that don't relate to each other or anything.is it supposed to be bits of ghost talk?
This app is freaky. The first time I tried, it said rain. I'm not so sure if this is accurate.
This device is not the real thing.  The words that it says are completely random; ask it a questions and you will get something illogical.  The &#34;spirits&#34; keep popping in and out, and sometimes it will say a word when it shows no spirits are around.  Fun for entertainment, but don't expect to use it on any ghosts hunts.
This game is not great fun like the old fashion quija board, or anything, but it is mildly amusing. The radar just rotates around a central point and small dots, presumably ghosts, appear on the screen.
within the first two seconds of use I picked something up. idk what it said but I was looping at the time. poop is yummy
Ghosts don't really pop up on my screen that much. pretty boring if you ask me. And random words pop up on the screen that I can't put together! lol
This is a good way 2 get u and ur friends freaked out at a late night birthday party .
I am still checking this one out.  My anti-virus program though is telling me this is adware so I might have to take it out.
I don't believe in ghost I know they don't exist so I don't know and u cant fool me saying u saw a real ghost I don't believe in that junk
Not impressed, this could have been so much better. This runs a little different on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; than it did on my Apple IPod. I know it's just for fun, but sometimes I say things are just a little too coincidental.
Ok so like within the first five minutes I had caught a ghost and had heard sounds around me. Then it came up with the word &quot;twelve&quot; and that is how old I am. this is really freaking me out. I don't know if it is real or fake but this is just plain weird.
I use this app when the grand-kids visit us, they get a kick out of it. Some of the words it says give me a cold chill, but it's still fun.
sometimes you get an app that is just for fun and works well this is one of them.  Dont think it really works but it is fun.  I like it thanks
I think it is a cool app but I don't think it is real because its always. making weird sounds. so don't get it please it is a waste of time.by Chyanne. Hamlin
This is fake that makes me mad I am a real paranormal investigator and fake apps like this makes us look bad should make  real parnormal investigating to help people no fake apps just to take peoples money
This would be great for kids at a slumber party or for really naive adults who believe every speck of dust in a picture is an orb.I bought the free version and I liked it well enough and then I bought the paid version which is no different from the free version in any noticeable way.With the paid version, it's almost as though it is setup to shoot out random words and phrases at a certain interval. Maybe they thought people would get their moneys worth that way to give people who paid for it more fake excitement? It seems that way to me.If you're into the paranormal, I would download the free version just if you're curious but don't buy the paid version. The free version is better, in my opinion.Don't expect this to be a serious tool--it's just a toy.
I can see my own kind, I'm not blind or mabye I am. Anyway I go to the graveyard yo see my buddy Jeff, it did not detect his presance AT ALL!!! Then I go to walmart and A BILLION FAKE GHOSTS WERE THERE!!!!! I think this is THE AVERAGE SHOPPER RADAR!!!!! It kept saying FOOD and SALES and BUY. WHAT?!?!?!  At least say what kind of app this is. MAYBE ITS A TYPO?!?! Well ALWAYS READ REVEIWS. Three stars cause it does something. SO IF NEED YOU TO FIND THE AVERAGE SHOPPER BUY THIS. Btw...BOOOOOOO!
This app used to work great for me. I searched out many spirits, most of whom became fast friends (well, some of them were a bit decayed and they weren't so fast).My issues began after my recent demise in a construction accident. I wound up in a number of pieces. It can be quite challenging to keep track of all of them. This application does an adequate job of finding the big pieces like my legs but isn't sensitive enough for my fingers and nose. Since the little pieces are the ones that usually get lost, this is a serious drawback.
what does : or pig park exciting somehow havent : mean?  im scared. theres a place called pig park down the street and i night i always hear voices in my house.
The reviews are the very best for this game.  I laughed out loud.  It is a little creepy when it says strange words.  But if you've ever spent an afternoon in the nursing home, it's pretty much the same thing.
Fun App, but needs a Barcode reader to enable tagging and identifying of ghosts and spirits . . . what? Hey, this app has already broken down the boundaries,  why not go the whole way?
I can't validate the accuracy of this app at finding the supernatural, but, it does at least produce *a* result.  It's up to you to decide for yourself if the results you get are more than just entertainment.  The app is stable, controls explained, and is an interesting conversation piece over dinner.  Especially if you're having dinner with your minister, priest, or other clergy member.
Im not saying I don't or do believe is ghosts. lets make that clear. but the point if this app I think is mote to just have fun. I mean seriously out the pal on your kids phone let them have fun with it. it's not the real deal. cause lets say ghost are real and the pros who have big equipment well. that equipment costs thousands of dollar's. now do you really think a phone even as advanced as the evo 3d which I have is capable of matching the hardware as of the pros? No. it's not. so I believe this app is not yo be taken serious but as just getbsome laughs out and dont be afraid to let the child inside of you out and just have some good ole fun.Deuces everybody DJ Collyder out and happy Halloween
So this is a gag app mostly but it's mostly lost on me. I played around with it for a while and then decided I was done with it.
The title says it all. The reason I didn't give it a better score was not because of what it is or what is was supposed to be or do. It was just for fun.  It was because of the way it worked. It used way to much system resources and was nearly impossible to turn off. On more than one occasion I had thought I had turned it off only to find it still running in the background. I couldn't find any setting to shut it off on exit. I had to use the app killer installed in order to close it. Quite annoying.
It would run all the time after exiting and force closing.  Uninstalled to end it.  Fun for free, but annoying it wont close completely.
It may show blips of ghost. It may say words that &quot;ghosts say&quot;, that sometimes make sense. But relax, it is not real, but I do believe in ghosts, I watch Ghost Adventures. The app is like its not real!
Lawl. this is very creative. I'm not critizizing, but you really have to have imagination for this game. AND IT CALLED ME MEAN!!! &gt;:) ill get u for that. :3demon wolf
It's for entertainment purposes, but it is fairly creepy.  Winchester would of loved this,but she joined &quot;them&quot;. Makes a great prank too.
Diverting to a point. I never had it pick up anything on the radar just occasionally say it had picked up words.
So  I was just on it and it shows that like 53 words were spoken. But it had no ghost on the radar and I was home alone and I started freaking out. Then I viewed the words, they were completely random I was confused I don't think this is real so you should pass on this. :(
I got words like sham, stupid, waste, took your money, fool, time bandit. All words describing the app, no doubt.
This app is fine just for a laugh, or to hear a device talk to you, or just for no reason at all.  I installed this app and have been running it off and on since I got it.  I have yet to find anything that I find relative to myself.  I have done a lot of research on this app because at one point it did keep saying &#34;Billy&#34; and I know no Billy, but about 3 days later a Billy comes by that my husband hasn't seen in a very long time.  I really think that it's just coincidence but it's always fun to play with the idea of the Ghost Radar, especially for the kiddos!
I like that it records &#34;words spoken&#34;...but I still think the &#34;Classic &#34; version works a little better.  They are both fun apps. though....
So to see if ghost radar actually worked, you could install it on two phones and compare results.... it does not work... it is just good for recreational use.  It's fun but stupid.
Not for serious ghost hunters, but it is a cool little app for kids to have fun with. Of course it doesn't track real ghosts
I was bored so I got the app, I don't believe in ghosts or anything I was just bored. its an ok app it shows weird patterns in your house and tells you there's a ghost there, its like your little brother on your phone. one thing I think would be cool to add is that at nighttime if someone turns it on make it so that it says that there are.like 30 ghosts right next to him
This game is not exactly what I was looking for in a word game.  I need more of a challenge.  It was okay, but really not exceptional.
I tried the app Word Frenzy on my Kindle Fire and I thought it was OK. It wasn't a game that kept me really interested or one I wanted to play just to waste some time. I have tried other word game apps that are better than this one. I didn't dislike the game, just didn't really like it either. I think what really gives me this opinion is the game doesn't have any eye catching graphics. Everything is different shades of green. It is free so try it and see if you like it, if you don't you aren't out any money!
I was looking for a app that was similar to the Scrabble game.  This is not it!  I did not care for this game did not like the timing.  It was challenging though if you are good at vocabulary origins.
Lots of stock index and commodity futures. You can track your portfolio and get daily news on each symbol as well as stock charts
I thought I would get into investing more so I downloaded the app.  However, never got into is so I haven't used it much.  But from the looks of the app, it should give you all the info you need.
I your wifi speed slooooow? This might help. It will tell you the available channels on your router and suggest which channel your router might be faster on. Of course, once I get a router set up, I don't like go in and change the settings, but if you do, this will work for you.
Nice app that reveals ambient networks and signal strengths as well as your phone's address and other details, all of which could be found under the os's inherent network tools. But this app does make it slightly faster to compare multiple signals' strengths.
This is a great app that could easily earn 5 stars. Unfortunately, the developer seems to have chosen to keep it ad based rather than offering a paid, ad-free version, and I find ads to be a serious turn-off in any app. I'm so sick of seeing blurry in-app ads for a local car dealer I've sworn never, ever, to do business with them. Ever. Seriously. (Yes, I mean YOU Pohanka Hyundai) In fact, I can't recall ever actually seeing an in-app advertisement that made me want to buy whatever product they were selling, but I can think of dozens of apps I've looked at and then removed because they were ad based. Most such ads are poorly done, difficult to actually read on such a small screen, and block portions of the app you're trying to use, and that's exactly the case with this app. Sorry, that makes this app worth, maximum, 3 stars to me. But offer an ad-free version and I'll gladly rate it 5 stars. Thumbs up if you agree.
I tried to download the wifi connector but it never loaded.  Very ambiguous to say the least.  I wish I could totally use this app.  It would be great if it really worked on the Kindle Fire.  But all I use this for isto see signal strengths.  I want to connect to them not just see them.,
Standard utility item.  Should have been built-in.  Display(s) could have been clearer, but they are sufficient for most needs.  Okay.
Sure, it tells you want is going on with your connection and what is available in your location for WiFi.
If  your looking for a program that assist with determining the strength of wi fi signals this program will help you.
I have rated this product as okay because it does measure the Wi-Fi signal but it does not provide a way to improve the signal.
This software is not to mesure WiFi speed, it is to see the wifi network around and their strengh signal. It's ok but I never really find a good use of it.
I got this because my tablet has a real problem connecting to the internet and facebook. I downloaded this but my internet speed appears perfect. Kind of a waste for me.
I didn't use it that much considering the device I had had good signal to the wifi networks I used and it didn't really scan fast enough to be amusing on the train ride to or from my job.
Lets you know how strong of an internet connection you are using, while at the same time showing all your neighbors around you
It's a challenging game but I just couldn't get into it. I get headaches from concentrating to much. So I couldn't play it for that long. It's nice to know they do a varsity of apps. :)
I liked this game at the start but it got a lot harder and kind of boring in later levels.  It's definitly a puzzle game.
Permissions aren't bad, gameplay is smooth and concept is well executed. For free, it's worth the download. I probably won't keep it for long, but for now it's fun.
If you're a person that likes puzzles, this game is for you. I'm not exactly a puzzle person, but I got it for free while they were having a special. If you're not a puzzle person, DON'T GET IT. I mean, I don't regret getting it, but that's because I got it for free. If you don't like puzzles, then it's definitely not worth paying for. And for everyone who's complaining about it not having a colorblind option, what do expect? I'm sorry, but there's a MINORITY of colorblind people in America. They're not gonna make a whole other game that like, 10% of Americans would buy because they're colorblind. Also, if you're colorblind and you bought a Kindle Fire, if you have any sense to think ahead, you wouldn't have gotten one for apps, because most apps have color in them. Believe it or not, Kindle Fires were made for people to read.
Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6Dragon Fire is a easy to play game where you redirect colored fire from into the appropriate receiver. Graphically, it's ok, and scaled all the way up to use the full 10" screen of the gTablet. The background music is decent, adding to the ambiance of the game rather than detracting from it. Control is done through tapping the connectors to change the direction the fire will travel along. It sounds pretty simple, and it is, but each new level adds complexity. More colors, more connectors, more receivers, etc. The difficulty level selection is done by adjusting the speed of the game. I like the way they do this, which is with a slide bar instead of a few predefined speeds. Dragon Fire lacks a score mechanism or any other way of tracking how well you did other than by completing the level. If there is such a thing in the game, I missed it, and there isn't a help section to clarify things. The base game is good, but the app as a whole lacks depth found in similar games.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions.
game is as described but if find that on my Samsung touch it is sluggish and causes me to lose lives.
