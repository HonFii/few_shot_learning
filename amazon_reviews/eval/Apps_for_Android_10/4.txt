It's easy to use and transfer songs. If I purchase songs I usually use iTunes but Rhapsody allows me to get songs and listen to them before I purchase them. However, some albums are only allowed to be purchased which I find annoying. I think they need to allow subscribers to get them for the fee. After all we can not keep them if we are not subscribers.
I love my rhapsody!! I was so glad that I could get it on my kindle for my daughter!! I have had Rhapsody since it was Napster...love that it is a device that we can use it on!
I love it, it works great as a mobile radio app. I've been able to use Rhapsody for a year and the product and app are defiantly recommended.
I know this app has been out for a while but I just downloaded it.  It's easy to use I just have to remember that I have it on my kindle.  I can get used to it though.  And it's free.
Overall, a pretty well made tower defense game. I found it to be quite fun, if a bit too easy on the easy settings.Things that aren't in the instructions that people can't seem to figure out on their own:You place power station towers to recharge your towers. 3 were sufficient for me to beat the first level.When placing a tower, you tap the location you want it, and then you can drag your finger around anywhere on the screen to fine-tune the placement. Quite brilliant, that; it solves the problem of trying to carefully place the tower while it's under your thumb.Enemies come from left to right on the first level. I assumed the opposite, due to the background graphic.Overall, a pretty solid game. Runs well, no crashes, no lockups, freezes, or any other negative events. Graphics are suitable to what you would expect from a bubble popping TD game.-1 star for poor instructions, not that it wasn't hard to figure out; very easy, simple game.EVO 3D, FAOTD.
this game is great now that its free and yes there are some issues that can be fixed but if you don't want to pay three bucks for it then get it while its free now.
greetings fellow amazonians from here at the Nashville city holding cell. this is not where I live, but I was extradited to here because a previous public nudity charge.anywho I was here and pretty bored so I looked up the faotd. I was a little worried that bubble defense 2 was not good to download and play in jail, but boy was I wrong. even though the game is a little lame the guys here don't care. some of them have been sitting here since the first. iphone came out and didn't know that this stuff exists. what was great I could use this game as a new currency which is really making my stay here pretty nice. thanks amazon for making my stay in jail an enjoyable one!
At first I  didn't  think  it was working  right on my K Fire. I couldn't  drag the towers, but once I figured out how to place them (just tap where u want them) things were fine. I only give it 4 stars because the graphics could be lots better.
This is the first tower defense (TD) game i've played and it's an enjoyable game.  Most of the negatiave reviews are from people that don't understand the concept and were to lazy to try to understand...or perhaps just trolling, big surprise.  The initial towers you can purchase shoot once.  As you earn more coins you can upgrade to better towers, power stations etc.  Anyways, the game looks simple in appearance, but again it's just a simple TD game for your phone.  The two things i don't like were the instructions didn't mention that you can upgrade during waves, not just between waves.  Also, I couldn't slide towers across my screen.  I could only move them by touching the spot on my screen where i'd want them.  This was tedious at times because the tip of your finger isn't as accurate as if you were using a stylus.  Sliding would have been much easier.  HTC Thunderbolt stock.
Honestly, what the hell is wrong with people today? The instructions about the power sources is *PERFECTLY* clear. Just because the bulk of the one star reviewers are brainless mouthbreathers, who are incapable of comprehending basic English, doesn't mean this is a horrible game.Idiots aside, this is actually a fun little game and, IMHO, a nice variation of your typical tower defence game. The controls aren't perfect though. Placing the towers can be a little cumbersome in terms of fine tuning the location in a hurry. So meaning that after doing the initial click-to-place the &quot;dragging&quot; for fine tuning is very slow. ESC = 'back arrow'.Game plays just fine on my rooted / rom'd Charge.
Its a pretty simple looking game.  The graphics are pretty base, and, the sound is lacking, but, I like the game mechanics, and I find it to be a better than average spin on tower defense.I find this title to be above average.
Standard TD game, set your various type of towers, be sure to set-up power stations to keep your towers firing and as you accumulate money you can upgrade or sell and change your towers. Different type towers are needed for different types of baloons traveling the course. Bright colorful graphics show up well on Kindle Fire. There are a dozen or more layouts and about 5 difficulty levels so lots of replay value although I feel the regular price a bit high, in other words I probably wouldn't have paid the price but it's definitely a good app as the free app of the day. Thank you Amazon.
My son and I really enjoy this tower defense game (I love the genre), and spent many hours over the past year or so playing it.  Yes, the graphics are a bit simple, and it isn't the best TD game out there, but it has been a nice addition to the library.  In my opinion, the 1-star reviews are unwarranted, and should be reserved for apps that really should be avoided.As for the permissions, this one really doesn't have any to speak of, so that's definitely a plus!Is it worth $3?  As much as we've enjoyed and played it, I'd say in hindsight yes.
if your wondering why it shoots once and stop you need to buy the lightning Icon and now that I know how to play its pretty good there's no defense games for the kindle fire so I'm glad they have one
Test device: Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialHave problems with locating you car while shopping, at an amusement park, etc?  Car locator *might* be for you.  It's pretty simple to use, and has a ton of extra features tossed in.  Simply tap the little guy in the corner and close the app.  Wen you open it again, it will show you which way you need to go to get back to your car.  Use it to take a pic of your spot and or the cars near you, just in case you need a little extra help or your car is damaged while you're away.  A lot of thought and effort went into Car Locator, and it's a handy little tool.  While obviously it's gear toward automotive use, realistically you can use it to find your way back to any spot you mark.The unhappy truth about this app though is that it relies on GPS location and a digital compass to lead you back.  While you can get away without having the digital compass, you're out of luck without GPS.  This can include times where you're in a spot where GPS signal is weak or non-existent, like a parking garage or around very tall structures.  How accurate Car Locator is is heavily dependent on how good a GPS and GPS signal you have, both at the time you mark your location and when you start trying to find your way back. In my testing, Car Locator was off by as much as 50 feet at times, which may not sound like much, but it's enough to put a good number of cars between you and where you want to be.Overall, I think it's a pretty cool app that will do what it claims if conditions are right.
Definitely not an app that I use every day.  I don't need to.  In those rare times that I do, it is a lifesaver.  It is fantastic when you are on vacation and have to park far away from where you are trying to go and don't know the area to be able to easily find your way back.
4.5 stars from over 1,100 ratings on Googles Android Market.\n\nRegarding the permissions,  read the app description; they are all justified.
This app is put together very well. Works really well and is very easy to learn and use. I like that the GPS feature is optional and doesn&apos;t just come on automatically.. I&apos;m not sure how often I would actually use this, but it&apos;s fun to play with.
Just got and haven&apos;t tried yet. For free it maybe worth a shot. Hope they didn&apos;t charge me since it is free app of the day.
Very useful to me because I don't actually have cable so I never have any way to see if my shows are on or new. This does that and also lets you customize your channel list so you only see those you need.
I have used this program on my kindle and galaxy phone...worked great. The kindle one upgraded...NOW I ONLY HAVE 1/3 of my channels that were there a few minutes ago. I sync'ed, I rebooted, I unselected all channels then re-selected all, the deselected and picked a few....no changes...shows the same 8 channels. I am not happy. I really liked this program and used it multiple times in a day...NOW I CAN'T! I'm going to delete it and reinstall...if not working, it's going bye bye from my tablet.Ok, update.....Completely delegated from everything then 're-downloaded and reinstalled...now working fine and dandy so I will now give two more stars...could easily have been 5 but I'm keeping one for the version's aggreviation!!!!!
This APP displays all local channels.  You choose whether you have cable, local, or satellite.  Then displays future shows.  Personally, I do not like free apps.  I do not care for advertising ads.
Gives up to date information regarding television programs . I use it on a daily basis to determine what programs to watch during the day.
This displays a TV schedule covering several hours at a glance for all channels based on your area and provider, much like an on-screen TV schedule.  However, being able to see 3 shows per channel at a glance is nice and the ability to drill down to the complete schedule for any particular schedule is excellent, especially for movie or sports channels.  And you can't beat the price!
I have been looking for an app to simply show me what's on, what time and perhaps some information about the shows and this fits the bil nicely.
Just got this as a free app.  I really do like the ease of use and its speed.  You can find info about over the air programs, satellite, and cable. You can narrow your search to only the channels you want.Maybe I just don't know how to save my choices, but when I switch between satellite and over the air (OTA) programs I lose my selection of favorite channels. Then when I switch back to OTA I have lost those favorites, also. This is the only drawback to this app that I see. If this problem was worked out (or if I find out how to do it right) I would definitely give it 5 stars.This is still a good app since my TV doesn't show me info on OTA programs in advance.Thanks to the developer for making this a free app.
We have Comcast, and when it comes to the "premium" (a matter of opinion) channels, they only list one each for HBO, Strz, etc. high definition channels. For programs in Hi Def, you have to go to "On Demand" for each of the premium channels.That may not make sense to you, but there isn't much sense about 900 channels to begin with. And that's where TV Listings for Android comes in. I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire, and up popped 900 programs for every half-hour on almost every channel we get. And THAT was great except that I don't ever watch 830 of those channels.In order to "delete" the channels that you don't watch, you have to check them off and delete them one at a time. This would rate 5 stars plus if there was a way to block, say channel 300 through 699 and delete them. After that, there's another group of 200 channels, and then I wouldn't mind picking out individual channels.Right now, even after some selection, when I want to see what's on at 9 PM, I'll get a list of 400 programs.Now, if that app would like to go a step further, I'd like to be able to delete individual programs that I will never watch ... like Tivo.
Long ago, we cut off the too-expensive pay for too many channels you'll never watch cable. We only get over the air channels now. It's rather quaint...there's a small selection of channels, but I typically find something on when I want to watch. It's like when we were kids....good sitcoms in evenings, family stuff in afternoons, kids stuff after school and cartoons on Saturdays, and garbage during the daytime except on one channel which runs stuff like Mr. Ed, I Dream of Jeannie, and McHale's Navy....real fun shows! This app helps us to see what's on. It's easy to browse since we don't have many stations. I set some timers for tomorrow to see how those work. I don't mind the ads as long as they don't flash ...developers need to get  paid for their service. More categories would be nice...Westerns please!
useful when you want to find out what's on to nite fast and concise.It loaded and works on my htc inspire.
It is great to have something like this on my Kindle.  It is a fun app for getting TV listing.
I have a very weird, spotty low-end cable package that makes standard listings useless. This program lets me put in only the stations I need, and is 99% accurate even for the bizarre stations! Love that I can get details on a listing if I don't recognize the name of the movie, as well.
Quick to set up, easy to use, does exactly what it says.  My only complaint is that every time there's an update I have to uninstall and reinstall.
the &#34;great price&#34; was sarcasm since there is no price for this app. however, i enjoyed finding out when television shows are on. it's a lot better to open this app than search the channels to see what's on. however, this does not give you a week's notice when the shows come on. it only gives you a day or two of tv listings. this is my only critique.
This is a great tv guide for checking on shows and times. I like the way it goes in detail on the show and the plot to the show!
No problems so far. We will see how long that lasts, lol. Usually after a month they stop working properly....
This was a huge 5 stars app, but now I wouldn't give it even the 1 star that I did.  On 4-4-14 this app changed.  First I noticed that programming after 6:30 PM that day was not listed.  Second the logo changed and the name was a little different.  I tried removing it and then reinstalling it, and now I get that the app is not reading the internet.  THIS IS WHY I DON'T UPGRADE APPS.!!!!!!!!24 HOURS LATER 4-5-14 THE APP IS BACK.!!  THANK YOU!  Now it offers 7 days of programming, category selection, and better information  on your selected programs.Because of the advertising window, which is still annoying, I NOW GIVE THIS APP 4 STARS.!!  Check it out, again.IT IS MY OPINION,since this app has a new logo,a new name and new features,it should also have new reviewing stats. Which is looking like (2) 4 stars vs (12+) 1 star.My suggestion is delete this app 100% (device,cloud,and app library) wait a day and then reinstall. That's what I did.
I've been searching for the perfect app for TV listings and I just may have found it. With the most recent update, the TV Listings by TV24 does almost everything I want. It is easy to save just the channels I want and I can select a specific program to get more details. Two more things would make this the all-time most perfect app: 1) Provide an option to view in a grid (my personal preference) and 2) Allow the ability to open the app on a computer to print the listings to share with the family.Great job! I plan to tell everyone I know about this app!
Needed this for my Kindle, and it does the job. Not much else I can say about it except that it's there when I need it.
We are cutting back on our cable cost--using Amazon Prime, HULU plus, and Netflix for tv/movies, and cutting down to the lowest tier of cable (until we get an antenna installed) and getting Ooma reduces our cable cost by $100 per month.  With the lowest tier of cable--basic reception--you don't get the on-screen tv grid.  This APP is a fine substitute.
Don't have TV guide, don't get the paper, but do know your cable company, then this app will help.One draw back is going though and deleting all the channels you don't have.
I'd give it five stars but I'm not clever enough for anything beyond &#34;Moderate&#34;. You lose a star because I can't play half the levels. It ain't fair, I know, but, well... that are life.
Definitely grab this today if you have any interest in a sudoku app. There's plenty of them around, some that are free. But this one is by far the best i've used. I can't say that it's worth $3 for everyone, as i'm not personally a hardcore sudoku guy. But really, the tutorials really make this worth it. The hard puzzles are actually challenging. Theres no shortage of puzzles. The highlighting system rocks, as well as the best hinting system i've seen..I need a lot of hints ^_^ so I very much appreciate the attention to detail there. The main menu doesn't look like anything special, but the actual board is clean and clear. Nice job, and definitely worth the money for people who love sudoku. Enjoy!Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)
Decent game.  The controls are a bit challenging as it&apos;s based on tilting the phone to move and tapping on buttons on the bottom right to fire.  Not bad but not great.  To the people who rate it low b\/c it&apos;s not free yet wait a bit and grow up.  Don&apos;t rate low without trying it first.  I wouldn&apos;t pay more than .99 cents for it but it&apos;s worth a try since it&apos;s free.
It's very good. Good graphics, control, etc. That being said, I find myself getting bored of it quickly. Not much replay value from what I can tell.
It has decent graphics and the sound doesn't get on your nerve in a hurry. The controls are pretty responsive. I normally don't like games where the controls are handled by the accelerometer, but I think I liked this one because it auto-shoots so that is one less thumb being constantly on the screen. Which probably isn't necessary on a tab but it sure is nice on my cell phone which already has limited enough real estate.Worked great on my EVO 3D without any problems.
I love when they use the pixels to make a the pictures!\nNo, seriously, great game, visually refreshing, but controlling on a phone just doesn&apos;t seem as tight as I&apos;d like for a rail shooter. Great for R-Type fans. Yay free-ness!\nWait... am I First? Wow... never been, guess I should say something...
Good graphics, music, sound, controls (hold your phone while level is loading the way you want to hold it while playing - it recalibrates each time). Bluetooth permissions are for Zeemote options, which app summary doesn&apos;t mention. Good overall, and even better for free!
Thank you to who ever decided to make this free app of the day this game is what I call fun n a sweet lil time killer the only thing like some have said already is that the controls suck im kinda getting use to useing my phone to control my ship but still a bit n the game is also a bit hard even on easy thank you again
I love this kind of game and this one is well done. Just a little hard on easy. Very fun game.
I love the concept of this game, it is very fun to play.  It reminds me of some classic arcade games (can't think of their names off the top of my head) and has some cool modern elements to it.  It is challenging, and not just because the controls are tough.  It takes a little while to figure out what is going on in the game, but the learning curve isn't too steep.  They give you three control options.  First is tiling the screen to use the accelerometer to control the ship.  This is extremely difficult, though novel, and might be a good way to do it if you're used to it.  The second way is by using the touchscreen, which is a little finicky, and can be challenging when your fingers are in the way of your view, but they worked the best for me.  The third is to use some sort of controller (Wii-mote maybe?) which would probably be ideal, but I haven't gotten around to trying that yet.  I knocked a point off for the controls, otherwise would be perfect to me.  Plays well on my Motorola Atrix.
I had no problems, was fun to play on my G2not shur why other people are having problems with the controls
Reviewed on HTC Thunderbolt & Asus TransformerNice game decent graphics in the 2d side shooter genre, think old school Defender with a few differences.On the Thunderbolt, I found the controls to be resposive and the gameplay smooth and challenging. Decent graphics, several game modes, and challenging gameplay make for a fun game.I noticed in the description it said it was redesigned to support tablets, so I expected HD graphics or improved controls or something, I did not see any optimization on my Transformer running Honeycomb 3.2, the 3.2 software sizes the game to fill the screen resulting in less resolution and stretched graphics for apps that aren't optimized for tablets. This appeared to be the case with this game.So the look wasn't optimized, next to check controls.Upon attempting to play the game using the acceleometer, I found that it was wanting me to control it as though it were in portrait mode but was in landscape, thereby making it unplayable using that method. Next I used screen control method with better results but found the controls using this method difficult although playable on a 10.1 inch screen. So, unless I'm missing another tablet version of this game, it definitely isn't optimized and is barely playable at least on Asus Transformers. As it is only "redesigned to support" tablets and only optimized for the Galaxy  Tab (really, why only that one?), I guess I couldn't expect too much, but most games are playable with 3.2, I don't know how the controls could get messed up so much, but I digress.So bottom line, this was great on my Thunderbolt, ran perfectly, but for a supposedly "tablet supported" game it failed badly on my Transformer, so if that's all you have to use apps on, I'd skip this for now.Anyhow, as long as you aren't buying this for your Transformer it's a good game, at $2 it's higher than most, and I'm not sure I'd pay more than a buck, but it is a good game overall and if you like Defender type games you'll like this.Feel free to comment but know that Amazon will not allow me to reply. Long story, but basically, if I were you I wouldn't reply to any of the troll reviews or correct others misconceptions, Amazon will ban you for criticising others reviews. Its a lifetime ban so there you go.
This is a pretty fun game to play, especially if you like word games!!  This is also a great game to help kids learn to spell!
Enjoyable word game but would prefer the capability to move to the SD card.  Hence, my decision to give 4 stars.  It would also be nice to be able to have a high score screen, a la Bejeweled2, rather than just single personal best.
This app is not for me and it did not gave me any fun at all, in fact it was boring for me, but it is not buggy it is lightweight and it is small, if word games are your thing then you may like this app
Although the dictionary has some limitations and doesn't recognize some technical or esoteric words, this game is very enjoyable. Bear in mind that the dictionary is self contained and isn't eating your data allotment, which is a good thing IMHO. Definitely on my 'keep installed' short list.
Judging by the reviews I couldn't tell whether this game sucked of not. After playing a round with no problems it seems like a fun game. 4 stars for now.
Nice game.  Can make words using "any" of the letters, in any order--not only diagonally, straight across, or up/down.  Timed mode is the most challenging.
Fun for downtime, easy enough for midde school kids to play. It was just what I was looking for, not so easy that I get bored but not so hard my kids can't play.
People love making variations on word games. Here is yet another one where you try to make words out of a bunch of letters. If you like word games this one isn't too bad.
This little word game has enough options and variety to make it a very nice challenge.  It is very simple to learn and you can easily end up spending hours challenging yourself to flex your vocabulary "muscles".The app takes up less than 1 MB of space on my Kindle Fire (which doesn't have or need a SD card) so I didn't lower my rating becasue of the size of the game.I would give it 5 stars except for the lack of a multiple player mode.  I think it would be even more fun if you could have the added challenge of an opponent.  Maybe they will add that option to the game, but in the meantime it is worth a try if you are at all fond of word-related games.  A very good FAOTD choice.
I see that this game has an average of "Four Stars" for it's reviews...and I agree with that.It's a solidly built word game with several modes that is fun to play in short spurts.  I don't think I would really enjoy it for a marathon gaming session, but in a few minutes waiting at the dentist, it's good fun.Overall, there's not really much negative to say about the app.
I thought it would be something similar to scramble with friends...its like the same thing.....((:  its a cool game,and reading the other reviews,I thought it was like scrabble or something like that..give it a try;it's free for the day!!:D.  -02/15/12 (Wednesday)
works well on HTC TB. I haven't played word games, or crossword puzzles in a long time. this has settings that are good for a beginner or child, or faster pace, for pros. I will use this as I realize how out of practice I am in word games. One is like a circle word game.
Haven't played it much yet but it seems like a fun word game. So far no buggy issues or force closes. If you like word games then today you just got a fun free game!
It is somewhat like &#34;Words Plus&#34;.  I do like the three different ways this game can be played.  It's not easy to &#34;clear the board&#34;!
I absolutely love this game. the modes are fun as anything. I know I'm about to be nitpicking, but its not really filled with much content. imagine if u could play it with people around the world, or see high scores, all that stuff. still, u should defiantly get if u are a. spelling or vocabulary freak! like me!
this app is very fun but it is not worth the price if u bought it when it wasn't for the app of the day.  it has 3 fun games of words.  but I highly don't reccomend it if u r getting it when it is not free.
I don't understand why all the negative reviews. This is a very good home replacement app. I've used every alternative out there and while this is definitely not the best it's nowhere near the worst. Just because it's different and you don't know how to use it doesn't mean it's a bad app.  There's no way I'd pay anything for this app, not with GO being free and a much better option, but for free dxTop certainly deserves a download. My advice, ignore the bad reviews and try it yourself. It's free for f's sake!And to the reviewer below me, no, this app did not break your phone. If you believe that is even possible you need to immediately post your EVO on craigslist and go buy an iPhone.
I like this app on my Galaxy Tab. I have played around with it and found that I like the customizations. I can get to my widgets and every other app easily. I may download and try one of the themes but they are $1.99 each  andi have not found the&quot;perfect&quot; one yet.I worried that I would lose my application folders but they are all there and working..  I gave this app 4 stars because it delivers what it says it does.
This is an excellent application that delivers what it promises...as long as dedicated amateurs have one their terrestrial radios tuned to provide the data sources that make this worthwhile.While some people might consider listening to emergency services radios voyeuristic or creepy: as somebody who spends far more time each day in a car trying to get to and from work than I'd like, this app offers --at least where I live-- true value added.My daily commute is sandwiched between two major metropolitan areas, in an area that gets overlooked during drive-time traffic reporting. The police/fire feed for the county where 90% of my daily commuting takes place provides me valuable warning on road problems that traffic reporters would be telling me about far too late...if at all.Easy to use; search by name, genre or location, or search for any audio within a radius near you. No stability issues running on an anHTC Evo 4gVery few differences between this and thepaidversion. Paid version drops ads, and adds a pause/play button that is persistent between sessions (and you can run the free and paid version at the same time to follow two programming sources).
the volume for my cricket zte was very low, but that is the only problem i have found so far
its really cool. the only probalem is that when you have an alarm set on it once it goes off you can't get it to stop without turning off you device.  Also works good with kindly fire.
This app is great . L Ike to listen in on area's other than my own . Like watch the show cops only to tv . The list of places you can listen and tune into is quite large . Try it you might like it
This APP is really neat.  I was surprised to get local fire and police reception here in Medford, Oregon.  It can even be improved with very little cost.
I tried one other scanner product before chosing this one, which offered coverage of services in Central NH, my region of interest.  Reception is GOOD on Kindle Fire!
free app that allows you to access local (and other) scanner radio stations.  very easy to use and to locate your local scanner stations.
This works like it is suppose to. I have gotten to listen to some towns I am not able to get on my regular scanner so I am very pleased with this
wow it's so fun to listen to the police and rescue peeps it's almost like your being there. kinda scary when you hear something that is so close to your neighborhood.
It offers many radio stations and is very easy to use.  Only complaint is that most of my local stations don't appear, which I am sure is not the developers fault, but what is there is nice.  Can't really expect much more for a free app but it is a nice item.
I have been using one version or another of this app for years.  i love being able to hear sirens etc and know what is going on.  but the app is only as good as the depertments that are on it.  More urban areas if you search have more going on and better decriptions, more rural, obviously not as much going on, but sometimes the radios sound worse etc.  but great thing to have if u like to know whats going on.
It's fun, but not always busy. You can listen to big city scanners they are more entertaining. If you like scanners I think you will enjoy this app.
like this. now I don't have to be in dark of what is happening in neighborhood or around where I live.
It's definitely a great time passer. Interesting to hear what you hear, for sure. You never know what's going on everywhere, but most of all there are several hundred locations to listen to. A great scanner for the interested mind.
It works very well.  The clarity is quite good.  I like the Idea that you can listen to police, fire, marine and air.  \If you into monitoring agencies this unit is just right for you.
not bad. it is not the Dev  decision what departments broadcast, so don't rate low if your area is lame.
A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
This is a fun app. There are many stations. However, there could be a lot more. You may not be able to get all local stations, but you should be able to get near your area.
I've never had a police scanner before. This is really cool to listen to. I love listening to my local scanner but it is also so cool that you can listen everywhere else as well.
Its always fun and interesting to listen to police calls. I like this app and you get lots of stations too.
I got. my kindle fire for. Christmas. this. year. this was one of the first. apps. I downloaded and omg love it!!!!!!!!!  thanks amazon!!!!!
Not bad if you live in a big city . I have to listen to county not city. No like the old scanners they use to have.
But I honestly rarely use it.  Just another one of those that sounds neat... and it is, but I just rarely sit down and listen to it.  If you have the time, then get it.  But be realistic.  Do you think you'll actually listen to it past the first day?
This is a good app. I can listen to the Police stations in my home town of NY from Texas
This app DOES work; at least it did for me. The problem was where I live, there was so little radio traffic, it was excruciatingly boring. But you may have better luck if you live in a metro area.
Enjoy the app
The only reason I am not giving this app 5 stars is due more to my phone than to the software itself. My 3.7 inch screen is not the best way to read a book. I very much prefer my real Kindle for that, but but this app works in a pinch.
Such great books on here to read, and I don't even read that much, that is until I got this app.
It is easy to use and access to most any book you want. I have used this app for awhile and found it a great resource.
I have this on two android tablets and it works great to read books downloaded. I once owned a Kindle but this is far better.
I love the ease of being able to download a book from my cloud and pick up where I left off.  It is great for the times I wasn't expecting some down time.  I wish it loaded faster but maybe that is my phone and not the app.
I use this on my Android phone for reading stories to my 8 year old daughter.  The one star removed is for taking forever to first load after not using it for a while.  The app is wonderful for reading.  It makes it a pleasure to read with just flicks of the finger.
Originally got this for my knock-off IPad (called YourPad) and it worked fine for a while, then got glitchy and wouldn't open the book.  Tried removing & reinstalling, however that didn't work.  Got out the CHEAPER knock-off (iBridge), installed Kindle for Android and it has worked PERFECTLY ever since (knock on wood).  I love that I can take my current reading material ANYWHERE and read while I'm waiting at the Drs office or whereever.  Not my favorite app, but probably the most used one.
To access your kindle books on an android tablet, this is the best way to do it. It's a little more cumbersome to get your books off the cloud, but once downloaded to your android (Galaxy tablet in my case), this works out just fine. On the Asus and Dell Windows 8.1 tablets (which are actually PCs), it's even more difficult to access the cloud for previously purchased books. I won't take any stars away for that, but only because there may be an easier way and I'm new to Win8 tablets. (Aren't we all?) Considering how many android apps there are, however, I am at a point where I can say that Android is far easier to deal with vis a vis Kindle and apps in general.
I don't read much but I am planning to change that. It works for now. I only downloaded one book to see how it works and the kindle for andriod that I downloaded.
great!!!!!!!!!!!this is all I have to say. I am trying to get back to what I am working on .
New for me.. but I love to read and its much easier to carry my kindle fire with me and not worry about the pages getting dog eared
I have enjoyed being able to get my Kindle on my phone. Play games and read books whereever I go.
whoo, love the kindle app.  had it installed in my old cheap tablet so i could read my kindle books, also have it on my computer too.  Its really a great app as it allows you to read your kindle books on multiple devices.
When I first got my Galaxy Note 2 and downloaded this app I just went crazy, reading and reading, dozens of books, quickly. However, of late, I have drifted back to the library.I just like the feel of a real book.Otherwise, highly recommended.
Kindle is everywhere. My mom was an early Kindle adopter and this app has worked great for me on several different smart phones and tablets I have aquired and the content is available for any of them. I use other reader apps of course, but this is the primo one.Enjoy.Jb
This is a great one if caught in place where you find yourself waiting. A little small to read but otherwise great app.
After my wife got a 3G Kindle, I though it might be nice to have a Kindle too, but when I realized I could get an Android tablet that was more portable and more like a PDA than the Kindle, I switched up.  I think I installed the Kindle reader first.  It's a nice implementation and I can't think of anything off hand that I would do to improve the user interface EXCEPT you should be able to see the time while reading.  Doh.  I don't want to have to exit the reader to see what time it is.  Ok, so the Archos 43 has a large screen, and I can see that one might not want to use up the screen real estate that way on a smaller screen - but make it an option then.  Please.  Pretty please.---2012/11/29 Update:  The app can open PDFs, so it is not necessary to have another PDF reader taking up space on your device.  I love that.  I hate that Amazon apps are HUGE and get more HUGE with every update.  This should be App2SD.  I'm going to downgrade my 5 rating to 4 on this point alone.  I love the reader, but the size of the app is making me have to uninstall other stuff to keep it on.  At some point, the Amazon app is going to have to go so I can keep the other stuff on the tablet.  Get a clue Amazon.  You are in the app store business.  When your apps take up all the room on the device, people can't buy other apps anymore!
What can I say that others haven't? This app works well. I like how it gauges and displays the time left in each chapter. I also like how that time is continuously updated (like when I stop reading for a bit and then resume). I suppose I mostly appreciate the percentage of the book already read. Really gives me a true location to where I currently am in the book.. this feature also estimates the time to the end when I open a book that I have already read, basing its estimate on how long it took me the last time to read cover to cover. Not necessarily needed info but nice to know what I average from book to book. This app will stay on my RAZR Maxx until I buy a Kindle Fire later this fall.
Good application with a quick download and frequent updates.  I tend to use this app more than Google read due to the selection of downloadable material.
I use both this and Nook for reading ebooks and both work fine. The Kindle is especially attractive and a must have for book readers. Note: owning an Amazon tablet not required as this, like the nook reader app, works on most tablets.
Not too bad of an app. It's one of the most well-known e-readers for a reason: it's simple to pick up and use - even for those with very little experience with smartphones. The library is simple to browse and find what you're looking for, which seems to be a complaint for a lot of e-readers. It also keeps track of your progress automatically, so if you're the type to read multiple novels at once, then this app is sure to please!Would prefer if there was an easy way to upload / link books from anywhere, but it looks as though you can ONLY read books from the amazon kindle store unless you manually put them on the phone / SD card through a USB cable. Other than that limitation, it works like it's supposed to and doesn't drain the battery too much. Watch out when buying, though! While there are a ton of cheap / free books, and Amazon isn't shy about showing you the more expensive stuff. One-tap ordering means you can easily purchase something you didn't want if you don't pay attention.Overall, it's not spectacular, but it works like it should and is an app that no one should pass up.
Does what it's supposed to. Using my tablet provides a larger context for reading. When I'm finished reading, I have the functionality of the tablet.
After the recent update, this has become the fattest app on my phone: 15mb WITH it stored on my card.Not very happy that I had to remove a lot of apps just to keep this one.  I almost wish that I could use the cloud reader on my mobile web so I could remove this app.++edit++Flashed CM7 (Android 2.3 based) and it's back to normal. Weird how that works..
What is there to say.  This is Kindle, one of the top e-reading devices on the planet.  I got one on my first computer and I've never looked back.If you like to read you need this.  Computer, tablet or any device it is available for!
Lets have my books at times when I don't want to bring my Kindle with me.  It's just important to remember to sync each devicel
I like Kindle.  It is a great concept.  I wish amazon wasn't quite so stingy with sharing books and what not, but it is a good step in the right direction.
i l[ke the books and the price is fair. I think the E books are very reasonable and shipping is fair price.
I have this on my Arnova tablet and it works well.  Very easy to use and understand.  Amazon is one of my fav sites and has made my life so much easier.  My only complaint is that on my tablet I cannot read the first or second sentence on the top of each page b/c there is a status bar there.. At one point last week it went away and i had the book on my entire screen but i have no idea how i got it that way and it hasn't happened since then.  If anyone knows how to fix this i would greatly appreciate the help!
The app works great and I use it all the time.I still have books that I did not buy that keeps being displayed on it and I cannot delete it. It also shows up on my Kindle for PC too but not on my Amazon online account. I have contacted Amazon many of times about this but they cannot help me.
Excellent reader, must have for any platform
i like the concept, and the game is as basic as you can get.  i would like to see different boards or popcorn arrangements (maybe make a random piece worth more?  like gold colored, or &quot;buttered&quot;, so if you dont burn it, it is worth extra points) .  other than that, app works fine, no glitches that ive found so far.
I love it.  Good clean fun that kept my kids entertained on a camping trip  zThey though your popping shoulf get a score...  charcoal being the worst insult, while utter perfection on the high end.
This games has been around for a long, long time.  But playing this on your Kindle is better!  You don't lose the &#34;pieces&#34;...you don't have to carry around the &#34;board&#34;, and you get good instructions, and a nice pace to enjoy as well! Bravo to Xoise Solutions, Inc.!
I enjoy this game, but it's too smal on my tablet.  I still play it because it's a fun game.. and the tablet is small for any purpose and/or location.  If it was bigger on the screen, I'd give it a 5 star.
I love the game Mancala but can't find good apps for the game.  This one would be great if there were template options and it would stop freezing.  I play as a single player and if the game wants the computer to go first it freezes.  I have to close the game out and restart it several times so that the player goes first, when the player goes first the game doesn't freeze.03/05/13A recent app update by developer has RESOLVED the freezing issue, so I have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.
This is a great app if you like to stream internet radio. It has worked well. Many ways to search for what you want to listen for. Sound quality is good and clear.
I was told about this app by my daughter who found her favorite Christian radio station right away. While mine wasnt available, I could listen to hers and while my favorite classical station was not available either, a short seach by Classical genre gave me several good choices as well as one with NO commercials (at least not so far). This is really a good app for my Kindle as I really enjoy listening to clasical music while reading and even while playing games.
I like the interface.  It makes getting to shoutcast stations much easier. I'm glad I got it as a FAOTD, I don't know if I'd have paid for it since I have Pandora and Slacker.
For what it's worth, this is a pretty awesome radio app. There are over 50,000 radio stations of multiple genres to surf through, and I think that number will only grow. I actually hope it does, for likeTuneIn Radio Prothere are a lot of local stations that I do not have access to, so for the momentiHeartRadiois the only one that I can listen to all local, and even some elsewhere that is ineligible for me onXiiaLive Proor TuneIn.The interface is a breeze to get through and to get used to. You can search songs, you can favorite songs; you can even tag songs, which is something that I haven't seen before. Overall, the app alone is pretty good. I just hope it gets improved by making more stations readily available.
It's very similar to Pandora. Got it as the free app of the day. These people going insane over permissions is just stupid.  No one is making you install the app, you whiney f'in nerds. Just don't use it. Simple as that. Pathetic.
Have had no problems with this app.  Nice interface took a bit of getting used to but good, and quick to tune the stations.  Works well on 4g.
Another good reason for the FAOTD. I had idea this app was around. Will be a great way to reconnect with shout cast. Well designed with many options.
Had it for a few weeks now......No problems....... good variety of stations..... I listen to Christmas year round..... plus old time radio horror and mystery shows.  Easy to use search function...... Keeps a list of my favorites.
I'd heard of this program from several friends who swear by it (and a few who swear at it :D ), so I figured I'd pick it up. Haven't yet used it.
Let's you listen to all kinds of internet radio right on your Kindle without having to enable web to go to the stations.  NICE!
This is a solid Internet radio app. As many before me have said, this has a very similar feature set to much of the other radio apps already on the market.That said, some of the fine details impress me here. On this,or any other music app, I rarely see any comments regarding bit rate&hellip; Which makes me wonder if I am the only person with a mobile data-cap??? This app has a wonderful feature where when you search or browse stations you can filter by a certain bit rate of your choosing. For those of us with a data limit, this is amazingly useful. While I really like listening to Internet radio, I have no intention of using all of my mobile data in a short few days.Other nice features I didn't find elsewhere include a history of songs listened and the ability to tag a song for later viewing. This is wonderfully useful if you want to download the song from Amazonmp3 later on (when you get to a PC or within wifi?).Unfortunately, I do not see any local radio stations herein, nor any specific feature to pull up your local radio stations based on location, etc.. This is one feature I really like about TuneIn radio.All in all, a good app. Hopefully they continue to improve it, listening to feedback from users, and in the end make it a great music app.
I haven't tried everything on it yet, but I have certainly liked what I've seen so far.  The in app sounds are not annoying, yet adequetly announce what is happening.
This is another solid internet radio app with a gorgeous interface. My favorite radio apps are iHeart and Tunein for local radio. Xiialive has a wider variety of radio stations not found on either iHeart or Tunein. I searched for some of my favorite local stations I use in the other 2 apps and they are not available in xiialive.So instead of using xiialive to replace the other 2 which is what I had hoped it looks like it will compliment the other two apps.UPDATE: This is the FASTEST radio internet app I have used. I don't know how the devs did it but unlike the other internet radio apps you usually have to deal with the connection first then the buffering of the audio. With xiialive I have NOT encountered any buffering or connection issues. Playback is nearly instantaneous. I tried it from a range of radio stations from around the world including different genres and as soon as I selected the station the audio appeared.
I am very impressed with the interface of this app.  Makes finding new music an easy experience.  It is a bit higher priced than TuneIn Radio, but I think it is well worth it.  I'm still exploring around with it, so I may update with some criticism later.  For now, it is my go-to music app.
I'm a huge music and radio streamer. I have 4 apps I already use for varying proposes being Pandora, Grooveshark, TuneIn and 8 Tracks. This app is particularly well built and functions rather well. It's got a great UI and it's easy to understand. There's plenty of stations to listen to. Found local and international stations I'm already a fan of. All that said this app simply doesn't bring anything to the table that I don't already have the ability to do and doesn't pack enough to replace any of the apps I have. I'd recommend any of the 4 aforementioned apps before recommending this one but this is one solid app in it's own right. 4 stars!
I miss playing backgammon and this is a nice way to be able to play when I can't find a partner.  I enjoy playing and winning, so I just use the easier levels.  Occasionally the CPU will get some strange runs of doubles but looking at the stats shows that it is not that bad.  For people really wanting a challenge, I would suggest using a high difficultly level.  It makes some pretty stupid moves, like moving pieces in the home area to a better take off position while there are still pieces outside of the home area.  But maybe the harder difficultly level corrects that.
Bought this to learn how to play as it has been years since my last real game. Fit the bill as a refresher just fine and turned out to be rather enjoyable to just play too.
Just like a backgammon board. I like any game that simulates the real thing, without having pieces to lose. Fun game.
I have  always loved this game but I wish the computer did not cheat so much. Its not much fun playing a game you're 99%  sure you will loose anyway. I will keep playing because I love the game.
game loads quickly and is fun to play.  different levels alllow User to determine length and difficulty of the game
Great game.  I especially like the fact that I can go back several steps to see what moves would work better.  It is making me a better player.I would like to see a &#34;Finish&#34; button, which would automatically finish the game when I choose it.
I love backgammon.  The only problem I have is that I believe the game may be cheating me.  The game usually wins.
Fun, uncomplicated. Used to play backgammon a lot and forgot how entertaining it is. Anyone can play, but it helps to understand game strategy. No issues with app on my Xoom or HTC phone.
I remember my Grandfather teaching me acey ducey as a kid. I love sitting and playing backgammon.  I Sam teaching my daughter this game too. Runs great. No problems
Good features: multiple diff levels, take back, both one player and two player games. At it's highest level it is not as good as fibzilla for pc. It seems weak with the cube. Very good, just shy of perfect. Recommended.
I used to play the board game with my mother and other family members.  It's lots of fun.  Hope you'll enjoy it too!
It has many different levels for beginners or more advanced players. The graphics are smooth and there has been no freezing up of  any kind that seems to happen with so many games like this. Only annoyance is the pop up ads to get other games by this company.
I haven't played backgammon for years so I may be a little rusty. This game is pretty good overall but I was hoping for more. Good graphics and good movement. The rules could be a little more detailed and clearer though.
If you are a champion player this is probably not the app for you but if you like a good game of backgammon without any bad glitches this is it.
Easy to load and easy to play. At times I question the neutrality of the dice throws. It seems to give itself a disproportionate number of doubles.  Also,  it seems to dawdle at the end spending more time, and rolls, lining up it's pips in it's home area instead of bearing them off. Still an enjoyable way to spend a few minutes at a time playing a game.
[From my mother] This game is easy to download, play and gives you a good little challenge. Thank you for creating it, it's a fun game.
I USED TO PLAY THIS BOARD GAME WITH MY BROTHERS ALL THE TIME GROWING UP. IT WAS MY FAVORITE, NEXT TO SCRABBLE. IT'S AWESOME THAT NOW I CAN PLAY IT ON KINDLE, AND NOT HAVE ALL THE PIECES TO DEAL WITH..
it is fun to play and I am going to try to teach my 7 year old grandson how to play. I think if he can get the ides of the gane hewill like it too.
Only complaint - that it won't reverse when I turn my kindle. Other than that, love it and hate it - especially when the computer seems to get doubles more often than I think I do. However, it has stats at the end of every game showing how many points each the CPU and I had, how many doubles we rolled etc. Darn if I didn't have more doubles than it did most times.Fun entertainment.
Nice and fun app. was easy to use on the kindle fire. i had no issues or problems. i would recommend it
The only negative thing about this game is it doesn't start from the beginning.  The game is already in progress when you log on.
I like it, have at this point only played it a few times, but am still learning how it works, I know how to play the game, I just have never used some of the things that it offers. So hey for free I am definitely not complaining, if you like backgammon and you like free give it a try, it is worth it.
I play many apps by this provider.  Ai Factory Limited produces quality apps for android devices. I use the Kindle fire and I have no problems with any of their apps.  They. run smoothly and seemlessly on my device.
It is important to note that this app is free.  It works well on the Kindle and is definitely worth downloading if you're interested in backgammon even slightly to improve your technique or learn the game itself on a BASIC level.  Although there are 5 levels of AI skill, I found that the moves the AI performed questionable at level 5.  I would rate the maximum level of the AI skill far below any officially world recognized player.  The skill level of the AI is mediocre at best.  In response to some of the other reviewers comments regarding the frequency of doubles in this app there is 'some' validity to their statements.  However I found that the high double roll rates were divided equally between myself and the AI.  I found that the rate of doubles (normally 1 in 6 chances) was only slightly higher at 1 in 5.  With such a small margin between the two ratios I must therefore admit that the RNG (random number generator) is indeed random.If you an advanced player, or world ranked player - don't bother with this app, it will only frustrate you, as if you were playing a novice.  Although that at times can provide it's own challenges due to the unpredictability of their logic or lack of.Bottom line, worth the price of FREE.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.
This game is loads of fun. If you like the real game you. should enjoy this. People who say it cheats are total morons. It doesn't.
I enjoyed playing this game. It challenges my mind especially against the computer. You should get this game especially if you are ann avid backgammon player.:-)
I have really enjoyed this game, but some games really seem to have a lot of doubles, and of course they are not mine.
A great game added to my tablet. Hours of fun to enjoy and it helps that it was free to download
How could I go wrong when it was free and keeps me busy for a few matches with the computer. I win to much and the dice are predicable.
yes I would get this free game if you like backgammon. good features and view.  2 works finelots of fun
Fun and frustrating...great game that allows different levels of play. Recommend for the novice and the well versed. My only complaint is the doubling cube can only be played before rolling
Not having played backgammon for many years, I began on the easiest setting. Three fast games in, I was hooked, and have found that the levels become decidedly more challenging. An intuitive and engaging experience.
I enjoy this game a lot. It has been somewhat challenging and I'm still experiencing some more challenging matches which I am looking forward to. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who is a beginner and for those who have more experience playing.
I have seen other reviews about poor gameplay and too many doubles for the computer.  I find this to be the opposite.  The computer does as well as can be expected.  I have no feeling that die rolls are better for the computer either.  The only stupid move the cmoputer makes is accepting a double when they very littel chance of winning.  This does make winning a match easier.  Just don't offer doubles in stupid situations and you can control that result.
Works the way it should and plays just fine. Graphics are basic but who actually cares? (it's just backgammon!) .
fun game- you do have to know backgammon in order to play- it may take a couple of tries before it comes back to you---no cheating with the machine
I know they say that the game can't be fixed, but when the computer consistently rolls multiple doubles, it does give one pause. The game can be a lot of fun, if you have a high tolerance for frustration.
Another good app for kids and or beginners. I loved it and play it often. I was surprised considering it was free.
Like any other Backgammon app, this one increases the difficulty by tweaking the rolls to favor the computer. But it has some nice features for beginners.  You can take your move back even if the computer has already moved. It shows you which pieces are available to move, and where they can move, if you want it to. You can choose single games or matches with or without doubling.You can play against other people if you want to. For advanced players, this would be a convenient way to do that, but advanced players will not be challenged by the solo play. I'm advanced-beginner level and win most games at the highest level.
I am a former tournament level backgammon player and enjoy this fast paced version of the game.  I keep track of my statistics and do see that the opponent gets more doubles which can be frustrating but since I consistently win more games and matches playing at the 5th level, I have to say that the game is created to let skill trump luck.  It would be a good game for novices to learn the game as well.  It's five levels give people a chance to compete at any level.
Used to play on a real board when i was young, had forgotten all about it, till I got the app. I'm a little rusty, but I am improving.
Been using the free version for years now and was very excited to see the paid version as the FAOTD. I'd recommend the game to any fan of backgammon without reservation. However, I was very disappointed to discover after installing it that my stats from 1000+ games played in the free version weren't imported into the paid version, starting me out at ground zero. I know it seems trivial, but in an app where stats are collected it seems almost a given that the stats should carry over when you like an app enough to pay to move from the free version. I've got enough time invested in the free version that in many ways it seems more attractive to put up with the occasional ad and keep my stats than to start over again ad-free. Gotta knock off a star for this oversight.In all other respects, this is a five-star app. If you're not coming from the free version (or don't mind losing your stats if you are), consider this a five-star review and invest (if you missed getting it as the FAOTD) without reservation.
Would have gotten a full five stars but sometimes, the game decides you have to make a particular play even when another play is available. I'm not talking about &#34;bearing off&#34; there's an order to that, but when I have three five point moves and the game only allows one of them... well, it doesn't happen often but enough to cost you a star.
Step up just like a game but except I do not know what I am doing ,if I knew how to play backgammon or remember how I am sure I would like it more
I know I will like this game once I get used to it.  I have only tried it a couple times without too much success as it has been many years since I played the board game.
This is exactly what you expect. A nice simple backgammon game. I enjoy it. The computer seems to roll way to many doubles but it is still fun to play
Fun game to play when you have no one to play against.  The opponent is predictable after a few games though.
I would love it but it's not yet there. Maybe with a few updates that make it look and run a little smoother.
This is a typical backgammon game.  I got it because I like to play backgammon.  I tried playing it on my phone, but I guess my fingers are too fat, I had a hard time touching the pieces to move them.  After a game I gave up on this.  It is really not a limitation of the game, more than likely it's my phone. I think on a tablet it would work much better.
I like putting my mind to work, I love a challenge even thou the way I learned to play Backgammon is a little different I still like it . I have always liked Backgammon years ago. I had not seen the game for a long, and O'BOY when I saw the free Amazon app of the day was Backgammon I got so excited!! I still like Backgammon. Thanks You  Amazon!
Nice game so far.  Plays through quickly because it shows you your possible moves.  I hope to find a setting to turn that function off.  If you are just learning to play it's a great feature.  But if you already know how, it seems to take away some of the challange.
I am not very good at this game & get frustrated sometimes but I do enjoy it & hope to improve my game.
I enjoy playing the game again since I don't get to play locally. It works well and can be adjusted to your skill level.
I played the FORTRAN version on an IBM mainframe, 351 points, this is fairly close to it.  This genuinely a game in which you use your head, and a hand drawn map.One thing that needs to be added is auto-save due to how freely Android tosses a program out.
