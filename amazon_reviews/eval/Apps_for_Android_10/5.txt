I really don't think I could live without Rhapsody. I have it on my phone, my computer and my Kindle Fire. I use it everyday, no matter what device it is on, it works great. It is a wonderful way to take your favorite music and playlists with you wherever you go, whatever you do. Be aware that you do have to have a subscription and I'm pretty sure the price can range from $10 and up per month.
If you pay for the subscription then by all meens get this App. It works well and  I love the service. I have a family of 4 and we all use it under one price.
this app I do not use. and not sure how to get rid of it so I am stuck with it
Rhapsody is great if you like "All you can Eat" music..  There are a lot of music programs and services out there now but I always come back to Rhapsody for a couple reasons.1.) I love their desktop app!!2.) I love being able to use the service with a REAL mp3 player, not just an android phone or ipod touch/iphone.  With the desktop app, the service works with Sandisk MP3 Players (Most are supported but check rhapsody before you purchase one)Now for this app.  The app on android and Kindle is great.  It gives you access, not just to their radio feature, but also to their "all you can eat" music service.  You can download the tracks to your phone for free (As long as you keep paying the monthly fee, these songs stay active".  Their "radio" feature is great if you like services like Pandora.  The Rhapsody radio doesn't have the ads like Pandora and other free radio services.  The radio feature is also very smart just like Pandora (Though I would say it is not as smart as Pandora).Overall this is a great app if you like music and like being able to choose what songs you want to listen to or if you wanna listen to an entire album!!  And the app doesn't bog the phone down with adds or video adds like Pandora!Try it for a month!! Most new phones and kindles will give you a free trial! If not you can use this link for one.. I was one over with the free trial I received when I downloaded this app to my Kindle[...]
Love that I can type any song in and it comes up quick. Better than Pandora.
This app was a free trial for a certain amount of time. I used it daily when I downloaded it.  I enjoyed being able to listen to any song I was in the mood for.
Rhapsody it great to have on your tablet or computer. Great music with famous artists and songs for free and you also can upgrade to avoid ads,but for me  its ok with the ads for free.
I've been using Rhapsody since the former Yahoo Music days.  The app for Kindle works great, just like the apps for the other Android devices.
can download all the songs i like and it is easy as pie!! my son got me interested and am so glad he did. Will continue to use this app!!
Every morning I wake up to an inspirational bible verse. It helps me clear my mind before a long day. I can save the verses also if I want to refer back to them in troubling times. It even works without an internet connection somehow. I was on a cruise with no internet or mobile data and i STILL received my verses. Such a blessing!
Clean, simple, easy to use. Daily verse, choice of Bible version, devotionals and pod casts. Would recommend to anyone! A real blessing!
I first downloaded it on my cell phone. Enjoyed it so much I've recently downloaded it on my Kindle. I enjoy the daily verse as well as the other features it offers.
I enjoy my Daily Bible as I enjoy reading a verse when I firstopen my cell phone in the morning.  I find it very inspirational.
This app is great!  It has a daily verse, a daily reading plan and then a whole list of daily devotionals, both audio and written.  I usually check out the Our Daily Bread audio podcast from here instead of going to odb.org and read My Utmost for His Highest (no longer available! :-( But still appears in list for some reason).  There is also a place to seach the bible by verse or keyword.  Many of the popular versions are available including NIV, NKJV and NASB.  Is exactly what is says... a Daily Bible!  Thanks for this app!
I am able to share and send devotions to my friends of many different speakers. Also you can find many different types of devotions with different versions of the Bible. Love it.
What a refreshingly wonderful app. There is so much content out there that to have it all mailed to me would be overwhelming. Thanks to these wonderful people I have been able to expand my spiritual walk to measures unknown to me. My eyes have been opened to revelations and deep understanding that otherwise I had been ignorant to. By having and using this app my daily morning study gets me ready for the day and keeps my heart in tune with God.It is customizable to which content I decide to read and listen to. Because of the audio portion my spiritual walk has encountered a new path of what can only be described as an old friend. That is how he will make you feel after just a short listen. I am talking about Pastor McGee and his TTB Bible radio program. It is a five year journey through the entire Bible and no one has been able to explain it as he has.McGee has a unique view into the word of God and looking back he was indeed at the beginning movement of the Christian non denominational faith. He saw the way had been opened and how chains of hierarchy and rules of the old establishment were being abandoned.He is only one of many podcasts that are available, from daily to old sermons to modern convention speeches. Rick Warren has a spot there as well as Joyce Meyers and so many others.Daily reading plans and so many wonderful features.I have gained so much for so long that some time back I became a regular supporter  of their ministry for it is with these works that many are being baptized in the Holy Spirit.
ok I don't have this version of the Bible app. I have the you version but anyway I read the reviews and am totally shocked!! do some people really not know what the Bible is and think its fiction!!! I am totally blown away by this. God is very real and he is our savior he also gave us free will. so you are free to choose your path and what you believe. however he loves us all anyway and should you ever come to God he will welcome you with open arms. God bless
Great app for Christians. You will enjoy this app and enjoy the choices you have. One of my favorites! I love this app.
I am using this app as part of my morning devotionals.  Perfect combination of verse, daily Bible reading, and devotional.  I have others I do, but save this for the last one as I really enjoy it!
The Daily bible give me a verse to read and easy way to get to other chapters and verses.  It even let me read different bible version.
I really love this app!  It's a nice way to have a daily scripture to ponder over.  There is also the option for more in depth scripture study which I also love.  I truly look forward to checking this app daily and it has added another nice source to help grow in my faith daily.
It's god work. enjoy not only able to read it but listen to the word too. Very good excellent book
What a great blessing to have this to read each morning, each and everyday Gods Word right on my kindle, and different versions great work, t hank you thank you!!!
This app allows you to read the Bible, receive daily devtionals, and daily scriptures in the most commonly used Bible version (atleast by me) NLT, NKJV, and KJV. You also get to listen to podcast by today's leading ministries ex: Joyce Meyer, Joel Osteen, Charles Stanley and etc.
I love how it reminds me every morning to read my daily verse. I really love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This Bible is made for every type of Christian.
I love this app. I have no complaints, and I didnt have any complications with this app, very easy and simple to understand. I love reading the bible where ever I go.
GET THIS APP!  If you desire to gain more knowledge about the Bible and to be able to do it on a daily basis, I would highly recommend this app because it keeps you on track and you can both read and listen to it either at home or in your car.  This is an awesome app also because it has several great features that make it better than other similar apps.  Unfortunately, you can't get this app for the Apple system, but if you have a Kindle or Android you are set.  I highly recommend it!
I listen to this app all the time especially the devotions where you can listen to many great podcasts. It is very easy to use and recommend it highly
I love it.  What else can I say.  Getting God's word every day, even from a tablet is the best.
I so love this app.I have been looking for a book that will help me memorize Bible verses easily without having to look at a page full of words. I give this app 5 stars easily.
I was looking for an app to help me with my annual &#34;read through the Bible in a year&#34; and this app is perfect.  I really like the way it offers several different plans (since I like to do it a different way each year).  Plus with this app there are daily messages (in your choice of lots of translations!), and practically all of it can be read aloud to you.  This is an excellent Bible app.
This app allows you to read and listen to the word during your devotions on a daily basis. While moving around or in one place you can listen to your favorite pastor sharing messages.  Your can listen anywhere and really immerse yourself in the word so that you enhance your understanding of the bible.Don't take my word for it. Try it out yourselves.
I love this app. It has a lot of variety to it in the way of speakers or podcasts, scripture verses and everything.
this app works great. u can schedule it to give u one inspirational verse per day as well as choose what translation u want showing on the widget.
I like this app.  It sends a reading to you each day, it will read the verse to you if connected.  Tabs include: Daily Plan ( various longer Bible verses that can be read to you), Devotion tab (recordings of various speaker talks on different subjects), and a final Search tab (you can enter a book, chapter and verse and it will come up).  This is a very useful and  very friendly app.
first thing I would like to do is to thank amazon for putting the Bible and Christian readings on the amazon fire.ienjoy the daily Bible because of the daily readings. everyone should have it installed on their kindle fire .thanks Tommy adams
Downloaded to use when I go to church or Bible study. Easy to find scriptures and several version selections also
I love this app. It was one of the first I downloaded on my tablet. The many versions and ease of use are super. The best feature I love are the audio devotions.
Daily Bible verse.  I love this, it pops up every morning, its searchable, and you can save your favorite verses.
this is by far the best game on android, beats angry birds, plants &amp; zombies,any EA game, any Eloft game, cut the rope...got sarcasm?
I played the first bubble defense game from the other market, and and enjoyed it. I admit this pales in comparison to Jelly Defense, but this is a solid game.
I don't know how long I've been playing it for, but I got it as the Free App of the Day a while ago. I play it everyday, multiple times a day. Like others who have it a 1 star review I also like Jelly Defense and Plants vs Zombies; while the graphics may not be as good as those other games, I'm getting much more play time out of this. Jelly Defense took me a while to finish and was worth it (if I had paid for it, another Free App of Day), this one is taking me much much longer to finish.  I'd rather the graphics be lacking if the game can be played for many weeks, or more?I'm addicted to it. I just wish I knew a little more about how certain things work, I'm trying to figure these out. Like I recently learned upgrading the power stations is very important, not just buying more. Upgrade everything.Sometimes I notice a tower right next to a power station let all the things go by without shooting at any of them, I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong when that happens, but that's rare. Also I want to know what it means when a tower has that little power graphic flash or sometimes just stay solid. Does it mean it needs power? Like it wants to shoot but can't at the moment?So other than a wanting a few more instructions, I love the game. Even with the things I can't seem to figure out, it still gets 5 stars.I'm surprised by all the low ratings here and wonder if it's mostly people who dont like or know how to play defense games.I wish people would realize they should rate on the quality of the app, not on whether it's their type of app. The low ratings hurt the developer and cause them to sell less games.If you like defense games get it, if I was suddenly forced to pay for it now, I would definitely buy it, because after a few weeks of playing I have lots of play-time left. Actually, I think I'll end up moving on to a new game before ever finishing all these levels.
Its sad to see so many Android users turn into Elitist Apple Fanboys crying about how this app "isn't good enough" for their ultra high performing devices. This game runs and looks fine on my Samsung Galaxy S2 so yah, I disagree about how "bad" this app is. It may not be as good as other Android games, but it certainly doesn't deserve the 1-star ratings its getting.
I never read game  tutorials, but maybe should have with this one.  It took me a while to realize that the easiest way to build new towers is NOT to drag them, but click the tower you want to build and then click the place on the map you want to build it.  The game itself gives you strategy tips for the game in general during the 1st level.  The only other thing you need is your brain, and it's a decent tower defense game.  The only thing that could be improved is the graphics, and a forced tutorial level that makes you place certain towers and explains what they do.
This game works just fine! When you go to start a level there is a paragraph that says right at the end that you HAVE TO HAVE POWER STATIONS to power your towers! Otherwise, yes, they'll only shoot once. It was obvious after playing around for only 5 minutes exactly what tower did what, &amp; how well everything worked. For those of you who can't read or have no common sense: the first little icon shoots one bullet at a time at incoming enemies.  Next icon, (ship wheel looking thing,) shoots out in all directions. Fire icon melts ice balls that will eventually come, or shoots one bullet at regular ones. Blue spiral thing...can't remember. Hot air balloon follows enemies &amp; shoots at them. Finally, the red power icon sets up a power station.While this game may not be goty material, nor is it amazing graphics-wise (they aren't bad, just simple) it's still a good tower defense game. With other higher quality TD games on the market, this one definitely isn't worth $2.99. It isn't worth the ridiculous reviews from a bunch of morons who haven't given it more than 10 seconds worth of play time, either!
i like it but theres is no volume in it i like feeling the pop pop i was all like wtf wheres the volume
This game is fine, eve if the graphics aren't great. I started the game read the directions and played just like any other game. The tower don't just shoot once, they start slow and progress as you play.I hate that the dev is getting slammed with lies but the one star reviews are not true, read the directions and the game plays fine. Amazon has been completly run over with trolls and you people wonder why the apps are mostly low quality.the price is way too high, but the game is fine. Too bad this dev has already been destroyed.
I don't know why people don't like this game. It doesn't really come with an instruction manual, though. But its very entertaining, very fun. I love playing this. HOURS of entertainment. Love, Love, LOVE it! Ok, but I have to say one thing. Its not really worth three bucks. Well...yeah it IS! LOVE IT
This app has everything for someone who likes to play games and likes to have fun at it, likes to think about strategy a bit and likes to enjoy playing. It's easy to play but hard to win, at least on all but the easiest level, so you'll actually have to plan out a strategy to get the win on each level, and it does get progressively harder, even if the action seems repetitive. This game is one I'll keep on my Fire indefinitely and will come back to time and time again for a little respite from my daily troubles.
Playing this game only worsened my depression. Each tower reminds me that I suffer from pre-mature... One quick shot and then it's worthless.
I think it works fine and everyone is lying. Read the instructions before you play. Then it will be fun :)
To all those who are morons try reading the instructions. It is a simple but fun game. My whole family likes to play this game. My 8 year old really enjoys it.
Great App for finding your car at the airport or at disney land. But that's about all i can think of to use it for. Never the less I do  use it from time to time and it works great!!
With all of the idiocy in almost every free app of the day&apos;s ridiculous 1 star reviews we are going to see no one wanting to be the FAOTD. Too much nonsense over permissions when it is obvious why they&apos;re needed if you just read what the app does.  Don&apos;t ruin this by being stupid.
This is a great app! Nice customization, allows for different views, alarms (for use with metered parking), etc. As for permissions, its blatantly obvious that the iApple people don&apos;t know what they&apos;re for. Do yourself a favor, go back to your iphone.
I downloaded it since its free and just to add it to my apps list, which I do everyday. I did test it out and have to say it does its intended purpose well. That being said, if you do need this app to remember where you parked, there are other issues at hand.
To the person wgo thought this was a stolen car finder, you&apos;re an idiot! This is for when you go to the mall and forget where you parked. The conspiracy theorists who say the dev steals your contacts are also idiots. Amazon does a lit of research and testing on their apps before putting them on here and ESPECIALLY when putting an app as the free app of the day. Personally, I&apos;m super happy that this is the faotd because I&apos;ve been wanting it, but couldn&apos;t justify paying $5 for an app that I won&apos;t use that often.
do you really believe a malicious app would not only make it past Amazon&apos;s review process but also be diguised as a really useful app.  get real and stop spamming the reviews.  this app works well as it is intended to function.  without the requested permissions, the app could not do what it has promised.
I&apos;ve been waiting and hoping for this one to show up as the free app of the day. I had this app previously but had lost it when my Google account became compromised and I had to. create a new one. Now I have it again!\nThank you Amazon.
First try, it worked very well for me.  It used GPS satellites so you need to be outside for the best results.  You use it and it acts as if your car has a homing device on it.  It gets you close enough
I never lose track of my car - until I go to a professional basketball game. The local arena has many entrances, and by the time I get out, I can't tell if I need to go right or left. This gets me pointed in the right direction and leads me to where I need to go. It works. Use it!
I wish I had this a couple of years ago when my friend and I couldn't remember or agree which side of Dodger's Stadium we parked on. That said, my truck sticks out like a sore thumb and I usually remember where I park. The times I HAVE used it, mostly for testing purposes, it worked like a charm.I did use this when parking in some paid-parking one time. It was nice to see how long I was parked there and made sure I returned to the right place. I can't say it saved me money, but I do think it saved me some worry.I think four bucks is a bit steep, but I would have gladly paid four bucks that day in L.A.!
This is one of the first car locator apps on the Android market and since then a lot of features and polish have been added. Many freebie apps have also appeared since then and you can even roll your own with scripting apps like Tasker. The original Car Locator is still the best of the bunch, though. Now that it is the free app of the day, don't bother with any of the others (today anyway).Yes it does ask for a lot of permissions and the Amazon marketplace is really awful about describing those to you before download an app. If you are worried, go to the regular Android marketplace and compare the feature list to the permission list before you download. The permissions are reasonable for the features you are getting.
The app works exactly as described. There really isn't too much to say except that your mileage my vary based on your gps chip's performance chip. The interface is simple to use and you can customize how you prefer it.if you can get this for free then it's definitely worth it
I love this app!! It's not something that I'll use a lot, but is a must for when you do need it! I recently used it for the first time at the Georgia vs Florida football game in Jacksonville, FL. If anyone has been there, you know parking is crazy an you may be a mile from the stadium if you don't want to pay $50 or more for parking, which I don't! I was in a new town, with cars an people everywhere, not really knowing where I was. The app marked my car perfect, an i could even see the sidewalk that was by my car on the map. The app actually showed the stadium too so I knew which direction to walk. When the tailgating party an game was over, it led me right back to my car perfectly!! Everyone that rode with me was highly impressed with the app, and so was I. Thanks for this awesome and helpful app!!
I have disocciative episodes from brain trauma, , which means I otnen forget where I am and how to get &quot;unlost.&quot; I have a service dog now, but many don&apos;t have that ability or luxury. To the doubters of the usefulness of a reliable, simple to use version of this type of app: I&apos;d like to take you to an unfamiliar box box store, blindfold you, spin you until you are dizzy, then leave you in a random back corner. Your choice, the free version a seventeen year old kid did while waiting for levels of Call of Duty to load, or one that costs a few bucks from a professional developer.
I really haven&apos;t had a need for this app but I&apos;ll keep it until I do since it was free and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll use it someday. There have been a few times I could have used it in the past but I didn&apos;t have the app. From just messing with it, it seems like a good app that will work.
I been testin this app all day and can honestly say it don't work. When I first seen this app I was extatic. See, I live in the hood and cars are all the time gettin stolen. So to test this app, I had my girlfriend take my car to various places at the mall and drop it off. This app only took me to the place I left my car - everytime. I don't need to know where I left my car, I parked the thing! So either I'm just missin the point, or this thing don't work. Deuces.
the app does just what it says. I just don&apos;t understand how you have a $30 to $40,000 peice of machinery that you are probably still makeing payments on, and you forgot where you put it.  There are times (like the post before me) where I can understand, but those are rare.
I Love this because I get Tv schedules I add daily. I want this here forever and ever. I want another.
I've tried other TV listing apps and this is the best so far. I watch very little TV, but this app always helps me figure out what's on. My favorite option is being able to choose only certain channel to be displayed. Why bother telling me about the local channel that only displays a live video feed of the freeway? This app is a keeper.
Use it all the time on my phone and kindel. dont have a dvr box for cabel so this is helpfull. very fast and always accurate. i recomend if you do not have a set top box.
Easy to use. Pick your provider and it will give you a choice of channels. It is really worth it. I like my Tv and this is just to Cool! :)
I find it much easier to get current TV listings on my android device using this app, than I ever have using website on the WWW via PC. Enter your zip code and cable company one time and the app remembers these settings. One swipe of the thumb and you are looking at complete, detailed listings for your area, starting with the current time. You have the option to scroll backwards and forwards to see what you might have missed, or what's coming on later. Very nice!
This is a good basic TV listing. It was easy to eliminate the channels I don't have. Not perfect but it is free, so don't complain.
5stars. This is a simple, easy to use program. It is really well designed. The fastest way to find out what is on Tv
This Tv Listing guide is another great freature Amazon has included in the Kindle Fire HD!!The newspapers have taken away the tv guide listings and sell it separately or the print is so small you need a magnifying glass to read it and it's only a half day.This listing is taylored to you zip code and I couldn't be happier. I was considering purchasing a one year TV Guide listing for but don't have to know and SAVED $65.00!!!!The Kindle Fire HD is the best gift I've ever gotten.Thank you Amazon and TV Listings for Android!One delighted customer!!
We were looking for an app like this when we got our OTA antenna. It installed easily and the set-up went perfect.  The first step to get rid of your expensive provider. Now if only I could find a HD recorder.
I like this app because the setup was easy - put in your zip code and what cable / satellite provider you have - and presto.. it shows you all the channels and their current playings, as well as, the next few hours worth.  It even showed me the HD channels that we have on DirecTV.  It's faster to use than the listings through the "Guide" on my remote :)
I LOVE this app!  I can check TV listings whenever I want, wherever I am (as long as I have WiFi) without even turning on the telly!  I can choose the time of day I want to watch, I can read a synopsis of the programs, and set reminders for the shows I want to see.  I don't have to log in (otherwise I'd probably have just used the listings by my cable provider).  I can also remove the channels I don't watch.  That means if I'm watching to just relax I don't have to look at any of the news channels, financial channels, sales channels, or programs in languages that I don't understand.  This is really convenient and useful.  And best of all FREE!!!
HANDS DOWN BEATS THE SCHEDULING GUIDE ON YOUR TV!!!!!!I love that I can make my own viewing guide by  eliminating all the channels I don't like.  It's so much easier to look at programming by scrolling on my KF instead of endlessly pushing a button on the remote control to look at page after page of programming.Also love that I can pick sports and see all the teams playing at the same time so I can quickly go to the channel I want to watch.  Ditto for movies.Viewing the entire line-up for one channel each day is so easy and quick.My only complaint is that I can't save my home viewing area and set up a new one I go on vacation in another viewing area.
Great tool to stay abreast of the 4-5 shows worth watching each week.  I try to keep my boob tube watching to a minimum and this ap helps me pick the shows I actually want to watch without be mind numbed by the normal stupidity and reruns.  Has just about any &#34;normal&#34; service provide you can think of for just about every where I've ever traveled in the US.
An excellent tv guide. Works real smooth on my android tablet and gives my tv listings. Use it all the time. A very nice app.
This app works well. It gives all of the local TV listings and is correct in the details regarding local programs & reviews of the programs.
It's a really neat app to see what's on TV now and what's coming on in the near future. It's highly customizable to the channels you get and is kept very accurate and up to date. I highly recommend it. The only room for improvement would be to give those of us who use both an antenna and cable a chance to have both sets of listings displayed at once, but I found a second listings app that I use for the over the air channels.
Workable.  Set to my cable company.  Brings up programs.  Can click on a channel and get the listing for the day in one place.  The search function leaves me frustrated, but haven't really spent much time with it.  Usually try once and give up (don't want to take the time to figure it out or when it seems to skip what I have typed in??????).
works well on the kindle fire.  has all my channels.  very easy to cofigure and use.  don't have to turn on Tv to see what is on.
I don't have a cable box in my room so when I need to check what's on I just have to go to this app I LUV THIS APP SO MUCH (:
Something I use and works great.. People even vote on what they feel might be the hottest movie of the night, love it!. Fallow my reviews on amazone to get right to MUST HAVES FOR KINDLE FIRE, and if you have a must that I don't, be brave and e mail me.. I 'm here to help with anything.. It's EZ when you SEEK, so enjoy EZSEEKs must haves for kindle fire.. Enjoy all!!..
Use this app most often when in rooms without the cable box guide. Really nice to not have to flip endlessly through a gazillion shows I have no interest in. Easy enough to use and set up.
Since the TV Guide web page is my only source of tv listings, I was happy to find this app. It automatically opens to whatever time of day you are in and tells you what's on. You set it up to your area and whatever channels are available to you, and that's what you get. It lists not only what's on each channel right now, but it also lists what's coming up. Even with the ads, I still like it.
This has been my favorite tv listings app.  I like the fact that it shows the 3 upcoming shows per channel in a vertical listing and then when I select a channel I can see the upcoming shows for several hours.  I can scroll pretty quickly and easily through the list to see all the channels.  I like the reminder feature.  It is even better with the recent update.
I think this is an outstanding app.  It is free, it took very little time to set up, and it delivers great (filtered) info via a very easy to use and understand interface.I use it several times a day and it just keeps getting better.  Well worth giving a try.
I love this app.I am one of those people that has just about everything technology wise that you can think of...but for whatever reason, I DESPISE using the guides onscreen on my television to see what is on.I did that, because of lack of options, but I longed for a subscription to TV Guide.  However, the newest versions of TV Guide leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion.Along comes this App which I stumbled across purely by accident...but it's absolutely stellar.It's like having a virtual TV Guide on my tablet and my phone.  I especially like that I can filter out channels that I'm not interested in.  I have filtered out all of the shopping networks and several of the news networks, along with all of the country music channels and ALL of the "Music playing on a blank screen" channels.The search feature works great, and the other major feature that I truly love is the fact that you can quickly select "Movies, Sports, or What's On" right from the main menu.  That way you can quickly search for those several different types of items.I am giving this App five stars, but there are a few improvements that I would LOVE to see.  More auto filters would be great...such as "Comedy, Drama, Documentary, etc."  I would LOVE to be able to hit "Drama" and see which episodes of "Law and Order" are on at any given time.Overall, however, this is an awesome app and I'm REALLY glad I stumbled on it.I would gladly pay a few dollars for the App if there were a paid version.  Highly recommended.
I'm not very good at this, but I was surprised that I do.like this one.  There are a lot of apps out there and it's hard to chose,  most want money and what seems like your soul too.  But this one really works, there is no confusion. It gave me just what I wanted. So far so good.I'll recommend this one.
This app works just right for our TV setup. For some reason, TV-Guide and EyeTV for Mac cannot seem to get all of our channels right. But this app is flawless.
Just what I wanted. This app works nicely on my Kindle Fire and I like it better than others I've tried. 5 stars
when i first got this app several years ago I really liked it though itch was a little too simple but the latest update has really elevated its completeness...so THANKS!
Love this little app.  We do not always get a TV paper to check out was it on TV each evening.  It is easy to pull this up on my Kindle and check it out.
This has my favorites, my emmys, my oscars, new picks, this is going to be great, love it just going through it.
Very accurate and saves me from buying the local Sunday paper just for the TV guide. Like the way I can zero in on my preferred channels.
You put in your zip code and there are all you channels and descriptions.  I switched to digital antenna tv and it lists all the digital channels that are available in my area.
I like how you can delete channels that you don't have on your tv or choose to not watch so you can see the schedule of programs easily.  You can cater it to yourself, it's simple to use, of course I do not have cable and that may make it easier to use???  But regardless, I have no qualms with it.  :)
I have this on my Kindle Fire & love it. I use this to see what is on & what is coming on later so I don't miss shows I want to watch. I use this mostly when watching TV & I don't want to go to my computer to check on shows coming up.
This app is easy to set up for your TV area and type of connection, whether it is cable or dish.  Gives good information on each program, and upcoming ones.  It is great!
This TV is awesome. We watch television of our antenna outside so we just pick up the basic channels and this tv guide has been spot on with the shows. I am so happy I have found this guide now I don't have to wonder what's on tv &#34;next'.
I was searching for a TV guide or TV listings for the television in my bedroom only. I have a regular rabbit antenna to watch local channels. (I don't have directv in my room) Now I can check the TV listings for my area and see what's on. Works on my Kindle Fire with no problems.
Was looking to find a easy way to see whats on tv at a glance.  Works better then any other apps.  Set it up to your area and then remove the channels you don't want and then whenever you bring it up its all up to date and ready to go.  Works well on my fire.  Would reccommend to anyone who can't always keep track of there favorite shows.  Tells you what the episode is about and if its an old or new episode.  Love it!
I use this app almost everyday.  I like that it is free and gives me enough info to determine what I want to see on tv daily or even a few days into the future.  I like the formatting/layout of the schedule: ubcomplicated, and convenient...and once again, it's free!!
This tv listings is the greatest.  Lots better then the old one. Thanks for doing a better job. As l stated the word needs repeating Awesome!!!
Whenever I watch television in other room of my home I need to know what is on without having to change the channel or interrupt others viewing.This is an excellent app for quickly looking to see what's on.
Keeps me updated on all my intended shows I plan to watch. Sometimes I'm looking for a special program, and this app tells me the time and channel it will be on. Recommend to anyone just to save guess work on what programs are playing when.
Use this all the time.  Much better than our cable listings.  Easy to eliminate channels that you're not interested in.
I had a different TV guide app. It would take forever to load, even going from one time to another. This TV guide app is great! It loads up right away not to mention, when looking up a show at say 8:00, it shows you the next two show playing on that channel and the time each show started. Great app!
does what I needed! you enter your zip code to get your local listings and BAM! being able to set reminders for shows is a nice feature too
Put in a ZIP code, pick a server, see what's on! I've used it at home, along the west coast states, and Hawaii. Works like a charm -- and it's free!
I recommend it profusely. best tv listings app on the market, and I always use it. other than that, simple and effective
Since I do not have cable TV, and our local newspaper only lists evening and night programming, I needed a way to tell what was on TV. This app fit the bill exactly!! I can even look ahead, and get a synopsis of the show. Thanks!
I really like this because it's quite easy to customize to your liking.  It's accurate and it works and its free.  And that's great.
As a snowbird in Florida with a condo furnished TV schedule that just creeps up the screen and takes forever, I use my android tablet to scan what's available and remove the channels that I don't want.
I have used this app on two phones and now my Fire. I don't notice the huge ads that other reviewers complain of. It is very easy to set up your cable provider and select your channels.  I recommend this highly!
I have never been a fan of puzzles. But I really enjoy playing this game. Runs great on Samsung Vibrant and what's more important - it does not drain battery like action/shooter games.
for a FATD this was a great game. Loved the design and the daily puzzles to do - starting with 'piece of cake'
this is the only sudoku game you will ever need. Play is responsive, have kept this app through three phone changes, Droid X, HTC thunderbolt, and now the Samsung galaxy s3, as well as my Samsung tablet. no issues, ever.
just fourteen words to sudoku lovers get it get it get it get it get it get it GET IT
I had not downloaded any other version of sudoku until this one. Works great in tablet, screen flips portrait to landscape nicely. Teaches as you play.
This is the best Sudoku game ever. It teaches you the game from the ground up and has unlimited replay value. If you want to learn Sudoku or youre already an expert you should have this game.
i love sudoku!! thank goodness it saves to SD card! this version has lots of levels and it keeps track of ur statistics which i edont need, but overall cool app!!
No matter how hard they try, no other developer has come out with a better sudoku app.  I have tried several different ones and none beats Jason Linhart's Enjoy Sudoku.
Really awesome sudoku app! Even good for those of us who are not the world's greatest at this kind of puzzle!
this makes about as much sense as the morons who gave this app a one star rating... personally i hate sudoku, but i hate idiot app reviewers more.  was just trying to balance out the stupidity.
I've used many sudoku apps and enjoyed most of them, until I played Enjoy Sudoku. This is by far the best. The interface is enjoyable to use. The hint feature gives you just enough and allows you to ask for more. The best part of Enjoy Sudoku is the Learn button, which teaches you strategies to become a better player. Excellent app.
Better than most if not all sudoku apps. Has many options, game of the day... some easy, others hard. I would recommend it to those who like sudoku!
I've played a lot of Sudoku apps, both on the Android and the iPad.  And so far, hands down, this is the best one.  I would have been willing to pick this one up for three bucks if I didn't already have it for free (yay, free Apps on Amazon).What I love about this more than the other apps is that you choose a number then the square you want to put it in.  Usually it is the opposite.  When you choose the number all the spots you've already chosen that number light up, making it easy to see if you are making a mistake or not.So, full marks for having something that is fun and challenging, giving a lot of options, and properly using all of the screen real estate to the best of its potential.  If you love Sudoku you HAVE to purchase this app.
I was a beta tester for a different devs sudoku, but this one blows that one away! Very well designed for us sudoku addicts! Thanks Jason!!!
Excellent sudoku app for all levels of experience. I applaud being able to stop all network access via the preferences.
great product - should be 10 stars.  I love this!!!  It is intuitive and easy to use.I like how the screens are laid out, with the big numbers for entries and little numbers for entering 'pencil marks'.They have a great product here.  It is obviously well designed and tested.I will look for more products from this company.If you like Sudoku you have to get this!
Enjoy sudoku is a great, challenging, fun distraction for beginners and up. It is a must have for sudoku fans.
I used to watch people on the subway intently zone out on their sudoku puzzles. I never quite understood the draw, so this review is that of a sudoku rookie. With that in mind I love this app. I have used it everyday since installing. One feature I really enjoy are the vocabulary lessons, and the wide range of skill levels. This is a well designed app, with no strange permissions and the price to entertainment ratio is great.
A very, very good way to pass the time......  This is an excellent app that goes from easy to just about &#34;no way to beat it.&#34;
I've tried several other Sudoku apps, but this is the one I'll be keeping.  Lot's of levels to choose from.  Love the stats you get after you've finished.  Good hint system.  You can set bookmarks for when you just need to guess.  Lots of other options too.  Auto pencil, etc.  Great Sudoku game.  Gotta' go - it's calling me...
Definitely my favorite Sudoku I have ever played.  Between the scoring, the statistics, and the random games, this application is above reproach.
I've tried five or six sudoku apps, with varying degrees of satisfaction. I review here Enjoy Sudoku (ES) for the KF.Enjoy Sudoku is one of the best board-type game applications I've ever seen, across all forms of games, across several platforms.The display is beautiful. I typically play with my KF in portrait position. I've tried landscape; it works perfectly, but it's just not to my taste. The highlighting of completed row/box is useful. Highlighting "all number N used" is extremely helpful, but having the display flash in different colors takes a bit of getting used to.The user controls are OK:- Entering choices using the box-first approach is intuitive. Entering number-first-then-box is claimed to be faster, but again, it takes some getting used to. (Because of the highlighting feature, I've not been able to get used to it because of the way the colors change back and forth.)- The undo/back-track command is really great. I haven't yet found how deep the undo stack is, but I've exercised it pretty well, I think.- I've used the rotate/mirror commands only once, but the change of viewpoint enabled me to finish a "fiendish" (toughest level) puzzle. Bravo.- I have yet to figure out what other command buttons do - from my perspective, ES behaves just a tad strangely when some buttons are pressed. I suppose I should read the manual, but a perfect app is written so all controls are intuitive.A truly strong point of ES is the range of available daily games: there are FOURTEEN levels, ranging from trivial to, well, really really (near impossibly) hard. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There is a slight discontinuity in difficulty: the game takes a big jump somewhere around "moderate" or "intricate." I can live with that. Starting over doesn't impact time-to-complete scoring (I'm divided on this one).At the end of a game, you get some feedback with a rough percentile chart. Sorta informative. It would be nicer if there was an absolute ranking; "User_name is 483 of 10 zillion" could be rewarding to players.I really recommend this app to KF owners.
There isn't much I can say that isn't already apparent from the insanely high ratings this app has. More options, better difficulties, better scoring, better implementation, better puzzles, and the best tutorial I've ever seen. Even the hints are great and helpful without giving away too much.
This game is definately worth the money and more.  It not only allows you to have fun playing but also has a good selection of strategies to use to solve the more difficult puzzle.  I am somewhat new to this game so the tutorial and the "learn" feature on this game is really good.  I also like the statistics regarding how quickly you solved the puzzle versus others who have played the same puzzle.
this app is well made, well designed, solid, and without any flaws. I been downloading free app of the day amazon apps for while now and this is definitely one of the better ones! Perfect for all skill levels and can really help out beginners!!
Love it!! I'm new to Sudoku, and this made learning to play simple and entertaining. I also really liked learning the history of the game inside the app. Really great customization as well; I love the color and background options, sounds, and that you can mark your puzzle just as if you were playing on paper. Excellent app!
Great game. Ignore all the nonsense reviews from free app day. I am surprised they take the time to write twenty words.
Well... it's the tilt that really counts but if you feel like shaking your tablet/phone... you're the one who paid for it :)I posted a few reviews of Android apps and this game, I believe, it's the first app that gets a 5 stars from me. Not because it's perfect - the resolution on my XOOM could be higher and the game is not as responsive to tilting the tablet as it should be - but because I just love playing it. It's got a definite retro, arcade feeling and, unlike something that you could have played back in the late 80's/early 90's, it responds to your gadget's accelerometer. And, with unlimited ammo, missiles and lots more surprises, it's just plain, no apologies fun.I got mine as the free Amazon 'app of the day' but it's worth the admission price from anyone looking for a simple but fun arcade game.P.S. - the game allows for 'keyboard' controls and I was in fact able to play it off a bluetooth keyboard paired with my tablet but why would anyone want to do that? It's easier to score because you're a lot more accurate but it's not as much fun as the tilting or accelerometer mode.
I haven&apos;t reviewed an Amazon app in a while, but this one definately deserves some great feedback. Controls may use the g sensor, but it couldn&apos;t be more well done. Love how the weapons systems work too. A+, finally got a game that holds my attention. Thanks Amazon!
Simple game, but a lot of fun just like flying-shooting-side-scrollers should be. Not a lot of depth to the story, but there doesn&apos;t need to be. Highly recommended.
It&apos;s a good little game, looks good and the level system is done well, star blitz is a lot better for a space shooter
cool little 2d shooter, like the old school vibe it has going. good time killer. oh to the person who asked why it needed bluetooth premissions, thats probably fkor the zii-mote that you can use to play the game. never used it, but like i said thats probably why it needs that permission.\n\nbottom like good free app of the day, download only if you like little time killer games.\n\nruns good on G2
This was a free app of the day so I looked into it for my Kindle Fire. I enjoy word games, etc and this is a different way to use your brain to come up with words. I told my aunt about it and she loves Word Collapse as well.  Granted it is not the hardest or most challenging word game but it is most definately a different word game to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games and does not mind having one that is not difficult when you just need to play something to clear your mind.
You are so pathetic Superman........I agree with the others.... We need an option to move to a sd card... I think the concept is interesting.... But to much room.
Superman I love you, I think you are absolutely hilarious! Your Story about the star wars movie still has me laughing haha you need to start a blog and post all the funny random reviews on there, you would have so many followers! Happy Valentines Day :) I think this is a great idea of a game. Free app of the day, faotd, download, developer, idea, fantastic, amazon, game.
this is one of my favorite word games on the tablet. It keps me busy and kills alot of time.I recommend this one. There a re a few different ways to play so that youcan change it up if you want. I love it.
I like this word game and thought it is fun to play. I also like that it has three modes of playing so if you get tired of one you just change over. You can turn off the clock for relaxed playing so you are just having fun trying to build the biggest words you can.All three modes are entertaining and are a bit of a brain tease. The game worked well on my Kindle Fire and the graphics were OK.
this game has lots of replay value: 3 unique modes of play and 4 levels of difficulty per mode. LOVE this game!! and I'm rather picky about my word games... get it while it's the FAotD! worth the 2 bucks though...
This really make you concentrate and focus.  Not sure about all the words in its database, but for the most part it's fun.
I really like this game very fun and entertaining. It is very addictive and challenging at times. I give it 5 stars
This is a ice game to kill some down time. My 11 year old grandaughter likes it and plays when she visits. It is challanging and fun.
due to the lack of Superman75's first-on-the-scene review I was forced to download this app completely unwarned about what dangers may befall me or my family upon its use.  I am constantly looking over my shoulder, not sure if I should beware of falling pianos, rouge aliens or rabid wolverines!
It is a fun game to sit and relax with.  I love being able to choose the different categories.  I can avoid the ones I know little about.  Even the ones I am very familiar with give me a nice level of challenge.  I want to see even more categories for me to choose from.
Love all kinds of word games.....so much so that they call me Webster at work! Love word scrambles and this is a lot like that, only you can play against a clock or at your own speed. Recommend to anyone that likes thinking and word games!
This app was fun, and took a new spin on a word search type of puzzle game, making it intriguing and a time-sucker. I loved this app and recommend it to anyone who likes to spell and likes words w/ friends or scrabble type of games. It's different than those, but a lot of fun and you will get hours of enjoyment out of it.
This game is not much fun. In fact, it was so not fun, that to entertain myself I had to click "see all my reviews" and then use the drop down bar to select "show most recent comments" just to see the review I had initially written but had been deleted. Feel free to look it up.
this is good but it is bad at the same time overall it is good. papa Johns piazza . I like trains
Does exactly what it says, changes your home screen organization and allows you to customize it.  Works well on tmobile g2 p
other home replacements were laggy or changed since the much that it was a pain to use my phone?? this one changes just enough without leaving you lost.. great navigation.. really really like it... Samsung galaxy 4 G
I didn't have much expectation from this launcher and was pleasantly surprised. I like the layout and the varied custimization. Take time to see what it offers and how tidy yet gorgeous it makes your home pages and app drawers. I'm hooked and that isn't an easy task ;0  Ty Amazon for offering it as FAOD &amp; Devs!
This is better than most reviews.  the app works fine, and there are lots of themes for this on the market.  I did however delete it off my phone since I liked the stock one just as much.  This app does a good job of adding choices to the android community.  The first minute of use seemed lagy, but then it took off fine.
nice app, glad i got it while it was freex, but i still would have paid for it.if you want better reviews then go to the android market, most of the reviews give this app 5 stars, so i do not understand the negative reviews, those stupid people probably have a really crappy phone that cannot run anything and they are just whiny babies. i tell you the day the faotd has no 1 star reviews, is they day i win the lotto......come on amazon, change the age to be able to review.
Most of the time you get close to nothing for 'nothing' but this free little app actually does what you would expect it to do. It gets you police radio conversation (even comes with a 10-codes translator file). It lets you:- set alerts based no the number of people listening to a specific scanner- mark your own favorites- finds stations 'near you' based on your location- has a top-50 list based on the number of listeners- lets you browse by area (in 15 countries), genre and source- shows 'new additions'- at least on a tablet's large screen the ads are small and unobtrusiveOn my XOOM (Android 3.2) I am able to continue to listen to the police talk while running other tasks such as browsing the Web or writing emails.Good work. Recommended.
Great app to listen to. Never realized how busy chicago police are till I listened to a little while of their feed. One complaint I read about on the google market is that there are limited feeds outside major cities and very few outside the united states, since many scanners are encrypted. Very well made app and volunteers run the feeds.
Has numerous stations, weather, police, fire, rescue, ham radio, too many to mention. Use it all the time, highly recommend. Never had a problem with this app.
This has worked very well for me.  I live in a rural area outside of the city I work in and I work with law enforcement agencies.  I like to be able to hear the folks I work with on the job and know that they are doing everything they can to make our lives safer and enjoyable.
Some call it nosey, I call it wanting to know why sirens are blaring. For free, this app works well and has a wide array of precincts to select. I live in Eastern PA and can select from multiple counties.
There's nothing quite like listening in on all the foolishness happening around you, or knowing if something is going on in your neighborhood. It's sort of like getting the local news before the news stations give it to you. Everyone I know is laughing at me for having this app, but I will be the one taking side roads while they're stuck in traffic because the police shut down a section of the freeway. Take that.
For a free app this works great. Even provides basic 10 codes.Works great on the kindle fire. Would love to see future updatesinclude notes & a record feature.
This is much cheaper than a Radio Scanner you purchase.  I get out local sheriff, police, ambulance, etc.  Great scanner.
Everyone loves to know what is going on around them and with this scanner radio in your area, you can be sure to stay on top of important local happenings. The app is great, easy to use and the settings make the experience more pleasing.
I LOVE THIS BECAUSE IT LETS ME KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND MY AREA, KEEPS ME SAFE, AND LETS ME KNOW WHEN SOMETHINGS GOING ON AND TO BE AWARE OF MY SURROUNDING HERE...IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT ONE CAN HEAR EVEN IF NOT SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR SURROUNDING AREA....A THUMBS UP APP THAT IS VERY GOOD...
an excellent way to be a nosy fly on the wall.  I didn't even know what a police scanner was before I downloaded this, but it's quite fun!  love the Top 50 stations, just listened to a high speed chase in chicago.
I have used this on my phone now it works great this way.
This app is amazing and FREE!! I could listen to this all night long. It picks up my local police station and you can't believe some of the stuff that goes on around town. The best time to listen to it is on weekends or holidays. It is very entertaining. Sometimes you just can't stop listening. Very addicting. There are complaints about it running down battery quickly, but I use this app on my kindle fire and it doesn't seem to use any more battery than any other open app. The other nice thing is that you can run this program in the background and still play other games or surf the Internet. I strongly urge you to give this app a try!
This free "Scanner Radio" app installed cleanly on my Kindle Fire HD and worked perfectly for my needs. The app does not turn your device into a radio but it does allow you to listen to Internet streaming of local government radio communications (police, EMS, etc). If your local service does not stream there communications, you will not be able to listen to them with this app.The interface was fairly easy to navigate and I was lucky to find that my local law enforcement's communication was available through the app.Recommended!CFH
I got this app to see what was going on in different places. Works great so far. Love it a lot!
I really like this app. My husband is a retired policeman , and  I worked as a police dispatcher years ago. This app brings back old memories. The only problem I have with it is It doesn't pick up the city I live in. Not sure why,  I get citiesall around me. Even though I can't get my city it is fun to listen to.
This app seems to work just great. All of the local municipal and state frequencies in my area are lumped into one single monitor frequency in my area though. I thought I would try this app just to see how well it works and it does. I have both a base station scanner in my house and a hand held scanner for mobile use when I go on trips but i'll bet they haven't been turned on more than ten or fifteen times in the years that I've had them. Listening to scanner calls as a steady diet is somewhat distracting to me. As a point of reference I was a licensed ham radio operator and CB radio operator. I never put my mobile transceiver in my car at all any more nor turn on my base station radio transceiver anymore either. I don't think my base station transceiver's antenna coaxial cable is even hooked up to the radio anymore as well. For you scanner junkies out there the Scanner Radio app will work just fine on your tablet or android phone and you can listen to scanner calls to your heart's content. One of my best friends is a consummate scanner monitor listener and has his scanners running all of his waking hours at home. In any event, happy listening on the Scanner Monitor app to the rest of you.
This app is easy to set up and use. Favorite stations can be saved and listened to whenever wanted. Stations can be found for just about any town or county.
very useful DroidX, scanner pro has been awesome for listening in random places like from New Mexico to Utah! (buy the pro version invest in the future of this app!) has made my DroidX pleasant again i seriously have over 340 app's installed in my phone DroidX greatest phone ever. look me up on appaware.com/user/name/dyingjedi or appbrain.org/user/dyingjedi/apps-on-the-motorola-droid-x
i have owned this for a long time now and am finally doing a review. this scanner app works fine on the kindle fire good luck finding a station in a specific area. works fine though and fun to listen to.
This is good if you're interested in what's going on in your area (or someplace else).  As I live near several schools and shopping areas, I find this useful.
Great app to listen to police, paramedic and fire department radio broadcasts around the United States. I have used it many times and have listened to chases, explosions and family disputes resulting in gunfire. Shows you how the police and other professionals have to deal with the dregs of society.
As a former dispatcher I have always been hooked on listening to police calls. This app is beyond what I ever thought was out there. You can get local calls, state calls ...even calls from around the USA or the world. It is a totally amazing app.
This is very addictive. There are so many great scanners to listen to. The most popular scanner always seems to be the Chicago Police.
I didn't expect this to pick up local emergency transmissions but the price was right to find out.Local transmissions do come across clearly.
I had to remove it as I found out that I live in a very dull city.  I guess that is really great!!  I waited and in an hour there were 2 contacts between the dispatcher and a patrol officer.  One about a lost dog and another about some trash.  Each was about 10 seconds.  It did kind of startle me when I heard it.  I thought it best just to remove it.  You may live in a city that has an interesting climate or you are a criminal and want to know when they are coming to your door but that is not me.  Try it you may need it or just enjoy hearing what happening!
Great app worked great with my kindle. I have used it alot sence I have put it on my kindle.
