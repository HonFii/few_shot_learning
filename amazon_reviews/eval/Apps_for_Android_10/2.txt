You have to go onto a computer to sign up. Well I don't own a computer!Make it so you can sign up in the app
Fun game while it lasts, but it FCs all the time with no rhyme or reason on my A500.  The only saving grace is that it sort of saves your game just before it blitzes (except for the 1 time it destroyed all my towers upon reload).  If the FC gets fixed, I'll up the stars.  It's not bad enough for 1 star, but the FCs keep it a solid 2.  Other than that, it would be a 5.
Those of you who like tower defense games are likely to enjoy games where creeps get progressively stronger, and towers that are adaptable, upgradeable and offer a variety of armaments. This app doesn't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse, especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow. They fire a single shot, and then take forever to reload. And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by. Not much of a defense. It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once. The instructions aren't too helpful, either. The touchscreen is also laggy at times, which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender, rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there. This one is mediocre, at best.
With such simple graphics and no sound, this is certainly overpriced at three dollars. You could get three defense games with that money and each would be better. The bubble defense is pretty standard but I just did't like this as much as most other games. Save your money.
robot defense but less responsive and harder to understand even the easy setting. I hope they fix the bugs, but until they do I cannot recommend this game at all!
this game to me isn't a very well thought up game, I don't get how to play and the explanation they offer doesn't make since either, I rate w two stars simply Bc I enjoy the free app of the day and don't want to lose it over crappy reviews.
I saw all the bad reviews and was suspicious they were planted there by a competitor to make this company look bad.  However, playing on a Samsung Galaxy S, this game had definite issues.First, there dots not seem to be an explanation as to what each tower did.  Strike one.Second, I could not adjust the game volume.  During the game, my phone's volume controls affected the ringer, not the game.Finally, the interface was terrible.  Trying to place a tower is so difficult, in that it is so slow to move across the screen as to render it unplayable.This could have been a nice sequel.  Instead it's a disaster.
After installing this on my 1st Samsung Galaxy 7&#34; tablet the tablet went bonkers on me. Even the pros could not reset the tablet back to factory settings. It's difficult to believe there could have been anything else responsible for bricking the tablet. I recommend you DO NOT install this.
I had high hopes for this application,  but it is hard to use and doesn&apos;t quite work right. Holding it the way it described made it very hard to see the screen due to glare of the sun. Also, the radar doesn&apos;t work right; it doesn&apos;t face the right direction (it thought I was facing North when I was really facing West). All in all, I am not going to rely on it.
This app only works with friends if they have it too. With that said, Google Latitude is better because Latitude is free (&amp; more people have Google accounts).
Very disappointed with this app.  The app would not let me set the correct time and day so all the shows are wrong.
Where do I find out how to use it other than see the listings? If I can see instructions and if it works I will give it a better rating.
I love how this app shows me the guide for cable since my new provider doesn't offer a channel guide.The only problem is the in app ads. They are huge and take up half of the screen. I tried to find a way to pay to eliminate the ads but there is no way.I am very disappointed. I think I'll look for another channel guide app.
I've been using this app for some time and I have always considered it a 5-star app.  The interface isn't perfect, but it works well and makes it easy to find what you are looking for.  You can configure your TV provider and select the channels that you want to see.  The only real issue I've had ongoing is that it occasionally adds additional channels that I am not interested in and I have to remove them, but I can do this from the main screen, so it isn't a big deal.Recently (the past couple of months), however, it keeps losing the configuration info.  It still knows my provider, but the channels I am not interested are no longer excluded.  There are over 700 channels with my TV provider and while most that I am interested in are at the beginning of the list, there are some that are not and it is a pain to scroll to find them.  It takes a couple of minutes to reconfigure.  There are options in the configuration screen for &#34;select all&#34; and &#34;deselect all&#34;, which is great because with so many channels, I can deselect and then simply select the ones I want, but the fact that I recently have to keep doing this is a deal-breaker.I waited to post such a review because I wanted to give the developer a chance to correct, but apparently they are either unaware of the problem or uninterested in fixing it.  In the meantime, I will be looking for a new tool to get my TV listings.I am running on a Kindle Fire HD.
This is a very good app. Yes it is ad-supported, but the app is well worth using even with the ads. You enter your ZIP Code, pick your television provider, and boom - TV Listings. For further control, you can filter only the channels you want to see listed and move to any time of day you wish. I use this quite regularly, it is way quicker than watching the TV Guide channel and this app is far superior to the TV Guide official app (which is pretty bloated).UPDATE December 2 2013: The latest version of this app is severely crippled by a bug. You can filter out channels that you don't want to see in the listings, but the app forgets the channels you have filtered every time you launch it. To me, this severely decreases the usefulness of the app. I'll be looking for an alternative.
It would have been great if I could set reminders on it. Otherwise it was just a basic tv guide that was digital.
what's the point of downloading this app if u can just check your Tv guide? Also u cant c any Tv shows. ur only seeing Tv listings. I dont like this app.
I loved this app until it suddenly dropped my listings. Instead pf 600+ channels on Time Warner Digital, it tells me I only have 34. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app,  but it didn't help.
kind of dumb nothing really on it. I really don't know how to rate this one. Not my cup of tea,
I haven't uninstalled it yet, but its slow.I have yet to figure out how the search works, but it isn't terribly obvious.I want to pare down the channels displayed to the ones I typically watch - I'm not interested in the non-HD broadcast channels, nor yhe premium channels I don't get. I'm also nointerested in anything being excreted by Fox Noise.
I couldn't get into this game so I deleted it. Someone else may like it though so it depends on what you are into..
The gave had decent graphics and a nice upgrade system.  The controls are bad. You can do motion but the response is slow out hand and then you can&apos;t see the ship
I tried this and deleted it within an hour. I love word games, but this one simply is not worth $1.99. Maybe it would be worth half that... maybe.
Thee really are so many word game apps out there and this one just isn't good. It gets boring fast.
Maybe but I'm not convinced. I happen to like Honeycomb's standard interface more than dxTop's but that's a matter of taste. Objectively, the scope of this app - take near-complete control of my desktop (and yes, it comes with custom icons and themes) - was enough of a concern for me to remove it shortly after installation. I asked myself how other, more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly. "Application Folder Pro", my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management. Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface, the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort. In my case (XOOM, Honeycomb) they don't. I wasn't able to justify allowing a "vendor's" app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it, just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it. And, on a more parochial note, dxTop was stuck in 'portrait' on my XOOM. There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives', this does appear to be a well-thought, well-designed overlay but it's a radical departure from Android's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was: if they believe that Android's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out, why not produce their own mobile OS? Seriously.In the Android world what I need and in fact I welcome at this time is 'helpers' such as 'App Folder Pro', not a new boss. dxTop tries to make itself the boss and I have not use for that.
Nice diamond concept but I like the original home screens for the DROID x. This is not as intuitive for me.
So, I read the description and I'm psyched, right? Just what I'm looking for! Well, not quite.I always go through the reviews before installing. But I always download because I want to be ready to pounce. Even despite the reviews I was like, &quot;Huh, maybe it will still work.&quot;  My dissapointment set in when I went to install it and the permissions were far more reaching than the capabilities of not only the descriptions but the reviews.This app wants to read my messages? It wants to read my system log? Why? It wants unintrusive access to everything on my phone which, if it's replacing the Droid OS, I understand BUT when I look at the reviews and the full capabilities of the app it makes me extremely nervous. It's just this side of jailbreaking my phone as it is, no reason to invite trouble where it isn't needed.
Yesterday (or the day before) the free app of the day was something to organize apps into folders, with added functionality.  That app was rated well, as there is, arguably, a use for it and the app was intuitive and ran well.  This app replaces something that doesn't need replacing.  Whether you run Froyo or Gingerbread, either will be faster and smoother than this offering.  I can see limited appeal for those who feel the need to customize and tweak and recustomize their devices, but I have better things to do with my time than &quot;fix&quot; what isn't broken and replace it with something that isn't quite as good.
nothing great. I've been trying to get a feel of it and its failing so far. I will probably uninstall since its too difficult to get use to. I read the reviews first and still like to try it my self, however I got to agree with what most are saying about it. Nothing special and its ugly. I tried to like it.
I always appreciate when people think outside the box and try to give a new perspective on things.  With this app though, I think more personal preference was put into the design and layout, rather than thought about what others would enjoy or find useful.Then again it could just be me.  I couldn't get used to the home screen diamond navigation or the quick access buttons.  I found them all rather clunky and hard to use.  The list of apps organized into running, services, recent waas nice.Overall the whole interface ran slower that the default one, and made the choice to uninstall a no brainer.  Better luck next time.
It's not really a bad app for free but it makes my fascinate run VERY very slow...will probably end up uninstalling
There are better launchers like Open Home 6. I've been running Open Home 6 for a good while now and it's my favorite of all of the other major launchers like Launcher Pro, ADW Launcher, and Go Launcher..
I hate not leaving a good review but if this application is better than the stock launcher on your phone than I feel sorry for your phone. It's messed up to navigate through all the screens especially if you have scrolling widgets,  plus it has a generic look to it. I well be sticking to my adwEX Launcher. Glade I got this for free or man would I be really disappointed.
I have an HTC phone, so I already have all these features with Sense. Not an attractive interface. Functions smoothly.
At first this thing was pretty cool, but then it started to slow down my phone as I added widgets onto it. I also like to point out that you can resize your calender or any other widgets on the wall. The way it organized my app is pretty cool but all the negatives things kind of made me want to uninstall the app.
It depends where you live on what channels you pick up. In my area I could only get the fire department, no police or sheriff's dept. So I deleted it.
Cannot pick up any police, rescue, or fire in my area.  I was very disappointed!Hope they soon get an app that will pick up fire and rescue and police in my actual county or city!
the product was alright. I was hoping it would have some closer stations to me. but it didn't but overall i think its a good product that can get the station they need
Interesting program but unusable on the handset listed. Constant lockups and would hang up even on startup so virtually useless.
wellworked ok..didnt have many local frequencies but worked. Would not shut off even after pressed stop andclosed. had to force close from settings. VERY annoying.
Um at first I used it for a while but, then I started not to use it quite as much as before & now it just seems to pretty much sit there in my tablet computer |[
While this app might be useful in major cities, it isn't at all useful in small towns.  The audio streams are from voluntary sources, it is NOT like having a real scanner receiver.
doesn't scan your local police/fire channels.  I could really care less about what is going on 45 minutes from where I live.
Does not work for me.  Was not what I expected in a scanner App.  Tried it and it was not what I expected.  Removed from my Kindle.
I Thought this was a good app, but I only received one frequency in my area.  When I found this&#34;ARCHIVES&#34;of frequencies,which I could use if I subscribe to some other program,I lost interest in this app.  GOODBYE!!
Could only hear it with headphones and really does not offer the music I like in an easy to find format.
Cumbersome and not really useful.  I tried it, then took if off.  Maybe i just can't take the time to mess with it.
works to a point but not in all area's you may want to scan. could be blocks on government scanner doing it or it's filtering design either way it doesn't always do want you might need it to do.
Good enough for someone who wants it for "amateur" reasons, but it is to laggy for me as a professional to use as a third radio frequency.
Can;t get into it, it has a lot of features and you can pick up any city's scanner, but it is boring.
I down loaded this and waited and waited for it to come up with something.  I know things were going on as my husband has a scanner in the garage.  I got &#34;nothing&#34;!  Will probably take off my Kindle HD Fire.
It's fun to listen to police, airport control, etc.Voice quality is too bad to understand anything. PilotsEye.tv (non-free) recordings provide much better voice quality for airport control.
Yeah yeah, it's great to have a kindle reader app on your phone.Nothing else about it is good. It crashes constantly, even when I am not using it.Not only is the instability pathetic, but that is exacerbated by the fact that there is no option to tell this dumb thing I don't want it to constantly run (and crash, apparently) in the background. How hard would it be to have an option for that?It makes no effort to keep track of your actual reading progress.  It remembers the last page viewed, which is insufficient because jumping to the index or end notes to check something results in the Kindle app assuming that to be your new current reading progress. Unless you manually bookmarked the page every time, progress is lost. It would be incredibly simple to have a default bookmark which keeps track of the highest page you actually flipped to in 1-page increments, rather than merely the last page displayed.It does let you change the text size and background color, which is worth a couple stars.
This app used to be my favoriteApp. Last update ruined it. Place in books not saved, not able to remove books, if phone call comes in, instead of going back to where you were, you are now returned to a totally different book at a random spot, and books that you have finished, are now marked at only partially read. I'm uninstalling. Which is too bad. I've spent a lot of money in the store in books. They just lost a customer.
Comics won't open to full zoom so can't read them, pages turn to quick and messed up slightest touch does something almost everytime, no room for errors here.  Not a fan, but try it maybe you'll have better luck.
This rating is for the most recent Kindle for Android updated version 3.3.0.405, which will not install on my Cruz T105 tablet. Please update again soon!  I'd like to keep reading Kindle books on my current android device. :)
Have been using the app for about a year now.  The older version was much better, responsive and reliable.  Unfortunately since updating the app has been very sluggish and force closes frequently, I was able to find an older version and revert back to it.  2 stars for reading books on my phone, -3 stars for the problems caused by the update and the effort to have to find a previous version without these problems.
This app has started to lag behind both its major competitors and the smaller readers.  Come on Amazon, we know you can do better.
Trying to run the latest version on android 4 on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Application is very unstable and crashes forcing a deletion and reinstall along with bringing all of the books from the archives back into the program. This is required at least 1 time per day. It would be very nice to see a fix come down for whatever has gone wrong.
You press on kernels to pop them, then you refresh the screen to do it all over, sort of like a bubble wrap app.  Quickly got bored with it and uninstalled.
Got this as free app of the day through the Amazon app market, and it is not too excellent, but then again I got it for free so cannot really be too upset.
I down loaded this app when it was free.  I thought I would use it.  However, I did not.  Wasn't my thing and I couldn't figure it out.  I deleted it.
Not a very bad app, but not the best. I recommend TuneIn app which has better function to find local stations, (the TuneIn app made this easy). This app did not have as comprehensive catagory functions. Display of radio stations did not always display the station's logo, which makes quick selection more of a chllenge. I did not pay for this app, I got it with the free app of the day from Amazon, I would not pay for it, there are better apps such as TuneIn to go with.
Had to uninstall after it started trying to view every file type I downloaded, including ePub, PDF, and others. That seems a bit overkill to me...
I enjoy streaming music so decided to give XiiaLive Pro a shot.  Unfortunately, the app just isn't very good. There are other music apps that offer more.
Thanks Amazon for making this app free today, but it's not worth it. I was intrigued by the equalizer, but you really can't tell THAT much of a difference on the Samsung Epic. The streaming is choppy (cuts out every 5-10 sec), and the app slows down other apps, e.g. words lag when typing on Tweetcaster.I also am confused and perhaps somewhat overwhelmed by what station to choose. The stations listed are the actual station names but don't really have a good description. You just have to assume the stations will play within the genre. I definitely prefer Pandora, which plays the next song based on songs you like and stays within the genre (or you can create your own station). The streaming on Pandora also isn't choppy. Maybe others have had better luck with this app, but I've already uninstalled it from my phone.
I imagine this app is going through some growing pains. Maybe I will try it again in a year or so, but right off the bat it did not connect to the first three music genre choices that I selected. Then, when it locked in on to what I was hoping to be an acoustic blues station, I ended up getting a Pointer Sisters song. My next attempt got me some sort of techno/rave dance beat. I am pretty sure that is not even close to Chicago Blues.
I was not overly impressed with this game.  I wanted to play with other people not the computer, could not figure out how to do that.
I love backgammon, but playing upside down is too confusing.  I kept forgetting which color I had since I was forced to look at the board upside down. Is it possible this is how it's played south of the equator?
I've installed/uninstalled this many times...playing when needing a mindless ap but removing when it stresses me. Too many flaws and coincidences..I can predict how the ap will trump me. The higher the difficulty the more perfect moves the ap gets. I never get a break and only win because of the dumb way the ap finishes its removing its pieces from the board.
This game has nice graphics, five (supposed) levels of play, and convenient player cues when  making moves.What it does NOT have is an AI which knows anything about basic backgammon strategy. That makes the five levels of difficulty not really be five levels of difficulty, because the game plays the same flawed strategies at each of the five levels.In fact, I've played several computer backgammon games over the last 25 or so years, and this is unquestionably the worst AI I've yet seen.In particular, it doesn't have a clue how to best run to the inner table or how to roll off. Two games in a row when I was hopelessly out-pipped (as the AI had already rolled more doubles than odds make credible) the AI simply chose the least efficient method of filling the inner table and then rolling off. At times it will move up men on the inner table when rolling off instead of taking two men off of lower points.It will "arrange" the inner table when there are still men to bring there. In one game at the "highest" difficulty, the AI had all but two men in the inner table, and needed 12 pips to bring those to the inner table. I had three men outside the inner table and needed more than 20 pips. On two turns in a row it "arranged the inner table" instead of advancing the last two men. In the meantime I brought all three of my men to the inner table, and actually rolled off my first pair before it brought in its last two.In another game both the AI and I had all our men in the inner table, and his array was much more balanced, as I was piled up on 5 and 6. On a few turns the AI moved men up from its 5 and 6 instead of taking men off of 2 and 3. When it later rolled 5s and 6s they were wasted. I won that game without doubles, and I should have needed both double 5s and double 6s to win.This game, as do most computer backgammon games I've played, seems to roll doubles for itself at an unlikely high rate. Also, be prepared that most useful game opening rolls are going to be "won" by the AI. LOL But the AI is so clueless that it doesn't really do it any good. Note that the game will also at times accept hopeless doubles, but that is not uncommon for backgammon AIs. The only games it won were games where it considerably out-rolled me, like 40 to 50 pips worth.I played this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 without any technical issues.Recommended if you don't want a challenge, otherwise look elsewhere.
The more I played this game, the more often the Ai opponent started rolling doubles nearly every single roll!!! How can you compete with that?? And not only that, the doubles were the number it could use the most to maximize moves towards a win! I'm sorry to say, but I honestly believe there is a flaw in the game that favors the device when in single player mode. If the rolls were more random, or the gameplay were more 'fair', It would definately get a higher score from me, but not the way it is. Also, one othe thing a LOT OF DEVELOPERS IGNORE ; AN EXIT BUTTON!!!!!!!  I'm not a developer/programmer, but how hard can it be? Too bad about all this, I love Backgammon!I read some of the other reviews and most people (as I do) that the dice are loaded. The roll should be as random as you can possibly make them concidering the limitations of programming. The differences should be where the AI decides to move the game pieces, leaving more open, or not, depending on the level. The dice rolls should ALWAYS BE RANDOM and have the same probability for both players. This would be the way it happens in real life with two people playing a real game. If the game ever gets updated to reflect better play conditions, my rating will go up.
It's been a few years since I learned Backgammon, and I needed a refresher. Game didn't really give me a chance to learn before wiping the floor with me. Probably fine if you play regularly.
Very very very disappointing that this app does not count calories as it claims. Hopefully someday in the future it will be updated to include this KEY feature. But until then, the developer can count 2 stars.
It does give you calories (and four other facts) for the items you'll find on the menu but it only gives you four and you can't put it all together.  For instance, if you look at Chipotle on the app, you can see the beans and the rice and everything's nutritional facts but unless you're writing it all down and adding it all up, you have no general idea of the nutritional facts of the burrito you're about to eat.  And by "nutritional facts" I mean fat, protein, calories, fiber, and carbs since that's all they give you.  Glad I didn't pay for it.
I was hoping for more to come of this app as the idea of an app that can help you add up the caloric intake is a great idea, but this app could use some extra work.  I'm glad I picked this up for free and didn't pay the $2 for it.  I'll still keep it, and probably refer to it, but the interface is not all that great to work around and I really wish it would allow you to look at several food items at once so you can see everything.I do appreciate that it is more than calories, knowing how much fat, protein, carbs, and fiber is also useful.I hope they update this app, I would like to see it become more than it is.
Total calories is only part of the equation. We need to have a breakdown such that we can see how many calories is that 21g of fat.It would be nice to be able to see generic items such as &quot;corndog&quot; - sometimes we get stuff from vendors that aren't a national chain.
I read the reviews for this one &amp; figured it would suck, but knowing how unreliable the reviews on here can be, I decided to check it out for myself just to be sure.  Well, they're right on about this one.There's one single good thing about this app, &amp; that's the fact that you can sort a restaurant's menu by calories or fat, or any of the other 5 or so ways they have listed. The only time I eat at any of these places is if I'm with someone else who really wants to eat there. So, if you're like me, this might be useful if you're looking to find the least fattening thing on the menu to eat. Regardless, it won't add up menu items for you, so you're going to be adding it up on your own if you want to know how much your whole meal is worth. This would be especially tedious if you were getting a salad, for example, as the dressing, croutons, etc. are listed separately &amp; would have to be added up separately.  Add the fact that they don't usually have all sizes listed, &amp; this app just becomes basically useless.It's a pain sifting though their lists no matter how you sort them. Not all restaurants are listed. When you find your restaurant, not all items or sizes are included. You can't add up menu items. The list could go on &amp; on. Plain &amp; simple this app sucks. They should be ashamed to charge people for this thing, &amp; I'm almost positive you could find a free one that's much more complete &amp; user friendly. For free it's an incomplete list I still won't waste my phone memory on. If it's a work in progress, then give it for free or don't release it until it's done.Restaurants have dietary info available that you can ask to see, or you can get online &amp; see it. Either way, you'll get a better list than this app gives you. Or, do yourself a favor &amp; don't eat fast food. Once you get used to eating healthy, you don't need a list or a calorie counter to help.
permissions needed for a simple dice game?  I don't like how the advertising is located conveniently too close to the &quot;roll&quot; bar, the dice (as you try to highlight them), and the options tab at the bottom of the screen.  I have accidentally hit the ad countless times and had to back out numerous. times in the middle of a game.  (KFire)  I also dislike that extra 5 of a kind cannot be counted as a score for a full house.iI give it 2 stars because the actual gameplay is pretty quick.Going to uninstall to see if I can't find one I like better,  or at least one that doesn't have gameplay functions literally on top of ad links.  I got a FAR better Yahtzi game on a CD out of a cereal box!
I like a game with more interaction.  As for being a free game it was just okay.  It was a boring game.
This program consists of about six single-screen puzzles, each with a few variations.  After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat.  As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the "next" puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed.  A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side, this app is "solid" (no bugs and with a finished appearance).  It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run.  (Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version.)  Finally, it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary, it is good for at least one fairly short sitting.
Even dough I'm a kid I'm not giving it 1 star I say 5 but it cost 2 dollers so i say 3 but not so much stuff so now its 1 but its good for learning(baby's)so its 2 :)-
Cute idea- downloaded for my 3 and /or 5 year old - thing is...there is no variety so they become bored very quickly. There are different activities, yes, simple puzzle, colors,  letters and a few more - however you cannot pick what you want to play as they are randomly set up and delivered in groups of 5-6 games or so per round of play -after each round you get a little sticker to place on a board - stickers are cute and fun idea - however they are not saved (no option)  and you start with blank board each time you begin play --would have been better if u could keep the stickers in a little album or something. - After about 5 rounds of playing I noticed games were repeating,  after about 10 rounds my daughter noticed - just not enough variety or options for a paid app - or an app for kiddos with minimal attention spans!!! I use on Kindle Fire and as with other reviews I read I do not have to be connected to Wifi to play- can play in car, on the go no prob.
A friend of mine downloaded this app for his smart phone, so I thought I'd try it. Not as fun as it looked.
I do not really get the point. I sat there and nothing happened. if it was better designed it might be better.
It is very scary to find out that ghosts are around you but this app does not work and it does not detect anything. Atleast in my house it didn't.
its cool but honestly I think that it is stupid. It's one of those games you have to be drop dead bored to want to playinteresting..... but, stupid
Its okay sometimes its interesting but most time doesn't do anything to raise a eyebrow..every once in awhile you will pick something up but only entertaining when shows words not just the dots!
This game is no fun it is all fake. No fun at all. Says the same words over and over again. The real one is true talking one
What a stupid game. My kid seems to like it but it has ended up prompting her to ask me all sorts of unaswerable questions about death so that's great. The part where it spews gibberish is pretty annoying especially. What does this mean mum? Nothing love, nothing. Argh.
what does the yellow meek what does the red meek I do not get it cool app thow the app is pritty cool for me I do mot get it at all
Ads are just annoying and there really should be another way for advertisers to reach us - just not on the app itself. That having been said, go download one of the other versions of this app. It's a lot of fun to prove or disprove your results. Just let the ghosts explain themselves; don't read into what's happening. Enjoy!
I thought this would be a fun app for my grandchildren but it is actually so boring you'd have to be a ghost to have any patience with it.  Sometimes nothing happens for a very long time and then an arrow points to the supposed location of a ghost.  Uninstalled.
this app is really really really weird. is it supposed to be real or for phranks? it blurts out stuff like &quot;Italy&quot; and &quot;shoelace&quot; and &quot;coming&quot; and its just really weird. I just don't get it.
WE ALL KNOW THIS DOSEN'T REALLY WORK DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. IT WILL JUST TELL LIES.DON'T GET IT MOSTLY IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE FIRE.
im confused on this wierd app. it says things and tries to scare u. nothing happened so far that it said. its just, not the best app...at all. it is alittle....alot....creepy
what a perfect app for Samhain and All Hallows!my 1st grader is having a blast finding "ghosts"I only wish they would stop restarting the app even when I FC it... i dont wanna hafta get physical. (I ain't afraid of no ghost, mmkay?)It found "energy" in my wifes altar, I just thought that was chuckle worthy
Downloaded this application as the free app of the day from the Amazon android marketplace, and have not touched it since.
I can't believe a simple app in a device like a smartphone is capable of doing all that the app claims. Now that i've 86ed it off my phone, how do I get it off my Amazon d/l queue?
This is not very Interesting Especially when the sound detector say the same words , there is no special thing about this glad it was free
This is a toy program not intended to find actual ghosts. I played with it for a bit then found it quite boring. I have uninstalled it but I might fiddle with it again in the future. I am using this on a Motorola Xoom tablet & it never crashed or caused any other problems.
its a toy, not too useful. I deleted it since it took up room on my phone and I didnt find it useful.
This app was cute/silly as a Halloween joke/toy, but I can't believe anyone would believe in what is 'says' or that anyone would pay for it [I got it as Amazon's Free App Of The Day]. Every few seconds it 'says' random words, and keeps a list of them, which you're supposed to believe are being said by ghosts/spirits. While I believe in ghosts, I don't believe in this app. It was fun for about 10-15 minutes before I uninstalled it.
Very corny joke of an app. No I did not think it was a real one, I was board when I downloaded it but very quickly uninstalled it because it bored me so much.
When I first downloaded this app it was great! It was fun to play around with and enjoy even with my friends. But once you guys updated it everything went wrong! I had to uninstall it
why developr, why for a simple game not give the option of App2SD? It should be an Amazon requierment, not worth the memory space, uninstalling
u need a huge sense of humor to play this with this app.I will be listening to music and then it will either do a slow beet or says words when I'm not even on the app.
I tried it, but did not like the lack of action.  I know it is fake, so why not make it fun fake?
I got this as the free app of the day from Amazon today.  I am glad I didn't pay any real money for this as this is like a "Rick Roll" type app which doesn't really do anything productive.  It was obviously meant to promote Sean Austin's music career.This app would be useful to people who want ideas to start their own music careers by picking a strange catchy name for your developer name and disguising it as something else such as a party gag type app.I agree with the many other reviewers that the reviews for this app are rather funny and entertaining.  Therefore, I am giving it 2 stars just because it gets people wanting to discuss their app purchases on Amazon.
When I did manage to get a word or two accepted, the game was over, and an ad would pop up for another app, and then I had to accept or push another "button" to go back to the game. The game seems to be enjoyable, but nothing would happen when I tried to select a letter. I tapped; I tried sliding the letter; I just pushed on the letter. It worked about 10% of the time.I tried the app twice. However, it was much more trouble than it was worth and I deleted it from my Kindle Fire...twice.
Not all that impressed and I am a big fan of word games. Needs something more to keep my attention. Maybe other word game fans will like the style because I didn't.
I Just Download Bloomberg and now I need to see is work. But also is just the website. Onlyif only I have item. To Download Everything I Don't.
Bloomberg was one of the most-used apps on my iPhone so I was excited to see that it was available for Kindle Fire too.  Alas, the font size is so small that it's hard to read comfortably.  So I rarely even use it.  Looking for an alternative that works on all my devices.
I was looking forward to this app on my Galaxy Tab, but the UI is very poor. I expected more. I hope Bloomberg fixes this soon, as this app has a lot of potential. It's not good for tablets yet.
Haven't found this to be any more useful than what came on my phone.  But try it, maybe you'll like it.
WASTE OF TIME MOST OF US ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THESE IN  THE FORM OF BARS ON OUR ELECTRONICS
I didn't care for this app. I got it thinking it would help me out and possibly save me battery. Nope.
I read the online help & everything.  Honestly, this app did nothing for me.  I saw some pretty graphs but that was it.  I saw that my signal is the strongest.  If that is what this app is form fine but other reviews made this out to be a way to boost your signal & I never saw anything like that.  Like I said, I saw some graphs & my signal is strongest.  Not worth my time to download this, even with it taking less than 10 seconds.
The idea behind this app is a good idea however the excusion was not well carried out. First of all you have to actually have to connected to a wireless connection to get the analyzer to work. Then this app constantly crqashed so it wasn't really working when I needed the app to work.
works but the info is not really what I was looking for. the program was not for me maybe for you try it.
It was working great until I received the update, then it stopped working. Even after uninstall/reinstall it still will not work now. I don't know what the update was supposed to do, but why mess up a good thing anyway? Lastly, this happened on a Kindle Fire.
I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire as the FAOTD - I tried playing, but couldn't get it work - couldn't find instructions for HOW to play other than a general description. I  The graphics are very nice, but apparently the controls are not. Uninstalled after getting too frustrated with the game.
This was kind of stupid.  I didn't really enjoy it much.  Deleted the game after about 2-3 days of playing it.
Welcome to 2112!  Amazon's resident idiot boldly goes where he has often been before...  Today's post was one of your greatest.  Look forward to these little gems of wit each morning.  Have a great new year.  Oh, I almost forgot--this is a game review site.  Well, Dragon Fire is worth what I paid for it. today--free.  Rather uninspired.  But thanks, anyway, to Amazon for your daily treats!
I don't really see what is fun about this game.  It is not complicated or anything, its just boring.  Honestly don't bother with this app, there are way better ones that are way more fun.
The app ran fine on my EVO 3D. I just found it a little boring and not really my kind of game. You just guide colored balls to their destinations like it says in the description.Now that I have that out of the way. I hate Amazon Appstore. Amazon Appstore is dumb. I hope it gets abducted by aliens.
its horrible. once I turend the game on I wanted to uninstall strait away. trust me, its a waist of time.
This game had great graphics and music, but it bored me a little bit. I thought it was cool at first, but after playing a few times, the novelty wore off. I deleted it after about a week. I didn't play it that much.If this is your thing, try it out. This is only my opinion.
PROS: The graphics are stunning, especially the shadowing.  You are able to create whatever moon phase you like.  The accompanying data is interesting for anyone who might need it.  The ability to use this as live wallpaper is a nice touch.CONS: As live wallpaper, the changes are (obviously) gradual.  For all the memory and CPU live wallpaper consumes, it would be nice to see something happening.  Despite all the PROS, this is not an app I think anyone would use every day, or even very often, and probably wouldn't be left on one's phone/tablet for very long.  Of course, as previously mentioned, the app asks for far too many permissions for what it does.BOTTOM LINE: This app falls into my category of "very cool / not useful".  What it does, it does well; however, what it does isn't useful enough to me to warrant a permanent place on my phone or tablet.  I installed it, played with it for 20 minutes, got bored, and uninstalled it.Nevertheless, kudos to the developer for putting together a nice app.  Interested to see what's next.
Kinda cool - but if you have seen it once that is enough - but not that exciting.......rather a waste of space
An impulse download and a huge waste of time.  It was difficult to use and I deleted is soon after.
I feel bad not liking this game because it is well put together and it should be fun. I did not enjoy it. I will chalk it up to personal preference. I am glad I didn't pay for it. I think it was a free app of the day.
I love Hexage games, I have almost all of them, but this one does not follow the pattern. Became boring for me after sme time playing.
After reading the description and reviews I decided to give the game a try. Bad choice! Vague instructions. Graphics are simplistic. Quite honestley, there are much better games available.  Game getting uninstalled right after finishing this review.
Good download and install on my kindle fire. I played? seven levels of the game and do not understand it. I do not know if I won or lost. I do not know what the objective of the game is. Uninstalled it.
Not really my kind of game.  installed and played it for a bit but got bored with it so uninstalled.
runs slow, HTC evo, played with just about 5 minutes and deleted.  wish there was better sharing.  not worth space on my phone.  did like the reactions when you touched the screen
This worked great when I first installed it back in Oct on atrix2...then it updated...uninstalled...reinstalled just the other day and nothing will load :((
I know it's kind of a nitpick but I can't reorder my account list. But it's the little things that stick out like a sore thumb.
I thought this was going to be the ideal solution for me with facebook, facebook page, and twitter. Unfortunately it wouldn't authorize me with twitter. I tried relaunching, restarting my phone, and reinstalling. The app wouldn't recognize that it was autherized. Since I needed an aio solution and this wasn't it, removed.
I got this for my Mother to play on my kindle...not what she was used to and I don't play this. I give it 2 stars because I did try but didn't like it.
Like everyone has said before me, the graphics are AMAZING on my Motorola Xoom. However, as soon as you start to get into the game, it's over.If you like Professor Layton's on Nintendo DS then you would like this game. I guess it reminded me so much of Layton that I was expecting it to be longer.This is just a taste of an actual game, like maybe an inning of a baseball game. Not even an inning. Just one side up to bat.If this was longer, I'd give it 5/5. But I would expect to only devote an hour or less to play the whole game. Just as long as you realize that, you won't be disappointed.
at first it was fun but then it got kind of boring. I didn't really like the game. it should be free!  :(
I was really looking forward to playing this based on the screenshots. Unfortunately, I solved it in about 20 minutes. Ending was abrupt and disappointing. Felt like a demo / teaser rather than a paid game. What a shame.
So short it wasn't even worth the 49&cent;I paid for it. Wish I could get my $$$ back. You can play short games like this online for free.
this game needs a help buttom, to at least help in the aero you are in on the game, i have gotten half way thru and for the life of me i can not get any far on the game,
Glad I got it free. It gives no instructions so you are left guessing the whole game on how to play or what to do next. Plus extremely short game from beginning to end.
While it looks great and has a nice interface, the puzzles were all VERY obvious. You get an item or read a message, go to another part of the house and use it on the very obvious object, receive another item or message, repeat. No challenge whatsoever. I finished the game in under an hour and there is nothing to entice you to play it again.The developer should be ashamed. This is worth MAYBE $0.99, if that. Do not buy.
Cannot play this game.  Get the following error and force-close as soon as it launches:"Sorry! The application Grisly Manor (process.com.firemaplegames.games.thesecretofgrislymanor) has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again."  Now I know the Android 3.0 Honeycomb in my Xoom wi-fi is really buggy, but still I would expect the developers of this title to have tested it this more thoroughly.
love the game style. it was a fun little thing, however the shortness and over simplicity of the puzzles made me feel like i played a demo. i am by no means downing the dev, in fact i wish to ask for more. you could even say i challenge the dev to make something bigger and more in depth. great concept, fun game, but pleeeeeeeeeeeease make a new better longer game.
the game is super fun and addictive. its way to short though. I finished it in an hour. I keep waiting on an update but it wont come.
Really? That was the end? I'm flummoxed. What was the point of figuring out those little puzzles if it is going to end so abruptly and accomplish nothing? Also a friend of mine downloaded the same game on her iphone at the same time &amp; we played together...there were important pieces missing from the Android version. Not worth the money...even though I downloaded this on a free day.
Fun game so far. Haven't solved globe yet. Bug at the stairs that teleports you to the truck in the attic when you touch the key hole.Force closed when I put phone to sleep during gameplay. Tried to continue playing and that's when it force closed.Samsung Fascinate 2.2 (yay!)
Let me start off with I only paid .99 cents for this app and it played very well on my kindle fire hd and that is why it got 2 stars.  The game itself is very short which I would have been fine with for a dollar but add that to the fact that there was no hint button and no instructions to any of the games and the clues where very  obscure and where not at all clear which puzzle they went to, and then the ending was just weird.  Anyway I don't recommend this game at all.
Ah well, the reviews said that this game is short. That is an understatement. I've had sneezes take longer than this game. You find a few things, put them together and before your Kindle warms up you are done. No puzzles, no mini games, no story. VERY boring. Don't waste your time or money. Take the 99 cents, put a penny with it and get a hamburger from MCd's. At least you have something to show for your money.
It was o.k. but I didn't like the fact that it had no hints or explanation to help you and it was way too short!  It should be a free game.  It only lasted about one hour!  The Lost City was so much better by this company.
A fun little puzzle game, but the whole game takes just a couple of hours to complete. The low rating is because it is so short and because it's no fun to go back and replay (you already know all of the answers to the various puzzles/problems),
took five tries to open. finally start to get into  it and now wont open again. liked what i saw. gotta fix force close issue.
I just didn't like this game. Ran well on my Samsung Galaxy Tab and Vibrant. You owners of weak phones... GET BETTER PHONES!  Game is boring and too short. Glad I got it for free or I'd been mad if I paid for this product. Good try devs but meh from my POV. Sorry. Oh, and look... Damazon brought the word count down to 20. Smh. One word for this game... NO.
I really enjoy these types of games, but I'm sadly disappointed!! :-( It's incredibly short! I was expecting, since it costs a dollar, that it would be more challenging and Much longer than the free games like this. I finished it in around 45 minutes, which is fast. It was Not worth my money... Disappointed...
would not install to LG Ally 2.2.1.  must be a great app but for now it isnt good enough for the low end androidswill update review later from the kindle fire
I had to uninstall this because it caused problems with other software on my computer.  Other programs wouldn't work right and when I uninstalled it, they began working correctly again.  So although it worked, I can't use it on my computer.
I love the Cloud Drive and Cloud Player. Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which took almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage.
There are many other MP3 players on the market that are much more stable and reliable than Amazon's.  It's a shame Amazon can't get this more stable as my family only purchases music from Amazon and it'd be nice if streaming music was a lot more reliable.  As it stands I just download all the MP3s we buy and put them on my SD card.
Works on the Google Nexus 7-2 tablet, Not on the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in &#34;airplane&#34; mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded didn't show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you've already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice:  Boycott until they stop that and fix the app.
Before I even checked out the native apps on my new phone, I went to the Amazon store to download this app (along with others previously purchased).  I never got past the permissions screen- could not believe how intrusive they have made this app!  So I didn't accept the terms, went back and read the reviews.  There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone.  Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app.
Like most of Amazon's apps, this has a nasty tendency to crash at times when you really don't want it to. There are other, free, players online that work far better.
UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.Original Review:No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional.
I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer  service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.Thanks for reading my review.
It's a really cool wallpaper, only the problem is that is slowed my phone right down after a couple days of use. Too but RAM is required and it also uses a lot of the processor and kills the battery
if you like smashing pumpkins and bats ,or have small kids this will be ok.  graphics are good and clear on 4.3 screen . compared to other halloween LWPs for the same price,this one is only worth the free ap of the day price. this dev. had some good things for BB, but has a way to go for android..
It was a bit too cartoonish for my tastes, so I'm glad I got it for free.  It has some cute features but nothing worth 99.
I have no idea why I downloaded this as I have never used it and no longer have it on my device.
App would not work on my Cruz tablet.  Installed but message "stopped unexpectedly" appears each time on trying to open.
I've always had mixed opinions about this service provider, but on my Kindle Fire it's a forced feature I can't remove. Whether it's a premium service or not, I very much resent this kind of heavy-handed marketing. Enough said.
When I bought my KF it came preloaded with the IMDb app. I was excited and was anxious to use it. It didn't take long to completely hate it. In any case, Amazon now says it's not compatible, so my assumption is that the app was upgraded and doesn't work well on KF now. In truth, I wouldn't know because of the reason I stated before; I don't like it, so I don't use it anymore and let me tell you why.* It only displays the abbreviated version of IMDb and is difficult to navigate. I love the Trivia items and it is a pain in the neck to find the link on any given page.* Unlike using the web browser, you cannot search the page for text. When you are perusing a prolific star's list of films or TV, it is very tedious looking for one lone title. Page text search is an absolute must have.* Also it doesn't offer tabbed viewing. I like opening up various pages in separate tabs, so I don't have to constantly hit the back and forward buttons.Really, those are my only complaints but those are all the complaints I need to make me decide to never use it again.There is one more point I wish to make and this is in their favor. One reviewer complained saying that you still have to be connected to the net in order to use it and so found it useless. Yes, you do have to be connected but can you imagine the size of download that would contain all of that information? We're talking hundreds of thousands of pages! If you've ever tried usingiBird Pro 2you'll know right away what I'm talking about.iBird Pro 2has less than 1,000 entries and is an enormous, time consuming, pain in the butt, download. Imagine that a hundred times worse. Yep, that's what you'd get.The point of the app is to make it fast. I will admit that it IS fast. It loads a lot more quickly than the web version. That said, the two complaints I have still trump it's speed.Sorry, IMDb. Your app stinks. Fix those two problems and make sure it's KF compatible and I'll be satisfied.
I used this app daily. Worked great. Then this update happened. Now search button doesn't work at all. That's 99% of my usage! I'm also still trying to learn to navigate it. Not user friendly.
I HAVE DOWNLOADED THIS ON MY TABLET AND I HAVE YET TO SEE WHAT IT IS ABOUT, I DON'T THINK I WILL KEEP IT, I HAVE OTHERS I LIKE SO I MAY DELETE IT
I really liked this app, until it stopped working properly. 15 minutes into playing it, the button for Jumble letters started to press itself repeatedly. The pieces jumbled continuously and it made the app unplayable. I tried on several other occasions to play it again, but the pieces were still jumbling. I'd rate it 4 or 5 stars if it didn't have this problem.
Glad this was free. Was really fun but I finished it in one hour from beginning to end without dying even once. Just a little too easy. Don't even bother with the "expert" mode, it's not hard either. Wouldn't pay 2 dollars for this so thank goodness it was TAOTD.
This was interesting for a little while, but eventually got boring and really was no challenge.  I ended up deleting it from my list of apps.  Since it was a FAOTD it was worth a shot, but I wouldn't pay for this.  There are other word games out there that are much better.
The game is so & so. Actually not very bad, It is dark and The primary object of the game is to make words from the available letters and the longer the word the better is the score. It also seems to be a game with magic spells and they destroy the various creatures living in the dungeon, there are about 25 dungeons. You need to come up with words that can destroy the creatures that live in the dungeons. Some creatures require multiple word solving skills to destroy them so you get the idea what this game is about.There are help screens that explain the rules and controls are simple and works perfectly on kindle fire. Overall it is plain old word game but with a twist wherein you get to kill creatures by solving word puzzles.The game needs full internet access but can be played by turning off WiFi. The price is little on the higher side, wished it would be just 99c like most of the apps. But, if you love dark dungeons and want to solve word puzzles and the same time the price of $1.99 seems justified.
It was a fun game for the first little bit, but don't know how a person is suppose to ever win.Very hard. I gave up.
Interesting program but unusable on the handset listed. Constant lockups and would hang up even on startup so virtually useless. Droid X2.
So the only time I ever use this app is if a friend is talking about an item they can't find. I always pull out my phone and see if Amazon has it and then tell them to get it on Amazon. I have made a couple of one click purchases on it in an emergency but otherwise I never use this.I pull Amazon up on my browser because this app really only has 2 functions: search for items, one-click. I can't view my orders, my account, track packages, or anything like that.I would just like to have more options that what is provided. Also, the layout is very difficult to navigate. I mean, if you are a loyal Amazon fan like me I'd download it just to have it but don't expect to use it much.99% of the time I just pull Amazon up on my phones browser since the app is so useless.
Without the filters and sort tools, this app means having to scroll to find items. Seems to lack the sophistication I've come to expect from Amazon. I hope this app will be refined or replaced soon.
I like the web versions of the store and of webpages not the app version of this. Maybe I am cut from a different cloth, but that is just what one brother likes. Nothing bad about the the app per se, I just do not enjoy the experience it provides.
This app works well on the Kindle but on the Android I cannot find books to download.  No matter what I try the books (one in particular) that I can find on my Kindle do not appear on the Android.  This is very discouraging.  The only plus is I can download almost any game that I don't want or need.  Please correct this matter or let me know what I am doing wrong.
This program, like the Amazon Appstore app, continually crashes. I've had to force the program to stop and restart countless times. Now, Amazon thinks I have several hundred Android devices. And, because of that, I try to avoid using these apps if I can, although the Appstore app is required for several games to operate properly.
Well I live in a small town and I thought it was just nothing going on.  Because if I put in Detroit Michigan seems alot happening.  But then I got another program on my Ipad and there is lots going on in my town.  So won't be using this one on the kindle no more.  Hubby might though on his since he don't have another option and it is free.
it is just not as fun as knocking the board if you win or lose the game and jumping and kinging is just not as fun with the cyber version.
Its just one of those games that you play for one day then get bord of it. It would be more interesting if u could play against real people. The freaking computer always wins! /:
DID NOT CARE FOR IT BECAUSE IT NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY.  SO I DELETED IT........ ...... ... ... .... ... .........
It was a free game, the premise and graphics looked cool, but it ended up being nothing special. I deleted it in less than an hour because it was really that not special. From what I can remember, it's in the same vein as pac-man, and I'd rather just get pac-man than this.
This game presents a clean aesthetic where you control a square that must escape the other &#34;evil&#34; squares trying to catch you.  You get some neat powerups that let you destroy them (like the power pellets in Pac-Man) and there are some other puzzle-type elements.  However, after just a few levels you feel as if the game has run out of ideas and you're stuck just playing more difficult versions of the previous levels.  It also tries to present a &#34;story&#34; with quotes from certain other block characters but it all falls a little flat.
this game could have been fun if the controls were designed better, the directional arrows on the left hand side were uncomfortable and difficult to use in a kindle fire. uninstalled.
I guess this is supposed to be like some kind of Pacman. But I'm having a lot of problems with the controls. Not sure if I don't understand or it's just not responsive. Anyway if you're looking for this game, it's free everyday on Google Play. Seems like that happens with a lot of the free apps of the day from Amazon. I keep forgetting you Kindle people are stuck with the Amazon apps &amp; have no choices
What I hate is that I don't have it and I would love to.  How do I get it?  Please e-mail me at wj112@comcast.net
This app. was extremely boring, It might be OK for a small child who needed to be kept entertained for a short time.
Not a bad game. It isboring though. Download carwash 3D. it is much more fun. all you do is create and pop bubbles.
