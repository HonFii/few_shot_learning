You cant use this unless you have a PAID account. and if you do, it can only go to 3 computers/kindles (whatever). anymore you will exceed your limit. THIS STINKS
why would you want to get a free app and but then have to pay 10 bucks a month to use it?
I love Rhapsody and have it on my home computer.  But this AP wanted me to pay for a second membership for it. I deleted it from my kindle
I didn't like that you could select a version for you daily verse, but the daily reading defaults back to ESV, and you can't change it. I deleted it within a few minutes
didn't like this app at all I dnt receive anything I instantly uninstalled. i expected the best from this App and didn't get it
The towers take forever to move, the instructions are in a very inconvenient place, and the towers can't keep up with the circles. On level one in the easiest setting I got a tower and it couldn't keep up with the circles so the game is basically impossible. Uninstalled right away, not worth the money, DO NOT GET!
This app is about how people fight bubbles of water while flying in air balloons.... ? seriously this app just fails in every direction, the concept of gameplay is unappealing and shamefull, graphics sucks, and did I mention that there's no music? :D am destroying this app to rubble, 1 star for faotd again.... you mad bro? good be mad hahaha
Never been speechless, but this is how this game leaves me unfortunately. Maybe by version 10 it will get better? I hope so.
this game makes no sense!! the instructions are not helpful at all!  i don't know if it is fun if u do it right but this game is annoying!
First, it's great news that this app by Maribou does not contain unnecessary permissions, as did another app of theirs a couple of weeks ago.  However, why this developer keeps cranking out game apps that can't be moved to the external SD card remains a mystery and a concern. Yes, it's only a MB in size, and I can fit this app and a whole team of Clydesdale horses in my phone's internals, but for some folks, this will become an issue during app "spring cleaning," and apps like this will be the first to go.Second, wish I would have known the app has no sounds so I didn't have to spend time fiddling with phone settings, thinking it was my settings.Third, with all the same complaints about the power stations over at Google Market, you would think the developers would rethink the app and take them out.  They don't HAVE to -- it's THEIR game.  But if they want to make it OUR game on our devices and charge for it, they would be wise to just redesign it and give the people what they're begging for!  They should take the complaints about the towers for what they really are:  FREE development strategy advice being handed to them on a silver platter!Fourth, the gameplay.  Sadly, it is indeed laggy as many have reported, and coupled with the frustration of the towers, it's just not providing any fun.  If the towers are necessary to provide the energy, they shouldn't be so expensive.  I'm just not sure lowering their price is going to satisfy those who already have developed a distaste for their existence to begin with and, hence, not be the solution to end the complaints.Maribou may want to to take this app back to the drawing board and make these changes... or not.  Depends on whether they want to stay competitive in at least the tower defense market.  And if their ultimate goal is to have customers download multiple apps they create, then for heaven's sake -- let them go to the SD card to attract some non-rooted customers and those who are vigilant as to what they feel is necessary and important enough to take up precious phone space.
this is not a good game. do not by it. I mean, really. its terrible. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!
definitely not worth it, a great waste of time honestly, I was like wtf when I tried it out, and uninstalled immediately
constantly. froze, not responsive and the instructions on how to play were useless.  a tutorial. would have earned it an extra star.  I got what I paid for on this one.....nothing.  uninstalled
THE STUPID GUNS FIRE ONE TIME NOT A GOOD GAME DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. GRRRRR GRRRRRRR GRRRRRR DONT BUY DONT BUY GUNS FIRE ONE TIME GRRRRR. D:&lt;
not really fun and the graphics are very elementary. I guess if you like candy you might like this game?! I don't know, I deleted it after a few rounds. I wanted to like it but it just got worse and worse....
just like the title says... its like some 14 year old kids first attempt at an app. there is that and the fact that it is a total rip off of bloons which is totally worth buying
For everyone saying the towers only fire once, you need to learn how the game works. One of the first things the game tells you is that you need a power station. That is a poor concept, and without the power station your towers only fire once. The power station &quot;recharges&quot; your towers, but can't handle a lot of them unless you upgrade the station. I gave it a one star for no sound, poor instructions, no real options menu, the use of a &quot;power station&quot; that costs a much as a basic tower and is required, and really for just being a bad game.To the devs, if you are going to force the player to use a power station for the towers either lower the cost or raise the amount of gold players start with.
klunky and a waste of money not even worth the free download..wasn't there just a bubble game that was horrible two days ago???
this does not evev work you start a round and they shoot once then they stop only got to the third wave don't recommend
I was excited to try this game when I saw that it was a tower defense game but, this was a sad disappointment. Even with directions, the game play didn't any make sense.Only one tower can fire one shot. Then that tower is useless. All the while 20 balls fly by it.. I couldnt win one game to save my life...And, that was the EASY mode!The really sad part about this game?  Prior to it being Amazons FAOTD, they were actually charging people $2.99 for this!If I could rate zero stars,  I would....
I don't know if the people who created this app are crazy or just people who want to pressure America.  well to get my point across loud and clear &quot;LOOK AT THE PHOTOS OF THIS APP&quot; and u will relize the Leicester of garbage this app really is.  its not tower defense.  and the name of the game shouldn't be called bubble defense because you are nit defending the enemy Wichita is the bubble.  anything would be a better name than that.  so just by that, u can tell that the game is inexperienced and just by the photographs, u can tell that this game has bad graphics and for all you know, this may not even be a tower defenestration's!!!!!!!
Secretly Transmits all of your contact data over the internet to the developer.  Also secretly transmits you car photo to the dev.  Please report abuse to the Amazon app store to have this app removed and remotely wiped.
I only downloaded it because it was free, but didn't find much usefulness out of it. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone because I think there are other products that work better.
I have tried to use this app several times and it has not once successfully located my car. Totally worthless. The last time it said my car was 42km away when I was standing next to it.
there was a time I really need this app to work, but somehow it said my car was across the world....how? I tryed playoff with it, fixing my gps and still mad me bounce all over.
Just get a flag for your car. I didn't find the GPS to be reliable enough to be useful. Maybe if I was at a sporting event
there is absolute no reason for this application fee or not...not on my phone. Hey dev... I think you need to think about
Definitely not worth it since it only locates the car 60-70% of the time. Sometimes it is spot on but other times it is WAY OFF.Originally installed this on my Optimus S about a year ago but it didn't always find the car, and it was a HUGE battery hog, so I uninstalled it back then.I thought maybe the app has been updated in past year and the problems would be fixed, so I downloaded the newest version and tried it again. Still the same problems. The app is constantly running in the background and seriously drains the battery. It runs in the background even after rebooting the phone, and restarts itself even after being force closed. Obviously the dev doesn't care since it's been just over a year and a lot of people are still complaining about the same things they were 1 year ago.Great idea but poorly executed. Pity, I really hoped the app would have worked right after all this time.
All seemed well when I saved my location but if you do anything after that, it fails miserably. After pulling down the task bar and launched the app I switched back to desktop and turned down the brightness, that&apos;s it. If you do anything with your device, it fails. We tried all kinds of senerios with the same results. \nTo bad, I was really looking forward to using it.
If you live in zip code 50266 don't bother downloading. Apparently we don't exist. Did the spinning "working" icon for about 5 seconds then a blank screen. Did the same whether I was connected through 3G or WiFi. Tried multiple times (obviously) and got the same results. TV Guide works here.
I had this app and loved it. It was a nice simple to use tv guide. They updated it and changed the format a little with some added information. Now I keep getting an error message stating I do not have an internet connection. Well I do have a good connection, everything else works fine. I can even enter the app store and give the updated version a terrible review. Please fix the problem or give us back the previous edition that worked.
Set up was quick and easy but it had the listings in the wrong time zone. I uninstalled it and re-installed it, and it was still incorrect. My cable company is small, and although this app had it listed as a choice, it did not have the correct information for the television show listings.
This was great till they decided to &quot;improve&quot; it.  Now it insists I'm not connected to my wireless.  Can I have the old simple app back?
Do not get this app it is a waste of your time and  effort I am glad it is free.
I ate bad Sushi the other night which lead to doubling over cramps before blasting diarrhea and gas so bad it nearly shattered the porcelain God. That was still better than what happened with this app.  I'd much rather sit on the toilet hoping the hemorrhoids don't explode with so much blood that I bleed to death than leave this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  I'm guessing the developers got beat up by either a girl or a girly man (no offense to my girly man friends).
Installed on Kindle Fire. Font too small and too light to read, no pinch-to-zoom nor settings to change fonts. Probably since I couldn't *read* it, it was hard to figure out how the listings were formatted.  Grids are easier to read when it comes to TV listings, IMHO.Quickly uninstalled it since It seemed like a waste of time for me.  Definitely not for someone who has vision impairment.
When it comes to app reviews, I find it hard to do them.  I am app crazy so I am downloading them from the android market as well as amazon's.  I am always looking for cool new ideas or some cool new gadget.  If I don't like it, it does not stay on my phone.  That being said, I have downloaded this app, but I do not recall why I no longer use it.  So I know it sucked or I would still have it lol.  If its free give it any app a shot.  But if you have to pay for this PASS, PASS, PASS and then PASS again.
this _is a game and it is so wacky i must say hamburger choo choo train ... chugga chuga choo CHOOO! ALL ABOARD!!!!!!!
Controls are super wacky and pretty much do this game in. I couldn&apos;t play properly with the accelerometer, it calibrates while the game loads up so I&apos;m assuming it got f&apos;d up somewhere along the way. No big deal, I changed the settings to use the touchscreen to control the ship. It seemed to work alright at first, but it progressively got worse as the game went on. With all the hassles of trying to simply play the game, I just couldn&apos;t enjoy it.
Decent graphics and game play.Error pops up each time game is launched, and appears to launch three copies.  Error message: There was an error with this application. Please download from the Amazon app store again.After exiting program, the android application launcher force closes and no icons will reappear until the game is installed.
This app I would have definitely rated 5 stars if not for the inability to move it to the SD card or keep an internal score.  This app has almost no permissions, which is GREAT.  So what reason it has to be stationed on the internal storage is a mystery.  It's not a critical utility app that may require it to load on the boot, nor does it contain a widget.... so WHY?  Why ruin an otherwise very decent, low-permissions app with that horrible oversight?  And I'm very happy to not see social networking components like Feint in the app, but is there any good reason not to at least keep internal scoring and add a permission to write to the SD for that purpose?  I'm shaking my head on why this developer wouldn't do these two simple things to make the app more valuable.  The gameplay was great.  I had no problems with boredom and the like.  I don't need to be entertained by little birds perched on wire that fly away when you select a letter.  This app is clearly for adults looking for content rather than primarily "graphic bling."  One other suggestion:  Lose the italics.  Word game people who like to play for extended periods of time of more than 10 minutes will begin to find the italic print irritating and not as easy for the eyes to adjust to.If the italics are removed, internal scoring is added, and it gets moved to the external SD, I'll be back to happily change this rating to a 5-star one.  Til then, I have to chalk its tire and tell it to move along, with a 1-star citation for parking itself on my phone's No Parking Zone.
Ugh. I had always just had the default interface and felt it was fine, but my brother does a lot of customizing with his myTouch 4G, so I thought, &quot;Eh, why not try it out?&quot; Never again will I try to change the home layout. This app is so clunky! I hated every interaction I had with it, and I can't believe anybody would pay $3 for this piece of crap.Do yourself a favor and leave this one alone. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
I have nothing against it. It's only a launcher. I just prefer to use ADW.. It is fairly stable on my phone. But I just don't like the way it works.
removing this application from my phone was my favorite part about it. it runs slowly, isn't intuitive and isn't better than anything you're already used to.I got this app for free, yet I feel cheated.
Couldn't get this app to work
I posted in the chat room a quote from a cable news network and was banned! By unprofessional moderators.I was just reporting the facts without any profanity, yet th chatters not stick yo the topic on hand. They chat about their personal life, etc.
Tried several channels across my state and none were able to connect.  Most were offline.  Th is app was a good idea but I can't get it to work in my area.  Also, this 25 word minimum word review is stupid.
Could not connect to any station, froze solid, forced me to have to reboot 2x to get my phone working again.  G'zone commando Froyo2.2
I didn't like it it didn't work right. I took it off of my kindle right away.Couldn't hear it right.  I like something I can enjoy listing to,  I think you need to improve this app. maybe some day I will get it again, when I am sure it works
battery and usage drain on my cell phone mobile phone.  Thid app scanner radio will drain your battery and scanner radio will use up your allowable mobile phone data usage.
Couldn't find my county didn't have good stations that I even wanted I ended up toke it off my device
most areas i have tried it at does not work at all or eithervery poorly. i would not waste my time with it, i have yet tofind a scanner app that works decently.
I had a hard time finding something for my area and when I did, very static and broken up. Maybe would be fine in a different area.
but to be honest i didnt expect it to because i live in the country, i pick up no stations at all
i never could find any station to play where i live or driving. waste of time. not good for people who do not live in cities!
This app does not work even half of the time and it is very laggy on people talking, you can not even understand them.
will not connect to anything even on wifi no local in city not out n sticks has trains but y listion to them talk
I was unable to access anything on this app.  Maybe I just don't understand how it works, but even for free, I dumped it.
Nothing in California. At least not in Sacramento or the surrounding area. They are supposed to be expanding, but I listened to other areas for fun and found it to be very poor sound quality.
It is useless. I could not get my local police on here. All I got was static and if you don't live in a big city just forget it.
This app can't find a major city that has a lot of listeners inside 5 minutes. Totally a waste of time.
I thought when I got this that I can hear what was going on around my neighborhood but it didn't allow that.
Was expecting something more like one you'd buy at the store think I was expecting to much for free it may work for others but not for me try it for yourself and see how it works out in your area good luck also don't like the idea of being told how many words I have to use in my review of any item
I was so excited to try this out but the only way I could have access to what I wanted, I found I had to pay. So much for free.
This update is horrible.  Every time I come into the kindle app it tells me my account cannot be synced so I have to uninstall and reinstall the app every time. I need kindle for books I have for some of my classes, and between the syncing issues and the storage amount (whats with that!?) This app is definetly worse now that the update has come.
I have a Nabi.Downloaded it to read ebooks.  I was SO excited.  Got going, downloaded samples, got hooked, went to purchase the full book to continue on and.... the books I wanted were suddenly uncompatable with my device.
Got this program as the free ap of the day, but really didn't use it. I wish the Kindle allowed users to access Google play
Why does Amazon need to know what else I am running on my tablet? Intruisive and spyware. Hasen't Amazon learned anything from the Carrier IQ debacle? This is a shame because prior to this most recent update, this was one of my favorite apps,
Now all my books are gone, freezes when I try to download any of them, locks up my device. I have hundreds of books that I can no longer read on either my tablet or my phone. Please fix this issue.
I can't get any of my books to open on this.  I see them, I download them to the device, but no text.  Not happy.
Downloaded this a couple weeks ago. But it keeps showing up saying Kindle stopped, even though I haven't touched it. I think it's interrupting my phone and other things. I'm gonna try uninstall and reinstall. See what happens.
I have been trying to install this app on my Galaxy Tab 2 so I can transfer my book to a single and it will not.  I don't know if the problem is with the Galaxy, I have not been able to get with their customer reps, or with the Kindle app itself.
I updated my kindle last night and now it won't even open! Very upset as I paid for some of those books. Please fix! It worked before I updated. I enjoy the kindle app but recently the updates are so big I had to choose between some other apps to put the update in. Going to delete and re-install. If it doesn't work I'm calling custmer service for my money back on the books I paid for.
I couldn't get this to  work at all on my Android, now I have  for some reason I have something wrong with my device
Why??? Runs horribly now even on a dual core and is literally 10 times larger than a year ago and for what? Please, please stop this and optimize this app!!!! I hate giving it one star but there is no excuse for this. And WHY do you store the book data in the app/system space instead of of user/sdcard storage space? AND when one deletes (archives) a book, why doesn't the app remove it from local storage? Why are these very basic housekeeping functions and storage decisions so poorly implemented? :(
Forcing me to sign in and reload books daily. Amazon saids its a issue with the Galaxy S3 with Jelly Bean, with no idea of a fix. Overseas call center is useless and can't speak enough English to understand.  Very disappointed, I've used app for many years with no issues on many phones.
Don't bother
Don't bother with this app. I wish I could delete it from my purchased app history so I'm not reminded that it was ever on my phone. I should have known better.
the mancala app game was not what i expected because it is small and ineffective. Not worth it at all.
This game, and most games for that matter, don't need access to accounts!  Come on, give me a break.  And I was so looking forward to playing - oh well, I'll recover, but recovery would be hard if I let my tablet's account information become compromised, just for a game.
Downloaded to my RAZR Maxx HD. Seems to work but have other similar apps that are much better. Already uninstalled.
This is a joke compared to Pandora.if I could I would give it no stars.stop trying to be different and just download Pandora.who u got to impress?
An internet radio app doesnt need to run at startup, and &quot;send sticky broadcasts&quot; has been documented by an Android OS developer as something he regrets was made public.Do a Google search on these words to read his comments: regretting sticky broadcast public
This thing plays internet radio stations, not real radio stations. They should say that up front. No use to me, glad it was free.
App and reviews sounded great, esp. for free, but it never worked for me.  I downloaded it twice, uninstalling in between and rebooting phone, and still kept getting the weird 'ball bouncing on hard floor' sound and 'Android Media console died' message no matter what radio station I tried.  I got one to stream for a few seconds but it kept losing the connection and going on and off.  I'm on Verizon 4G with a very strong signal. so it's just an app that won't work for me.
actually &quot;Kay&quot; it in fact says &quot;find your favorite local radio stations&quot;. not sure what description you read. you might want to re-read something before you try to quote it.
I tried using this the other night and it would not work.  All the other apps I have used to watch videos work ok.
this app was ok at first then even when my kindle is turned off it went on when I tried to turn it off it would not work, thus I had no option but to delete it.
Keeps telling me that I need internet access then immediately exits. My 4G LTE connection is FINE. That, plus the stupid permissions mentioned, motivates me to uninstall and enjoy tune in pro, which also allows recording and has multiple timer settings.
1) malicious intent because a sticky broadcast will blow by any other security and be global to the entire system. So they can easily be used for very nefarious reasons. 2) lazy programming. 3) some valid reason for some system level application that you truly truly trust that actually would need such access (I cannot think of a single example of a user level application that would need this level of access).Unexplained sticky intents in a radio app are EXTREMELY suspicious. They are global and they stick around forever. They also blow past all other permissions and security since they are intended to be used at the SYSTEM level only. No radio app ever needs that level of access! Ever ever ever! Sorry, but no way in heck will I install this and I will definitely warn people about it. I did "buy it" as the free app of the day but when I noticed the permissions I did not actually install it and I will not as long as they have these ridiculous permissions embedded in it. Shame on this developer for trying to pull a fast one (or so it seems).In fact, here is a direct quote from a developer of Android itself: " Er... there is NO reason to use sticky broadcasts for communication within your own app. In fact, I'll go farther and say you just should not do this. Sticky broadcasts are GLOBAL to the system. And because of this, performing a sticky broadcast is multiple orders of magnitude slower than just implementing direct calls within your own app (IPC for each receiver to register, IPC to the system to send it, IPC from the system back to your app to deliver it, marshalling and unmarshalling of all the data within the Intent over both IPCs).More than that, there is NO protection on them, so any other application can watch your sticky broadcasts, or even send their own values back to you. (Btw, this is also issue with using any broadcasts within your own app. Broadcasts are really there for cross-application communication. It is just far more efficient and easier to implement these things within an app by having a callback interface.)Now I am really regretting that I made that function public. :/> And of course, if you want out of application notifications, you have > no other option.You do have the option of using a normal broadcast rather than a sticky broadcast. You'll notice that there are basically no sticky broadcasts used by the system, at least that you see in the public APIs. In fact there are some places they are used internally, but even those are slowly going away as we discover security holes with them because there is no way to protect who can receive the broadcast data."If you Google a block of this post you will find the original source Amazon will not allow me to post a link to it. (Update you can find the link to this in Daniel's comment, below! Turns out that links seem to be okay in replies, just not in reviews? At least it wouldn't allow me to do it. No matter, it's there.)
It is a good thing this game is free! I would have asked for my money back if not. Do not waste you time!
such a fake artificial intelligence! levels 1-4 feel relatively legit but the second you play level 5 everything goes wrong! y make computer cheat?!!! From always getting convenient doubles to getting perfect rolls to catch u each time to when you're caught and rolling to get off the center it'll take 3 rolls with only one or two of the rows blocked. Dirty game, plenty of other MUCH better free backgammon apps out there, pass these guys up!
This game never played correctly. I installed it several times and it still would not play on my Toshiba Tablet.
I really like backgammon,but not this.downloaded it,then turned off my WiFi to play.I immediately got an error screen.I checked permissions and it said external storage.then why wouldn't it play?if you have to be on line to play a game as a single player,then that's a red flag.you should be able to play against the computer off line.if you want multiplayer,then go on line if you want to risk your privacy.I won't.
i got this game in hopes that i could finally learn how to play the game but this version was not for that. they do poorly to excecute the rules and the design is just poor. there must be a better version out there. i deleted this one from my fire.
This board is upside down!  It's so annoying. I want to bear off on the bottom right not the top right.  The whole thing is backwards!  I deleted after ONE game.
It is totally slanted in favor of the computer oponent.  I play at the hardest board and doubles are rolled constantly by the computer opponent and I had zero doubles. also on opening roll, the &#34;good&#34; rolls, ie 4/6 3/5 6/5 etc are always ALWAYS given to the computer opponent........no random play of the dice ever, and when you use the doubling cube and it appears that you have a slam dunk at winning, all of a sudden, double after double on the dice shows up when it is the opponents play......really a waste of time, takes the fun out of playing by not having a random dice play,  awful........dont waste time or money,
This is the world's all time leading cheater.  I have been playing backgammon for over 60yrs,  more than 1,000,000 games at least.  Statistics show that if you leave a spire open this app will hit you 90 / percent of the time. If you play this game as much as I do you know the statistical average is around  35 percent.  And wait until you get to a roll off,  count on the machine getting 3-4 doubles. They even have a disclaimer telling you why they are not cheating. This game is no fun.Grampyz
This game is very bad. You just talk to a guy who doesn't understand a word your saying. Plus who cant even see anything. Do not get this app.
absolute rubbish. game loads then won't let you enter text. audio input doesn't work either. and that was just the opening screen asking if you want instructions. hello? this is a text-type game! shame the developer couldn't even get something like this rite. i prolly won't try any other games from them seeing how they completely crashed and burned on this which is literally pc gaming 101.
if you just want to feel guilty about what youre eating, this app is great. however, if you want to know the actual caloric content of what youre eating, this app is a waste. it lacks many selections and key features, and the data that it does have doesnt even jive with the internet
If this app were free, I'd probably give it 3, maybe 4 stars if it supported Android 3.0.  For $3?  It's lucky to get even 1.They seem to have left out a number of places, like IHOP (they have Denny's, though), Taco Johns, Papa Murphy's and Golden Corral (though they have Old Country Buffet).It also just displays nutritional info, but it lacks the ability to put together a whole meal and get a total of all those numbers.There are free apps that do a much better job of calorie counting than this one.
The developers think this is worth $2.99?  Really? There's no saturated fat listing, items can't be combined to make a meal, and the Chipotle section doles out the info piece by piece. So you have to check the salsa, then the steak, then the cheese... and add it all up in your head.  Uninstall.
I expected a lot more. Not sure if thats because other calorie counting apps have set the bar so high, or because this one is just that bad. The list of restaurants is extremely short. The app doesn't look like anything special, considering the dev's want money for it. It lacks so many features, features that every other app of this category have. There should be some sense of customizing meals. Even if they didn't go above and beyond, selecting 1 standard size for each item is ridiculous. Some of these fast food sites even let you build your meal and see the totals. Honestly, this is a poor excuse for a calorie counting app. Don't waste your time.Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)
Everyone else is right - this app is pretty bad. Almost every single one of these restaurants already has this information on their web sites, and most of those allow you to build a meal so that you can actually COUNT calories.This app is also sorely lacking in food and restaurants. The Arby's Angus Three Cheese and Bacon is missing, and I've been seeing commercials for that for several weeks now. Plus the restaurant Zaxby's isn't listed at all.Honestly this would be tolerable were this a free app, it really wouldn't be worth. 99, but frankly for the dev to charge 3 bucks for this is just downright insulting.
PARENTS BEWARE THIS GAME IS STUPID DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUPID APP ALL YOU  DO IS PARK AND PARK AND IT WILL GET BORING AND YOU WILL OFFICIALLY  HATE IT DO NOT GET THIS APP!!
color good. graphics move smoothly but it does not work on my Samsung Instinct 2.2 android OS.  i have a small screen.  maybe this game is made for bigger newer phones 2.3 android maybe
I know the description says "not compatible with Droid", but one reviewer said it ran fine on his Droid Bionic, so I figured I'd try.  Big mistake - the app ran really slow, then even slower, then hung the phone completely. The only recourse at that point was too pull the battery and restart.  Some may think one star is unfair, given that the app is merely (not) performing as advertised, but there's really no excuse for this kind of behavior on one of the most popular Android platforms.
These permissions are absolutely above and beyond what is required.  There is no reason why a simple game application needs to read the state of my phone, and CERTAINLY not the id of my calls.  Stay far away!
This app has a problem. The permissions in the Amazon store version include read and write access, opening network slots, and accessing information about networks. The same app in the Google Market version also asks for information about phone calls, and accesses your phone ID. This is the *same* app with less permissions - why? Obviously the developer was worried that the app wouldn't pass Amazon's reviewers, since it looks like the developer really wants your phone info (why? To sell, would be my guess). So you download this app and soon after you are alerted that there is an update. Of course, the update might be a great way to revert the app to the original permissions that were specified in the Market version.Guess what happens when you update the app.
Permissions are way too much to ask for to play a traffic puzzle game. Growing very tired of excessive invasion of privacy esp. for stuff like puzzles and games. Bad enough you have to give permission to important apps and utilities. No longer will I download any apps asking for the same types of permissions using excuses like feint and leader boards, bug reports, e-mail, all of it. Just a poor excuse to have access to data of value to sell & make up for lack of people buying the apps. Every single dev says they dont use the data they can access or make it available to data miner companies. So who is responsible for all the massive data stealing through apps? Nobody, so it must be the Spyware Fairy.
To those concerned about downloading apps and becoming victims of data mining businesses, I've listed what this developer was asking for on Market vs. the "dog and pony show version" you're now downloading on Amazon (THAT WILL SURELY BE UPDATED sometime after FAOTD when the developer feels you've already trusted his app, are not paying close attention, and are "simply updating" for some other minor bug fix).Permisssions the developer submitted in his AMAZON FAOTD version:(the version you are considering downloading... for NOW)* Read only access to phone state.* Write to external storage.* Open network sockets.* Access information about Wi-Fi networks.* Access the vibration feature.* Access information about networks.The STANDARD permissions the developer currently asks for in his MARKET version:(NOTE: for both PAID & FREE Market versions identical, and only FREE version has "ads")* Network communication - full Internet access - Allows an application to create network sockets.* Phone calls - read phone state and identity - Allows the application to access the phone features of thedevice. An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone, whether a call is active, the number that call is conncted to and the like.* Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage. Allows an application to write to the SD card.* Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator.* Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks.* view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi. (network comm.)Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a "car version" of the Block Me game, especially the Market's PAID version.  The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions, so in the paid version, you're paying for "more game" and not "less/no ads."  The developer clearly doesn't care about giving you more "game" for the money, because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon.  He knows asking for your phone's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call, and who called you, are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining.  So he takes it out.... but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful "leaderboard action" and "rate this app" and "notify me of bugs" stuff, as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they don't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app, what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD, what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to (even WITHOUT the phone serial number request), why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one (for now), and what he'll likely do to update YOUR app once he's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back, just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here, for instance the "paid" version of Bubble Popper.  The permission for the phone is IN there, even in that PAID version.P.S.  Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why, especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia. Why they can't get or don't want an English-speaking American to look it over first before marketing to America makes me cock my eyebrow in a BIG way.
This is a great game.  It is a real mind twister and a lot of fun to play.  Each level is not easy and there are 480 puzzles to play and each one gets harder.  I played for over an hour and I really thought this game concept was unique and fun to play. It reminds me of being trapped in Manhattan in grid lock and trying to get to the airport to catch a flight.Based on game play it is a 5 star rating, based on violating my privacy is should be a Zero star rating!Now the bad part, why does a simple game app need access to my Kindle Fire data?  Here are the permissions that it asks for access to:* Storage (OK)* Network Communication (not OK)* Kindle calls for Kindle state and Identity (not OK)* View network state (not OK)* View WIFI state (not OK)* Hardware controls to control vibrator (OK)There is no good reason why any app needs my Kindle state and ID.  This is another app that either collects the data for themselves or for the tooling software company who developed the app development software.Such programs are under investigation now by 35 State Attorneys General who are asking the five major app selling distributors (Including Amazon) to require the app developers to disclose their privacy policies before their services are installed on a device.  At question is the ability to pull sensitive information from your device and use it themselves or resell it to other companies.Most app developers have not even drawn up privacy policies as they believe that they are outside of a 7 year old law governing online privacy.  Such apps can drill into your address books and other personal files on smart phones and tablets.  The states feel that most people rightfully do not want that to happen and don't even know that it is going on inside of their device.The Federal Trade Commission has released a study that indicates that the app makers are collecting data even about children and violating federal laws.The answer is not a 10 page publication regarding the app makers privacy policy, the answer is simply, "DO NOT COLLECT MY PRIVATE DATA FOR ANY REASON!"  Writing a privacy policy may make some app makers think twice about misusing data but how will that protect the consumer when the app developer is overseas and out of reach of the federal and state laws and jurisdictions?For the above mentioned reasons I give this app 1 star as that is the lowest I can go.  Please stop putting data collection software onto my personal and private devices!
constant misspellings within the app are a red flag (for me) and this title has plenty... also, too many permissions needed to run a simple game.
just copy the example of this developer.. copy a popular game style then offer it for free.... how else does this developer make any money?  gee thanks amaz.... if u need a puzzle game so bad get infecct. but if u want to save a buck n get phone jammed up w puzzly mcspy app  by all means
I am growing tired of the applications that ask for more permissions then they need, especially games. That is not acceptable. This must stop.
Not fun
These electronic devices are not toys, so why promote baby games for it.  Give your kids a set of blocks or teach them yourselves.
it said &quot;parents&quot; &quot; birth&quot; &quot;accident&quot;. I am an only child! my mom is not pregers!p.s. I know ,s go in between words, and .s go inside of &quot;s!
Not exactly what I wanted.  Looking for something to have fun with Grandkids.  Just a low tech toy for kids.
OMG! I am so freaked out it said that some ghosts in my OWN HOUSE were saying &quot;blew&quot;. That is so freaky. IS THIS REAL!PLEASE TELL ME.!Oh my goodness.
at first I was begging my dad for this app and when he finnally said yes I got it and it didn't even tell me which way to go to get it it ducks I hare it I cant beleive I wasted my time on this app
Doesn't tell you how it works.  I only bought it because it was free, wouldn't have paid for it any other way.There's really no point to it
fun for 1secs but it is stupid says I have 6 ghost at a time 0_o don't get I need words s s s
I do not no wat to beliv. is it good or not I'm going to wat to git it tal.me if it is good plus. my sis mite git it to soooooooo chud. I git it
I fricken don't even believe in ghosts!!! it is weird, creepy,sooooo dumb, and fricken stupid!!! if u got this app u r stupid!!!!  DONT GET IT!!!! JUST DONT!!! TRUST ME NOT THEM!!!!! DONT GET IT!!!!!
I GO TO THE CEMENTARY AND NO GHOSTSEVERYONE KNOWS GHOSTS ARE REALLY IN THE CEMENTARYFAKEST APP EVER DONT BUY IT
I got two words in a two hour time.nothing but two thumbs down. it offer a free upgrade which I didn't do. maybe I should.
I have a kindle fire and it doesn't haves microphone.... it took forever to get &quot;duck&quot; from it and like a minute later my lil bro came in and threw a toy at me. couinsidence... my point is that a kindle.fire doesn't have a microphone and if it doesn't have that it cant pick up anything from a &quot;ghost&quot; I also live in an apartment.... Haha FAKE DONT BUY IT RIP OFF EVEN THOUGH ITS TOTALLY FREE ITS JUST GONNA TAKE YOUR APP SPACE UP DONT GET IT!!!!
it showed where one was i got up it didn't move toward me when i walked toward it and worst part is is this is a prank to scare a 5 year old worthless don't get it save your time and download something else.
it's kind of boring. it just... well... does.... not much. when I first played it, it worked well, and I liked it. now, not so much. it gets really, and I mean really, boring after a while. I deleted it...
I was hoping to get a message from someone but this app gave my a bunch of rubbish-y answers.  I got &quot;circus&quot; &quot; topic&quot; &quot;news&quot; &quot;selection&quot; and &quot;joined&quot;. the last one only made sense because I walked past a locked gate at my neighbor's house. his dog Maggie died a few years ago but no mention of &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;Maggie&quot;.
So, I let it run for 40mins and nothing at all happened. This is a waste of battery and space.Don't bother installing.
the app does not work at all.I really like ever thought it was going to work.don't get the app it does not work at all
This app is stupid, you stare at a circle and then it says some random words. That's all people! Come on, admit it, this app is stupid.
this app scared the crap out of my little sister even though I told her that its bull. I picked up like 5 ghosts. kinda creepy. apparently a ghost was on top of me and in the bathroom.  so whatever.. get it I dnt care.. and btw if a ghost app is free tht means its BULL CRAP. anyway enjoy if u do install this app. (u probably wont enjoy this)  :D
this is such a lame app. I mean really how is it even supposed to work. at school I saw one of my class mates playing with this app and it was stupid because I was thinking it doesn't even work. don't waste your time or space.
Total waste of time!  Sure, I don't expect catching ghosts with it, but I'd expect some entertainment out of it. And with that mindset, I rate this app total crap! Hope I quit the app fast enough that it didn't con the advertiser in the ad banner!
blahity boga blaa I don,t care I wan,t to waste time doing less important stuff but I like it its ok
i know i should be kicked thinking this would work and this is just a game but nothing even showed up not even a word.
it said passage when I got close to a door. it says sell. then it said center! FAKE APP DONT GET IT EVER!!!!!!!
Looks cool with all the lights and such but never tells you what you are seeing, how it is possibly picking things up...just an odd idea for an ereader or a phone.
This is so stupid and such a waste of memory. It doesn't even work (although I figured it probably wouldn't).
Why would such a simple app.need SO many perms?  the description of this app was written in a way some of the perms make sence. DO NOT DOWNLOAD BEFORE READING PERMISIONS!
Can't get the Classic version on the Kindle Fire, instead they want you to pay for the regular version.  Why would i want to buy the full version if i don't even know if it would work?!?!  They should offer this Classic version for free to Kindle Fire people too!!! Disappointed!
Don't ever download an app that needs this much access to your information.  Especially one that doesn't do anything. Please don't be naive!
if you think this is actually going you any type of results. ghosts aren't real, and either its your intelligence.
I am 8 years old and I have phobia.I have phobia with lots of things espesially spirits or ghosts.This app is definately not for me.But my dad likes it though he is not scared of much because he is a police man.
if u r a scaredy cat and cant handle scary stuff don't get it.it is that simple I seriously don't get why people think its fun to be scared I mean like you are worried what's going happen just live your life with a clean diaper Ps I think all you horror movie makers are sick and twisted my friend at school said when she was five she saw  a little&quot;ghost&quot;girl with a jump rope please give me a break people should have better things to do than sit their with a poopy diaper cause you are so scared and you are just sitting there in fear that a &quot;ghost&quot;will be in there
this is a bogus app... a hoax if you will. it's obvious the developers are just accessing your personal information since there is no such thing as ' ghost radar' lol.
This app is useless without a delete button so you can get rid of these pests once and for all...
Maybe I just don't know how to work it, but Ghost Radar Legacy doesn't seem to be all that interesting.
and not useful even as a joke, because it just does meaningless things that are not usable as data. Of course, it's all bogus anyway -- how would a tablet sense ectoplasmic emanations, even if they were real? I was hoping it would be at least interesting and fun, like the "alien scanner" I used to have on my palm pilot years ago, but it's just technobabble.
I didn't like this at all.  My nieces had me downloaded and I found it to be a waste of space on my kindle.
&quot;working on the same principles as traditional paranormal equipment&quot;... so this too is a hoax?uses you phones sensors to read electromagnetic fields?  didn't realize my phone had that sensor.  stop telling bold faced lies to make a quick buck.
Awful app design. Could have at least modeled an accurate radar, instead of blips just appearing randomly before they are &quot;scanned&quot;.
This app is misleading at best, downright deceptive. It doesn't matter whether one is gullible enough to believe in the &quot;paranormal,&quot; it is certain that the hardware of Android devices is not capable of doing what the description claims it can.
Reality is much more interesting and has predictive value. This, not so much. Not worth keeping. Carl Sagan would've had something to say about this.
This app was a total rip off like come on some words?...theres not even any audio to hear the voices you just see the words. I was expecting more from this app but I was let down it doesn't matter it was free so another app uninstalled from my Transformer
What a joke. Not only is this uninteresting, it annoys you with push notifications to alert you to alleged words from the beyond that I'm sure it mines from your personal information. This is not a game, it is an identity thief.
as soon as I turned it on, I pointed it at my uncle Griswald and the words serial killer appeared on the screen.  Right then and there I knew app was a fake . My uncle Grizzly is so mild mannered and wouldn't hurt a fly. I told him how it called him a serial killer and he just laughed and laughed...and laughed..Then he said, be a good nephew and to put the duct tape,rope and hatchet in the trunk of his car because we are going for a little ride. OH BOY, I HOPE WE ARE GOING TO DAIRY QUEEN.
App use:Let the silliness begin! You turn on the app and it scans your surrounding area listening and scanning with radar for the presence of ghostly spirits. It randomly says a word in an electronic voice and saves it in a list. The radar spins and it shows you the presence of spirits nearby.Main screen:* VOX* Radar a series of red, blue and green dots appear and disappear from the screen supposedly indicating the presence of ghosts* Words - captures a list of random words that supposedly were spoken by a ghost.* Stop radar - stops radar from spinning* Settings - adjust sensitivity of the device from low, med, high and advanced.* Advanced - allows you the ability to adjust the sensitivity of your device's sensors. This includes Scan frequency, duplicate detection threshold, display impedance, signal timeout and signal capacitance.What I like:It was free!What I don't like:The waste of time to download this app and looking at the screen. Unless these ghosts are speaking via WIFI my Kindle Fire won't hear them as the Kindle Fire does not have a microphone. Just about the only way the Kindle Fire would convince me that it detected a ghost is if it flew out of my hands and hit me in the head.Summary:This app is a complete time waster and a waste of battery power. If it is an electronic Ouija Board it is slow, boring and useless. In an hour it heard 9 words that absolutely make no sense. They were: motor, this, sugar, safety, whether, frozen, creature, muscle and soap. Unless the spirit drove their car into a frozen lake because of eating too much sugar and was attacked by a creature with a muscle cramp and covered with soap then I don't know what this means?This app is just silliness and not worth the time to download. If you like such things you might enjoy it but I won't waste the batteries on my tablet for this app. The only thing recently appearing and disappearing in my house is this app.Size: this app is 3.29MB on my Kindle Fire.Permissions:System tools - modify global system settings
ghosts are not real people they are just myths. they do not exsist. this app is terrible. I would give it a worse rating if I could
It doesn't detect real sounds or real magnetic fields.  It is just random things to fake like it works.btw, the reviews are hilarious and deserve five stars.  If the app said it was only for fooling people it might get a better rating.  But why reward lies?
don't waste your time on this worthless app. it makes up random things and gives you 9 words every 5 seconds. not worth $.99
as soon as i got to reading this app...my dogs ashs moved...no joking...my shower is dry but dripping water!!!! this app is wwwaaayyy to scary
Makes no sense.  Doesn't even have a guide or user tips to let you know what different things and colors mean.
Downloaded on both my Galaxy S III &amp; my Acer tablet - then set sensitivity to be exactly the same on both devices &amp; ran then side by side. If was truly picking up &quot;paranormal activity &quot; should have detected same phenomenon &amp; words at virtually same time.  One picked up a &quot;ghost&quot; and a word &quot;negative&quot; &amp; absolutely NOTHING on the other - Totally bogus will be deleting BOTH!
the first moment I got this app it it went crazy with nonsense words like Russia, paper, whatever, hats and much more. the app is only good for pranking your friends. I would'nt recommend it if your trying to find real ghosts. just get the equipment if you want go look for real ghosts. to prove my point that this is a fake I went to over 50 houses with this thing over 2 months. every house had ghosts even the ones that were brand new and not on any burial  ground.  whatever. you do don't. waste your money.
Why would this app ever be a pay app?  I don't care if Halloween is next week.  This is just stupid. In other words, why is it the FAotD?
There are people who want to believe something that isn't real. Inevitably there's other people who will take their money and lie to them. Want to believe your dead beloved exists? Someone will gladly tell you she's &quot;out there&quot;, for a price. Want to believe you can speak with her? Someone will gladly tell you they can speak with the dead, for a price. So when someone tells you your phone can detect ghosts, don't be fooled.
At least they could have made the app somewhat entertaining. It spouted off a few meaningless words then stopped. What a waste!
This app is not compatible with new large screen model phones I.e. HTC sensation. It goes into compatibility mode. The developer needs to update the app settings.
Just read the description..&quot;for entertainment purposes only&quot;..That's all you need to know its fake &amp; a sham.  Buy this if you're the type who'd spend 2.99/mos. For Dionnes Psychic Network infomercials
Like super lame. We played with it for about 5 minutes before we decided it was a waste of space on any device. Super glad we did not pay for it.
its stupid and pointless and ghost aren't even reel when you die you go to heaven or hell you cant go around the earth when your dead!!!! this is crape its totally stupid and its not real how would the developer get the app to sense all that stuff its crape lies!!! I mean seriously if your stupid enough to beloved this *omg it works I saw a ghost* -_- really?!...... get a life spud pickles and make something worth our time!!! God loves you :D
nothing bad to say, just wouldn't waste time on this for kindle fire. fire has no gos,camera,or Mike, so it just spins, &amp; says a few random words like elephant gone mirror move. all unrelated it seems.
I don't like this game, it doesn't give me enough time to figure out the words before the letters change, and I am not sure I understand how the game really works.
Did not find this useful.  Was very disappointed.  Found other aps more useful and do not use this at all.
System lockups, crashes and processor overheats. Attempted several times to load and finally lost interest and moved on. May not have been a software issue, but could not function on my handset.
Bloomberg news app isn't Kindle Fire friendly. It works, but can use a serious update. The app itself is clunky and doesn't take advantage of the larger screen than phones.
This app didn't do what it promised it would do, which is analyze my wi-fi. It seems a bit pointless when the wi-fi connection strengths are already shown on your list of available networks.
Not very accurate and very slow
IT doesn't do anything the wifi in my phone doesn't already do.  I don't really see the point of the app.
Very boring, also it won't let me change the direction of the fire once it is in the direction changer. I'm glad I got it for free!
The app worked quickly and all that, but i deleted it after a few minutes because it was to simple for my liking
It's a game. There's no excuse for games not having app 2 sd available. Games are not essential in any way to the performance of my phone. Therefore they can live on the sd card. Uninstalled.
permissions are ridiculous for an app that just shows the moon state and location, there's a moon out tonight that goes strong and there's a girl in my heart,  take me to the moon and let me play amongst the stars.
Got it when it was a free app of the day. I used it for about a week and then forgot about it. Have not used it since.
You can go to a lot of web sites that do this already for free.  my complaint is why anyone would pay for this in the first place.
I got this and then wondered why I got it. I do like star gazing etc. But this was just a needless app there are others out there that have more options.
This was a dissappointment from the beginning, lucky that a quick uninstall fixes every problem as quickly as they can disappoint.
Just didn't see the point.  Maybe I missed something but I uninstalled it.  Not a good time waster for me.
I am sure there are those out there that will love this game.... but I am not one of them... I have already uninstalled it from my Kindle. Every time I make a selection the match I was going after changes... this is fun for some but frustrating for me.
Totally different from what I thought it was.  It is not a terrible game, just terrible for me. It would be a wonderful game for children with minor learning disabilities, since it seems to be more of an educational game than just a game for fun.As I stated previously, not a terrible game, just terrible for me.
The reviews were so good that I had to try this game but after about 5 levels I was tired of listening to the mumbling Totem freak and also still had no idea what the strategy is to win each level. I can't even get where the description of awesome graphics would come from because I only saw a few objects pictured - an owl -like post, a floating totem guy and some bubbles with eyes that you're supposed to somehow &quot;match &quot;.  I uninstalled.
I was bored with this game, and its to difficult after the first level.  I'm all for strategy games, but this is not the one for me!
DroidX Load SLOW.  Camera  button  inoperable. Crashes when open gallery photo. Can't transform even one photo!!! Don't waste your time with this useless app.
Everytime I tried using this app it wanted to spend 15 minutes connecting to some server.  I thought it be a cool 10 minute app but it never actually did work as advertised because the servers took so long I lost patience.
After reading reviews I still wanted to give this app a fair chance. I'm a sucker for zombies. lol I was sorely disappointed. it uses a single zombie face and even then its not that great. vary it up a bit with different faces and sounds. the sample pic that it comes with looks a ton better than the one the app actually made. On top of all of that you (the developer) should probably remove the base picture after the zombie one is made. you move too far to one side or the other and you can clearly see the picture used. It's a good concept, but needs a LOT of work.
