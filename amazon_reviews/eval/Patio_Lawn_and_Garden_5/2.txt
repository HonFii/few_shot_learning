metal too soft, its all wore out after light use, the thread on front already smooth out.lots rust on the back puller/handle part, need something with better material, rather buy once and be done with it for many year.
I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.
I have my old machine from Sear Lure is not reguire it was heavy. Sorry to get rid of it. The new one was not really working right. hardly kill bug.
This pruner does not even remotely cut 1&#34; branches, wet or dry.  Does not cut 3/4&#34; branches.  It may cut SOME 1/2&#34; dry branches but at least the one I received was not sharpened and I was forced to return it.  Have not decided on a new one yet, since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different.
We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it, because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is, the two hand-grips are each curved to the side, giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to "steer" the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands, it was very awkward to "steer" the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since.
I'm not sure how I missed that important point, but I did.  I don't see that clearly mentioned from scott's, either.  This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills.  It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass.  So I'm back to the mower.  One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push.
I hate gas powered tools! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem. Obstacles are a definite problem. The maneuverability is quite limited. With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great! It's great to have a passion and this mower is for you. If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing. This mower is not for you.
Cuts well, etc.; but was missing some Nyloc nuts from the hardware baggie so my dad went to the store to get more.  After assembly it was fine.  But who needs that added hassle?
Couldm't cut my grass very well.  Misses some spots because it just didn't cut it.  if the grass is taller than 2 inches, this is not mower for you.  Need to spend the money and get something that works.
Who is willing to buy a new product that only has a 90 day warranty? That is the typical warranty on used product. If the manufacturer has little faith in their product, then neither do I.
I bought 2 different feeders at the same time and this one is holding up much much better. It is solid and easy to clean. I didn't use the wire that came with the feeder as it was too short. But I threaded a pipe cleaner through the top hole and it works great. The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.EDITING: I am going to have to lower my rating on this. The hummingbird feeder works fine. The issue is the yellow "bee guards." Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow? So if these "bee guards" (dumb name...should be called bee attractors) were any color other than yellow...like RED...then I wouldn't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I can't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.one more issue. I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed. We searched the grass below and found 3 of them. There were no gnaw marks, chew marks, bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers. What removed them? I don't know. But now that they are gone, the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir. Like I said, this nectar feeder is all but useless and the moment I can actually remove it without getting attacked by flying insects, I will and never put it back up again.
This is difficult to clean.
i guess for the price all you can ask is that it works but barely. hose kinks very easy disrupting water flow and leaks where connected to the spicket, but water does get from point a to point b so i cant give it one star.
ridiculous pricing on these new Webers... where once you could get a 22" model for less than $70, the company now charges (and never discounts) upwards of $100 or morehave to agree with other reviewers about:bad quality control -  issues with the the charcoal grate not fitting the four-point resting tongues - sloppily sizedpoor material choices - older models had really nice hardwood handles, but the newer models have the molded plastic crapola handles...loose fit overall - something seems amiss at the factory - models are not assembling with as tight tolerances as in the pastWeber used to be a solid name in the U.S. charcoal grill market - i'm afraid that this reputation is slipping down a steep slope of obscurity if the QC continues to slidei recommend:1. better quality control2. standard hinged grates for all models (you will win big fans)3. better tolerances4. revert to hardwood on handles ('handles' heat better - get it?)btw, i use cheap aluminum round cake pans in the ash catcher - works better than an expensive model upgrade to catch and remove waste charcoal
This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as "starting fluid" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care.
I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months, so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it.
Bought it in May of 2010.  Did not use it from November to April.  That gave it a life span of 7 months before it became uusable. Spend a few dollars more for a one more sturdy.
I guess this might be ok if you had one VERY SMALL area to trim but it is very tedious and time consuming to use to trim multiple areas. I tried it out but decided to return it. Instead I broke down and purchased a cordless string trimmer (18 volt) which I love and does the job much quicker and easier than this thing could ever hope to do. I wanted it to work for me but no way!
Action works well enough, but the blades only cut if you use the very tips.  I expected better from Fiskars because I have several other Fiskars hand tools.
Fiskars badly missed the target on this one.  Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version.
I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly.  I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13:  I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house.  However, I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.  I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks.  They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands.
The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly, BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers.  if you're trimming an outside branch, that's not a problem, but I've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.If you choose to buy these, make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you're going to be muttering to yourself a lot.
I got this for me, but gave it to my wife.  I wanted something heavy-duty for cutting vines, etc. in our wooded area, but these work better for gardening / cutting fresh flowers.  I was looking for something more "beefy", but this seemed a little delicate for my use. My wife does enjoy this very much for her small garden.  It was likely my fault for buying this product for something that it was not intended for; and it does work very well for what it was designed to do.  I liked the rubber tip cover for when you throw it in your pocket.  I do wish that you could hang this up on a peg-board, but there's no opening to do this with, and the blades are heavier than the handle so it would hang tip down.  Instead we have to throw it in the "gardening tool drawer" where it is slightly more difficult to find.UPDATE: after one season of use, my wife has broken these sheers cutting in the vegetable garden.  She admits that the item that was being cut was too big for the sheers, but they should be more durable.
I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy, but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose, the male end just snapped in half. The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap. Yup, it was under normal water pressure but it wasn't like I was using the hose as a tow rope, or pumping benzene through it.I've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years, but never snap in half like that.Next time I'll listen to that little voice.
The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose.  Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year.  This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk.  I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price.  It looks like it will work forever.  Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8" hose.  It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.  If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a quality reel the first time.
I've had this for four years.  It leaked from day one.  Finally took it down to see if I could fix it.  The replacement part from Suncast costs 64 cents but the shipping is $9.50. On a 4 year old item, replacing the part doesn't make sense. Since this hose is right next to my front door, I have to have some sort of reel.  I'll look elsewhere.
I've had this up for a week and it's got one yellow jacket. I notice that some people recommend apple juice, but the instructions say to just add water.I'm very disappointed.I added some sugar today and possibly other ingredients in the future to make this more attractive.Their fly catcher is great, but this one works poorly for St. Louis yellow jackets.
I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case, in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds, they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house, but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service.
This is well made and sturdy but I just don't find myself using it because it's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you're carrying tools as well.  Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store.  It's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I don't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that's more of a chore. It just doesn't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft.
Update and downgrade. I'm downgrading this to two stars because the birds simply don't like it. I've had it up or a long time now and it is surrounded by four other feeders that all do a brisk business. This feeder has the same seed and yet the birds try it once and then ignore it. I'm convinced the seed is simply too difficult to extract and so the bird give up. There are much better feeders on the market and I would start with any feeder from Droll Yankee such asDroll Yankees YF Flipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder. Updated on 1/24/2014.I have a large "feeder station" outside of a picture window in my den and over the years I've tried a lot of feeder designs--some just because I was looking for the best made and best designed feeders and some because I wanted to defeat squirrels. I'm in Connecticut and there are lots of gray squirrels here and they are amazingly clever (and funny) when it comes to getting food from a bird feeder. And they are determined little creatures. I finally found a method to keep squirrels out of my feeders 100% of the time, and I'll get to that at the end of this review. But I'm still willing to try new ideas and it would be fun to find a feeder that solves the squirrel issue all on its own. I'm not sure that this feeder does that, but time will tell.This is a larger feeder than I thought it was going to be-and that's a pleasant surprise.  It also seems pretty well made, but I have some doubts about some of its construction features. Here are some pros & cons:Pros:*The dome on top and the lid look as though they'll keep the food dry from rain or snow entering through the top of the feeder. Wet food can grow mold and that is very dangerous to birds.*As I said it's a large-capacity feeder and  holds three pounds of seed. That's pretty substantial, so I like that feature.*It was simple to assemble, all that  you really have to do is attach the lid at the top of the tube and then put the hanging loop (using a small nut) on the dome. Took less than two minutes to assemble everything. Unlike the Droll Yankee feeders that I use, the perches were already installed and that saves time. On many of the Droll Yankee feeders you have to tap them through holes in the plastic tube and that requires freezing the posts (to shrink them) and that's a pain.*Overall it seems very well made, but with a bird feeder it often takes months and some severe weather to find its flaws--so I'll update this review in a month or so.Cons:*First and foremost, I am not crazy about the way the base tilts down. The idea is that the squirrel will fall off (from its own weight tilting the base) but it appears to me that a squirrel could catch its paw in the feeding station opening if the base starts to tilt after he's on the feeder. I'm not completely sure that that's a possibility, but I was able to get my finger caught (gently) between the moving base and the stationery feeding tray. I certainly don't want to look out and see a squirrel hanging by its paw. Again, the risk may be pretty low, but the way this is designed, the feeding perches are attached to a collar (that has holes through which the birds feed off of an interior tray) and that's what moves. It's easier to understand once you have the feeder in front of you.*Also, I prefer a feeder that has a catch tray underneath to catch the spilled seed. Instead, this tray has openings in the base so that food that falls off of the internal feeding tray falls out through slots in the bottom of the feeder (again, much easier to see when you have the feed in front of you).  The problem with food falling on the ground is that it brings rats and mice. When there is a catch try, the food gets eaten by the birds.*The tube seems a bit too flexible to me. The way that you mount the lid, for example, is to squeeze it a bit and slide in two prongs on the lid (the lid, not the dome, they are two separate things). It seems to me like the prongs could have been a tiny bit longer to keep it attached more securely--and also, every time you grab the tube, you squeeze it and the lid can pop off. Not a major flaw, it's minor, but it's an issue. The Droll Yankee feeders have a lid that slides up and down, you don't have to remove it and it fits very securely. I'm not sure if the plastic tube on a Yankee feeder is thicker or not, they may be exactly the same.You might think that from the cons that I don't like this feeder, but that's not quite true. I am willing to keep it up for a while and see how it works, both in keeping squirrels away and in just feeding the birds. If I don't see squirrels hanging by their paws or find a lot of food on the ground, I'll be satisfied. As I said, I like the capacity and I think overall the feeder is made of quality materials. I just have some issues with design choices that had to be made in order to facilitate that tilting base. I will raise my review to four or five stars if the feeder proves itself. I really want to like this feeder partly because I like the capacity so much.OK, I said that I figured out how to keep squirrels off of your feeders and I have. I went to a bird feeding store and I bought a sort of kit that consists of a pole (plus a simple insert for putting the pole in the ground securely--it works beautifully) and a baffle that goes around the pole. Squirrels can only jump about 4' off the ground maximum--and I can verify that from years of playing with the height of the baffle. So if you place the baffle on the pole at 4' or so and IF there are no nearby trees or fences for them to jump from, they simply can't get up the pole. I have a three-pronged hanger at the top of the feeder and I have three feeders on it: sunflower, suet and thistle. It works: in five years, not a single squirrel has reached the promised land.I don't have this Perky-Pet feeder on that pole though because I want to see if it defeats the squirrels on its own. So I just hung it on a 4' pole (a shepherd's hook) so that the base of the feeder is within the squirrel's jumping range. It's only been out a few days and the squirrels haven't discovered it yet, but they will--and soon. I'll try to keep a video camera handy and I'll post a short video of my experiment if I catch a squirrel in action.I love squirrels, I find them very interesting--but I would much rather just watch birds without that extra havoc. I'll post an update shortly.
Simple assembly (two minutes worth) is required for this feeder.  The tube has two holes in the top into which you insert the  metal prongs on the roof (you cannot see this in the stock photos, as it is covered by the squirrel dome).  I have uploaded a photo of the top. The roof has a 2 inch  opening for seed and a bar across it, so that the baffle part can hook onto it.  To fill you have two choices, remove the top by slightly squeezing the plastic,  the plastic is flexible enough for this, but I am not sure if that is what it was designed for and am afraid that squeezing it may stress it.  Or you can try to pour the seed through the opening, which is not easy because the bar across the top tends to deflect the seed.  I really do not like this, especially because the tube itself tends to move around when you set it down due the spring loaded bottom designed to keep squirrels out.We have Abert squirrels (darling but clever things that look like koalas).  They are acrobatic and determined.  They do not seem to be able to access the feeder after a few days (and they usually do get into them quickly) but it remains to be seen if they will learn.  Birds do not seem to have a problem.This feeder is not worth the current price over seventy dollars.  The metal parts are a lot nicer than most birdfeeders, and the bottom works well but I feel that the design of the top is really lacking.  I am concerned about all the weight on the small prongs that stick out and filling it is a pain. The plastic part is also not much better than my 20 dollar feeder.  Filling it so annoying, that I cannot recommend it at all.  I have a couple of the Perky Pet 102 Squirrel Resistant feeders, (you can get three of those, with some money left over for the price of this one) that have multiple ports (which birds like) and which are MUCH easier to fill.  Squirrels can get a bit of food from them, but they do have to work a bit for it.  Try one of those first if squirrels are a pest.  I am going to use the baffle (which is very nice powder coated metal) for my one of my other Perky Pet feeders.  If the baffle were sold separately, I would buy some more of those.
This mower hit a small rock on its first mission and that enough to break the unit and send it to the dump.
I bought three of these to keep a local skunk out of our lawn before he/she manages to dig out all the grass.The PIR sensors inside the scarecrow barely detect a skunk - it's too low and slow to set it off unless its within a few feet of the sensor. However, the sensors do a great job of picking me up to 20' away. When an object is close, the water won't hit it, even on minimum range settings. What few drops are hitting the skunk, he/she simply shrugs off and keeps digging / eating.This 'scarecrow' works better repelling squirrels since they seem to set it off more easily (hopping through the grass) and because they seem to mind the water more.I like how the sprinkler head can be adjusted for range and scope of rotation (360 degree vs. a smaller sector, etc.). That allows you, within limits, to fine tune the area of coverage. The smaller the area of coverage, the more effective the scarecrow is, since the pest will be hit repeatedly as the stream whisks back and forth in a narrow arc. But that only works for alleys or other narrow confined approaches, not a open field.Another nice feature is how you can daisy-chain these scarecrows. The bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap. They even include sealing rings, so there is no leakage. However, I am not impressed with everything being made of plastic. The thing is fragile, as emphasized in the manual - no pushing, pulling, etc. on anything plastic other than the stake and then only around the garden hose fittings. For example, I accidentally dragged a hose across the top of one unit and the plastic distance dial popped right off.For $50+ I expect better and its claimed efficacy re: skunks is not borne out in my experience.
This looks like a well built sprinkler.  It seems to work for a lot of people, but it did not work for me.  The motion sensing was unreliable even at its most sensitive level.  The squirrels were undeterred and they continue to plague my garden.
Im 6'2" and this thing is tiny. I always have to hunch over. I wish i bought a longer weed eater. Also i wish it was more powerful.
This works pretty well for wasps but is useless for houseflies - either that or I'm just inept.  I couldn't catch the flies to buzz them.  I'm pretty sure they were mocking me as I tried.  For us, this doesn't not replace the old fashioned fly swatter - which I had to go out to the hardware store and buy. This product does seem useful for larger, stinging sorts of insects and might replace chemical bug spray products.
The saw has good and bad qualities...PROS.1. Price is comparable to other brands..2. The height of the pole is adequate..3. Home Depot sells replacement chains...CONS.1. Balance is an issue. It gets pretty heavy balancing an electric saw on a long pole..2. Poor design causes wood debris to quickly accumulate in the gear area. As a result, wood chips need to be removed between uses. Failure to do this will cause the chain to slip off or damage the nylon sprocket that moves the chain..3. Chain guide bends when the chain is tightened. As a result, an accurate cut is almost impossible..4. The tightening screw comes off very easily due to vibration during usage. After losing it, the only way to tighten the chain is to unscrew the two bolts holding the metal chain guide, move it forward, and retighten the two bolts with one hand while maintaining pressure on the other..5. The unit is underpowered. Eight amps is not enough for cutting large branches..6. It is very cheaply made. For example, the chain guide is thin. As a result, it bends to the side. Second, the gears and sprocket are made of plastic or nylon and will wear away in short time. Third, the oil reserve is a small squeeze bottle that is useless. It does not hold enough oil and needs constant refills.
I have had this pole saw for three years and have used the pole attachment once or twice a year for the first two years. During the second year, the trigger mechanism broke and did in the pole section, and the whole thing has been sitting for over a year waiting for me to jury rig up a toggle switch in place of the broken trigger.I am about to get back into this process and that is the reason I was looking up a replacement when the Amazon "you purchased this item in 2007" notice came up(I do like this function from Amazon as it saves me from reordering stuff)Back to the pole saw.I did expect the pole trigger mechanism to last longer than it did and Remington needs to re-visit the design.Added a JPG to product page as you can only add videos to the reviews???????It shows a SPST $4.00 switch installed in the place of the plastic piece of junk that comes with the unit and the trigger hole filled in with silicone to stop stuff from getting in to the area.The saw also leaks most of the oil (chain lube)out when it is sitting, so put something under it.I have to do a lot of this type of thing these days to make products work: See my other reviews.
This is a nice sturdy product but it doesn't work well on my deck railing.  I have a board railing with slats, rather than a thick beam, and the unit just falls off if bumped.  When I move it so it sets against the slat it doesn't lie flat on the top.I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail, but it's not supposed to need that. If you plan to order these, get just one first, and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias.
I bought this simply because of the reputation Havahart has. The other Havahart traps I own, like the 1025, is of top quality and made to last a lifetime. When comparing the two, it's as though they weren't even built by the same company.  This model is simply a joke. The sides are so uneven I had to bend them in so that the doors would close without leaving a gaping escape hole. I also had to bend the hatch bars because they would not fall into the fasteners when the hatch was triggered. I did catch one mouse, but without my straightening of the unit it would not have even been functional. (Note to owners...you really need to read the instructions on how to adjust the sensitivity before you say it doesn't work.) That makes this unit NOT ready to use right out of the box.Other notes...There is no handle so you must be careful how you handle it so you don't get bit by the rodent. The top corners are also razor sharp and you need to be careful not to get stabbed. The corners should have been rounded off for the extra $.10 in cost.It is important to note that all traps must be cleaned with with bleach and then soap after a catch. The urine and feces detracts other animals since they consider the trap "marked". Based on that point, it is also important to know that cleaning this unit is painful as the windows are unfinished and act as a cheese grader on your hands. Once again, a few pennies should have been spent to finish off the rough edgesHavahart's build quality with this model is pretty disgraceful. I wish the company would have thought twice before they permitted this cost-cutting AND let their quality control go down the drain.
I have a couple of the larger Havahart traps and swear by them.  Those are solid, well-built, and foolproof.  This model is exactly the same as their larger 2-door trap, just shrunk down.  Unfortunately, everything fits together very loosely, which makes it tricky to set the trap, and much too easy to trip.  The "U"-shaped bars which lock the doors down have a tendency to fall out.  The long bars attached to the doors, which hook to the trigger, also fit very loosely.  Setting the bars onto the trigger involves taking two cylindrical pieces of metal, about the size and shape of the point of a ball-point pen, and balancing one on top of the other.  This is trickier than it should be, and the slightest jar will trigger the trap.  It helps if you take a large pliers, or set of channel locks, and flatten the ends a bit so they will stay mated better.  A strong wind can set this off, and a storm certainly will, making these unsuitable for outdoor use.  Note also that a man-size hand won't fit inside this trap, so you will have to carefully toss the bait in and hope it lands on the trigger, or keep trying until it does.  There is no handle, so you need to be careful about where you hold a filled trap to avoid getting bit.  You can make these work inside, but be prepared for some aggravation.  Overall a disappointing product.
Not what I expected.  This is to be added in sitting water.  My mistake.  I thought it was a dry type of killer feed.
For every soil sample I tested this powder with, it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5, which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here, good stuff), and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix), 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester.
I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success. I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die. Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer. I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help. I will not buy these again.
I am a Master Gardener, which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours.  We can't teach old wive's tales, just scientifically proven plant info (but some of the old wive's tales have been proven, so they are O.K. :-) ). These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness.  They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants.  I am giving two stars for the novelty factor, but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down
This thing really makes no sense at all.  I was given one of these as a gift, so I used it.  But I also grow tomatoes in a garden every year, so I will use that for my pro/con comparison after using the Topsy Turvy this past summer.Cons:1. Costs more than a whole bunch of seedling tomato plants.2. Needs potting soil which adds to the cost.3. Must water EVERY day or the tomato plant drys out very quickly.4. Doesn't produce nearly as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground (or in a big pot).5. Not reusable as the "bag" became brittle and falls apart after a summer in the sun.Pros:1. Takes up very little space as long as you have a place to hang it (note: it must be a sunny place).2. Seems built well enough not to break easily (at least for one summer's use).3. You don't have to "stake" the plant so the vines don't break.  Hanging upside-down, the vines are fine.4. Plants growing upside-down are interesting to look at.But really, this thing makes no sense.  Why plant something upside-down?  You could plant your tomato plant right-side-up in this thing and you would probably be better off, and you would not be bothered with the extra effort involved in planting it upside-down. In fact, you could buy any decent-sized hanging basket and plant a tomato plant in it and let the vines tumble over the side of the pot and have nearly the same thing.  Or just buy a big pot if you have a place on the ground to put it (but staking the vines would be better then).  But, it doesn't have to be upside down.  The upside-down concept is just a gimmick to get you to buy this thing instead of a regular hanging basket.Since I have this thing and a place to hang it, I would have probably used it again, excepting for the fact that the plastic "bag" becomes brittle and falls apart when you touch it after a season in the sun.  So you won't be able to use this year after year as there is no way it would stay together when handled enough to replant another tomato plant in it.  They should have used a plastic that isn't destroyed by the sun.  So don't buy this thing with the thought that you can use it season after season.Anyway, the kids look at it strange, so at least it is interesting.  But that bit of unusual-ness is its only real value.  If you just want tomatoes and don't care about the upside-down gimmick, there is really no reason to buy this.  Just buy any pot or hanging basket and plant your tomato right-side-up.But it does work, and once you plant your tomato you don't have to stake it up, and it is interesting to some to see a plant growing upside-down, so I give it a rating of two stars even though I find it really is pretty goofy to begin with.  And you are not going to get as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground.  But thinking about it, if I used my own money to buy it (instead of receiving it as a gift), I would only give it one star.  Really, it is a silly thing useful only as a gimmick to grow a tomato plant upside down.  If this is your only choice, buying tomatoes at a farmer's market would probably make more sense.
For starters, there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front, seems intuitive, but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow, but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it, but, so far, we're not doing well.
I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient.  After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping, we just felt that it didn't cut it.  We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them, so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time).  Also, I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes.  The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges.  The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves.  I cannot speak for the weedwacker, as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it.
Clearly of quality construction, but far too expensive given options that are available.  Mine were stolen from my garage, and I replaced them with a two-piece combo purchased at Costco for $19.00.  They come with a life-time replacement guarantee. The $19 item cuts just as well as the Felco and is equally comfortable to hold and use.
The travel settings are very difficult to use and it often sticks.  It also sprays as much water out the side as forward.  The tripod is the only good thing about this sprinkler.
I was disappointed since I thought it would be stronger. I still use metal trowel for digging when durability of a tool is needed.
I am not happy with this trowel because it bends when digging in hard/compacted soil. I suppose if you have sandy loam...you might be good. Not for me.
The Perky Pet 203 CP is difficult to fill and clean since the only opening is the diameter of a soft drink bottle.  Perky Pet makes other models which open on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end.  That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.  This model also lacks and included hook for hanging.I have and far prefer the Perky PetPerky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feederwhich has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.  It comes with a small "S-Hook" for hanging, too.
I used Perky Pet feeders for many years and was always satisfied, however they must have changed their quality control people because the ones they sell now are junk. If you just screw the bottle on to the base snugly, they leak, and if you try to tighten them they twist off and have to be discarded. The flowers and the wasp guards do not stay on after a couple of washings and have to be glued on.
The hummingbirds recognize this feeder right away (better than the saucer kind) but it started leaking after a couple months.  Pretty unreliable.
The only reason I gave this feeder two stars instead of only one is that I like the glass bottle, much nicer than plastic.  Even at that, the glass is hard to clean unless you have an overpriced feeder "mop" or a flexible bottle brush.Despite the advantage of glass over plastic, this feeder is not even useable.  I hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy.  It leaks when the wind blows.  It leaks when the temperature rises.  It leaks just because it feels like leaking.  And that attracts ants, armies of tiny, biting ants.  I've tried filling it to almost the top and I've tried putting just a bit of food in it - doesn't matter, it leaks.Even if that weren't a problem, I still would not like this feeder.  The plastic bottom and the flowers inserted into it are next to impossible to clean.  The flowers have little ridges that cry out to be filled with mold and nasties.  A dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all.  I think the manufacturer is doing the birds a real disservice by selling something that is likely to end up with dirt and mold, and be bad for the birds.So, this product is for the birds.  And very much NOT for the birds, not if you care about them.
The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.But it's flimsier than it looks from the photos. The construction is thin sheet metal, with sharp edges.I don't know why there are so many positive reviews. It's a less effective feeder than cheaper options (i.e., the birds don't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic), and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed. Meanwhile, the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger (which is shown in the photos), or it has a large shaft through the middle, so you can stick it on a pole.The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top, but it's also poorly engineered.
I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby. The birds don't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet.
I have had this unit for seven months, now.  It honestly is just a cheap device, turned out cheaply, to cash in on the solar craze now going on.  I'm all for great-quality solar panels that provide reliable energy.  This unit does not.  Yes, it reads fine on my multimeter, when I check it, but the battery on my RV is not staying charged.  I have gone through two charge controllers, so I have to think that the panel just might be the culprit, here.  I am in a city with almost 90% very sunny days.  This panel gets full, blazing sun, just about daily, for seven hours.  You get what you pay for, and you don't get much, apparently, at the price this unit goes for.  My RV battery performs as it should when it is not hooked up to this unit.  It charges and holds charge when I'm on the road.  Again, it looks like a case of a badly made solar panel.  Spend more for a better unit.
My first reaction to this product is that it is very expensive for a single unit. But if it works better than the others, perhaps it is worth it. I bought 2 units and plugged them into different locations in the house. After two weeks of testing, they have only caught 2 mosquitoes and 1 small unidentified bug. I have seen fruit flies cruise right past them and there is still a pesky fly buzzing around my house who seems to have no interest in the traps.In addition, the UV light is rather cheaply and flimsily inserted into it's holder so it moves around and causes a loud buzzing noise which requires you to readjust the light from time to time. The buzzing noise is loud, you will hear it if you are in the same room. Finally, this unit is missing an on/off switch so the ony way to turn it off is to unplug it from the wall and find a place to put it which is ackward because of the sticky tape which slides out very easily and the fragility of the UV tube and the fact that it is not terribly secure in the socket.I realize a good trap is hard to come by and none of them are perfect, it could be that this unit is one of the better ones on the market but at $34 a pop, it just doesn't strike me as good value for money. At this time, I cannot recommend it.I'm debating if I should give Flowtron a try, the only thing holding me back is that it is not designed for indoor use which is what I require.
I cooked my seeds with this contraption. The heating pad would be infinitely better if it had temperature control. Though all in all I like that all the components were included.
I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product. The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense. If it was that easy, there wouldn't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening. But I don't buy a dedicated germination kit. The standard seeding kits available for $3.00 are fine. I have one I like for the windowsill, not because I love the brand or soil it contains, but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL!! That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly. The cost is ridiculous and, if you really want to heat your seedlings, then put an electric blanket or throw under them. You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket, the seedlings start a bit earlier. And if in a colder area (basement/attic) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear. But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area. If you want a smaller area, fold the blanket. Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70, but your environment may be different. Don't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate, these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money. If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you can't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window, then get a heating blanket and a grow light. Much cheaper in the long run.
So far I've purchased two of the Orbit 62001 Lawn Timers, but I've gone through about four of them with Amazon and the local mega-mart. The first 62001 I purchased in 2008 died (and it was my fault) when I left it out for a day during a freeze (note: I live in southern Texas, and by "freeze" I meant - it hit 30 for about two hours at night). The digital portion worked fine but the actual physical housing which rotated the open-and-close water flow restrictor would simply no longer operate. I replaced this unit with another from Amazon and it worked fine for the following summer. Having learned my lesson, I unhooked the timer for the next winter and left it in a dry, insulated, garage. The garage would hit a low of around 40 versus the outdoor temperature of 30 or less. The garage never hit freezing temperatures and the batteries were out of the unit until the following spring. When spring came, the same problem occurred - the digital portion worked fine, the physical water restrictor would no longer move. I ordered replacement #3 from Amazon and this time straight out of the clamshell the unit would not work - same exact issue. I returned the unit to Amazon and grabbed a replacement from the local mega mart - again, same exact issue.Now, I should state that I live in an area with hard water and yes I can see that being a possible issue.  Perhaps gunking up the the inner-workings of these timers and restricting the mechanics from moving about properly. However with my two "mostly-broken" units I've torn them apart and found no calcium build up on the regulator or even evidence of rust or circuit corrosion (I am not an engineer but when comparing a working to non-working unit, it all looked the same). I should also note that I have aOrbit 62032 Yard Watering Systemin my backyard and it has been working fine for three years running. After multiple tries with the 62001, I've stepped down to the slightly less functionally robustOrbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timerin hopes that it might last longer than a year.I've given these units two stars (instead of one) because there is the slightest chance that I simply might have been unlucky with my four units. When these worked, they worked flawlessly day-after-day. Multiple timers and day-to-day nuances made watering during drought restrictions a breeze. I just wish they would last.
This was the third one I purchased as my other two just stopped working after 2 seasons. This one didn't even last this season. not wasting any more money on these things.
Bought this about 4 years ago from another site (much more expensive). It worked well.The pole holding it gave out (wet soil from heavy rain and snow), and the feeder hit the ground (frozen grass). It literally smashed into about 10 pieces; I don't know if I even found them all.The interesting part of this story is that the thistle feeder hanging on the opposite hook of the pole and 2 poly rain rings (over the tops)  did NOT break. Only this feeder broke!! I suspect that it was either weather-worn, OR an old(ER) feeder with limited life to the plastic, OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.A few feet away, I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected (anchored in cement), i.e., NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame: an animal attack.I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement.FINALLY, they said that an animal probably got at it, but they couldn't guess which one. DUH. I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break, AND that the other barn style feeder, only a few feet away, was not touched, basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.Last email from mfgr: Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder!?I asked about the lifetime warrantee again.They asked for photos. I sent them.Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken.I wrote that they'd just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say.Answer: NO REPLACEMENT; must have been an animal attack (their words).BOTTOM LINE: Forget the lifetime support. They won't replace the feeder.Be ware of expecting any type of replacement or support from the company. The emails were almost accusative; really off-putting, as if to discourage further contact. And I had shown them a photo of the pole AND the other elements on it which did not break. We exchanged probably half a dozen emails.I'd like this feeder again, but I'll be d....d if I spend money on something which is NOT supported when the mfgr says that it is supported for a lifetime replacement.Whose lifetime? An ant's?Probably made of SHODDY MATERIAL with a limited life is my conclusion.The company will insist that "some" animal attacked it, and they don't support animal attacks. Great excuse (not).
For everyone out there that is an avid bird feeding enthusiast, you are by now well aware that you will spend half your time selecting seed, buying feeders, setting up and tending to them, and the other half battling squirrels for control of them. Squirrel's are nothing less than amazing in both their tenacity and technique when it comes to getting at the bird seed we desire so desperately to keep them away from.  Squirrel baffles of all shapes and design are only effective about half the time at best. And weight sensitive perches are soon made obsolete or at least only partially effective when word gets around as to how to hang down from above and keep your body weight elsewhere. This very expensive squirrel buster is really nothing but a little better design on an old idea.  The weight sensitive perch is nothing new.  Its been in the arsenal of attack on squirrels for quite a few years now.  A weight sensitive perch is only as effective as what's overhead for the wily squirrel to hang his feet on and drop below.  The squirrel buster does just about as good a job at making the top of its feeder pretty near paw proof as I have encountered, but not totally.  My neighbor who owns one of these has seen quite a few squirrels attempt to drop from above to the seed below only to slip and fall, (much to her giggling delight).  However not a day goes by that some future Olympian worthy fellow somehow manages to lock his feet above securely and feast on the spoils now at his disposal below. Now that she has had it for a few weeks it has become an everyday event that at least a couple of squirrels beat the system. Its my opinion that there is no such thing as a foolproof squirrel busting feeder.  This one is close, but at the price their asking for it I don't consider it a worthwhile investment at all. Take away its design and its no better made than any other feeder costing half its price.  It will get just as dirty and is just as hard to clean.  Its all up to the individual of course.  But its my take that this feeder is extremely overpriced regardless of its promise and performance.  If you are interested in a feeder that is every bit as squirrel proof as this one and is about a third the price, try the Backyard Bistro bird feeder available on the web.  I own 5 of them and they are made of very tough impenetrable vinyl and aluminum and its shape and hardness makes it just as effective against squirrels as the buster here. You can even buy six of these in a case for the price of two of these feeders, and with free shipping thrown in.  Check it out and see for yourself.  And happy hunting!
To call this &#34;spill proof&#34; is ridiculous! If the can came with a simple screw cap and a separate funnel it would be fine. Instead it comes with a cap that you have to punch out the center to fit the spout, thus rendering the cap useless for sealing the canister, and an incredibly poorly designed spout that just does not work. I ended up ignoring the spout and using a plastic funnel instead. If I can find a replacement cap at least I won't have completely wasted 20 bucks. Not recommendedPros: will hold 5 gallons, does have 2 handles, is fairly stableCons: the nozzle is a waste of time, there is no separate cap for storage - the nozzle has to be in place
Update: Stopped working effectively after about 16 hours of use.  James on a twig slightly larger than a matchstick and then makes a whining noise and a nice electric burning smell until I whack it with my hand a few times, then it'll work in a promising manner until you actually bring the blade to bear on a hedge.  I've found that the cutting bar is so flimsy you can bend it permanently without much effort.  Might be why its jamming all the time.  Might be interesting to try to bend it to a semi circle for custom cutting before I jam it into the garbage can...No power, fibber marketing guys, impractical for anything other than marginal light duty work here and there.  Very first piece of outdoor equipment that I've bought that just stopped working after a short usage period.  Maybe i've been fortunate.--------------------original review:I'll say something good first.  Its not the worst hedge trimmer i've used. (update: yes it is)That having been said, the box shows that its ten feet long, and after fiddling with it for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to extend it and reading the manual twice, i came to the conclusion that this includes the height of the person holding it.  Love the marketing spin...The cutting end is a good 7-8 lbs.  Try holding that at an angle on the end of the (actually) four foor pole for a while.  Would have been brilliant to put the motor on the bottom and some kind of actuation through the pole and just the blade on top.The specs say it'll cut almost a half inch.  Not exactly.  Anything about a third of an inch or so will stop the blade dead.  Now you've got a heavy cutter on the end of a long pole stuck on a branch.  If you're lucky, you're also on a ladder.Not worth a hundred bucks.
Threads not good and I had to toss it in the junk pile.Saving it for a crooked hose thread where it might workwith a force crank. Be careful. If buying retail look for damaged orimproperly mfg threads.
Birds don't like this feeder and have never used it to feed from despite my moving it to various locations in my attempt to get them to feed from it. Useless!
PLEASE SEE THE UPDATE AFTER THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW.We have been plagued with squirrels for years.  Our neighborhood has vast numbers of large oak and pecan trees with a smattering of fruit trees.  These provide food and shelter for these little critters so they multiply like crazy and typically overrun the area.  They dig up flower beds, destroy container plants, dig holes in the lawn and devour one small bite out of every pecan and piece of fruit before it matures.  If that's not bad enough, they have chewed through the wood trim on our home and made nests in the attic.  Squirrels are NOT cute little cartoon critters.  They are destructive tree rats.  Over the years, I've tried to keep them at bay by using various home remedy methods--from putting ground red pepper around plants to using a pellet gun to permanently remove individuals.  Nothing worked.  They liked hot pepper and for every one I killed, three more would take its place.With this in mind, I was skeptical of "Deer Off".  But I was willing to give it a try and I actually think it may be working...at least for the short term.  After spraying a liberal amount of "Deer Off" around the base of trees, in flower beds and around container plants, the squirrels seem to be staying away.  It's been a little under two weeks since the initial application of the product and I've only seen one squirrel at a time in the back yard.  In the past, they came in gangs of more than a dozen--sometimes as many as two dozen at one time.  So far so good.The label says "Deer Off" deters animals by smell and taste but it is odorless to humans "once dry".  I never noticed an odor as I sprayed it and I have a pretty sensitive nose.  It's also supposed to last for months even after rain or watering of plants.  I can't verify this but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  If there's anything I dislike about the product it is the silly battery-powered sprayer container.  I've noticed this trend in lawn care products recently and I don't like it.  Batteries and battery-powered pumps add an unnecessary expense to the products, they add unnecessary complications should electrical components fail and they add unnecessary waste to landfills.  It's not difficult to pump up a sprayer and let air do the work.  And, of course, air is free.  In my opinion, the advent of battery-powered sprayers is a dumb marketing idea that should be rectified as soon as possible.I'm giving "Deer Off" four stars due to my short term observation that it appears to be working with the local squirrels.  Docked one star permanently for the battery-powered sprayer.UPDATE 06/12/2012:I guess I was too optimistic.  The squirrels are back.  Digging in the lawn, digging in the flower beds and digging in the plant containers.Yeah, that didn't last too long.  No big rains to wash it away either.  It just quit working.  And at over 30 bucks for the large bottle, I can't recommend it as a temporary solution.
Rabbits have been feasting on my new lawn and I was excited to be able to try Deer Off from the Vine program. However, while rabbits are one of the critters it says it repels, I guess rabbits didn't read it. The first try I liberally sprayed it all around the perimeter of the grassy area I was trying to protect. But, judging by the fresh rabbit droppings I found each morning afterwards, I suspected it wasn't working. My second try I liberally sprayed everywhere, perimeter and main lawn, and later that night I checked outside and found 2 rabbits feasting away. Maybe they like eggs, but it doesn't appear to work on rabbits, at least not the ones I have here in San Diego.
This didn't seem to accomplish a whole lot and I found getting it up and running sort of fussy. Maybe the wildlife in other areas is a little more bothered by it, but here it just ended up being more trouble than it was worth for the amount of actual effect that I felt I was getting.
The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks, not the claimed three months, and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them.  I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard.  Two weeks later I'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well.  I like the safety lock just below the sprayer's trigger. I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved.
As a gardener, I'm familiar with Deer Off. Like most of the smelly deer repellents, it works, but has to be renewed after rainfall.As a codger, I'm finding hand-held sprayers somewhat of a chore, particularly when spraying the whole garden, so I welcomed the idea of an electric spray gun.Unfortunately, this one doesn't work.I read the instructions carefully, shook the container, inserted the feed to the pump and pulled the trigger. Result - not much. The pump whined away for a while, but nothing came out of the nozzle. Eventually, after several minutes, with the batteries starting to show the strain, the pump primed, and a stream of liquid came out. When I adjusted the nozzle to convert the stream to a spray, the result was disappointing - there wasn't enough pressure to produce a decent spray. I tried spraying some of my shrubs, but the results were unsatisfactory.As an experiment, I tried cleaning the intake with water, in case it had been blocked. During the process, I found an interesting phenomenon - the pump produced a good spray pattern when handling water, but not the thin sludge that is Deer Off.Bottom line - it doesn't work. It might be better with a more powerful pump.
The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then, when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry, NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food.
It doesn't mention this in the product description (but does on the bottle), but this product is not supposed to be used on edible plants. Well, I'm a vegetable gardener with a rabbit problem, and if I can't spray it on things I'm going to eat, it's useless to me. This, despite saying it's safe for use around kids. Had I known this from the description, I never would have ordered it.It does get one star because my mom uses a product with the same active ingredient on her roses, and it does keep the deer away (although it stiiiiiinks).If I get brave enough to ignore the warning labels and spray it on the kale, I'll update.
I have my garden behind an six foot wire fence.  Unfortunately, one side of the fence is only 4 feet tall due to damage last winter.  I used this product as well as an electronic aid to keep the deer away.  The result was $60 in plantings and 40 hours of labor down the drain.  It didn't my local animals one bit!  Next year I will raise the fence and perhaps install a moat!  Actually, I have a neighbor who had good results with just playing a radio in the garden.  Guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music!
I had high hopes for this product, as deer and squirrels tear my flower and vegetable gardens to shreds.  This product works as advertised, flawlessly - BUT it does not repel so-called wild critters.  Deer and squirrels initially were frightened by the sprayer action.  However, the repellant odor did not deter animals from eventually taking over my entire garden.I talked to a county fish and game official; he opined that urban animals are too accustomed to man and his many exotic sounds and smells  After three days or so, the deer simply ignored the spray of repellant.  They are persistent pests that won't hide in terror on seeing me.  Believe me I am quite scary.  I am proceeding to evaluate other tactics.Bambi and his kin are safe for the moment.
Well, I've tried everything I know to do, and so has my husband, to get the sprayer to spray.  The batteries are good and properly inserted, the motor is functioning but nothing will come out.  We've carefully followed the directions on priming, checked for kinks in the hose, turned the blue nozzle to to the "on" position and made sure the inlet was deeply immersed in the liquid.  Yet, it simply won't spray.Since the sprayer won't work, my next step is to pour the liquid into a hand sprayer and use the product as directed.  So, at this point I don't know how well the actual repellent repels unwanted animal critters, but the sprayer definitely doesn't function as it should.  Just thought the potential buyer should be aware of this before purchasing.  I will report back on the efficacy of the repellent after I finally get it applied.
Deer Off and I are not doing as well as I hoped due to the smell, drought, batteries, ingredients.The drought and water restrictions have all the varmints in survival mode seeking food, water and shelter.  More regularly seen squirrels and rabbits plus formerly unseen creatures (bobcats, coyotes) have arrived en masse. So taking a chance on Deer Off was a no brainer to get them to move along. I don't have a DEER problem so I cannot indicate if this works on them.However, it FAILED to repel the squirrels and rabbits and was an unpleasant HUMAN experience due to:- non-working batteries I had to replace,- pungent smelly concoction had me gagging,- ingredients can cause allergic reactions ... READ detailed ingredients BEFORE purchase.Although an application of this deterrent can last up to 3 months, heavy rain and your lawn sprinkler can rinse it away requiring another application of Deer Off. The battery powered sprayer makes for easier application without your trigger finger falling off and their customer service is pleasant and helpful.All in all, I wouldn't buy this product.
Just like other animal repellants (and I've tried many), the Havahart repellant (Havahart also make traps) fails to deliver.The battery operated sprayer is a toy, so good luck getting it to work reliably.The odor is similar to other products. In fact, you can make your own with rotten egg and hot pepper.But to focus on the core objective: repelling critters -- I did not see any noticeable drop in the amount my flowers and vegetables. Deer, squirrels and rabbits seem minimally discouraged.
I'm not sure if it's supposed to be this way, but the Deer Off product I received was the consistency of buttermilk. The package was marked "ready to use," so I know it's not meant to be diluted. I don't know what happened, but I do know sometimes stuff like this gets frozen in storage or sitting on a loading dock and changes consistency. Since I received it, it's been in my garage where the cold-hating cacti spent the winter.The sprayer was firing, but the repellent was too thick to make it through the gun and out. The sprayer seemed to have a lot of power when I sent water through it.If the sprayer worked with the Deer Off, this would be a great product. I ended up "painting" some of the leaves of my squash where I noticed the rodent damage yesterday. I'll report back if they quit nibbling. If it works, I have ornamental plants that the jackrabbits won't leave alone that I'll try it with.The dogs enjoyed the smell of the Deer Off. I really didn't detect any obnoxious odor.
I tried this product and it does appear to be somewhat effective at deterring critters from bothering garden and flower areas for a while. It turns out to not be practical for my needs because of the relatively limited working time, and the relatively large expense of the product. I can not afford to continue to apply this product to garden and flower beds. The area I live in is experiencing a drought so a garden is a particularly attractive feeding ground for animals, so the product might work better in areas where animals are not so stressed to find food.
SEE UPDATE at end for the rating change from 3 star to 2 star.I obtained this item through the Amazon Prime Program.  I have a large yard with bird feeders  and that attracts a lot of squirrels and rabbits.  I have tried chasing them off, but that is almost like swatting at a fly with a tissue.  A lot of exercise on your part, entertainment on the critters part, and nothing changes.I thought that since this product is safe to use around animals and did not appear to be a bio hazard that I would give it a try.  Here are my thoughts on the product:First, the Sprayer:1.  While the unit comes with batteries (4 AA batteries), they did not last more than a few minutes.  I had to install new batteries to get anything out of the sprayer.2.  The sprayer is supposed to put out a stream and a wide spray.  While it will put out a stream, it does not go very far.  As for a wide spray, I guess wide is in the eye of the beholder.  It is not very wide and it only travels about 3 feet from the sprayer.  I good hand pump sprayer that you can re-use for other sprays would work much better!  I have a 1.5 gallon sprayer that is pumped up by hand and it sprays this material 4 times farther and gives a nice fan spray!  I would have to rate the electric sprayer a 0 Star product as it is just not worth using and it comsumes batteries quickly.Second, the Deer Off Product:1.  The product seems to work as the rabbits and squirrels have not been back at the feeders since I used the spray.  Of course, it has only been on for two weeks and it has not rained, so I do not know how long it will last.  Still, it is working and that is saving my plants and the seed for the birds.2.  Having a premix product is fine, but it is a very expensive way to do anything, especially if you have a large area or if you need to reapply the product after a few weeks.Overall, I would rat the Deer Off product well, but the packaging and the battery powered pump I would not recommend.  If you can buy the product as a concentrate, I would recommend it.  I gave the product a 3 star rating due to the battery powered pump and the fact that it is a premix.UPDATE:Well, I guess two weeks is about the limit.  Just a couple of days after writing the review the rabbits were back.  I put the rest of the concentrate I had into a hand sprayer and then sprayed the plants again.  That worked until we had a small rain shower pass through and then the rabbits were back.So, I now have to say that for the price this is definately NOT a good solution!!
The actual fluid may very well be working - it's hard to tell.  My problem is with the motorized sprayer - it's more trouble than it's worth.  The alkaline AA batteries that came with it weren't producing any spray, so I replaced 'em with rechargeables.  This produced a sputtering short-range squirting.I may try John Casey's fix but honestly, I'd prefer to just pour the contents into an old squeeze-sprayer and try it that way.As to the fluid's effectiveness - well, *I* can't smell anything, but the DOG can, so he has added his own ingredients to the mix.  We'll see how THAT works out!.
Dead batteries, hard to push the safety switch to the safe position while keeping the sprayer pointed away from yourself.Fine print on the bottle says do not use on food plants, even though the Amazon page said that the product is recommended for organic gardening. Being OMRI listed and USDA approved for use in organic gardening is in direct contradiction to the instructions on the bottle.I had planned on using this for my cherry tomato plants, but the instructions on the package clearly say do not use on food plants.I did sacrifice one of my tomato plants, since I felt that a test of the spray wouldn't be complete without a plant that I know the deer love to eat.It was difficult using the sprayer, first was discovering that it had dead batteries, then of course I had to find replacement batteries. Then it took quite a while for the pump to prime. The safety switch is very difficult for me to place in the safe position while pointing the sprayer away from me, it might be easier for other people, as I have some limitations to hand strength.The spray went on ok once I had gotten all the bugs out of the system. It appears to work, but we have had quite a bit of rain, and it is very possible that the deer found somewhere else to munch on plants.Overall a two star item, since I grow mostly food plants, and I think the directions on the package over-ride what it says on the Amazon page
Upon getting the spray, I had a hard time getting the sprayer to prime up. It took about 5 minutes or so of opening and closing the nozzle and holding my finger on it blocking the spray hole to get it started. Once i did, it was very good. It has an easy adjustable spray tip that goes from an almost mist to stream. There's just a slight smell from it but its nothing offensive at all, reminded me of yogurt. It has a slight milky color to it which is nice because you can see where you've sprayed. The main ingredients are egg, capsacian and garlic. Pretty simple ingredients and the label says its harmless to animals and humans. I believe its USDA approved for organic gardens which means it should be safe but one never really knows.I've only had this a few days and will update in a few weeks but so far, the squirrels aren't attacking by bird feeders. They can't resist sunflower seeds which are for the birds not them and climb right up the thin wrought iron plant hangers. I wanted to give this a try because I can't spend all day chasing them away. They keep the birds from coming and can go thru the entire feeder in no time flat. You'll get a batch of squirrels that are very bold so I hope this stuff continues to keep they off the feeders. I don't care about the grounds but not on the feeders. I sprayed the polls and the feeders, without getting the openings for the seeds. I also sprayed the surrounding grass and plants under and around the feeders.The birds don't seem effected at all. They eat from the feeders and the grounds under them with no apparent issues. There were a few squirrels but they didn't stick around long. Not sure if it was the spray or that they saw me watching them...lol.  Again, I'll update this in a few short weeks and give my final thoughts. Keep your fingers crossed!UPDATE 6-14-12:No Good, it seemed to work for a few days but now the squirrels are back and climbing up the plant hooks again. I sprayed the hooks and the bird feeders till they were dripping with the spray and it didn't stop them. Oh well! on to other inventions.
This review reminds me of the old joke about the box of baking soda in the fridge put their to keep away elephants.  The rationale is that if there are no elephants in the fridge, it must be working.  I like the delivery system on this, it beats the heck out of the squeeze pump.  I only saw deer once in my yard and after I sprayed I haven't seen them since.  The big "but" is that I don't have empirical evidence that the reason I haven't seen them again is the spray.  It is easy to use and I guess it is working but I am hard pressed to offer any proof.addendum  6/8/13  I went to use this again and the battery spray no longer works.  I ran it in warm water thinking it may have gotten gummed up but to no avail.  So one use it worked, the second use the battery spray failed.  I did replace the batteries although it was making noises with the old batteries, I gave that a shot anyway.  Still didn't work. Since my primary reason for liking this was the delivery system I have downgraded my review rating.
I owned an older model of this feeder that lacked the roof, and I was eager to try this version; it seemed like a perfect upgrade.  Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in it.First of all, one of the welds on the roof where the posts are inserted is crooked.  It was possible to insert the post and use the feeder, but it looks a bit cockeyed.  NOT the quality I expect from the Duncraft name (and price).Next, I discovered how inconvenient it is to fill this feeder, not a small consideration for a feeder that holds so little.  With the roofless version, I could simply turn it over, shake out the hulls, add fresh seed, and shake it until all the seed was under the grid.  That can't be done with this one because of the way the roof is attached.The posts are not fastened to the feeder; the feeder and roof have round holes where the posts just sit.  The roof is only balanced on the posts, not fastened, so if you turn over the feeder, posts go flying.  The washer that holds down the grid is attached to the hanger, which goes through the roof, so the screw and washer can't be removed to lift the grids for filling unless the roof is moved up out of the way.  Bottom line:  The feeder needs to be partially disassembled and reassembled to refill it.  Bare-handed most of the time, as it's a fiddly process to get it all back together.  In the cold and snow.  Every couple days.The quality and filling hassles didn't stop my trying to use it, though.  What ultimately retired this feeder was that "Squirrel Blocker" turned out to be merely a naming convention, not a description of the feeder's performance.  The squirrels quickly figured out that launching themselves onto the feeder from a nearby tree would shake the feeder enough to spill seed handily onto the ground.  Soon they observed that this also caused seed to shuffle to one side, piling it high enough to reach into the grid and grab it.  Hot on the heels of that breakthrough was the realization that simply sitting on one edge of the feeder tipped it enough to keep the seed piled up for easy access.This could be avoided by placing the feeder where squirrels can't jump onto it and using a pole baffle so they can't climb up.  If you have such a location, would like to add a platform feeder, and have a setup (e.g., handy picnic table) that makes it easy to work with the feeder when filling it, this feeder might fill the bill for you.  It's attractive and sturdy despite its manufacturing defects, and I think it would last a long time.However, any feeder can be pretty well squirrel-proofed by locating it where squirrels can neither jump nor climb onto it.  If I had such a location, I would surely use it.  Meanwhile, I can only chalk up another victory for the squirrels.
I occasionally get a bird using it to hop to another feeder but I haven't seen any stop to eat. A cardinal sized bird shy away from it. Squirrels, on the other hand, have no problem at all jumping on to it. I believe it was able to eat from it as well. I'm not sure what to do with it now.
The great reviews swayed me and I got this.  I find this no better than a $5 or $10 sprayer from my local shop.  Coupled with the $15 delivery charge from Amazon on this, $35 is a bit of a joke.  The other thing that bothers me about the sprayer is that the spray is not "instant".  I press on the button and it takes a half second to actually come out...also, more annoyingly, when I release the button it takes a good 2 or 3 seconds to stop spraying.  This is seriously a pain when trying to do some precision spraying of fertiliser or medication.  I'm also not too impressed that there is no way to spray off the body of the sprayer.  It wouldn't have taken a lot for the designers to allow the spray nozzle to connect to the first connector on the actual body of the sprayer.  All-in-all, I feel really ripped-off by this.  I only wish I could return it but Amazon will not allow it unless I pay to ship it back, which, at the lowest rate, would be about $30. C'est la vie.
Upside-down is the way to go. The house finches are completely baffled by this feeder while the goldfinches happily flop over to get their seed.As another reviewer said, squirrels won't touch thistle, but they do like the seed mixes. This feeder is all plastic, including the perches, unlike more expensive feeders that have metal perches. The squirrels will chew the plastic perches right off. Also, the plastic bottom of the feeder is held in only by a tiny tab and notch, so there's a good chance of its falling out.In short, if this feeder lasts a couple of months that's about all one can expect. If you want a more durable feeder, pay more for a better built model!
This electronic deer repellent is interesting, but I'm afraid that there's little way to know if it works.  The idea is to entice deer with a scent so that they touch a set of wires looped at the top of the device, which sends an electrical shock to the deer.  The instructions indicate that it is not intended for an area with a high concentration of deer and that you need to rotate through different scents to keep them from associating the shock with the scent item.  The units came with an acorn scent and I can imagine teaching the deer to avoid acorns while they continue to eat your fruit trees or scrape their horns on our aspen trees.  I'm not sure whether they have reduced the damage that the deer have done in my yard, but my dog avoids acorns with a passion now.  I guess that's good though ... right?  I would say nice try, but maybe a bit off the mark.
When human beings displaced deer from their natural habitat, we did something very disruptive - we replaced it with a much better habitat. Rather than pick among the sparse native shrubs, the deer now have a huge selection of succulent new food, imported into their environment at enormous expense. Not only that, but the suburbs discourage the predators which might have kept their numbers down: the many traffic accidents don't compensate for this.Better habitat - fewer predators = uncontrolled population growth.Result? Waking up in the morning, to find that all the tulips have vanished. Or worse, waking up in ER to find that you've just collided with a deer.In the suburbs, the deer population has grown out of all proportion. We'll welcome anything to keep the damned things out of our gardens. Unfortunately, killing them outright is illegal.The concept of the product is fairly simple. It's basically a low-powered cattle prod, with a deer attractant. The idea is that the deer is attracted by the smell, licks the device, gets a mild shock, doesn't like the experience. If they do it often enough, they get conditioned to stay away. Deer are not particularly intelligent, so the process takes a while. I've been using devices like this for a few years. It works, a bit, but not well enough to replace deer repellent chemicals. The most effective repellent(apart from a fence) is spraying, but it has to be repeated. (Even repellents don't work for the young deer, who are unbelievably stupid, and will eat anything, including poisonous plants.)This particular product is a tad clumsy. Others use a scent-impregnated piece of plastic, which needs to be replaced once a month; this one has a ball of cotton wool, plus a bottle of attractant. I suspect any decent rain storm will wash it away. The instructions confirm this. Apparently I'm supposed to add new attractant every week, and after rain. Not good.The instructions also recommend changing the attractant every so often, 'because the deer get used to it'. This approach works for repellents, but is completely wrong for something designed to condition deer to stay away. I rather thought that the whole point is for the deer to associate the smell of the attractant with a shock!Now that I've installed these things in my garden, I realize that the people who design them didn't realize that they are supposed to blend into the environment. What possessed the manufacturer to give them red tops!I'll continue to use it throughout the season. If it seems more effective than its predecessors, I'll let you know, but initial impressions are not favorable.Good luck in the Fight.
This is a set of 3 battery-operated devices that are supposed to deter deer from eating your plantings.  The devices consist of a plastic stake, about 18" high that you stick into the ground with a handy foot tab.  On the top of each stake are two metal wires connected to a battery-operated charger, surrounding a casement that is to be filled with acorn-scented cotton balls (cotton-balls and acorn scent included in the package).  The intention is for the deer to be attracted by the acorn scent, sniff the top of the stake, get a mild shock from the wires, and then high-tail it out of your yard.The stakes were rather simple to assembly and load with AA batteries (2 needed for each stake).  Instructions said to insert an entire cotton ball into each casement, but it was rather difficult to get an entire cotton ball in place.  According to instructions, several drops of acorn scent should be distributed on the cotton balls after every rain, or at least once a week.  I found it a little difficult to re-apply the scent drops with the sticks in the ground--it's much easier if you take the stakes out of the ground so you can apply the drops at an angle.The stakes are green plastic with red tips, and would probably be child-magnets for small children, so they aren't recommended for use around children.  My hunch is that 1-3 year olds would learn to avoid the stakes even faster than deer, but I still wouldn't want to use them around young children.  Older children might be tempted to pull up the stakes and use them for sword fighting, so they probably wouldn't be good to have in yards with older kids either.On the package, the manufacturer notes that the stakes are "very effective" in suburban areas where deer density is low and damage is mild, infrequent, and unpredictable.  And "not effective" in rural areas where deer density is high, and damage is extreme and frequent.  In other words, they're most "effective" if you don't have a real problem with deer.  I wasn't aware of these limitations when I ordered the product, but tried them out anyway in my blueberry plantings in front of my house, which is in a rural area with plenty of deer.  I aimed my game camera at the stakes to see whether I could catch deer being deterred.  My camera showed dozens of regular visits by deer to the blueberry plantings, in which the deer looked happy, content, and well fed, but not very deterred.
I have to say that I am at fault for this one. I must have taken my stupid pills the day I requested these. For some reason I was thinking that "electronic" meant that there would be a sound deterrent or a light or something besides a shock. I should have read further before ordering.These were easy to assemble and install the batteries which were provided. My happiness ends there.The first thing that makes no sense is the "lure" that is applied to the tops of these. As a long time landscaper I learned eons ago that you never intentionally "lure" whatever you are trying to avoid (i.e. japansese beetle traps). Only frustration and madness lie that way. So in order for these to work, you have to lure the deer to your yard so they can essentially stick their noses in the scent and therefore get this mild shock. It is all about training the animal as you would a dog with invisible fence.As someone who lives in a heavily wooded area I can tell you from nearly 30 years of experience that if a critter wants it, they will get it. Short of a physical barrier they will find a way around.These may be OK for someone in a suburban area, but if you have kids that are touching things these would be a no go.I'll keep spraying repellent and letting "nature take it's course".
We live in suburbia - 1/2 acre to 1 acre plots - in Westchester County New York.  Lots of deer.  These have an odd way of working.  They actually use a scent to ATTRACT deer, then they use a shock to repel them.  It's a bit odd.  Unless the deer actually touch the wires, they are never repelled - only attracted.I haven't done a statistical study, but I would say that the deer are MORE active on our property than they used to be.  Previously, they would wander through.  Now, they are curious and stick around because of the scent.  I have only seen one deer (a huge buck) touch the wires.  It only seemed mildly phased - and didn't run away or anything.These are also very dangerous if you have kids around.  There are package warnings, but the wires give off a pretty good shock to humans - probably not enough to do any damage, but pretty unpleasant.
I put these up in my yard around the fence line. The deer still came into my yard. Didn't seem to make any mind of these stakes. The instructions say to place them at the areas away from what you want protected.  I followed the directions and the deer still enters the yard and eats the plants.Maybe if you combine these with other deterrents they may work better. I don't know. These don't seem to work.
I agree with the one-star review titled "Pointless" written by "Kitten Kisser".  I live in an area that falls between the last two categories "Rural residential" and "Rural non-residential agricultural" - I have high deer density, damage is frequent but unpredictable.  Since I installed them, I haven't seen any deer in my yard, but my schedule has been erratic, so it's not unusual.  I've seen deer damage on plants near one of the three repellent stakes, but not near the other two.  But then, I don't know if I would have seen damage on those plants if the stakes were not there.I will continue to re-scent the stakes, at least as long as the supply lasts.  And I'll move the stakes, as the instructions say.  But since my walnut tree got partly eaten, I don't have high hopes for these stakes doing the job.
Deers are the worse pest in New England. Not only do they destroy our gardens, they also spread Lime disease, a serious deer-tick born ailment that is named after a Connecticut town. For some unfathomable reason, the local politicians decide that, ours being a proudly liberal town, any hunting or trapping of deers is strictly forbidden all year round anywhere within the town border, making this town uniquely pro-deer in the state of Connecticut.Poor home owners who cannot put up six-foot tall fences all around the properties are pretty much defenseless against these nasty invaders. Last year, my entire crop of okra as well as my wife's prized lilies were gone in a single evening. It was not that we chose to do nothing, but the deer-repellant spray was washed away in a drizzle and the deers were free to munch on the tenderest new shoots. This year, we feel we have no choice but to pay up for the somewhat rain-resistant but much more expensiveDeer Scram 25# Deer & Rabbit Repellent Granular White Pail. This blood/garlic mixture has worked for us so far, but I am constantly worried that the smell is fading fast with each rainy day.When I saw the phrase "electronic deer repellent" on Amazon, my heart skipped a beat in joy and wonder. Could this be the silver bullet to our deer problem? I made the big mistake of not reading the detailed descriptions and the reviews until the item arrived. This "repellent" uses acorn scented oil to ATTRACT deers to one's lawn only to gently send them away with a mild electric shock. Question 1: what if the deers choose not to touch the metal part with their noses? Question 2: What about the deer ticks they carry? Question 3: Why would I want to attract all the deers in the neighborhood to my small property in the first place? Do I really want to remind them how many tender and juicy flowers and vegetables I have just planted?There is just no way I am going to put this boondoggle in my lawn. The only legitimate purpose of this thing I can think of is to use it as a bait while waiting around with a bow or a rifle, assuming that the acorn oil actually works. Maybe someone should market a similar product under the brand "Havabrain"?
At first glance, the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent seems like it might work.  It supposedly attracts deer with a scented lure (a cotton ball at the top to which you apply the supplied scent drops) and the deer, if they nudge it with their nose, get a shock from the wires that run down the post.Unfortunately, this underestimates the deers' ability to bypass the post and munch your garden - as most deer would do.  The package notes that it is designed for "light deer pressure" installations, such as urban back yards, and not for more rural or even suburban situations.  My house is decidedly rural with high deer pressure, and the Havahart made zero difference in deer foraging in the garden.  As you get only three in the package, you might need many more to protect even a small garden to any significant degree.And even in the urban setting, where this might work better, anything that attracts deer probably makes things worse rather than better.  In this way it is a lot like the Japanese Beetle traps with their pheromone lures - while the traps may catch a lot of beetles, they also attract more beetles to the area.Sadly, the only thing that seems to really work on deer is a physical barrier, perhaps reinforced with a continuous electric fence.
I set this up near my barn,and alas the deer seemed to ignore it's effect.They still frequent the proximity of these stakes. I have tried everything,now I will feed the deer,and give up on the garden!
When I turn the water on, the nozzle starts spraying water, without me touching it or pushing the handle. Today I wanted to wash my yard, I left the hose with the nozzle on the floor until I turned the water on. By the time I got to the hose, the water coming out from the nozzle soaked my coffee table in the living room through the screen door that was closed. The water on the nozzle is always on until I turn off the water supply. This is totally unacceptable.
I bought this and a bag of Scotts grass seed to cover an area of my back yard that was recently regraded after construction.  The spreader worked OK for the first few minutes, then became harder and harder to crank. Too much friction for the plastic parts maybe. I'm glad the space I had to cover wasn't any larger. What a pain. I could have done just about as well  pitching handfuls from the bag. I think I wasted my money.
This would maybe be 3 stars if it worked outdoors, but I would not chance it!  It has a very cheap build for the cost and has the electric switch and electronics on top, exposed to weather, so I would not want to use it outdoors (as I had intended).  I bought a simple Haveaheart trap and sent this back.  If you intend it for indoors, it would work probably fine, but it still looks cheap for the price.  I just was unimpressed.
I've used Deer Off before and didn't have very good results with the sprayer so I decided to try the concentrate formula.It states to NOT use on plants that are intended for human consumption so all of our garden plants that are getting eaten by the squirrels and deer have no hope at. We used it on other plants and the plants that we applied it to had burned brown areas on them in a few days.We also applied it around the bird feeder to keep the squirrels away and to some trees to keep the deer from rubbing up on them, all with no results. The best thing that we have found is to try and plant Deer-resistant plants when possible. For the garden, I have no clue how to keep those pesky squirrels out.
My problem is rabbits, cats and squirrels.This product is more difficult to use than Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent Granular Shaker. You have to dilute the concentrate, then spray it from your own sprayer. I was tempted to just pour the concentrate around, but didn't. This product sprays on the foliage, while the granules stay on the ground. This may be a better product for deers since they are not close to the ground, but deers are not my problem.The product smells horrible, but that's how it works. Don't spray it in the wind. Really. I mean it.You can still smell a faint odor when it dries.It seems to wash off after one rain.It seemed to have no effect no rabbits, squirrels and cats. For these critters, the granules seem to work better.Finally, the measuring cup that comes with the concentrate and sits on top of the cap shattered in transit. This was annoying.
The drought and drought restrictions has caused most vegetation to dry out and more varmints to munch on almost anything green or juicy. They're desperate and trying to catch a break which I understand. I just don't want to chance the illnesses they spread with their droppings or traveling guests (fleas, ticks etc).I tried this formulation to keep the varmints away. The product's offensive rotten egg smell does that BUT it dissipates after 3-4 days and the munchers return to make up for lost time. I guess our Texas varmints are used to hot sauce and chili pepper because it does NOTHING to keep the varmints away.In essence, it keeps varmints and neighbors away for a few days but that's it. This may work better where the animals are not in such desperate conditions. It didn't keep the Texas varmints at bay long enough to cost justify this product.
I have reviewed several different Deer Repellent products in the past 2 years and am still hopeful that either something new that works will come out or a new formula of an old standby will do the trick.The market is still prime for a great product to emerge.....The putrescent egg and hot pepper combo is not working. I think the local southeastern deer are starting to like hot & rotten.There are a couple of other details that make this product loose a couple of stars besides the fact that it does repel all deer:- The advertising that you can use it on organic gardens but not anywhere near food crops is misleading.- The price at $38 for 32 oz is slightly over $1.18 an oz and 32 oz only makes 2 gallons of repellent. This is suppose to treat 400 ornamental plants 4 feet tall or 4000 sq ft of plantings. But spraying top and bottom of leaves as per directions really gives much less than 400 plants. These would have to be very small . I estimate that with my professional backpack sprayer with constant pressure tip installed and on a very fine mist spray pattern that I would only be able to spray approx 100 ornamental 4 ft tall plants. Not sure where they are getting their numbers.So I am still waiting for that perfect deer repellent.....Sorry this may not be the review you were hoping to read about. Please comment if you have found a product that works great and I will add your comments to this review.2 stars. 3 lost (one each) for effectiveness, advertising, and cost.Hope this helps.
Deer Off 32 Ounce Deer, Rabbit and Squirrel Repellant comes as a concentrate, so you will need another container to use. I have a fenced in property so do not have deer. However, I have rabbits and it doesn't work to deter the little buggers. I gave it 3 stars because I do not know if it is effective against deer.
Not anywhere as near useful as I'd hoped. Slow and a lot of hard work for very little gain. I would not recommend it.
I have clay soil. It immediately clogged the tines. You can keep making holes with the tines clogged, but since the soil is not being ejected, all you are doing is further compacting the soil below. You may think you are helping your lawn, but you are actually making it worse. I suspect this is a good tool if you have soil that is dry, or sandy, and therefore likely to eject from the top. With my type of soil, which is fairly common, it was basically useless. Please check your soil before spending your hard-earned money on this.
Yard Butler generally makes good products that I like. This, unfortunately, isn't one of them.I've got a small amount of lawn that gets lots of traffic, so this, if it worked, would make great sense.I tried using this with the lawn at various stages of moistness, in case that was the issue. In each instance the aerator jammed, repeatedly. In some cases, un-jamming the unit was very difficult. It is currently waiting for me to unjam it with a hammer drill and masonry bit.I don't recommend this unit.
the first day I had it and was digging and planting in my garden the main shovel broke in half at the neck I am more careful now but it was very low quality material and split way to fast and way way to easy
So far my mice simply enter these traps, eat the bait, and leave (sans zap) leaving some mouse poop right nearby as an F/U to me that they weren't falling for my fancy zapper traps. More traditional traps I bought after these also failed to catch any mice (but at least the mice didn't take the bait this time).My mice have no reason to suspect traps as I have thus far relied on my two cats to keep the house mouse free and it hasn't been an issue for years. That is if you don't count the occasional mouse corpse left diligently just outside the bedroom door for me to walk on half-asleep the morning after the kill...Then recently I started noticing mouse poop but no mouse corpses and assumed the cats were't keeping up their side of the deal. So, loving electronic toys, I got these expensive Thomas Edison style electrocution mouse traps which failed, followed by traditional snap traps which also failed. So I guess the little critters are smarter than I thought and the cats are back on Tuna.In any case these are batting a zero so far but are still baited as are the snapers. Time to try something else.I promise to update this review if they ever come through.PS: Cleaned all the contacts, tested the batteries, not over-baiting, or letting the bait touch the contacts. As I bought two I am doubtful that they are defective, just apparently not very effective.UPDATE: Caught one mouse in a snapper trap; same bait. So far the zappers have got none.UPDATE#2: Latest count is These traps = 2 kills - Old Fashioned snapper traps = 4 kills. I seem to me mouse free now.
Pros:- Compact, sturdy, easy to setupCons:- Expensive- Very hard to clean the peanut butter out of the unit- Given the above, actual reusability and longevity is in questionMy major gripe on this product is how hard it is to clean. The peanut butter can't sit in there forever, eventually it gets a little rotten and you don't want that smell in your house so it has to be cleaned. The peanut butter, once smeared to the back wall, is imbedded into the vent holes and into the cracks and corners of the inside compartment. I bought 2 units and each unit took me 20 minutes to clean with a bunch of toothpicks, qtips anda bottle of rubbing alcohol. Not well designed with this in mind at all and at this price point, I expect more. Perhaps the sellers are just hoping you'll give up and throw it out so you can buy another one from them? It's cynical to think so but go ahead and try cleaning one and you'll likely agree with me.
This is a good price for a no-frills garden sprayer. I'm not expecting a miracle at this price point and because of its all plastic construction, durability may be an issue. For $10, I can live with ordering a replacement if it breaks down after a 8 months to a year, but hopefully it won't. [Product has now failed. Please see update at end of review.]I was looking for a labor-saving way to hydrate the more delicate plants and flowers in my garden and maybe administer some plant food through foliar feeding. I had been using a spray bottle and all that squeezing was very tough on the hands, so I finally decided to do the right thing and get a sprayer. Assembly is very easy. Attach the hose to the wand, attach other end to bottle. Fill with water or your desired mix of fertilizer or bug killer, insert and screw on the pump/handle and you're ready to rock 'n' roll. Flow rate is very satisfactory and you can adjust the spray pattern from a single stream to a fine mist by twisting the nozzle cap. Fully pumped, the stream reaches approx 25 ft out.Design FlawsI don't like that the carrying handle and the pump action are one and the same. There's a little notch that the handle locks into when you rotate it clockwise. This secures the handle in place so that you can carry the sprayer. To pump again, you have to twist it 1/4 turn counter-clockwise so you unlock the handle. Once fully pressurized, dissipation rate is good, but I didn't like the extra step of having to lock and unlock the handle each time. I have to set the sprayer down, unlock, pump, lock again, pick up, then spray. Another minor issue is the squeaking sound of the pump, which I don't really mind, but just pointing it out in case you do.A secondary problem is the length of the hose (about 3 ft.) With the sprayer being held in a relaxed position in one hand (hanging straight down like a shopping bag), I can only bring my other hand to about mid-chest height in front of me. I can't raise my wand hand above my head to mist tall trees and objects. On mist mode, you can comfortably spray anything from ground height to about 8 ft without having to raise the bottle higher.Thirdly, there's no caddy or snap-in clasp to keep the wand secure when the sprayer is not in use. I am expecting a random mishap to snap the wand because of this-- either someone walking by and the wand snagging on some clothing, or it being stepped on. The wand looks especially fragile and susceptible to cracking. It is this product's weakest link. Some sort of loop for attaching a shoulder strap to wear the sprayer would also be a welcome addition.Overall, the Chapin 20000 is easy to use, but not without some design annoyances. For what I paid, I am satisfied with this product so far.UPDATE: DIY Strap Add-on ModificationI was able to fashion myself a strap for the sprayer out of 2 key rings and a camera bag strap. Stamped onto the vertical support vane on either side of the neck is a circular identation (visible in product blowup). You can punch it out with a screwdriver and insert the key rings, then attach a shoulder strap. I now have a wearable sprayer that leaves my other hand free for other gardening tasks. It's a bit clumsy and looks funny, but it works.UPDATE 8/28/10I am downgrading this product to 2 stars because after 4 days, the spray release mechanism has now unexpectedly snapped off. I had concerns about the durability of this product because of its all-plastic construction and did not expect it to last for very long, but less than a week is unacceptable, with less than 4 gallons of use out of this sprayer. The handle is reattachable via snap pegs, but it won't stay on due to the force of the spring in the release value. The clamp had become worn. When pushed down, the lever pops back out. Buyer beware! Not recommended.
It does work and works great when it works, but having to stop and unstick the line from itself is a pain you know where.  This is my first wire purchase for a specific trimmer I just purchased, though, so I don't know if this will happen on other brands, but it never happened on a previous trimmer I had.
We have lots of leaves in the fall in spring and the second time we used this the strap came off and we had to fix it.  So I can't recommed this.
Please don't let the fact that this nozzle costs a fair bit of money fool you into thinkging that this is an all metal product.  See the screw right in the center of the stainless steal spray head? It's attached to a thin plastic core.  So, when you twist the outer rim to seat the metal spray head thereby shutting off the water, the relatively thin plastic core is stressed and in short time, snaps.  The spray head is then no longer attached to anything, falls out, and water gushes everywhere. It becomes a useless hunk of metal and plastic parts.  I am going to try a high strength 'epoxy' repair but I don't hold out much hope. Rather than twisting the rim to shut off the water, you could use one of these;Dramm 12353 Heavy-Duty Brass Shut-Off Valveto do the on off work.After further consideration: If they made parts available, I'd fix it, put it back in action and appreciate its other, more robust characteristics.But until they do, I do not think you get what you pay for.UPDATE: Epoxy doesn't stick to the kind of plastic they used to make the core.
During their seven to 10-day life span, Fungus Gnat females may lay up to 200 eggs into the cracks and crevices of growing media. Moist-growing media containing high amounts of peat moss are particularly attractive to adult females.I have 2, 50 pellet pot jiffy seedling starters. I ordered these for refills because it was more fpr a cheaper price. Now I know why..You can tell these were at least last years old stock or older. You can tell that simply by how long it takes the pellets to absorb the water. It should really only take 1 minute to absorb. These took over 3 to 5 minutes. Most of the seeds I planted when using this batch of pellets did not grow. I was going to try to save the peat to mix with some potting soil.When I opened the pellets there were tons of Fungus Gnat Larvae feeding on the seeds inside. YUCK Yuck Yuck!THANK GOD I CAUGHT THIS BEFORE THEY TURNED INTO FLIES! MY HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN INFESTED!Yes, I blame these pellets and not my seeds or myself. I have never had this issue before.In order to not waste the money I spent buying these I am going to have to spend more money on an insecticide and mix it with the water, when using them..Yes, I am sure the eggs were in the peat pellets and not from me or my home etc.I Know these are old stock, and had eggs in them hence, bad stock!I will not be buying from this seller again!Buyer beware.This is my first ever bad review. Trust me, that tells you something!...... Move on!
After ordering a couple other of the wrong size pellets, I was excited to get these under the impression that they would be the correct 42mm size. As received by seller toolboxsupply, these are the 36mm pellets (which, by the way, seem to be much more widely available; I'm having problems finding the 42mm size anywhere, but I was REALLY expecting these to be that size because the product's title explicitly states this).I assume this might depend a bit on the seller--but I doubt I'm going to try buying these from Amazon again, this being my second attempt. I am hesitant to rank the *product* down for that reason, but it's really apparently a problem with this *listing* and one that I don't want others to fall into this trap. I'd avoid this unless you don't really care which size you get--but if you have the flats already (and I don't know why or how you'd use these without them), it *does* matter.I'd like to give the product itself more stars: while perhaps more expensive than loose seed starting mix, these work well and are very easy to use assuming you follow the directions. Plus, the netting is easy to remove when transplanting or potting up with minimal root disturbance (as long as you don't let the roots get so big they creep through the netting). But it seems exceptionally difficult to find correctly-sized, reasonably priced pellets for your existing Jiffy flats (they make at least four sizes I know of, ranging from 30-50mm). But because of problems with the listing or at least some sellers, I don't think I can do that. I'll revise if this problem is ever fixed, because the product itself does work well if you manage to find the right one among Jiffy's lack of size labeling (and apparently Amazon's or others' confusion). Additionally, Amazon's return process is easy.For those who actually want 42mm pellets (the kind that come with theJiffy 5032 Professional Greenhouse 25-Plant Starter Kitand perhaps others), Jiffy's official refill is theJiffy 5777 Refill, 25-Count, but you'll notice that on Amazon, it's more expensive than the original kit with that number of pellets plus the kit (flat and dome cover) itself! I was able to find it more cheaply elsewhere, but just be warned.I'd be curious how many others actually received 42mm pellets as the listing states or who maybe didn't notice that they got the wrong ones. I'd also be curious who they purchased it from.
I have used peat pods for years now. I was not impressed with these due to the basic problem that these did not work well with seed, and I did compare these with some others I purchased at Home Depot side by side. The others 100 percent sprouted and grew, and these 1 out of 10 grew I am sorry to say.
I would love to review this product, but one of the pieces arrived broken and there's no number or address to ask for a replacement part!  I've informed Amazon, but it's been almost a week and no reply.  So, here's what I can tell you.  The bench looks beautiful.  Nice, dark wood and looks very sturdy when assembled correctly.  But I would never buy another product from this company as there is no way to get a hold of them when a piece is broken or missing!
This is a nice looking bench if you don't look too closely. The finish is rough and uneven in many places as if it were applied unevenly. This does not give it a rustic look but instead looks sloppy. The quality of the wood is poor. It looks and feels like pine, although it may be fir. It's definitely not a hardwood.The bench was shipped UPS and arrived in a thin cardboard box, not the usual sturdy box that I'm accustomed to receiving from Amazon. The pieces were loosely wrapped in foam. No bubble wrap, nothing to secure it but some tape. Consequently, I wasn't surprised that them main support bar (the curved one at the bottom) was split in half. Because it was split on an angle we were able to repair and secure it with zip ties. Looks a little odd but it worked. Several other pieces have cracks in them but were not broken all the way through.Since I received this as a Vine review item we proceeded to assemble it rather than return it. Assembly was very easy and we had the bench put together in about 10 minutes. The screws and hardware provided were high quality, better than the wood for the bench itself!I am using it by my patio table on the back deck. It seats two and is sturdier than it appears. Only time will tell how well it will withstand the rain and sun. If it becomes unstable for people to sit on, it will be re-purposed as a stand for some of my potted plants in the front garden.Because of the high cost ($89), the horrible way it was shipped and the broken parts (others have had the same problem so it's not just my UPS route), I am forced to rate this lower than I would have liked, but it's just not worth it unless the company makes some changes.
This product is very cheaply made.  Although my bench had all the parts and none of the wood was broken - it is very clear that the wood is very soft (probably pine) and will be a one-season bench.  The one I received also lacked the rustic 2-tone look that the Amazon picture presents.  Mine is stained a dark brown and it almost looks like it is painted.  The finish is not consistent and there are quite a few spots showing irregularity that could have easily been smoothed out when the finish was still wet.On a plus side - the one I received went together quickly (I would recommend using a cordless drill/driver).  The assembly directions were only illustrations and although they lacked detail - there was enough information to put this bench together with little problem.  My product was adequately padded during shipping and it didn't suffer any damages through the mailing process.Overall, this is a very basic bench that two people can sit on.  There is no doubt in my mind that it is going to wear very prematurely and frankly if you want to extend its wear - you probably should be storing it in a dry area when it's not in use.  I personally think that it is horribly overpriced for the quality and workmanship.  My Bench was a complimentary product through the Vine program - I really think that had I paid for this item I probably would have sent it back.
I applied the product as stated, still had problems.  I even threw it in a garbage can with 1 bag of garbage to see if it would scare anything off.. nope.  Luckily my garbage is far away from the house where it isn't a horrible issue and I can feel good I feed the critters all year round.
Maybe the neighborhood cats relieve themselves in the flower beds a little less often.  Maybe.  It doesn't affect the squirrels at all.  The Deer Off spray from Havahart works better at keeping the squirrels away but even that is only temporary.Maybe it will work better for others.  We have what amounts to a wildlife sanctuary in our back yard.  The neighborhood is full of pecan and oak trees.  Those trees are full of squirrels.  We have bird feeders to attract birds.  The bird feeders also attract the squirrels.  The birds and squirrels attract cats.  Sometimes the cats get lucky with a bird or squirrel but mostly the cats just hang out and turn the flower beds into latrines.  The squirrels destroy plants and containers and chew through wood trim on the house and get into the attic.  If the cats would only eat all the squirrels and leave the birds and flower beds alone it would be welcome.  Doesn't happen.  And this stuff ain't makin' it happen either.This stuff doesn't work for us.  You might have better luck...if you're not living in a wildlife sanctuary like we are.
This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients.  It even looks like pepper, and smells somewhat like pepper.  The three main, active ingredients are:#1.  Oil of black pepper:  0.48% by weight.#2.  Piperine (comes from black pepper): 0.185% by weight.#3.  Capsaicin: 0.032% by weight.The other 99.3% are "other ingredients".When you open the big blue jug, please note, it is five pounds by weight, but the jug is about 3/4 full, so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.I used it around the perimeter of my home, which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats, chipmunks, and deer.  I also have a pet dog and cat.  I did not expect miracles, and as with any product of this type, you need to accept that it is a deterrent, which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors, nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals, I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times.  Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property.  I tried a couple of applications in various places.  None of the chipmunks, cats, squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all.  I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions.  In fact, I ended up applying it heavier than instructed, and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.But, if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach, I do not see any reason to pay $5 or $6 a pound for this product.  5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces.  Since the active ingredients (various forms of pepper) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar, or about half an ounce, you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own, homemade powder for far less.For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs, I use a mixture of tap water, some chili powder and one egg (left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle), along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion.  So you could possibly not use the egg (attracts some animals, even when rotten) and add a little more pepper, dish soap or baking soda.  You'd end up with something that would work as well as this product.
I was hoping that this product would keep the squirrels out of the fruit trees, but it didn't phase them.One of our pear trees is far enough from other trees that they can't just jump from tree to tree, so I decided to try this product around it.  Less than an hour after applying the product all around the tree, the squirrels were crossing the band to climb and retrieve fruit.Other reviews seem to indicate that it work from some people in some situations, but our squirrels are determined to strip the fruit from every tree and this product didn't stop or slow that process.
I got this in the spray bottle and it works just as poorly.  I shake the product around my plants and it works fine until we have a dry spell and everything is withered except my garden.  Then NO-thing will prevent critters from raiding your watered plants.  What a disappointment.
This product is presented as a safe and effective deterrent for a variety of animals. The active ingredients are pepper compounds, the scent of which can deter animals. However, I've found that many animals aren't really affected by the application of Critter Ridder, either because it wears off quickly or isn't active enough in the 1st place. If you use it I would recommend a solid application in the areas where you'd like to repel animals, if it's too weak then animals can easily adapt and ignore it. Also, rains neutralize it, so it's a waste to apply it during rainy season. I believe you could create your own herbal animal repellents with plant oils and extracts and get better results than using these granules. The granules may seem convenient and safe, but so far they seem low on the scale of effectiveness.  The cats, dogs, and rodents in my area don't seem that disturbed by this repellent, and applying even larger amounts in hopes of making the application stronger would make the cost excessive.
I was excited to try this, as I've had raccoons knocking over my garbage and recycling cans for weeks this summer. I followed the directions and applied lots of this all around the area where my garbage is, even sprinkling a little in the garbage for good measure. I closed the lids tight. That same night, it was worse than ever-- garbage knocked over, trash all over the side of my house. By the time I saw it, there were flies swarming and birds picking through it... meaning that I guess flies and birds don't mind this repellent either!It would be one star except that I do like the idea that it's safe and approved for organic gardens-- but it's clearly not effective in all cases.It leaves a peppery smell in the area, and you're advised to wear gloves while applying it.
The major reason I wanted to try this product is that we have a strong presence of feral cats, plus raccoons and badgers come out at night as well.  I have a square lot running a little over a quarter acre.  One five-pound container was not enough to cover the entire perimeter, so a week ago, I concentrated it on the two borders where I have seen the cats the most.  No change; I just chased two cats out of the covered area this morning; the product does not seem to bother them at all.  In order to cover the entire exterior perimeter (four-inch wide band) of my lot, I would need 2 and  containers; the label also indicates that one application only lasts up to 30 days, assuming you apply it as directed, only on sunny, dry days.  The annual cost for me to use this product would, therefore, be:  2.5 containers x $27.09 (current cost per container) x 12 months, equals $812.70.  From what I have observed this past week, it would not be effective.
I had high hopes for Havahart's Critter Ridder.  I live in a neighborhood that doesn't really have any public space to it, so you often find people that walk their pets and use your lawn without respecting their neighbor's to clean it up.  There are also a few pets that roam freely and have their pick of lawns.  I used Critter Ridder around the edges of the lawn to create a border.  Most dogs appear to have just walked over the border of repellent and continued to use my lawn.  They didn't even appear to be affected by the repellent, so it wouldn't have helped to spread it over a larger area.I'm sure some pets might have not like the repellent, but I definitely could not recommend this as a general purpose solution.  There were too many breeds and kinds of dogs in my yard, even the very next day after using this.
I applied this liberally around our back entrance which is frequented by squirrels, raccoons, possums all who know what else at night. While most of these critters are not problematic, the raccoons are a nuisance and empty our birdfeeders and even our hummingbird feeders. After sprinkling this product around the entire area, the racoons (and squirrels) pretty much ignored it. I have found success with Deer Away spray which works much more effectively.
I obtained this product because we have cats and chipmunks that invade an area between our house and our shrubbery.The product is nicely packaged and easy to use.  I was concerned a bit about the warning label that suggested you contact a poison control center in case of contact with skin.  It was hard to believe it was that dangerous.  The coverage was also less than I would have thought for five pounds, but adequate for the job at hand.The material is granular with a not-unpleasant smell.  The smell was completely gone within a few hours of application.As a test, I set up a motion activated wildlife camera and recorded the area in question for about a week.  I saw cats every night (two different ones), chipmunks during the day and a few birds.  I then applied the product.Unfortunately, I have photos of the same cats and chipmunks in the same area after the product was applied.  There did seem to be fewer chipmunk visits- but the cats continued apparently unaffected.  The birds were gone, but I wasn't worried about them.Could be I did something wrong (or that we have strange neighborhood cats) but the product did not work for me.
We applied this yesterday around the perimeter of our house. Today I watched a squirrel come right up to the window next to where I was sitting and dig in the dirt where this product was applied. He stayed quite a while, dug up a nut and ate it while staring at me. I'm not at all impressed with this product and don't recommend it.
After trying this product, I agree with other reviews that it doesn't last 30 days.  The price point is high for what you get.  I prefer going to BJ's or Sam's Club and picking up a vat of black pepper and/or Cayenne powder and sprinkling it around any perimeter where you don't want critters and it is cheaper to use & I feel safer.  I've used the black pepper before around the perimeter of our home to deter black ants and it works.  We also use the black pepper & cayenne powder around our veggie garden to deter animals away.  We reapply as needed, but it seems once they know it's there, they find somewhere else to dine.  I've also used moth balls around my flower gardens to deter cats from eliminating in them.
Package says the active ingredients irritate animals when they touch or taste the product. Also lists that the poison control center should be contacted if the products gets on your clothing and contanimation of food and water should be avoided. Because we have young children and pets, I don't think we will actually chose to use this product due to saftey and ground water concerns. I would rather have pests dig up my lawn than end up taking our pets to the vet or the kids to the doctors for medical treatment.
This Critter Ridder says it is rain resistant and then at one point in their description says heavy rain resistant. When I received it, the weather forecast had a low probability of rain for the next 10 days; so trusting? that, since it was the best I could do, I spread this along my problem area for dogs. We have a sidewalk with a grassy median between it and the street and several trees surrounded by hosta gardens that it's been very irritating, in more ways than one, to find dog waste left in.The directions say to use gloves to spread it, but since the can is a shaker, it seemed much more handy to just give a shaking application that way. I spread it along the edges of the sidewalk and in a ring around the hosta gardens. As luck would have it that evening was one of those 10% scattered showers, not that heavy of a rain. The next morning there was no trace of the granules or the smell, which had a slight ammonia odor and there in the corner which had probably gotten a heavier dose because that is also where an area the hosta are was a huge pile of dog poop.That sort of destroys my opinion of this product's effectiveness.
This is a fine tool for very light use. Unfortunately, most of the tasks you use a garden knife for are anything but light duty. After losing my many-years old hori hori knife, I thought I'd try this, mainly due to the price. On the plus side, the grip is comfortable, and the notched point is a nice feature. However, the build quality is not at all suitable to the things I want to use a garden knife for, such as prying out major weeds, dislodging rocks, sawing small roots, and dividing dense perennial clumps, etc. The blade is very thin and it is not securely attached to the handle. Returned it and went for a more sturdy knife (AM Leonard brand) that works much better (albeit at a higher cost). This knife would be fine for very light use in light soil. It won't survive anything else.
I've had this knife for about 2 years and I used it moderately to divide perennials.  It has worked fine for that purpose until I used it for the first time this spring and the handle slipped off.  The big-grip handle is glued to the metal shaft and the glue seems to have deteriorated with age.  If you are interested in a garden knife, I would recommend something with a forged handle since these tools see some tough duty, glues and plastic aren't going to last.
Bad news, made in China. Good news, well-made. Nice wide tread (width tapered 1" to 1 5/8") and textured to prevent your foot from slipping off. Blade (6" x 4.5" x 15" long) welded to the oval steel shaft. Great "D" shaped handle (4 1/4" x 8 1/4" and screwed to steel shaft) at just the right angle for tough jobs. It is 47" long and weighs 4 pounds. Nicely balanced. UPDATE/CAUTION: This spade has a problem with the way the handle is attached to the blade. It is not welded all of the way around allowing water to get inside if you wash off the blade. I did this and the next time I went to use the spade it was rusty in this area. I have found Fiskars to be a good company that stands behind its products, so I contacted them. I explained the problem and they immediately sent me another spade. I thought the defect might have been an isolated problem but the replacement has the same issue. I like to take care of my tools and this rusty defect is enough for me to downgrade my rating from 5 to 2 stars. Not recommended.
I do a lot of work on my 2.5 acres of southern Florida yard. Everything grows fast, even in the dry season. I use saws, machetes, cutters, trimmers,and pruners depending on the task.  Pruning is a big thing for me since I had rotator cuff surgery on my dominant shoulder and swinging a machete or using heavier equipment is harder than it used to be.So I do a lot of pruning and depend on my chosen tool to be sharp, work properly consistently, and have a functional safety mechanism if provided. Unfortunately I can't keep this blade sharp, it seems to crush what I'm cutting instead of sharply severing it, and the locking mechanism continually engages when I don't want it to. Big disappointment.  Perhaps it's time for Amazon and other retailers to indicate on their descriptions where each product is manufactured.
Not only did the one I got from Walmart look identical (except for label Kelsyus), and cost 1/3 of the price, it is also holding up better.I bought the two at the same time and Kelsyus one won't hold air in the pillow.I've returned this one for a replacement and will give the company a second chance. Kelsyus has a good reputation but the two products I have bought from them have not held up.Update after a year:  I have now purchased a dozen different designs of floats and this design remains the most popular for use with young children because it's the easiest to climb onto, particularly with waterwings (life jacket).  My husband also prefers this design because more of your body is in the water.
I love the idea behind this, but it did not hold up well at all. The edges frayed and it started to fall apart quickly.
While I seem to be in the minority, I did not love this product. There just wasn't much activity on it. I put them in a high traffic area but they were left untouched. I did better with the repellent.In the end, I rolled these in a little tiny amount of PB powder and used them in a barn wall to get mice. They worked great.
This package contains six baits per pack and they are shaped like earthworms. The bait is made of mole-poison Bromethalin. I tried to use this to kill moles in my yard where there is significant traffic in the soil. The trickiest part is the proper application. I use a hard wooden stick or a metal rod to pierce a hole in the mound and detect the tunnel, and then drop a teaspoon full of poison pellets, when I am using Bromethalin pellets. Generally the holes are below the surface and the stick gives a reasonable measure of where the tunnel is. There are hits and misses, but you have to place this where moles can find it. I found it very challenging to put this into mole tunnels (the product is very wiggly) and finally gave up. I recommend Bromethalin pellets which are easier to handle and apply.
cut the worms in pieces, crushed the runs and waited for repair, baited each hole.  Waited days and checked, worm gone in some, but no dead moles, and burrows continue to appear.  I have tried traps, poison peanuts, more traps, more traps, more traps.  These moles seem to live close to the house foundations and burrow into the grass sod to eat worms each year.  One came up and died on it's own last fall perhaps from &#34;old age&#34;.  Nothing seems to kill these critters, as long as we have earthworms and sandy soil and shade.
This rat trap is designed pretty much like any standard mouse trap. You place the bait on the designated end, you pull the u-shaped bar against the spring and secure it in place with another bar that fits into a little hole on the same piece of metal as the bait. It wasn't too difficult to set up, though the spring is rather tight, and given the size of this thing, you'll want to watch your fingers. I tested it out a few times with a pencil to see how well it might respond to vermin.The first time I tested it, it took a couple of jabs with a pencil to release the bar and have the trap close. But every attempt after that, I had to literally force the bar to move in order to get the trap to go off. And frankly, my opinion is that if the trap is not going off when I'm trying to force it, it's not going to go off for a rat that doesn't have two hands trying to forcefully set it off. I chose not to set it with actual bait and then leave it anywhere because I didn't want it to just attract rodents without actually doing anything about them. We know we've got something that keeps coming to the front entryway of our house, we don't want to give it any reason to keep coming.
The above is just a suggestion that peanut butter is better than cheese as mouse bait.  The trouble is that even with the right bait, this trap is unreliable.  It just doesn't spring that easily.  So, sadly, I can't recommend this product.
We thought we had a rat in our barn, so this came in at just the right time... but lo and behold, no rats in the trap. It looked like the bait was eaten a little, but sometimes we'd find a tripped trap, but no bodies or body parts - so we're thinking a small mouse might have tripped the trap. After reading mixed reviews for the trap, I tried some testing with a stick to see how hard it was to get this thing to trip. I gotta say, other brands I've used (mostly Victor, I believe), trip much more easily... but it does have to do with the kind of bait you use. The purveyor of lore and cartoons will want to put cheese on a trap - but that is only effective if the rodent has no other food source... and there are usually tons of food sources they already have access too. The bait has to be irresistible for them to venture onto that trap with your human smell embedded in the wood... so I use peanut butter and it usually works like a charm. Rodents also tend to run along walls/baseboards for navigation with their whiskers when it's dark - so the placement of a trap is also crucial. My experience is that peanut butter has several things going for it. It's sweet - and rodents love sugary stuff. It's gooey and sticky - so the critter isn't going to take the bait and run with it - they're going to relish in their (hopefully last) meal as they lick the trigger vigorously to get the last morsel. Every trap I've ever used before has tripped and killed when I've used peanut butter. I lived in a house with roof rats and they were too smart to get into the live trap - so we had to lay out Victor traps - and boom - one right after another.So - that being said, I did testing with a stick and really poked the snot out of the trigger before it snapped. If tripped, the spring is strong enough that it would definitely do the trick - but I can see after lots of testing how people are dissatisfied with the mechanism. I did discover that if I carefully set the trap barely on the trigger, it's more sensitive - but it can also trip as you walk out the room when you do it like this.In a nutshell, I don't think I'd get this brand in the future - but if you lay enough gooey peanut butter down, they should fiddle with it enough to cause it to trip.
These are horrible. The soil clogs the bottom on the bulb so the water can't come out. Look cute, but they don't work
These were a waste of money. They clog up with dirt and don't work like they claim to. I wouldn't suggest them
This is one of the worst bird feeders I've ever bought.  It allows the birds to waste seed and the top doesn't stay seated.
I purchased one of these around 2 years ago at local HW place,  to find out Gilmour had moved to China. Gilmour used to be very good quality, but not anymore. Apparently most everyone has gone to China and the quality of these valves has really gone downhill, but not the price they charge you. This valve is really cheap and can't take much pressure and it got  a pin hole leak in the valve after about 2 years and I foolishly  replaced it with another one, to have it blow it out six months later as it was the only Y valve the HW had and I needed another one ASAP. I use quite a few Y valves/hose splitters  and 4 way splitters, so the 'search' was on to find something better.Here is how I rate the valves now after ordering them and studying them and using them.BEST1. Camco-Y  ball Valve/ hose spliter. Made in the USA, solid , solid brass with amazing full sized ball valves. High flow. Designed to also fit RV. Commercial grade valve! Hands down winner and same price as the Gilmour and made in the USA. Available on Amazon. This is superb valve.2. Achla Designs. Made in Taiwan but very solid and heavy. For commercial use. Available on Amazon. This is a great valve.3. Orbit Y ball Valve /splitter - Much thicker than Gilmour valve. And much cheaper. Made in China. Available on Amazon. This is a pretty good valve.4. Nelson Y ball valve/splitter-Nelson went to China not to long ago. Current valves are very lightweight and not suitable for commercial use. Orbit splitters are heavier and better made. Available on Amazon. This is acceptable if you turn the Hose bibb off and have lower pressure water lines.5 Melnor, more cheap made in China stuff, quality is not as good as Nelson made in China stuff largely as Nelson is has better finish quality. Available on Amazon. This is similar to the Nelson.6. Ray Padula- More made in China that is suitable for gardening but not commercial use. All of Rays Products are made in China and are very expensive. He's kind of what is wrong with the USA, marketing hype and advertising then off-shoring to sweat shops and delivering poor quality and hoping you're 'dumb' as he rolls in the money . Ray should have gone to college to learn mechanical engineer and manufacturing and learned what it means to be an American manufacturer. Give a 'lifetime' guarantee to try and convince you its worth the time to drive and pick up a new valve. His prices indicate he expects 2.5 valves to fail in your lifetime. Buy Camco and pay once and less and get made in the USA!!! Let Ray move to China, the Chinese want made in the USA for their own gardens.WORST---------------------------------------I wish someone with an engineering background or industrial background would write these reviews, but the made in China crowd would not make as much money replacing their blown out valves.I don't know why DRAMM does not make a Y valve or Hose splitter or if they do, why Amazon does not carry it.  Amazon carries some of their high quality nozzles and hose disconnects that are made in the USA and high quality.  DRAMM is the best when it comes to brass. Camco is the next best quality you're going to find.Stay away from that Made in China stuff, we send them fake money, with Pictures of dead Presidents and they send us fake valves that break down. Made in Taiwan quality is pretty good if you cant find American or Canadians products.
I used this along the perimeter of my front door, but since it's a powder, it scatters all over when the wind blows.  I don't recommend it for outdoor use unless you don't mind it blowing all over the place.  This product did manage to keep ants away, but I have yet to see any dead ants.  The tip doesn't really help with any sort of application precision...the powder mostly comes out in poofs.It might work at keeping bugs away in areas that aren't exposed to drafts.  I like the fact that it's "earth friendly" but I need something that I can line my windows and doors with and not have to worry about insect powder blowing AWAY from where I need it most.
I was disapointed to find that the reaction to this organic substance did not meet my needs.I have an ant problem in my house near where I keep my parrots.The population seemed to be less but the substance did not erraticate the ants.I am also concerned about pets that could injest poisons.Ironically a covering of table salt in the doorway and along the wall seems to confront the ants digestive symptoms and keep the pests more at bay.I used to use the typical ant traps with the poison that is spread to colony,but I am against chemicals that threaten my household pets.
I figured all hickory chips are basically the same; these prove that they're unfortunately not.I used Kingsford hickory chips (green/tan paper bag) all last summer in my old Weber, and grilled up some of the best BBQ chicken I've ever had.I recently ran out of the Kingsford, and picked up these Charbroil chips at the hardware store.I used the same technique as usual (soaking chips, putting in tinfoil, placing on coals, let smoke for final 15 minutes) and the flavor just wasn't the same. Not bad, per se, but not nearly as tasty as the Kingsford. These chips imparted a slightly more bitter, smokey flavor, instead of the stronger hickory flavor of the Kingsford.Unless I just got a bad batch, I would say you should go with a different brand of chips; I recommend the Kingsford.Happy grilling!
I cleared some drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard for fire prevention.  The gophers that were digging countless holes in the hard dirt of the slope decided to relocate to my backyard lawn.  It is &#34;ON&#34;, varmints!  I've tried gopher repellents, gas bombs, traps, solar spike deterrents, and baits, with varying results.  Why not give this Tomcat Mole and Gopher Bait a try?Dislikes:*Difficulty in locating lateral and main tunnels of gophers.  Lateral tunnels are plugged and concealed near the mounds while main tunnels branch out from the mounds.  Both types of tunnels can be founded with careful probing but my lawn's clay soil is too moist and usually just collapses rather than leaving a distinct tunnel.*Main ingredient is Castor oil.  The gophers I'm trying to eliminate are smart as hell and were not killed by this bait.*Unsafe for families with young children, pets.*Unsafe for the environment, e.g., wild predators such as skunks, coyotes, or hawks may eat the poisoned/dead gophers.Results:*I followed the instructions precisely and applied the bait to fresh lateral and main tunnels that I could find.  For the first two weeks, the gopher activity seemed to have ceased.*During the third week, gopher dug new bigger holes near the original mound (gloating that the bait didn't work).*There was a dead gopher found floating in my pool after the fourth week.  Uncertain whether it was killed by the gopher bait or just accidentally drowned while running across the backyard.Overall:Did halt the gophers for two weeks from digging holes near the original site but the damn critters simply branched out to other locations.  Uncertain on the effectiveness of the bait to kill these critters fast before they have another litter.  Now is the time to call a pro.
As I write this review, I can hear little critters scurrying around between the floors above my office. I have also seen mouse droppings on my kitchen counter. I baited aTomcat Snap Trapand aVictor Electronic Trapwith this attractant, and placed one trap in each area. So far no mouse has taken the bait.Up to this point, I'd say this product is a dud.
I used this with the Tomcat Spin Traps, which I received at the same time.  I'm not sure whether to blame the traps or the Motomco Gel Attractant.  There are mouse droppings in the areas where I placed the trap and I'm certain we have mice, but after almost two weeks I have yet to catch a mouse.
Some chunks are huge and some are more reasonable sized with one-inch dimensions. I found that when using charcoal lighter fluid to start the chunks, the smaller ones started quickly while the larger ones started on only one or two sides and never did ignite on all sides. For that reason, the smoke from the chunks was significantly reduced.I will not buy Char-Broil apple wood chunks again and will use apple wood chips and charcoal instead.
I've always admired the Wilton Armetale products when I would see them in stores. They are very attractive so I was excited to get this griddle and try it out.Upon receiving it, I first did a little research on the types of metal used in the production of this piece. I was a little concerned with the use of aluminum which I try to avoid for health concerns. I decided to try it out despite my concerns because I figured this would be used occasionally and not daily.It fit right on 2 of my burners. I made a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches using plenty of butter. They stuck horribly to the griddle. It was quite a job to remove the stuck on food. This was just the bread itself sticking too and not cheese which is odd, I've never had a problem with bread sticking to my pans, especially since I used butter. I also tried making saut&eacute;ed onions and peppers with plenty of oil. Again, horrible sticking and cleanup was a bear.I've decided between the use of aluminum in the product and the sticking that I'm going to use this as a large and very pretty trivet and tray. I've found it nice to place on the table and set dishes on. I also sit it on my counter and place a lit candle on it.Pricey for just a tray or trivet but it is quite attractive. I recommend using an old-fashioned cast iron griddle. You can't beat them.
I have tried using this griddle to prepare several different types of dishes, but I have yet to have a single dish that did not stick to the griddle and make a mess. And since you can only hand wash it, the mess is even more a problem to remove.As one of the other reviews said, this is better used as a serving dish or the keep food warm, I cannot recommend this griddle as cookware.
I bought this to do vacuuming up of mango leaves.  I have no desire to blow things around so I wont assess that.  But for vacuuming, the suction isn't very impressive. Only small nearly dried out leaves get readily vacuumed in.  Larger leaves or leaves still freshly green are too heavy to be sucked into the tube.  So in the end, only about half to 2/3 of the leaves at any given time get sucked in.  Unless you like the unfinished look of only half your leaves being picked up, the rest you will have to rake.  What's the point of the machine if you still need to rake.  I do enjoy its feature of chopping up the leaves into fine particles so it saves on bag disposal and for that I may use it upside down just to feed large amounts of leaves into it for waste processing. But otherwise, the motor seems too weak for massive suction.  I realize the limitation on a 15amp circuit can only allow an electric motor so much power, but still this product seems way overrated to me.
I really liked this grill cover when I got it. It was attractive and felt heavy duty. I used it gently to try and preserve it for more than a season, but unfortunately that didn't matter. I got a large tear on a corner within 1 summer, and a 2nd smaller rip by the second season. I garaged my grill from October-April 2 years in a row, so this never saw anything more then rain showers. I've patched the tears up with gorilla tape on the inside, but I'm really bummed that this didn't last longer, especially with one adult owner who tries to make things last.
This *was* a well-made grill cover and though the smallest size was too big for our grill, it served us well for the first year. After the first summer, it started fading pretty badly; the bottom color is now a purple-ish color. After the 2nd summer, I noticed tears on the top, towards where the handles are. Now on our third year, there are multiple tears and the "fabric" has become brittle and tears easily. For what I paid for this item, it should have lasted longer. Each time we remove and replace the cover now, it tears a little more. So, expect to only get about two years out of this before it starts tearing (if you look at other reviews, you'll see they have the same issue, too).We do store our grill and cover in the garage 4-5 months out of the year, too.Would not recommend. Will post pics later today.
Initially, like many of the reviewers here, I was ecstatic with my grill cover.  The quality, features, and heft of this grill cover is impressive out of the box.  Unfortunately, you get about a year from this cover too -- two years if you are lucky.  And I've own two of these covers so I don't think it was a fluke.My environment though is more extreme when it comes to sun damage.  I live in the Phoenix, AZ area, and my grill sits in direct sunlight for about 75% of the daytime.  We don't get much rain here, and a few of the 2-star reviews felt that the rain caused the demise of their grill cover.  In my case, I think it was the brutal AZ sun.I also read a few other reviews where they noted their cover still looks good.  Well, other than some fading, so does mine but don't let that fool you.  You have to look up close and see that the interior water barrier is no longer holding and will make cracking sounds as you move the cover.  This may lead to water spots or rust on your grill of course.  The cover also weakened and will start to rip once it gets to this state.  Finally, and more concerning to me, there is a residue power all over the grill cover (both outside and inside) after two years.  I don't know what it is.  Does it have PVC in it from the PVC undercoating?  Is it getting in my food and in my lungs?  I don't want to risk it any longer so it is going in the trash.I can therefor only recommend this grill cover if it isn't in direct sun or direct rain for most of the time.
I like to consider myself an educated woman, heck I build furniture in my spare time... but it took me the longest time to figure this thing out... and I ended up leaving it laying in the corner of my deck when all was said and done. First off do note that you're only getting the black wire/metal portion... you'll need to supply your own actual flower box, plan on something lightweight (like those plastic ones) and personally I'd keep it to the 24&#34;. This just isn't all that sturdy and even if you're lucky enough to have a railing it actually fits I feel like it wouldn't take much weight. We have an older wooden deck and the top portion is really thick, the only way I could make this would be to sort of bend it, maybe attatch extra bolts, I really just couldn't work my mind a way to attach it that looked & felt like it would work. In comparison I bought two of these last year CobraCo English Horse Trough http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NKYWO0/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and they were super easy to install and even came with the liners so I didn't even need a box, I just had to add dirt and plant my flowers. They were left up all year and still look brand new. I'd recommend spending a bit more and going with something better. I think this will end up in the trash.
Parlez vous francais? (The instructions are - only - in French!)Once you figure it out, you are left with a wire extendable contraption that is quite flexible.  It struggled to not flex when I put in a ceramic window box - forget about filling it with heavy damp soil and plants!Note:  The flowerbox itself is not included - just the black wires shown.It is probably best for those cheap plastic window boxes you get at HD.  Not for higher end ceramic or heavy wood window boxes.
First of all, the instructions came in French from a company in Pennsylvania.  Go figure.This was very confusing to put together notwithstanding the french instructions and the pictures that didn't help at all.  Once I figured it out, it would NOT stay put on the deck railing.  Had to use fish wire to hold it flat.  Part of this brand new box showed signs of wear and was discolored.  It did the job with some 'fixing' on my part.This is a lot of money for something this poorly made and lacking any kind of quality control.
Parley-vous? All of the product info. is in French, which may be why it is temporarily unavailable. Perhaps they'll get a translator and reprint the instructions in English.Consequently, you pretty much need to guess how to use it, based on the illustrations. I was interested because it's supposed to hang over the deck railing, which it seems to do, but there are also screws and holes, which suggests that it may not be sturdy enough on its own. Since I picked it out specifically because I do NOT want to drill holes, this is not reassuring.The metal supports seem surprisingly flimsy. It's better than dollar-store quality but not by a whole lot. Yes, you can hang it, add a box (wouldn't it be great if the box could be included), fill it with soil, etc. but I just don't feel confident that it will hold up without bending out of position over time. I would suggest the lightest possible box and the lightest possible soils---perhaps even a bottom layer of foam packing peanuts just to fill up the space without adding weight. You would definitely want to make sure the box you choose has excellent drainage, because rain would also add more weight to this.Bonne chance.
I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product.  The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense.  If it was that easy, there wouldn't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening.  But I don't buy a dedicated germination kit.  The standard seeding kits available for $3.00 are fine.  I have one I like for the windowsill, not because I love the brand or soil it contains, but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL!!  That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly.  The cost is ridiculous and, if you really want to heat your seedlings, then put an electric blanket or throw under them.  You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket, the seedlings start a bit earlier.  And if in a colder area (basement/attic) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear.  But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area.  If you want a smaller area, fold the blanket.  Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70, but your environment may be different.  Don't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate, these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money.  If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you can't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window, then get a heating blanket and a grow light.  Much cheaper in the long run.
This bird feeder is very attractive in the yard, but it is a little of a pain and messy to fill up. Once it's hung though, it looks great.  So far the birds haven't found it, but I will keep watching and update the review once they do. *Update* After a couple days, they definitely found it and they are loving it. I just looked out and there are 4 sitting on it.*Second Update*After about two weeks of having it up, the birds are going crazy for it.  I looked out today and there had to be at least 40 little ones trying to get to it.*Third Update*I ended up taking this feeder down. It was a pain to fill and a pain to keep clean.  It's fine in dry weather, but with the rain we get it just turned into a soggy mess.
I really wanted to like this valve, it's made in the USA and the construction is much better than most of the Chinese counterparts. This valve seems to be made of high quality materials (machined brass mostly) and feels solid, but it has a few issues and a major design flaw.I had to return it because it would not work on any of the 4 hoses I tried.Pros:-------------------------+ Made in USA+ Brass Seems DurableCons:-------------------------- The female end of the valve has only a few threads, it will not fit on any of my standard hoses without leaking water everywhere. This is a major design flaw.- When the lever is in the "On" position, it extends out past the brass body and interferes with connecting this unit to anything other than a small diameter hose, such as hoses with padded handle areas or even Dramm's own quick connects.- There is a warning label that comes on this product which states it contains lead and chemicals which are known to cause cancer. It would be nice if Amazon included this information in their description.- Expensive compared to similar products. I don't mind this considering the construction and that it's made in the USA, if only the product would work properly.
This feed did not work well for me. It is more expensive than many others, at $2.40 a pound, but there was a lot of waste. It seems to be only Black Oil Sunflower, Cracked Corn, Millet and Milo. The Sunflower was eaten readily, but I could have bought that alone far cheaper. The snow in my yard is covered in what looks like teeny, tiny rabbit droppings...the Milo the birds have tossed off the platform feeder. There is also more corn than i like to see. It is not eaten by many of the birds, and I always worry about corn stored in plastic developing aflatoxins and killing the birds. I will not buy this again.
I usually use the Catchmaster brand traps, but saw these in the store and thought I'd give them a try. While they have the same design as the Catchmaster (basically a cardboard triangle with a sticky interior and a scent lure to attract the male moths) they don't work nearly as well. In the same cabinet, the Catchmaster trapped over a dozen moths; the Safer only got one.I'll be sticking (sorry for the horrid pun) with the Catchmaster from now on.
Update 5/10/14 - after using these traps alongsideCatchmaster Moth and Pantry Pest Trap: Three Packs of TwoI am seeing a huge difference in the number of moths trapped between the two brands. The Catchmaster does a much better job in a side by side comparison. Where I might have about 10 moths stuck to the Safer Brand, I have over 100 on the Catchmaster. I will be purchasing the Catchmaster Brand from now on.We had tiny little moths that seemed to come into our home from packaged grains that we purchased from the grocery store.  Once we had them, they just seemed to multiply.  I didn't want to use toxic sprays or cleaners in the pantry so I was happy to find these easy to use pantry pest traps.  All you have to do is fold the traps into a triangle with the sticky stuff inside and open the little dot with the pheromone (a scent that attracts the moths) and drop it into the trap so it sticks on the side.  Then just set the trap in an area where the moths are.  You won't be able to smell the lure, but the moths will.It takes a week or so to trap all the moths, and each trap lasts for up to 3 months.  I was surprised at how many moths it trapped.  We also used one in the garage near the bags of bird seed and thistle.  Moths seem to be attracted to that too and we caught a lot of them in there.  Two thumbs up for a safe and effective product.
Some time ago I wrote a glowing review about this seed but the last batch was sub-par at best. There was almost no sunflower in the mix and the sunflower seeds that were there were small and dried up. The main ingredient was millet. I'm very disappointed.
This must be about 75% brown seeds, which for some reason our wild birds wont eat. So the price is great if your birds like this stuff but unfortunately ours don't and it just gets thrown out of the feeder.
my backyard birds are picky about the grain in this mix and no birds touch the sunflower seeds which seem to be most of the mix in this bag of seeds. I have to dump out the feeder to toss the sunflower seeds and will not buy it again as it does not work for my needs to feed my wild birds.
This injector has not worked for me at all.  I find that it is only really useful for liquid injection and even then, it is difficult to assemble (the parts aren't mechanically perfect) and injecting it into meat such as a chicken breast results in a lot of projectile splatter of the marinade.  Hurray, salmonella on the walls and ceiling!I'm giving it two stars (instead of one) because I hold hope that someone with greater skill could make this thing work wonders for them.  For me, it's a wasted $20.
This is very nice edging but if you buy it here or at Walmart.com,  you don't get the 10 stakes.  Home Depot sells the same edging WITH the 10 stakes for the same price.Update - November 2013 - I've now installed 8 rolls of this edging in my yard.  It's easy to install, and looks great.
I live out in the country. There aren't any houses around me, just a big, huge, cornfield. The farm that the field belongs to is about 1/4 - 1/2 mile away. So, between us is just this big huge field that starts next to the opposite side of my driveway. We get a lot of flies from time to time, and it can get worse during various stages of the farming/treating of that field. I thought this Victor Fly magnet would be a good product to help make our time out on the patio a bit more enjoyable. It didn't turn out to be very useful though.It is super easy to use - you just open it, fill it with water and hang it up. So, no problem there. You do want to be sure to hang it a very good distance away from any area that you will be using, because this thing STINKS. Even if you have it placed pretty far away, if the wind blows right, you still get a nice whiff of it and your face will instantly curl up.I have had it outside for a month now. There's maybe about 10 flies max in there. I have moved it twice to try to get the stench further away from us. The flies do not flock to it and they do not seem to be enticed by it or drawn to it at all. More so it seems they just end up in there by happenstance and not because they purposely went in there due to being specifically attracted to it.I will leave it up and see what happens. Maybe once there are more flies in there, it will attract even more flies...or something? As of now though, I wouldn't recommend it especially if you were hoping for it to help on your patio area etc because you cannot actually place directly on or near your patio due to the horrid stench. You have to place it so far away that it will basically (in theory) control the fly population in that other area - that's if they actually go into the trap.The idea of this thing is that even if it catches just a few flies, it helps overall because those few flies aren't reproducing. Flies apparently reproduce mass amounts at light speed, so even if there are just a few flies caught, you're overall reducing the number of future flies by the hundreds. This really isn't an "immediate area" type of control like citronella candles would be, but more of an 'entire population - in the long run' type of control.
I hung this up close to the back of the house and boy did it stink of that smell exclusive to rotting trash. Because of that, I was sure that this would work, but it's been out there for weeks now and only has about five flies in it. I find this strange, given that I had the open trash can sitting quite near it while we had work done inside the home and there were large families of flies hovering above for days.The trap is easy enough to put together--fill it with water up to the line and make sure the lid is sitting on it right so that there is room for the flies to fly in. The string it hangs on it long enough to put on a branch.I think the sticky fly strips work better than this.
To repeat what others have said, the battery compartment is terrible!The curved top has grip ridges that are useless, I had to pry the top off.Once inside the battery holder defies imagination, curved plastic meant to hold the batteries impede the insertion of the batteries which barely fit in the plastic holder that isn't even the same piece of plastic of the "trap".This really does look like a hobbled together prototype!Following the prototype model, wires inside the trap are exposed, if a rat found this device unarmed, I would expect it to be disabled due to chewing on the exposed wires which are connected to the shock plates.The trap entrance is quite large, an adult can easily insert their hand, perhaps making it easy to clean, but also seemingly dangerous if there is enough of a shock here to kill a rat. However, this seems like it would be effective for chipmunks or squirrels as well..There is no bait holder, you simply smear some through the large holes on the opposite side. These holes are actually large enough to allow a mouse in which could explain why some user report bait loss with no kill.It is also not very apparent that the trap has been triggered. tiny, dim blinking led? Great idea, so I have to get into the small area to check or pull it out daily?Opportunities for improvement:1) Battery cover2) Battery holder3) exposed wires in the rodent area4) I would make the shock plates removable for cleaning, with wires hidden under the plates soldered to something that would make contact with the plate when installed.5) Needs a removable bait holder for easier cleaning6) Smaller grid on non entry side ( or bait in center with dual entry )7) Personally I would add flap doors to each side that would make the apparent entry smaller, rodents are more curious about entering enclosed spaces with the smell of food inside, the large open end is not ideal.8) Audible beep, like a low battery smoke alarm, should be used to identify either low battery or after the device has been triggered and needs to be checked.
To call this a trap is being very generous. It arrived in a fairly thick cardboad sleeve which turned out to be of much higher quality than the trap. Included were 4 "C" cells and a packet of Jif Peanut Butter. The top of the unit has a curved plate with several shallow ridges which presumably are intended to assist in removing the plate to insert batteries. The plate defied removal since the surface is slippery and the ridges are not deep enough to enable a firm grip. With the use of a miniture pry bar the plate was eventually removed. Out of curiosity, the plate was reattached and removal was attempted again. No luck to do so without the assistance of the tool. Apparently the intended method of removal is to squeeze the sides of the plate and it would just lift off. That did not work with this unit nor did any other method that was tried. None of the other reviews mentioned this problem. Interestingly, the bottom of this worthless item falls off very easily.Anyway, back to the top. Inserting the batteries was not the normal simple task because the design of this unit is to make battery insertion a chore. After completing the battery insertion task it was time to try out this alleged trap. Recently I had the crawl space encapsulated and the workers removed two dead rats who met their demise due to some rat strips I had placed previously. I thought that it would be better not to have to touch the dead rats by using this trap. I placed the peanut butter into the trap, turned it on to check the green light blink, held the bottom from falling off and located it where the dead rats were found. When I later checked on the trap I noticed that the peanut butter was gone and the trap was empty. I had some jars of peanut butter in  the kitchen so I reloaded the trap. I did this for several days with the same results.This trap is nothing more than a feeder for whatever type of rodent or other creature has a fondness for peanut butter.
I followed the directions to a tee and I have yet to catch a single critter.The idea behind this trap is great! Allows for fast and easy trapping with little to no mess. A true "No Touch" design. Just dump the critter out and you're done.The issue seems to be that the rodents don't like it/completely avoid it. Not a single nibble on the peanut butter or ANY of the baits I tried.So I either have no mice or unwanted rodents (doubtful since the TomCat bait I set out gets nibbled on) or this thing is a complete waste of time, effort, and money.
I have to admit that I was really looking forward to receiving this contraption.  I have a lot of suet and bird seed stored in a shed in my yard that mice have been continuously getting the better of.  I have used a lot of the old fashioned traps that work ok most of the time.  But the idea of zapping the little buggers and then just dumping them out quick and easy like appealed to me.  Unfortunately this new space age take on an old theme leaves a lot to be desired.  I have to start by mentioning the horrible battery compartment that other reviewers here have well verified as being,...Well, just horrible. It fools you at first look that it will be easy for its right on top of the unit.  However once you start trying to insert the 4 c batteries included, you will find it a total exercise in frustration.  I had to eventually use a screwdriver, as well as in the end ask for the aid of my son in holding down the batteries already inserted in order to get them all secured.  Its horribly tight, cheaply made, and I challenge anyone to get the batteries in this thing without using some very colorful metaphors.  Once armed and hot, the instructions are pretty simple. Load bait, place, dump the dead rat.  The first night that I used it, I caught a mouse, and continued too on and off for several hours.  I would say that about one time in three either the trap failed to work, or some scholarly mouse found a way to get to the peanut butter bait from behind without entering.  But this traps lack of a total kill ratio is not my major complaint with it.  I think its a great idea that this model merely represents an early prototype of.  First up is the electric shock that some other reviewers here re portably got while loading the batteries. That didn't happen to me, but the fact that it happened at all to anyone else is totally unacceptable.  I have used tasers and stun guns of all kinds in the past, and have never once suffered an accidental shock while just handling the batteries, or the outside of the unit.  This trap is very cheaply constructed, and the fact that some reviewers got a shock from it shows that either it is poorly insulated overall, or that the quality control on the unit is most lackluster indeed.  There has also been a couple of stories in other reviews of traps arriving with a wire exposed, or the casing misaligned, and some just quitting altogether after a very short amount of time.  Overall I feel this trap needs either another look at its design, or at least some much better quality control.  I judge it unacceptable the way it is.A couple of last points worth mentioning.  Although it should go without saying, this thing is an absolute no no to be used around crawling infants, or any little kid that could just comes across it and finds it fascinating.  If this trap is able to detect a mouse or rat entering it, I can't imagine it having any problem with mistaking a small hand or arm probing around its innards, and thus activating its shock. A very painful one for a youngin' to be sure.  Finally, the brief instructions instruct you to insert a little peanut butter inside one of the bottom holes of the plate in the rear. This metal plate is not removable at all, and thus over time would have to be cleaned by your sticking your hand inside the unit and scrounging it out manually that way.  Very inconvenient.  Also, a couple of times the peanut butter disappeared with no mouse inside the unit, and I do believe that they managed to get at it through the back, without the trap actually malfunctioning from inside.  A really bad design flaw in my opinion. All in all, I find this trap very poorly made, somewhat dangerous, not well thought out in its design, and finally too expensive in my opinion for what you get.  My suggestion, pass on this deal and look eleswhere...
We tested 7 different products over 9 months, and came out with a clear winner (traditional Victor trap).We didn't catch a single rat in the Victor Electronic trap - but I suspect it's because we were catching Norway rats that are pretty big, and we suspect the electronic trap is too small for them. There are many reports here of this trap working - we wonder if users would have caught their rats faster using the traditional Victor, & also we wish the other users would say what kind/size rats they are trapping.We baited all the traps the same (the Victor web site has great advice if you need more information on baiting & identifying the type & quantity of rats you have). Also, we rotated all the traps, so the rats had an equal chance at each trap. Additionally, the Victor Electronic successfully trapped/killed crickets, so we know the basic principle works.Results:*Victor Old Fashioned Rat Trap- 8 Norway Rats (caught 8 of 9)*Tomcat Rat Snap- 1 Norway Rat (caught 1 of 9, but did NOT kill it - maimed it, and left a bloody mess everywhere. This one gets an extremely reluctant recommendation, only if your rats are trap-shy around wood traps)*Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap- Zero (O)* D-Con Baitbits - Uncertain - They ate this but later were caught by a trap. These take 3-10 days to take effect, but then the carcass can wind up in a wall, under a floor, etc. Uncertain how much of a dose is necessary to kill a large rat such as a Norway. Probably would have worked by itself, but traps are preferred so you can measure effectiveness & dispose of carcass properly.*Tomcat Block Bait- Zero (0)* D-Con Rat Glue Traps - Zero (0) - This might work for mice, but an awful idea for rats. Just makes a mess - avoid!*Tomcat Old Fashioned Wood Trap- Zero (0), but the rat steals the bait every time. Tomcats do NOT snap. Just like a real Tomcat we once adopted - he would find rodents and play with them, tease them ... but not kill them. I even whacked the trap with a broom handle and it still didn't snap. Makes you wonder if the rat designed this one!Hope this helps - thanks!
The reviews for this seem to indicate that people either love it or hate it.I've had bait stolen out of this trap so many times, and not one dead mouse/rat.  I've changed the batteries, moved it around, tried different bait, etc.  Nothing.I love the concept of this trap, but the quality/efficacy seems to be hit or miss.
We have an intermittent rat problem in my neighborhood. It's partly intermittent because one of the neighbors puts down a lot of poison.  As we have pets, this is not an option.We tried this trap on numerous occasions. The set- up is pretty easy.  We never caught a rat or anything else in here.  Could be they were too smart or could be the neighbor got them all... but it didn't work for us.
looks like it will work... came with batteries... came with a little bit of peanut butter... the 'blinken light' came on when turned on... but, but...after careful placement in line with an observed path, not a single rat after several days of hope for giving a single rattus rattus the chair!on the other hand, my three $2 glue traps nailed five over two nights, with two two-fers!those dirty rats! they must have known what what waiting for them!
I've used this a few times now in an 18' above ground pool. I am able to clean the pool well enough with this pool rake. If held just right, it does a decent job of picking up the settled debris. I do not have any trees close to my pool so I don't have many heavy leaves to contend with as most pool owners do. However, even with my smaller-sized pool and only light debris to pick up, I will be amazed if I can get through one season with this pool rake. It is very flimsy and the net is not attached well to the frame. It's cheaper than many pool rakes but I've had better rakes in the past which cost less. This pool rake doesn't begin to come close to being a professional type pool rake or resemble anything near being heavy duty. I am having to be overly slow and gentle moving this rake through the water.
I have been using a bag-type skimmer ever since we got the in-ground pool.  I thought this style would be handier; I could scoop up some leaves, swing around, and deposit them outside the pool area.  Not so.  The skimmer doesn't capture many leaves, or anything else, at all.  Maybe I don't really know how to use it correctly, but it doesn't work for me.
Well, the price is OK, but while I expected some of the ladybugs to be DOA, it looked to me that out of 1500 about 300-400 came dead.  I will look for local suppliers in the future.
Item arrived fine, worked great out of the box.  Difficult to get the smaller bugs as they seemed to fly through the racket, or get pushed by the breeze created from swinging it.  Seemed better to let them fly into it than try and hit them.  Worked great for about a week.  Then dead.  No reason for it to be dead, just dead one day.  Changed the batteries - wasn't the batteries.  It either shorted itself out or the internal wiring came loose.  Really wish it had held up, but poor quality turned it into an expensive toy for a short life span.
