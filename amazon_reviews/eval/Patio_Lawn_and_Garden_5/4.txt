Good USA company that stands behind their products. I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you. I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.
It's probably one of the best hoses I've ever had.Pro's:- It's good enough for most front yards, or small back yards.- It has enough flow (and with the right head) to water plants 25ft away from the nozzle, and water your garden.- It's light weight, and flexible (it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I've owned)- The hose is flexible, yet strong. I haven't cut the outside yet.- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months, and the rubber hasn't cracked yet! I believe it's good quality rubber.cons:- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition!
So far so good! I have not really had the time to test out the hose as it is cold weather time right now. I bought this Gilmour hose based on all the recommendations. I am looking forward to not having to wrestle the hose to use it.
Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses. You stand behind your product and provide great customer support..  But I am only giving you 4 stars  because this hose and the 100 footer I bought  a few months back seem to kink more than my older Flexogens not sure why ?
There is only one thing wrong with this design:  the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently. Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape. That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications. It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.That said, the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair.
This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.
I've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me, too. It killed me to spend so much on a sprinkler, but I've probably sunk so much on junk sprinklers in the past 10 years and bit the bullet after reading the reviews for the Raintrain. Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.  No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered. It doesn't get much simpler.The spray is low and slow so everything gets watered more effectively and there is less evaporation. My lawn really looks better than it had when I used my old sprinkler.I use this in my garden  and it does a good job keeping all my perennials and herbs staying healthy and lush.This sprinkler is well made and worth the higher than average price.
There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a &#34;traveling&#34; sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it.
This looks like it will be a great piece of equipment.  I've used it a couple of times so far and have been impressed.  The only problem is if it hits a soft area of the yard, the wheels can sink in and it gets stuck.  You certainly can't just set it and forget it.  It needs to be babysat every half hour or so to ensure it is still moving.
BEEN USING NOW FOR 3 YEARS.  SLOWLY REPLACING ALL HOSES WITH THESE. KEEP THEM WRAPPED IN A WIND UP STORAGE CONTAINER AND IT LOOKS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE MANY YEARS OF QUALITY HOSES.
It wouldn't be too difficult to design a wider cutting blade that would create a wider 'trench' (although the motor might need some beefing up to handle the additional load) and it would be great if it was easier to get more depth too (it's possible but requires a little backyard re-engineering).  It's worth what it costs, though...I'm basically satisfied.
GOOD
-Quick and fairly easy to install- Seems to be of good quality- Only option I know of for replacements for the B and D trimmer- Too expensive as someone already noted. The retail price is even more out there so I'm glad Amazon cuts the price in half, but still expensive per roll.
These are the refill for my weed whacker.  They work fine and are easy to install.  It is always good to have a few extra to replace the spent roll.
...I wish B&D would make a refill that held more than 30 feet.  Otherwise, it's a good product.  I would give 4.5 stars if I could.
got these for my b&d 20 volt trimmer- fit perfect, and no problems. a little expensive, now rewind myself, but will purchase more in the future for my lazy days!
What can you say about replacement string. But, in 3 packs, more economical. It is fairly easy to replace. Good product
It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something, may that would be a different story, but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well.
This one has one bulb (versus 2 in the larger units).. I've found that these last a couple of years with regular (daily) use.. My last one lasted about two years - and when it went out, the problem wasn't the bulb - it was the transformer in the top of the unit.  It runs silent (no audible humming from more than a few feet away).
....to really tell if it works as we are short of mosquitos this year and I have not attached the bait that comes with it to attract what there are.  I have had several of these in the past and they proved effective and this should be the same.  Bulb cost is minimal thought limits advertised effectiveness to a half acre.  I'm not sure how they figured that out but our deck is 20 feet from a small pond that hatches these guys and this little machine should be OK to zap 'em.
Thus far after a week has done a good job but have to use a blower every day to blow out the debris, Bulbs are good and I run it24/7 thus a good buy, Having lots of mosquitos I bought to ofthe 1/2 acre ones thus put them in different places around the home here, Big plot of land here in rural area of gulf coast, Does not get them all but sure helps a lot
For instance, if you want the bugs off of your patio, do not install it on the patio.  Install it about 25 feet away, and you will be amazed at how well it works.
We have had a very wet summer here in Georgia and the bugs have been horrible. This was a great price for what you get and does the job.
I just threw away one of these  that I've had for over twenty years. I later found out that what I thought was an electrical issue, was really only a bulb gone bad. Well, anyway, I bought a new one and it looks a lot better than the old one, and seems to work just as well. Not sure just how many mosquitoes it's killing, but there's a pile of insects on the deck below it every morning.
For all the negatives, I am giving it 4 stars because it does it job so well.Pros:-It does it job well.Cons:-Power cord is not even a foot long.  You will always need an extension.-Loud, but I don't know any effective zappers without that kind of noise especially when it get bigger insects-It does not have a pan to catch the insects so expect to see a little mess at the foot of the zapper.-Not a very attractive design
Can't speak to the 1 acre coverage, but, it does the job for the back deck. Not as loud as other bug zappers we've had and that's a good thing.
We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener.
The local bird population was eating all the raspberries a day or two before they were ripe enough for us. This thwarted them!It is a bit tricky to put on by oneself. I recommend at least two people if you have much of a span to cover.  We will be buying more.
We made a PVC "greenhouse" framework and stretched this over it to keep birds and hornworm moths out. So far, it's working pretty well.Great stuff. Can get hung up on the roll when you're rolling up what you don't need. Cheap enough to throw away at the end of the season without pain.
I bought my garden claw several years ago. I was looking for something to help turn compost into my vegetable gardens.The criterion I was looking for was something inexpensive that wouldn't break the bank the way a tiller would. But would still get the job done without causing me to be laid up with back pain for a week. For the most part I have been very pleased.We have 2- 12'x12',and  2-8'x8' beds  along with a few smaller freestyle plots, and we mainly use the claw to add compost and cow manure to them every Spring . With the claw I am able to quickly mix in my amendments, and to loosen up the soil about a half foot down in next to no time. If I want to go extra deep, it does take a double dose of clawing , but it is worth it in the end. And it really is not that much extra work since the soil has been pre-loosened a bit by the first go around.As far as starting a bed from scratch, I have used it to start new plots, but only after the sod has been removed. I do think it would be a tough chore to try to do a new bed from start to finish, with only the Claw,and without removing the grass first, but not impossible.When weeding I find it invaluable for use in between rows. It is a breeze to simply stick the claw into the center of a clump of weeds and give a twist and a tug and be done.My one complaint is that the handle has come a tad bit loose. It is still perfectly functional and it took about 5 or more years of good solid use for that to happen, but for someone with a larger plot who uses it more often it may be a concern.
This is a handy tool for cultivating small areas, but it is not appropriate for anything more than a medium sized flowerbed.  The handles work well to gain leverage, but you will feel it in your muscles if you  attempt to do too large an area!The fact that it isn't powered lets  you get into areas you wouldn't want to go with even the smallest of  tillers, and it does a great job of breaking up the ground to a depth of a  couple of inches, which is perfect for flowers.For larger projects, use  a mini-tiller, and use this tool for the detail work and the smaller beds.  Both tools are a good combination to have at your disposal.
It's a classic all right, but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing, however, is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut.
I wish I could say that I purchased this mower after seeing Al Gores "inconvenient truth" and my life was changed by it.  The truth however is that I finally got fed up with my old power mower failing to start for the ump-teenth time after repeated repairs and promises of it now "running like a champ".  This old time mower will take some getting used too, and also don't kid yourself, it doesn't do the job as easily as a power mower by any means.  However on the plus side you will never again suffer through a mower that fails you, needs fuel, requires any real maintenance like oil changes or plugs, and best of all if you take care of it, will be the very last mower you ever buy.  The only way this mower will up and quit is if you do.  Any maintenance it does require is easily handled by a screwdriver or wrench.  Even for those whose knowledge of small gas engines doesn't go much beyond kicking it and swearing when it disappoints you. I fully agree with the reviewer here who stated it is best used on pristine lawns with lush healthy grass. (Unfortunately a lot of people that have lawns of such quality often don't cut their own lawns. If you happen to be the exception, read on) This mower cuts thick grass of reasonable length straight and evenly very easily.  Where it fails you is on long loose weeds fluttering in the wind.  The mower passes right over them no matter how many times you try again and again to sever it.  I solved that problem by putting a little more effort into trimming with the weed whacker, and leaving the heavy grass to the mower.  And it by far is most efficient when used regularly once or twice a week.  A time table you will find effortlessly fits most peoples lifestyle since the mower is so light and easy to use that mowing the lawn will no longer be an all day Saturday event.  Unlike lawns where power mowers are used that usually get long and seedy looking in between jobs, you will find yourself taking this mower out far more often just to hit the "high spots".  Thus your lawn comes to have the appearance of a man that gets his hair cut every three weeks and thus never looks like he is long overdue.  You can also get away with using this mower early in the morning or late in the evening since it makes very little racket. And one last thing, I didn't notice much difference in the physical effort needed to push it considering that most people use walk behind push mowers in any event.  Aside from having to use it a little more often, and its lack of cutting power on long weeds, I consider this mower to be well worth one's investment.  You will eventually come to find your lawn never looked better.
I ordered my Scotts 20" Classic Mower on Earth Day and because I had to put it together, I finally used it for the first time in mid-May. I wish all I had to do was put in two screws and be done but there were 5 big pieces to the handle and lots of little pieces (fortunately almost all the same set of pieces). I could put it together with only a little difficulty and I don't have much practice at putting things together. I couldn't get the E-rings in. My husband managed that.The handle flexes. I wondered if that was needed to handle the bumps, but after using it I don't think it is. I think it is just cheap. The mower part feels more substantial.  It is made in China. I wonder how many years of not using my gas mower it will take to make up for transporting this from China.In the reviews people talked about it stopping suddenly. I had the same issue. I have a very small yard; it is level except for a few odd little depressions. At those spots as well as at random moments the mower would freeze up. It happened some times when the clippings kind of got clogged on the back guard. Other times, I could not see why it stopped. It went right over the small sticks in my yard, which I was happy about. On the other hand, all the dandelions just bent over and snapped right back up after I passed over them. I had a few spots where I went at the grass from a few directions before it mowed. Once I got it going it tended to keep going, but every corner meant a full stop and then had to try to get `er rolling again. Next time, I'll see if I can figure out a way to mow with less full corners. As I said it is a small yard, so I'm not sure it will work.Overall I am happy with the product except for the issues I mentioned above. I didn't want to spend too much, so for the price this is about what I expected. I plan to use this every other time I mow. I'm keeping the gas mower to get through the weeds and plants that are out of control. As I'm growing more native plants and food, my area of grass is decreasing.
I have about six-thousand square feet of lawn.  This mower handles it quite well.  There's some effort to push it, but it's actually easier in some ways than using a power mower; for example, the lighter weight of this mower makes it far easier to change directions in a tight space.  It's easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.  Also, it's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself, simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn, and this, in turn, makes it more likely that you'll skid on any mud.  With those limitations, however, I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower.
It's 9:00am on a beautiful Saturday morning.  The air is a little cool but the sun feels warm on my skin.  The Northern Cardinals are singing and I hear a Golden Fronted Woodpecker chirping in the tree above my head.  As I sit on my back porch and sip my coffee I feel content and happy.Then, my next door neighbor fires up his ridiculously over-sized riding lawn mower.  A few minutes later the guy behind me joins in.  I head inside.  Another Saturday morning ruined.  I decide to make a  point.  Later that day the neighbor is hosting a bar-b-que in his backyard.  As he is tending the grill I chat with him for a while.  He has over 30 guests and they are all having fun talking to each other and laughing.  I announce that it is time for me to mow my yard.  His eyes get big and he stammers "N..n..now?"  Yep.  I roll out my brand newScotts Push Reel Lawn Mowerand start mowing right next to his fence.  None of his guests even noticed.  He happily offered me a beer and a brat when I was done.  This mower makes life better.EDIT:  I received aFiskars reel mowera month ago through the Amazon Vine program and, to be honest, I like it better.  I still like the Scotts but the Fiskars is easier to use and requires less maintenance.
Winter is not the most appropriate time to review a new lanmower, but the truth is that the (coarse) grass was around 6 inches tall. It took two passes but got mowed very nicely. I think this one's a keeper.
This is my second germination set I've ordered in the last two weeks.  This one is even flimsier than the other one by Hydrofarms.  However, the concept works:  place peat pots of seeds in a warm, humid environment and seeds will sprout.  I have mine on a heating pad under a grow lamp.  The peat pots only expanded to just under an inch.An aluminum pan with a clear lid would work just as well, as the metal would distribute the heat better.  I found the lid popped off easily so I check on it several times a day.  I have beans and turnips growing in my peat pots.With care I intend to reuse the pan and lid for multiple uses.  For new gardeners this is an effective way to grow seeds.  I could also place peat pots in sealed plastic bags for cheaper, though. I will report back in a week when the first seeds sprout.
We have several traps to deal with the mice that love our garage - this trap works well, but the one improvement would be to have the case transparent so you can see the contents.  When the mouse goes in, the trap rocks and the door closes and latches - this all works well, but the trap frequently closes without a mouse.
This works well, but you cannot tell if it just tripped or if caught any.Sometimes it is tripped empty and that locks the door so it has to be reset before it can catch again. On the other hand, this is really low-cost and you can buy a lot more.
I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps, bees, etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise, great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy, so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb.
These guards look like they would work well to deter bees.  However they do not fit most of our feeders.
Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however, there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well.
Attaches to any regular outside spicket or your washing machine line.  Seems to read ok, but I'm not 100% sure because I do not have anything to compare it too.  I think it would be beneficial to have a professional with professional tools measure the pressure as well to ensure the most accurate reading.The one negative I have is that the gauge fills up with water under the glass.  I'm not sure if mine is defective or if they are all that way, but I would think the water should not seep in like that.
I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review
This is a short piece of hose.  It may not be the colour shown, so don't buy it if you're using it for decorative purposes.  If you want it to function, it will.Yes, it has a plastic washer instead of rubber.  If you would happen to have a leaking problem, just add some teflon tape (which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure) - it only costs a few cents a roll.As this is the cheapest such item to serve its purpose, it gets my recommendation.[Mine is red and green, apparently for Christmas].
I bought this to relocate my hose reel in the backyard, and it has proven to be a decent buy. I have had no issues with leaking, and that's all that I can really ask for here.
I used this in the shower because it is a tough brush for skin, but don't use it on sensitive areas because it is a strong wire which can damage the pores of vital areas if you know what I mean.

I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn't heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles.
Probably the best grill for this price range! Got one for my parents and compares well with my Weber 18" for grilling! My only nit pick are the legs! You may have to tighten them down from time to time to keep the wobble out! But, back to grilling! This is one nice little unit, burgers and steaks cook up quite nicely! The secret is knowing how to use the upper and lower vents for heat and smoke adjustments! Once you have that down, you can whip up some serious munch with this puppy! Have done some excellent k-bob's and burgers and steaks have come out just as nicely! Have used Webers hickory chips for smoked meats and the flavor was delicious!After each use, clean out ashes and you will have consistant bbq! Put a piece of aluminum foil in the ash pan to catch the ashes! Wrap it up and dispose of neatly. To  help season the upper and lower grills and get rid of that metal taste and smell, I placed the grills in my oven! Preheated to 325 degs. and baked for about an hour! House stunk like hot steel for awhile, but no metal taste, the first time I used this grill!
The grill appears to be of good quality but the assembly instructions don't match the parts that were shipped. The instructions show how to attach the air vent which comes attached with a rivet from the factory. There are more parts than are needed. You can assemble it! but you will be confused. End product is satisfactory. Why do they call it the Smokey Joe Silver when it is black? Poor choice of names.
The Weber Smokey Joe is a great portable grill as far as cooking quality is concerned but there are a few issues.First the good. You get a decent size grill area for an ultra-portable grill. It measures at 14 1/2 inches in diameter. Sure you probably can't do much with this grill if you are cooking indirect, but that's not what this grill is meant for. The grill cooks much like it's larger cousin - the Weber One-Touch. The porcelain enamel coating helps prevent rust. There's a vent damper on the bottom of the grill (as well as the top) so it's quite easy to control your temperature, much better then any other portable grill I've owned anyways. The ash-catcher works well enough to keep hot pieces of ember from falling to the ground.As I mentioned before, there are a few caveats. My main complaint is that this grill has no lid-lock. This makes transportation a bit cumbersome, especially for a grill that is meant to be portable. You have to buy the Gold or Platinum version to get this functionality. I believe all portable grills should be easy to transport. I use a couple bungee cords to lock my lid down during transportation. Another small issue I had with mine is that one of the legs is a bit shorter then the other two, so my grill doesn't sit as evenly as it should. This isn't a big deal because Weber has great customer service, it's not that big of a deal anyways, it's just a little off. Finally the top grate doesn't fit very tightly so it wobbles around a bit - again a small issue. One other thing I should mention is that even though it has an ash catcher, it doesn't have any sort of One-Touch type of system, so you have to dump it to clean it (the vent damper doesn't quite do it).  This isn't an issue at all for me because it's very light and easy to clean anyways but I thought I would mention that for those that might be curious.All in all this is a great portable grill. For my wife and I this is a great grill to use even when we aren't going anywhere because it needs so little charcoal. Cooking on this grill definitely feels like I'm grilling on a baby version of my One-Touch. There are a few issues that keep this grill from getting a perfect score, but don't let these small issues keep you from buying this great grill. Personally I believe it's worth the $5.00 to go ahead and upgrade to the Gold so you can have the lid-lock, but it's not essential, like I said before a couple bungee cords do the trick if you need that functionality. Happy grilling!
Setup was easy on this grill after I realized that I will have to scrape the tabs of the ash catcher ring down the small leg posts. At first I did not like the idea of scraping my nice new grill, which is why I temporarily stumbled on the instructions. They pop in nicely once you get past this. The 3rd leg kind of twirls on which is quite obvious once you start fiddling with it but the instructions have no words so the pictures are not as self-explaintory as I would have hoped in these 2 areas.My only complaints on this grill are the legs and the handle. The legs were wobbly and not as secure as I would have liked them and they were installed all the way to the base of the grill (as the picture showed)  some nuts and bolts would have went far in this area.The handle gets to hot to handle with bare hands. especially when doing large meats like roasts or whole chickens. Wood would have fixed this problem. I wrapped mine with some small rope (not string) and it helped a little.All said and done it's a great grill. Get it.FYI-The Weber 87886 Chimney Starter is incredible and it's only 12 bucks. Get that too.Weber 87886 Chimney Starter
This grill performed as advertized in the reviews here.  Assembly is easy and takes less than a half hour.  The cooking time is longer than other charcoal grills, but is more uniform because of the ceramic cauldron reflective characteristics.  I also bought the stainless steel tools and the tool holder.  The latter ships separately from another company and the shipping/handling is about twice as much as the tool holder.
After our gas grill had to be retired, we decided to get a charcoal grill.  Weber has a reputation for having a solid product that will last for many years, and I have no doubt that we'll be using this for a long time.  But the legs seem to be made out of somewhat cheaper material than what we had when I was younger. Think I'll be getting the cover to protect it over the winter.This particular model doesn't have the one-touch ash catcher and after using this a few times, I'm kind of sorry we didn't go with that particular model.One person can put it together without help, athough it can be a struggle for a bit.Grilling?  Well that's exactly like you'd expect although I miss having a grated shelf to keep some items a little further from the charcoal.  That just requires a difference in how you mound the briskets.
First the good. I love the looks of this grill. It is sleek, styling and iconic and I enjoy seeing it on my porch.- It is much more attractive than one of those monstrous gas grills.- It seals very tightly.- Its simple style allows you to cook many different meats in many different ways.- There are so many accessories available for it and they are easy to find.Now the bad. Besides the black metal kettle part, everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal. I wouldn't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic. Again, I would not buy a children's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let's face it. This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill. You are paying for quality and looks. I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply isn't a viable competitor right now. If there were other options it would not have fared so well. I feel like Weber has taken advantage of their good name and market share and is allowing their quality to suffer.Shockingly, I would buy it again.
I love this grill.  This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap.  The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on.  In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on.  I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method.  The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.My only complaint about this is its size.  Its great for direct cooking steaks, chops, etc.  But to do some more long term smoking of ribs, whole chickens, its a little small because the coals get too close to the sides of the food and some parts might get scorched.  If you do a lot of slow, indirect cooked foods, go for the 22 1/2 inch weber kettle grill.
easy to set up but they got the apple and didn't stick around to say thanks for the snack.  maybe next time
I caught over 18 rabbits, 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort.
This works well, but be sure not to buy this for smaller rodents, such as squirrels or rats.They are too small and light to trip the mechanism that swings the door closed. I've used this trap to catch large opossums and it's the perfect size. The animal was not harmed and we were able to set it free without touching the little fella. Recommended.
This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your "out o sight" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as "Mark the Mole Man") came to our house, I showed him our "out of sight" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, "Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'." As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience. Go get your nasty little critter with this trap, but don't follow their directions. Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos.
Having been unable to create a method of capturing marauding mice and teleporting them unharmed to another galaxy, I resorted to a humane trap, intending to drive them several miles into the county and release them to find their county mouse cousins.  Alas and alack, the mice were able to enter the humane traps, retrieve the bait (peanut butter on a bit of cracker) and exit the traps with the bait.  Perhaps they work in pairs with one holding the door open while the other goes in for the food. With a heavy heart I next purchased a pair of these traps. For many nights the mice could count on their evening meal, the bait strategically placed in various places in this trap. They walzed in, dined, and left, no doubt laughing their little tails off.  It seems a human with a master's degree in psychology is no match for the average rodent.  Then, wonder of wonders, last night the traps actually lured two hapless diners to their death. My delight was short lived upon reading reviews here that the mice do not die instantly, but might suffer for a time before expiring. What's a person to do?  My advice, if you do purchase this type trap, is to use just the smallest amount of bait (my successful last night bait was cream cheese) which I rubbed the entire length of the pressure activated metal strip. I think previously I was using too large a piece of cheese or cream cheese. I suppose I'll continue to use the traps, as I have to get this problem resolved though it's awful to think of them suffering at all.
This is a refill package only and requires you have already purchased the Victor Flea Trap. Our experience with the flea trap has been very good and we have noticed the trap catches anything that happens to stray on its surface.The refills install easily and quickly. We have had to install a new bulb in the trap but that was also easily done. We leave the trap behind a sofa in the den and have noticed a steady decrease in trapped fleas as we've used it.This is a good supplement to flea control and can be safely used with pets.
This is a review of the refills, followed by the same review as the trap.  The refills are easy to use, they come with a separate protective layer for each refill and it's fairly convenient to use the protective layer to cover the old, flea infested sticky trap when replacing it with a new refill.  Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.For the trap itself:I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It might work, but I wasn't willing to wait that long.
The head is attached to the shaft securely and doe not feel like it is going anywhere.  However, the individual metal tines bend quite easily and care should be taken to ensure that they are straight, or it is going to make your thatching job harder than it needs to be.Also, thatching a large lawn by hand really sucks!
This thatch rake is great for SMALL spots.  If you plan on doing an entire yard, go rent a machine.  It takes a LOT of effort to use this rake on Augustine grass in Texas.  Having said that, the rake works as intended and is high quality / durable.
Not for the faint hearted but a great arm exercise. This thing does pull up lots of dead grasses. Had this for more than 18mths now and it is one of the better tools. But with 5000 sq ft lawn, this is not a long term solution. The metal teeth will bend inwards if you use it forcefully enough; especially when lawn is wet. Not a big deal but can be frustrating each time you try to straighten it back. I'll continue to use this tool for small areas. For whole yard maintenance, I've upgraded to an electrical detatcher. [Greenworks 27022 14-Inch 10 Amp Electric Dethatcher - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTQOPVBA281X/ref=cm_cr_ryp_cmt?ie=UTF8&channel=ryp]
- Many different modes of patterns to choose from- Fairly cheap feel, but it works, and for the price I can't complain.- Doesn't quite seem to get the water pressure I like especially on the more concentrated stream settings, but again for the price its a useful nozzle.- Mostly used for washing the car, and the 7 settings come in handy there.- Amazon delivered quickly
The construction and material are sturdy, no complaints about that. All the settings work great. There is just a missing option I think. There's &#34;Center&#34; which does the center holes, &#34;Shower&#34; which does the outer - but not one that does both. Need more water for the plants!
I finally broke down and bought a more expensive pair of pruners than usual. The blades on these are great! Small branches and more cut easily, quickly and cleanly. They are certainly a lot more comfortable to hold than the cheap $7 sheers I've purchased in the past.My biggest issue with them so far is the orange hold-close tab broke almost immediately. They have a life time warranty, but of course I threw away the receipt and all of the packing materials.
I've had this pruner for several years, and I've used it for a variety of tasks, including pruning roses and other bushes, to trimming off small tree branches. I've even used it for branches that were probably too thick for the tool, but when you have it handy, sometimes you use a tool for a purpose that it wasn't intended. Even when I try to go through something too large, it hasn't broken or jammed in such a way where I couldn't remove it and take it from another angle to finish the cut. That shows how durable it really is.I've had no issues with using this pruner for all those tasks, as it allows me to trim individual faded rose buds with one hand. The spring-loaded handle keeps the resistance at the right amount so it isn't necessary to fiddle around with it just to keep a decent grip.If I were to lose this pruner, or if it were to finally break, I would not hesitate to purchase another one as a replacement. I'm very satisfied with it and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of tool.
The gear mechanism does assist your chopping power.This is a solid branch cutter and as long as you clean your cutting edges,the tool should operate for a long time.
There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes, it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper.
I purchased this at Home Depot.  It can cut 2" or even 2.5" branches with relative ease.  But there is one issue.  The cutting blade broke at some point.  I didn't notice it until I had problems getting the cut to go all the way through.  However, I went to the Fiskars website [...] and found out the live chat button and explained the issue to the customer rep.  She sent a new one out that day and I received it in 3 business days.  Installing the new blade was very easy and it worked just great.Over all, this lopper is a joy to use.  The movement is smooth and the cuts are clean.I wonder if Amazon will ever sell the replacement blade, though.
I love how powerful these are.  I have cut up to 1.5" diameter with this...any larger than that and I reach for a saw.My only complaint is that to get the large branches, you have to open the handles up all the way due to the power gear (almost180 degrees apart).  The limiting factor is cutting branches is whether I can open the handles far enough apart where I'm working.
I'm really weary of buying things that are made in China. Fiskars is located in the USA. I'm unclear on the reason (RICH EXECUTIVES AND GREEDY BOARD OF DIRECTORS) why they would manufacture these snippers in China. Brings me down.Anyway. These are QUITE nice, very lightweight -- you will not be cutting anything more than thin plant material with these BUT they do reach in very nicely, nice thin blades. This operates on a naked steel wire spring, not a coiled spring, so I'm curious how long these are going to last. Comes with a thoughtful little orange plastic cone for the business end of the snippers.These are significantly superior to bonsai-type snippers or repurposed manicure scissors. Ideal for deadheading flowers. I love garden tools and these snippers are a real treat.
I bought these to trim the leaves from my cannabis flowers and they work well for that. For any jobs that require more strength, get yourself something bigger/stronger.They're not perfect, they're not for heavy-duty cutting, and they're made in China.But they cut. I kept a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol around to clean the trichomes off the blades periodically and had no problem getting through my entire crop. My hands were sore,  but you'll have that after trimming a pound and a half of high quality cannabis.  To help ease the pain, I smoked some cannabis. Worked for me.*I am a fully RCW 69.51a compliant medical cannabis patient*
I always have this tool on me when I'm in the yard.  It's perfect for dead heading dense flowering plant without accidentally snipping the neighboring blooms.  It has a very sharp and strong blade so you can cut only using the very tip of the sheer.  Because the point is so narrow and sharp, it comes with a orange rubber sheath to protect the blade while it's in your pocket.My only gripe with this tool is the flimsy orange clasp which breaks off very easily if you are not careful.  I've owned several copies of these sheers and I've manage to break off the clasp on all three of them by clipping branches a little larger than recommended.  Fortunately, the orange sheath keeps the blades closed, assuming you don't loose it.
I had to go with 4 stars because Amazon stated it was 7-inches long in the description but it's only 6-inches. I checked the Fiskars Website and they show it correctly at approximately 6" in length... but it's exactly that length and the cutting edge is 2". I have a large hand and the length does make a difference for me and I kept pushing the locking lever closed because my hand covers it and my thumb pushes the latch forward. I did trim some lilac bushes with it and it's pretty easy to use, feels the same in either the left or right hand and is quite sharp. However, since I have about 30 more bushes to go I'm going with the larger pairFiskars 9920 Garden Multi-Snip with Sheathand these will fit much better in my wife's much smaller hand. If you have a small hand they you'll likely be going with 5 stars because I can't find any other issue with it.
A great feeling splitting axe. Very comfortable in my hands and allows me to split wood easily. The overall sharpness of the blade isn't what I expected though. I expected much sharper thus the 4 star rating.
The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions.  Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width, length and height.  Not saying the info is deceptive, just not as clear as it might be!  I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.  I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid...which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I didn't plan to sit on it anyway.
This is the second of theses reels I have purchased.  The first one broke after much use due to the stress and a heavy hose I had installed.  This time I purchased a much lighter weight hose and it works great.
This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent, everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First, the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem, I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second, I grilled on it 2 days ago, on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks, should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars.
I bought this a replacement for one exactly like it.  The old one finally was put to rest after many years of use by my parents.  This compact grill is easy to use and uses up very little space.  Perfect for a small deck.  Great construction and easy set up.  The one drawback was that the new grill did not come with the two side tables that the original grill had. I took them off the old grill and installed them on the new one.
I hung this trap about 20 feet from an underground yellow jacket nest.  For the first few days, not many yellow jackets were trapped, I was not impressed.  I went out and shook it up a bit, making sure that the attractant was properly dissolved in the water.  Next time I checked, this thing was FULL of stinging insects, yellow jackets and a few hornets.  There are still some yellow jackets around my deck, but a lot fewer.  We can now sit out there without fear of being stung.  This first trap was a test drive, I am now ready to purchase more of these things.  Would like to purchase another three, but Amazon only has ONE in stock!  Bummer.  At least I know that they are  not a waste of money.  I do worry about the bee population, but I cannot have them so close to my house.  My kid is being stung, we cannot enjoy our deck.  The bees have to move outta town!
beware -- do NOT have in enclosed spaces....even just walking by it makes me want to gag!!  but the flies love it.  they have such bad taste
We had a fly problem a few years ago, so I tried these traps. I was very impressed with the sheer number of flies it caught (my wife was just disgusted). This year we had a bigger infestation, so I tried theRescue Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant #FTA-SF4and they were nearly ineffective. I purchased a few more of these disposable traps and they're amazing at attracting and catching flies. The smell, however, is quite bad and is almost more offensive than a few rogue flies.The major advantage of this type of trap is that it works in the daytime, when flies are active, unlike an electronic trap like theFlowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer (One Acre Coverage)(which I also purchased).The irony, I found, in having such effective attractants is that you get more flies. I moved my traps to the far side of the yard, away from the house, and suddenly we have fewer flies trying to sneak in the side door. (Obvious?)
In the $80 range with no shipping or tax, this is worth the money if you need to prune tree branches on a regular basis as I do.  My husband loves it and thinks the construction is superior.  Unfortunately, I have difficulty working it.  He's 65, and I'm 59 and don't have the arm strength/length nor the the height (5' 3" and under are going to have trouble) to work it properly when it needs to be fully extended. Any man should have no difficulty, and it will pay for itself the first time you use it versus hiring someone to prune for you.August 30, 2007 update:  Since December 2006 when I bought this, I have been forced to use this more because my husband has been unavailable due to his golfing addiction.  In spite of my shortness, this tool works fine for me as long as the trunk of what you are cutting isn't more than one and one-half inch in diameter.  However, there is a saw attachment which will allow you to get through the thicker branches.  Over time, this tool has become indispensable to me, especially since I have six redwood trees, numerous other treees, and tons of high bushes.August 16, 2011:  Fiskars has terrific customer service.  After almost five years of heavy use, a plastic clamp that holds the extension, broke.  Know that Fiskars honors a limited lifetime warranty on this item.  I had to send them a copy of my Amazon receipt and a picture of the damage (picture cannot exceed 2 megabytes). Full instructions on how to make a warranty claim are included on Fiskars' website, plus their telephone customer service is excellent.  They sent me a new part plus a link to complete instructions, including pictures, for disassembling the pruner and replacing the part.  My husband was able to effect the repair.  There was no dollar cost to me at all, and this is way better than having to buy another one for $80.May 28, 2014:  I still use this pruner regularly, and it continues to work well after the repair.  The only problem is that you do have to watch the thickness of the branches you are cutting because this pruner will only tolerate so much.
excellent product, already done with winterizing trimming around the house, when I first pulled the cutting bowel and branch fell down, my wife instantly said " magic", that's how I felt, too. But then moving on to larger branch and switching to cutting saw and that's when problems occured, first the wing nut which were used to tighten and positioned the saw were being knocked off by the tree because of the push and pull motion; which un-screw the wing nut, went down and look for it, after finding it and tightening it up super tight, back to work and the extension poll fell out also caused by the push and pull motion, pick it up, slided it back in, tightening it up and figured out how the rope and jaw reacts to each other and did some adjustments, and it works fine ever since, I'd give it a 5 star if not because it took me 30 minutes to find things and fixed  and adjusted it the first time I've used it, other than that, it's a great helper to make things possible.
This is a nice, light weight tool for trimming small branches high in trees and shrubs.  It easily cuts branches up to 1/2 inch.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is my experience with other Fiskars' tools with the same type of adjustable head. The head is a weak point, after a few months of use my experience is that the plastic head will fail.  Even though it has a lifetime warranty; returning for repairs is just too difficult to be worth the trouble.
Each time I cook with my grille, I use this around my waist and have all my utensils handy and ready to go, what I did was just hang it upon my belt and it works great, unless you use suspenders or don't wear pants.

I bought this to retrofit it on my Genesis platinum series 2 gas grill.  The reason why is that the factory installed tool hooks prevent you from opening the lower grill doors with tools hanging from the hooks.  These are stainless steel and I have figured out how to do this so I am going to relocate them to the side of the work table on the grill.  They will work and last with a little customization.
The tool holder works well.  There is a little leakage of smoke, but I don't think this reduces the quality of food preparation or changes the temperature of the grill.  The tool holder ships from a company other than Amazon, and the shipping/handling costs are more than the holder.
I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times, but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great.
This rotisserie is made for weber 22 inch charcoal grills.  I got this from amazon and it shipped in record time.  This is a simple accessory with few parts.  There is the skewer with the two prongs that slide over and screw onto it to hold your meat in place.  There is a big ring that sits on top of your kettle and the lid goes on that.  There's a screw-on counterweight to help with even rotation.  And then the motor that slides onto a bracket on the aforementioned ring.  That's it.  Basically no assembly required.  Do you like beer can chicken?  You won't bother after using this.  I'm not a chef so I can't explain how spinning the meat around makes it so good but it does.  Juiciest bird ever, seriously.  Also does roasts well with excellent results too.  I haven't used this for a turkey but I can't see how that wouldn't be outstanding as well.  The motor is quiet, if you care about that kind of thing.  The plug attached to it is ridiculously short so you will probably need an extension cord.  I recommend keeping the box it comes in for storage because otherwise it's kind of bulky and random in the garage.  The only criticism is it's expensive.  But it's one of the coolest BBQ things i own and would buy another in a heartbeat if it was stolen or broken.  But Weber doesn't make them anymore!  So if you are thinking about this, buy now before they are gone forever.  I wish I could get extra prongs for the skewer so I could do two of whatever I am doing without have to jerry-rig it.
All you have to do is pick this thing up to know that it's hollow plastic parts. And all you need to do is sit on it once to know that this is one solid little stool.The manufacturer's catalog that came in the box shows that their other products are children's toys that are built for punishment, yet no so dangerous that they'd crush a child. They've carried that same quality construction through to this little stool.The wheels are a little on the small side to carry my 230-lb body across a patch of healthy lawn with ease, but it wasn't so difficult that I would have to stand up and move it, either.I find it a tad inconvienent to reach under the seat to get to tools. There is a cup holder on the outside, but it's design is such that it isn't good for anything but cups or cans. The one thing I'd like to see here is some other sort of outside storage for tools instead of the cup holder.The all-weather plastic means you can leave it outside, but it's lightweight design means you can store it on an upper shelf, too.All in all, the solid, but lightweight construction makes this one a keeper.

I really like this bird feeder but not for the fact that squirrels can't get into it. I have two dogs that make sure that doesn't happen. Heck half the time they don't even let the birds on it. But I love it because I went out the other day and four of my six bird feeders looked fine and had seed in them but when I inspected them the seed mix had gotten wet and clumped up so it no longer would come out of the feeder. Not this feeder! The water can't get in to the seed area because the squirrel begone hood. This was the only feeder that was completely empty even though it was the newest edition and held the most seed. It's a hit with me, the birds, and maybe even the dogs!
This is a study feeder, with a tube 4.5" in diameter.  The seed comes out the bottom of the tube into a small tray that goes around the tube.  The birds can feed through 4 holes in a metal sleeve that is suspended by a spring from the bottom of the tube.The main selling points on bird feeders seems to be 1) How squirrel-proof is it, 2) how long will it last, and 3) how much does it cost?  I will add a 4th of my own requirements, and that is how deer-proof is it.  I have had deer come in Winter and tilt myPerky-Pet 7103-2 Copper Triple Tube Bird Feederfeeder and drain the whole thing in a night.  The hoof-prints in the snow gave them away.  ;-)So this feeder appears to be both squirrel- and deer-proof.  Tilting the feeder does lose some seed, but it does not flow out very easily, especially when the bottom part is pulled down like when a squirrel or deer is trying to get into it.  The top dome also tilts when weight is on it, which will certainly cause squirrels and chipmunks to slide off.  I think it's a good design.How long will it last?  They claim a heavy-duty, powder coated finish, which I assume is over standard steel.  The spring inside the bottom part to make it tilt I assume is steel as well.  So this feeder will likely rust in maybe 5+ years, and once the spring rusts away, the bottom will fall off the tube - the spring is the only thing holding it on.  You will have to get a new spring from Perky Pet.  Aluminum or stainless steel would be better materials.How much does it cost?  This feed is on the expensive side, especially not knowing what materials it's made of and how long it will last.  I would wait for a price-reduction from the list price.
We have quite a few mature trees in our yard which provide an ideal place for bird feeders. Anyway that's what I thought when we moved here. I hung several of the birdhouse style feeders and in no time the squirrels and chipmunks figured out how to scare the birds away and skillfully scatter their meal on the ground. I watched some even work in tandem to steal the bird food.Perky-Pet has recently released their latest in a line of anti-squirrel bird feeders. They call this one the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler (Model 397). If you have ever observed a rodent at work, they are clever and persistent in their desire to secure food and housing for themselves. As you can probable see by the photo this bird feeder has a long clear plastic seed tube that makes up the body of the feeder and providing a visible place to store the bird seed. The bird feeder dimensions are 25 in. H x 11.7 in. W x 11.7 in. D; the seed tube is about 4 inches in diameter and will hold a substantial amount of seed, up to 3 pounds! Here is a promotional blurb I found on this product from Perky-Pet:"Best Used For: Attracting and feeding birds without allowing squirrels to get the seed. This unique squirrel-proof feeder will increase your bird traffic while minimizing seed lost to squirrels."This feeder has an attractive shiny metal saucer-shaped lid (or as Perky-Pet calls it "a dome") that connects to the top of the plastic seed tube. There is a hole at the center of the saucer to connect the two parts and at the same time provides a place for a ring to be fastened on the top of the dome for hanging. The dome is part of this new squirrel-baffling bird feeder, along with a very cleverly designed metal base that comes already attached to the bottom of the seed tube. There are four holes (or ports) about the size of dime around the metal base right through the seed tube. These holes are the feeding ports. Small perches are also attached to the base in front of each feeding port and are made out of metal just like the base for durability. Considering the dimensions of the perches and the feeding ports this bird feeder is obviously made for small lightweight birds; No crows or pigeons allowed!Now let's get to the patented weight-activated base and other features of this squirrel-baffling bird feeder. The smooth metal dome is not secured tightly to the top of the seed tube which allows it to wobble around when any weight is applied from above or below; like from a squirrel or large bird. According to Perky-Pet: "The dome tilts and wobbles as well to throw squirrels off balance who try and land on the feeder." This also applies to those pesky crows that dominate our backyard in the mornings, scaring away the smaller birds we are trying to feed. Likewise, if weight is applied to the base, such as by a leaping squirrel, chipmunk or a large bird, the base swivels like a bucket under their weight, automatically closing off access to the feeder ports and preventing the loss of seed.There is very little assembly required. Perky-Pet has included an excellent sheet of instructions that are easy to follow and is written in English only. In fact, there are only two steps to complete assembly. All assembly applies to attaching the dome to the seed tube; everything else comes already assembled. During assembly one thing concerned me. The seed tube is plastic and there are two small holes on opposite sides to attach the dome to the seed tube by poking the ends of a metal bracket through the holes. This feeder is not light and once 3 pounds of birdseed is added it is quite heavy. In my opinion, this is the weakest link of the Perky-Pet bird feeder. In order to prevent a future disaster I decided to drill-out the small holes so I could insert a 2-piece hard rubber grommet into each new hole. This allowed me to still insert the metal bracket as designed while also providing reinforcement for the plastic seed tube. Only time will tell whether my modification will prolong the life of the feeder, or not.Perky-Pet has three short and informative videos on their website explaining (1) How the Squirrel-Be-Gone Baffler works, (2) Where to place your bird feeder and (3) Instructions for cleaning the feeder. You can Google the website by typing the following in your browser window: perky-pet squirrel-be-gone baffler model 397.I had originally intended to hang the bird feeder on one of my wrought iron shepherd staff hanging poles but decided not to when I realized the bottom of this 25-inch bird feeder would only be hanging about 3 feet off the ground; much too low and inviting for the numerous non-flying animals that roam around my backyard. After I watched the videos mentioned above I decided to relocate my bird feeder to a higher point and nearer to our birdbath; I also added a hook to the end of the metal strap I am now using to hang the feeder from a protruding galvanized metal pole mounted horizontally on the bottom roof line of a large shed in the backyard. I have to use a stepladder to hang and remove the bird feeder, but that is no problem. This product was built in the USA with both U.S. and Chinese parts. The label information on the front of the box is written in English, French and Spanish.Overall I am pleased with this new bird feeder. The squirrels and crows have tried to access the feeder without success so far; the wobble and tilt action has definitely kept them off guard. However, they are crafty and persistent animals and since there has been a minor amount of seed loss, mostly during the recent wind storm, the seed that did fall to the ground has kept them motivated to devise new ways to thwart the security measures built into this new Perky-Pet bird feeder.On the front of the box Perky-Pet added the following statement:"Feeder base and dome tilt to baffle the squirrels and protect your bird seed! Birds feed undisturbed from 4 feeding ports."I think Perky-Pet is overreaching reasonable expectations for this product by expecting small birds to feed undisturbed. There is always some animal around my neighborhood looking for a free meal; either in the form of birdseed or in the shape of a bird. Though it would be nice, so far undisturbed feeding is not the norm around here.Otherwise, The Baffler has worked as promised. Since there are moving parts it stands to reason that some attention will be necessary in the future to ensure the mechanisms continue to wiggle, tilt and wobble. There is no mention about maintenance on the Perky-Pet website that I could find. Only time will tell how well this new feeder will work over the long haul. Since much of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler is manufactured with metal parts I expect my Perky-Pet bird feeder will outlast most if not all of the plastic and wooden bird feeders on the market. This bird feeder retails new for $73.99, which is a hefty price for what you are purchasing. I know you can shop around and buy this bird feeder for much less than that.
My back yard is a haven for all sorts of wildlife- not just birds, but rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks and the occasional skunk. I choose plants that encourage wildlife, and I never use pesticides or herbicides. I've never had a bird feeder, though. I was always worried about the effects of artificially feeding birds, but I was recently reassured by a naturalist that birds get their food from a great many sources, and one more source really won't make a difference. And so I ordered this feeder.Looking at the list price, you'd expect it to be a pretty hefty, solidly-built device. If you did, though, you'd be wrong. There are a couple of stampings, a molded base, a thin plastic tube, a couple of springs, some pieces of steel rod for perches... and that's it. It comes mostly preassembled, requiring only that you attach the mounting ring at the top of the feeder. That piece did give me some concern, as the main thing supporting several pounds of seed and feeder is a skinny #6 screw. New, it has more than enough strength, but a few years outdoors might weaken it through corrosion.Filling the feeder is easy, although my first attempt resulted in a pound of birdseed scattered on my back porch. It was running out through the bottom of the feeder, and I couldn't figure out why until I discovered a black plastic cap about an inch in diameter lying in the bottom of the box. It's not shown in the wordless assembly instructions, but I managed to figure out that kit is supposed to close off the bottom of the seed chamber. It slips on to part of the molding that composes the inside of the base, with less than 1/2" of overlap. The only thing really holding it in place is the weight of the birdseed in the tube. Once the level of the seed falls below this cap, it could easily become dislodged, and the seed inside could run out. I considered gluing it on but that would make it impossible to access the springs inside if they became unhooked or broke. Once I had this figured out, filling the feeder was easy enough, although I was also concerned that the tube is suspended by two very thin steel wires that are inserted in two small holes in the plastic tube. This also seems like a potential point of failure.  I hung the feeder under my maple tree, using a lightweight steel chain- something squirrels were unlikely to be able to chew though.That was several days ago, and since then we've had two heavy rainstorms, neither of which managed to get any water into the feeder. That's good. I haven't seen any squirrels try to get in, and I don't see any seed spilled below the feeder- which suggests that perhaps the birds have yet to discover the feeder. It may well be that food is plentiful enough this time of year that the birds really are stressed enough to look for new food sources. I suspect that when cold weather comes, they might be a bit more motivated. I'll be watching the feeder regularly between now and then (my home office has a clear view of the feeder) and I'll update as the birds and squirrels discover the feeder. I'll also update if any parts fail along the way.Update: A close inspection of the ground below shows evidence that the birds have indeed discovered the feeder, and it looks like the level of seed may have dropped a bit- I'm going to put a mark on the tube to monitor the level. No signs of squirrel activity.Update II: The birds have definitely discovered it. There isn't too much wasted seed on he ground, but the level of seed has fallen least rabble, and I've observed several birds feeding on- and right now it looks like two robins are having a bit of a fight over who has priority on it. Still can't give it any more than three stars, given the cost and construction, but it's good to see that the birds are making use of it.Update III: The birds- or a combination of birds and other scavengers- are now consuming seed at a rate of two or three pounds a day from the feeder. I just refilled it, and  I noticed a good deal of seed on the ground as well. As I type this on my back porch, there are four small birds on the feeder, and about eight or nine scavenging seed on  the ground below.A this point I'm undecided as to whether I'll keep filling the feeder, get another, smaller, feeder, or just discontinue feeding until winter. I'll probably buy another 20 lb bag before I make up my mind.Followup: It's now June, and the feeder has been hanging in my yard since last August. It doesn't look any worse for the wear. There are no paint chips, no rust, no cracks in the plastic reservoir. In short, it looks pretty much the way it did when I hung it 10 months ago.  I've discovered a number of things since first hanging it, too. Most commercial seed mixes at the big box stores are full of milo, a seed that no bird appears to care for, although they'll eat it in an emergency. The best deals are to be found at country feed stores, buying mixes or making your own. I use a mixture that's mainly of black sunflower seed, some cracked corn, safflower seed, and occasionally some cracked peanuts. This has something for just about every bird found around here, and has drawn a much wider range of birds to my yard than I've seen in the past 27 years. I plan on adding a noter feeder or two, using different mixes in them feeders to get different birds, and maybe add a few birdhouses as well.July Update: I was working at one end of the yard when I heard a crash and turned just in time to see a squirrel sailing through the air after bouncing off the roof of the feeder. They still haven't figured out a way in, but one or two of the smarter ones may have realized than sitting on the feeder and shaking it can dislodge seed do they can eat what falls to the ground below- see the photo.
This is exactly the bird feeder I've been looking for. We have a serious problem with very "intelligent" squirrels. They've managed to get into every bird feeder I've used and ruined most of them. This feeder is sturdy. It also works to keep the squirrels off, at least so far. I hung it on a moderately high branch where it's easy for me to fill and so far the birds have figured it out, but the squirrels are kept at bay. I hope this continues.The feeder can hold three pounds of seed. That, of course, depends on the type of see you use. This is another plus for me. We have a lot of birds here and the other feeders would run out after one or two days. So far this one has lasted a week.The price is rather high, although not all that much worse than the feeders in the stores in town, but if it keeps the squirrels away and lasts several seasons, it's worth it. It's certainly better than investing in a new bird feeder every year and having it ruined.
I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof, EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging, no squirrels, great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price, I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!
I hung this feeder in the same spot as another squirrel proof feeder that the squirrels never defeated but never stopped trying to vanquish it either.The squirrel-be-gone feeder is large with it's eventual weight determined by the type and amount of seed used to fill it. Listed capacity is three pounds, but we keep it half full to keep the weight down. Filled to capacity this feeder requires sturdy support.It is easy to assemble the feeder with the only challenging part the piece that hooks into the plastic tube. Filling the tube is no harder than filling any other feeder of this type though I found that using a funnel makes filling much easier and neater. The base and baffle are made of powder coated metal - I'm guessing aluminum because a magnet doesn't stick to it.Most importantly, does it keep the squirrels at bay? So far I'd have to say yes because mostly they don't even try to get into this feeder. Even if they could get past the baffle, the perches are too small for a squirrel to grasp securely. Even the Rodan-sized blackbirds in our yard have a difficult time getting food out of this feeder because the perches are too tiny for them also.A deer had mastered the other squirrel proof feeder and regularly emptied it. I don't think Bambi will be ever to get seed out of this feeder.Yes, I was also taken aback by the listed price for this feeder. Yet, the price has gone down at least five dollars since I first saw it posted, and on the day I'm writing this review it's on sale at the Perky-Pet site for 59 dollars. Those who have spent years battling the squirrels might not mind paying this much for a squirrel-proof feeder that actually works.UPDATE -  I filled the feeder to the top; it holds lots of seed. The next morning the feeder was completely empty. We suspect deer who have previously emptied our other feeders. Will have to monitor the situation.
The Perk Pet 397 is almost like the Cadillac of anti Squirrel Technology. The top baffle helps serve to "baffle" the enemy, while allowing some birds to maybe stop and perch on the edges... but, if they are too weighty, the baffle will tilt, kicking them off the top. Very few birds I've seen on the feeder have tried landing on the baffle, so it may not work as a perch anyway.Baffles are old hat in the battle against the Squirrel Invading Army, however, so Perky Pet has enlisted even further help. The perch section on the lower portion of the feeder is spring loaded, so that when something too heavy for the feeder touches down, the battle line is closed and the invasion repelled.Unlike the Droll Yankee, THE M1 Abrams in the Squirrel Invasion Prevention Army, is much more expensive than this model. I do not own one, but I can see how someone would want one if they have a bigger squirrel problem than just 2-3 of the little pains. This, of course, in no way justifies the cost of the Perky Pet 397, as $75 is a really expensive feeder. Sure, it works, but you better have a really bad squirrel issue to buy into this one in my opinion.Missing is the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the perch latch, though I've seen a few cardinals on ours, so I assume such birds wont be an issue and will still be able to feed.The feeder is easy to assemble and easy to fill. One thing to note, if you plan to fill this to capacity, ensure wherever you are hanging it has the ability to withstand the heavy load. This thing holds a lot of seed.Overall, I'm happy with the feeder and its squirrel thwarting capabilities. Where I struggle is the price. For $50 you can buy 2 baffles, one for above and one for below a regular feeder. Unless you give the little suckers a place to hang out between the 2 baffles, you pretty much succeed with squirrel immunity. If you want an all in one solution, have the ability to hang this with a full load of seed and just want to hang it and forget it, this is definitely not a bad solution to the Squirrel Invasion.
It took a while for my hummingbirds to get used to the new feeder before they started sitting instead of feeding while hoovering. Once they figured this out, it is their favorite feeder.
I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days....
I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully , which I did and it has never come down , been up for at least a month. When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak. Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window. Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick.
It would be even nicer if they were packaged in different lengths and sizes (or at least one had a longer handle).
This is a very well made brush that is good for feeder ports, especially hummingbird feeders.  So far for me it's been tough enough that after several uses its still holding its shape, and without shedding.  I like it and feel it is well worth the price here on Amazon, (especially with the free shipping that is being offered at the time of this writing).  The only thing I feel I should make extra note of is its really small size.  It's only 3 1/2" long, which makes it kinda useless for anything but ports on feeders.  If you want to get down to the bottom of a tube feeder where it really gets nasty over time, you will need to pick up a long bottle brush.  Also, if you do buy this brush for use on feeder ports, I would toss the suggestion of keeping it around your sink for other uses that's mentioned in the description.  You will be bringing in all kinds of bacteria from dirty feeders into your kitchen.  You can wash it well of course, but it's still a better idea to either keep one of these strictly for other uses than feeders, or buy some other brush for your kitchen sink.  Recommended for its quality and price.. : )
This little light is easy to assemble, needing not much more than a screw driver to tighten the nut and screw. Once it is clamped down on another sturdy object, it stays put.  It doesn't wobble or come undone.  The cord is five feet long.  Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant, the effective radius is plenty enough (about 24" from a foot away).  I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage, and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users:  the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT!  This lamp would not be recommended around birds or small children.  However, set in a nice location this is a pretty lamp that provides good swivvel and warmth.This clamp comes with a 60-watt bulb, packed in its separate cardboard support.
Here's some opinions I have after using this blower for a couple of weeks now.1. The vacuum bag is hard to take off. I seen in another comment that, do not to slip in in all the way. Haven't tried that yet2. The On/Off knob. Sometimes I found I bumped into it with my hand causing it to move it's position.3. I found it easier to let the bag lay on the ground instead of using the strap around the shoulder when vacuuming leaves.4. The Magnesium Impeller will fit on this unit. I ordered and installed the Magnesium Impeller from Toro model 51598. (thanks to Allen who commented about that in his review)5. Would be nice if it had one more lower setting on the blower6. It's very light and has plenty of power
I use this for a very small lawn.  It starts like a breeze and cuts well.  It has plenty of power.  I got used to dragging the cord pretty easily and that is well worth the trade off for ease of use.  The main draw-back is that the handle is wider than the mower so prevents Getty close enough to fences, etc.
I have had this mower for five seasons so far, during which I typically have to mow twice per week from March through October or even November.  In other words, this mower has seen lots of use, and it hasn't failed me.There are several reasons I love this mower:1)  I am allergic to gasoline, so I avoid using it as much as possible.  Therefore, it is extraordinarily helpful to have an electric mower that allows me to avoid yard-based gasoline-guzzling &#34;appliances&#34; completely.2) It is light-weight, so I can handle it on my own.3) The handle easily folds down so it takes up less room in storage during the winter,4) Because it is electric, I can flip it upside down to clean it out without worrying about spilling any toxic chemicals.5) It does a very good job cutting grass!  This is important in a mower!  It also does a good job mulching grass clippings.6) It can handle hills without any issue.7) It is easy to adjust the cutting height.  In fact, the cutting height can be adjusted with one hand, by moving the handl on the left side of the mower.8) It is QUIET!  This mower emits less than half the noise polution that a typical mower emits.  I could probably mow very early in the morning and not annoy my neighbors too much. :)9) It doesn't pollute the air the way gas-powered mowers do.10) It is easy to start, with no pulling, keys, or other obstacles.  Just plug this baby in, pull up on the little orange handle (on the main handle), and mow.  That's it!Using a cord can be annoying at times, but it is something to which I QUICKLY became accustomed, and I quickly set up my &#34;ballet routine&#34; of mowing while avoiding the cord.  It isn't that bad. :)
I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it, and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality, cost (no gas) and quick startup, it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well, was very quiet.
I bought this product back in 2004, replacing an older gas mower after my neighors house caught fire from a leaking gas can in his garage. Used the electric mower until 2007, when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner. I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it. In July 2008, I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy. Plugged it in, and it started right away, try that with a gas mower. My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn, this mower just gobbles up that lawn. It does bog down in taller/thicker patches, hence only 4 stars. But it gives a nice clean cut. Changing the blade was easy. And it does a nice job of mulching, my lawns look great. I will never own a gas mower!
This mower works great with small lawns that have minimal obstructions between the electric outlet and the desired mowing area.  The only way they could make this mower better is if it was push assisted.
I originally chose a more expensive knee pad, ignoring these because of the single strap. However, when the ones  I ordered didn't work right, I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However, I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around, the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater, so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely, and once I adjusted the strap, very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side.
I should have bought knee pads a long time ago! I have bony knees, and gardening and housework really bruise them.Now I just strap on the pads and don't worry about it.The only thing is that the backing on the foam pads is peeling away, a little. So they're not the sturdiest pads ever. Maybe now that I know I'll use them often, I'll buy a higher-end pair and relegate these to the camping bins.
I bought these for two reasons: 1 - I paint a lot (walls).  2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor!  For the former, they work great-  they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders, etc.  I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees.  It's great.  My knees aren't the best and these help a lot!  For the latter reason, they're great too!  I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house!  Good excercise and quite tiring!  But for the price - you can't go wrong.
Bought as a gift and here's the offial report:'Great pad cushions and velcro closure. Extremely comfortable. Only hitch: the liners inside start detaching very quickly.'For under $10 they're worth it.
Overall I am pleased with these knee pads because I can garden without moving a kneeling pad around,  I gave this product four stars because depending on the type of pants that I am wearing they either feel too tight on my right leg or too loose.  Also if you are working  on the ground with a lot of dirt, some of the dirt tends to get inside the knee pads, so sometimes to have to stop to shake it out.  I would probably buy this product again.
This is a very convenient way to keep all your gardening tools handy. It's similar to the bucket tool caddies that contractors used with one key different -- there's no flap that goes inside the bucket, so it's possible to use the bucket to carry dirt, weeds, plants, etc. without getting dirt all over the caddy.Construction is decent. I had no problems fitting it to a five gallon bucket, but it's essential that you find one that does not have a lot of ribs around the lip. The caddy straps on with velcro, and the ribs would make it hard to get a good fit. Thus, buckets you buy at places like Home Depot will not work well - you need an old 5 gallon paint bucket for best results.There are plenty of pockets. The pockets on one side are closed at the bottom; the pockets on the other are open on the bottom. Chances are you'll be able to fit all the tools you want to carry. The only problems I encountered were with long handled weeders. I'll end up carrying them inside the bucket as before.The seed pocket (sort of like a wallet with cutouts to stash seed packets) is a nice touch but, alas, one that I can't use since I purchase most seeds in bulk bags not envelopes. Wish there was an option to remove that and replace it with a pocket suited for tools, but hey - at this price, I can't complain at all.My only concern is construction. While it is decent for the price paid, I expect it will be a bit ragged after significant use. Reenforced seams with rivets would be great - I'd be willing to pay a bit more for that. A better gripping mechanism would also be a nice touch - perhaps some type of spring clamp that grips the bucket so the burden of holding this on is not born by just a single piece of velcro. Lastly, a built-in sheath for a garden knife would be an excellent addition.
The material is good and easy to clean. Size is perfect, just as described. I have a bunch of Fiskars tools, and now they get perfectly organized and easy to move around. Price was good and deliver was fast.
Do you find yourself constantly looking for the last hand tool you used when working in the flowerbeds? Are you forever walking back and forth to get the right tool, or to toss the weeds you just dug up in a lawn bag? If so, you need a garden caddy, and you could do a lot worse than this model. While it's not made of heavy-duty canvas like the $60 models, it's strong enough for every day use, and it can last through several buckets. I bought this one for my girlfriend, a passionate gardner, and she's very pleased with it. Might even get one for myself.
I am relatively new to gardening and only had 2 old, cheap tools that I used to pot indoor plants. When I started vegetable container gardening, I quickly found that my old tools were not going to cut it, so I got myself a nice set of Fiskars tools. I then needed something to hold them and carry them in when I went back and forth to the garden, so I found this bucket caddy.I already had 5-gallon buckets as that is what I use for container gardening. It is tricky getting the caddy on right the first time. I found it easiest to lift the handle of the bucket up and then put the caddy on, being sure to align the openings on both sides of the caddy with the sides of the bucket where the handle connects. If you don't do this, you won't be able to use the bucket's handle, which kind of defeats the purpose of being able to carry your tools to the garden! Even after going through this process a few times, I still haven't mastered it, but I did at least get a tight fit of the caddy's "belt" onto the rim of the bucket. The handle is pretty much locked in the upright position, but that's okay with me because it makes it easier to grab it and go to the garden.There are loads of pockets of all sizes. They fit everything from my big round composite soil scoop (Fiskars 7068 Composite Soil Scoop) to a small pair of scissors I use for opening bags of soil and such. The caddy fits my Fiskars garden tools set plus several extra tools and there is still plenty of room for more.The material the caddy is made from appears quite heavy duty but, since mine is still pretty new, I can't speak yet to how well it will hold up over time.You might want to complete your bucket and caddy with a bucket seat (Custom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Buckets), as I did. I had hoped for it to be more flexible for comfort, but it is still great to be able to sit on the bucket and have your tools right under you so you can both reach for whatever you need and also easily put away what you're done with.Definitely recommend this Garden Bucket Caddy.
...I thought this was a canvas bucket with a handle and didn't realize it was a canvas wrap around for a 5 gallon 'homer' bucket, which is not included.Tip for putting it on, unlatch the velcro strap and remove it entirely so you can slip the wrap under the bucket handle, not over it.  That might be why some people are having the velcro or seams tear, if you wrap it right around the handle and then raise the handle, that would put more stress on the strap.Once I wound this under the handles as pictured in the amazon image on the product page, rerun the strap and secured the velcro it was snug enough to put a bunch of tools in the pockets.  Which are big enough for tools you'd use to manicure plants, as opposed to hand shovels and the like.  Look at the photo and you'll see some regular standard scissors in one of the pockets, that should give you some scale.So nice that I have a big bucket to put stuff in, not so nice that its really made for rather small tools, not so nice that I had to go buy a bucket but that's my fault.  I own a ton of fiskars stuff and although I know their big business is scissors, I thought I was buying a yard tool caddy and not a scissors holder.I re-purposed it as a sprinkler/irrigation repair bucket, that's working for me.
A not really sure if this attracts mosquitos or if it is the light, but whatever it is it works so I am very happy with my purchase and woul recommend,
Given the price and the length of time these each work....you have a 2-3 year supply.  Store them in the same box used to store the zapper &#34;off-season&#34; - BUT KEEP THEM IN A LOCATION SAFE FROM CHILDREN.
I like the product, the sensor works well the minute it comes in contact with a subject that crosses its path (that would be me for now) but it's hard for me to tell if I am getting results.  I live in a wooded area with lots of deer.  They come every day and more so at night, so I haven't seen any action yet.
Cats just love nice soft planting bed dirt. Easy digging, no grass or leaves to work around and often plenty of room so they don't have to re-visit the same spot. They are indeed tidy animals. After preparing them for this year's planting, adding all sorts of expensive amendments, every day saw new cat diggings and poop. This year the beds are off limits.Set up the Scarecrow and not one cat visit to report yet. Well, they might of visited, but they didn't stay! I know it fired off at least once and while the water goes up some and doesn't actually hit them, it does make a sudden and fearsome noise and a lot of commotion and they want no part of that.Once I saw a mountain lion paw mark in one of my beds, so if it chases them away that might also be a good thing. Same for raccoons at the fish pond. And it does all this humanely.You do have to be careful to set the sensor low enough for cats and smaller animals. In the past I tilted a Scarecrow down so the sensor picked them up, but for deer or larger dogs you don't have to. With a raised bed it is easy to set up the height to just above ground level, but for a bed at ground level you might want to try setting it in a pit. You can't lean it over because it works by tracking animals walking across its path.It does not work on critters coming straight at or away from it. My outdoor motion lights are like that. You have to spend the time to find out the direction your visitors will travel and make sure they go across its path.The kick of the water will indeed knock it back so that it is pointed upward and this will make it useless. Really, you just have to attach it to a supporting post. I wired mine to the planter walls. I had one once that I put into a pot full of gravel and that did not work. Normal soil will not contain it either.So, spend the time to point it correctly and secure it. I find that going up half-way on the sensitivity works fine. You just have to test your situation (with the water off).You need a 9V battery as it does not ship with one.Years ago I had what seems to be the same device, a gift. It broke and the company would not answer an email about buying the part (solenoid). I hope things have changed and parts will be available. I do not like throwing away a $50 item that can be easily fixed.Hecho en China of course. Should be cheaper considering. Lost a star for that.
I would have given this five stars but the connections loosen with use and I have had to hand tighten the connection right beneath the scarecrow head a couple of times.  I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond.  I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller.  They work in unison and are effective!  I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter.  Everything has remained undisturbed.  And, I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and (to me) less obtrusive.  This was a great investment.
The second unit has worked very well. We had a family of foxes take roost near a creek in the neighborhood. Each night very late we could hear a fox making a weird noise near our house, I guess as it strolled by. Well, this took care of it. After about 10 days, we shut it off and we're guessing the fox changed its route due to this device. Seems well made.
Well, I am very glad I made this purchase.  This unit works very well, gosh it does scare the animals away.  I now have no dug out holes in my garden and my vegetables are  undisturbed.
We live in the desert so not many people have grass in their yards, however we do. Because of this we attract colonies of rabbits and they are killing our yard and eating everything I try grow. I recently planted some clover seed to fill in the patches of grass their urine has killed, but the whole task would be useless had I not found the Scarecrow sprinkler. I'm happy to report this has almost completely solved our problem. We have been keeping the sprinkler pointed towards the section we are repairing and the clovers are coming in undisturbed. However, there are blind spots as the sprinler cannot see off to the sides very well. Now the rabbits are hanging around the other half of our yard. Solution- we will definately be getting another one of these for the other half. One annoying thing about the Scarecrow is they didnt include a ring to were you attach the hose to make attaching and unscrewing easier; you have to twist the entire sprinkler around making lining up the threads kind of a pain. Regardless this is has been the best rabbit repellent I could find. I highly recommend the Scarecrow!
Like others, we've had a problem with obnoxious pests visiting our yard late at night.  The Contech Scarecrow worked really well the first time, but the vermin rapidly adapted and learned to avoid the covered region (front yard plus bedroom window).  Even moving the Scarecrow around only worked the first couple of times.  I've decided to use rose bushes and transplanted poison ivy as a more permanent deterrent.
This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however, it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all, this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it.
I just got this tiny machine home to Japan in my luggage and tried it out. Yes, it is underpowered, but that could also have to do with the 100-volt supply here. But that said it does exactly what I need it for, to trim edges where my mower can't reach. It is not really too short for me, and I can swing it like a one-handed scythe because it is so light.I was totally disgusted with my much more expensive Makita that would never feed the line properly, so I feel the Black and Decker is worth $19.95 for every time I don't need to swear and pull the Makita reel apart to rewind it!Four years later ----- it's still working! The motor seems to slow down now and then, and the blade that cuts the extended line got loose and then lost, but it still trims just as I need it to do. I got a second unit for the US place last year and it has a better designed handle and faster spinning motor. The "bump" line feed in the old one still works most of the time, and I fixed the blade problem by cementing a box cutter blade on the housing. The spool is easily rewound with standard line. No real complaints!
I'm glad this gadget came with two double A batteries, I could test it right away!  Shaped like a smallish tennis racket, the Amazing Bug Zapper does kill any bug it makes contact with, but you have to tap the bug first!  It works fine with larger bugs like wasps, and other slow, flying insects, but the item is fairly bulkly and hard to handle for fast, small bugs.  In the south, I need an entire bodysuit made of Amazing Bug Zapper fabric!

This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves, branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days, I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap, the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended.
I bought a rotating composter last summer. It took all summer to turn my yard waste into compost. Actually, by the end of the last summer, while the compost was almost done, it was too late in the season for me to use so I just left it in the composter. This spring I had great compost. That's almost a year for that batch. This year I am hoping to speed things up a little.This product contains the microorganisms to get things started quickly. I added this product to my yard waste a few weeks ago. I have already noticed an improvement on the progress of the compost process compared to last year. Hopefully I will have usable compost ready to spread in the garden by the end of summer.
So, I got the compost in the mail.  I opened the box, and the composts were all over the place.  Good thing that they put the box inside a ziplock bag.  If they didn't put the box inside ziplock bag, i'm sure it would be one messy box.  Anyways, other than that, it expedite the compost process.  Good thing to have in the yard.
We added this to our compost tumbler and it seems to be helping break down the material we put inside (yard waste, food, etc.)As another review noted, the box did not hold the contents inside. It seems like the manufacturer/distributor knows this because the box was sent inside a plastic bag which caught all of the grains that had fallen out.
It can be quite hard to get a compost pile going. We have tried a couple different ways and couldn't really get what you are suppose to get from a compost pile, we would always end up with just garbage and flies. We researched online and watched a lot of videos. It has to have a certain mixture of types of things that you add. We had way too much household food in ours. We also decided to forgo our compost bin and decided to go with a tumbler composter after a couple failed attempts in our bin.This Ringer Compost Plus helps get your compost going. We are now having much better luck. I suggest doing some research yourself if you are just beginning. There is more to composting than just throwing your scraps and coffee grounds into a bin.Spring is the perfect time to start and the Compost Plus gives it a head start.
I have a classic-style composter with the doors on the bottom and a compost starter really is an excellent way to boost the breakdown process.  If you don't have a tumbling composter you might want to add aYard Butler Compost Turnerto your list.  Anyone who has been composting for a while would recommend a starter, especially if you are mixing everything in your bin from food scraps to wood chips.  No, composting doesn't happen overnight and everyone will learn about composting as they gain more experience.There are several "recipes" you can scout out on the Internet when you are going to make your compost.  For example, one common one is one part food scraps, one part grass clippings, and two parts dry leaves.  Ringer Compost Plus has has directions on the box that are quite useful to those just starting out.  There is a brief vignette on troubleshooting that is helpful.  For example, if you have a smelly pile they have a very helpful hint on how to minimize the odor.  Only complaint I have is that I would have preferred a resealable bag over a box.  Other than that, I'm all for compost makers to jumpstart the composting process.
I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps, brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process, but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process, I'll be purchasing more.
I've always had a compost pile in the back corner of my yard and since I grow most of my own produce, it comes in handy to fill raised beds (certainly cheaper and better than buying soil) and to top-dress beds. The thing that convinced me to try this produce was that it is a 100% natural product and, as much as possible, I like to keep an organic garden. As an aside, I read Mike McGroatry's blog/website a lotEasy Plant Propagationand agree with him that compost isn't complicated--it's what nature wants to do with a pile of clippings. The best thing you can do is just get out of the way and let nature take her course. But you have to be patient (not one of my more stellar qualities).The problem I've had is that while I do get great compost/soil from the pile over the course of a summer, it's a slow process. With that in mind I decided to try this product. (I also thought of buying one of those tumbling things, but have you seen how much they cost?)I tried the product today. The instructions call for sprinkling about a cup on a pile that's about 3 x 4' and about 12" deep. I had a freshly stacked pile of materials (both green and brown materials) that was about that size and 3' tall already, so what I did was spread it out and and then re-piled it but added a cup of the Compost Plus for every 12" depth or so. I watered each layer (as per instructions) as I re-stacked the composting materials and built the pile back up to its original height. This sounds complicated, but it took all of 10 minutes. I just used a pitchfork and it was very easy work.I won't know for a month or so if this is any faster, but I'm hoping to see some evidence (heat perhaps) that this stuff is speeding up the process. I may even be able to tell sooner than that. One thing I got from the packaging was that it's important to have a good level of moisture in your compost pile--not too wet, but certainly not dry. I have been remiss in that--again, I just let the rain water it normally. I will try to be more careful about keeping this pile wet to give the product a fair chance. If it works and speeds up the process, I'll be thrilled. I'm reading a lot lately about the value of microorganisms in soil (and reading a lot about no till gardening)Plowman's Follyand that is what this product is: a mix of select microorganisms.I will update this review in a few weeks and report back on how its working. My only negative thought now is that it took most of the 2 lb box to do the pile (again, 3 x 4') and so adding this stuff regularly adds another expense to the garden.Update 5/09/2013: It's only been a few weeks since I first applied this stuff to my compost pile and while I don't feel the "heat" that I was half expecting, I will say that the pile seems to be composting faster than normal. I'm seeing a significantly faster conversion to compost in the center of the pile. Not a miracle, but noticeable.
I love composting; it makes me feel like I'm doing my part to keep valuable plant nutrients in the ecosystem, and waste out of the landfills. And it's super easy to do when you break it down into the basics: heap up food and yard waste, and let it rot. Then you wait, sometimes for a year, for your compost.This product speeds up the process a little bit. It has a mild manure smell that did not bother me when I was storing it in the garage before use, but the smell did bother my nose-sensitive mother, who wanted to know what 'that stink' was. So for storing inside, be aware others might find the scent offensive. I'd suggest just using it right away. :)The pellets are really just a kickstarter product, with enzymes and flora to make the compost process hotter more quickly. If you've never composted before, this is a great way to get some quicker compost bang for your buck.It's also fun to use, making the process more like cooking. If you really want to learn how to compost well, read Let It Rot, or find a website on composting. Even with a starter batch like this, composting still takes time and patience.NOTE: Some of my pellets arrived sifted out from the box. It was a bit messy.
I've been working on a compost bin for about a year now, and noticed lately that it wasn't heating up as much as it had in the beginning. When I received the RINGER COMPOST PLUS I added about half the box to my current compost pile (a turning drum style) and by the next day found that the head had returned which means the composting process is back in full swing. My ONLY complaint, and it's minor, is the smell(!) of the contents of the box! You certainly don't want to store it in your home or even in your garage - it's THAT strong. I wrapped mine in plastic to keep it dry and tucked it under a sheltered area near the garden. But hey... smell or no smell, this stuff works!
Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker, it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings, leaves, and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then, though, it has gotten me started on composting.
But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost, with an approximate ratio of 1:2, and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate, or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around, as they would be most places, this product isn't strictly necessary, but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though, it's likely to help out.
I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better, richer, darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well, I called the company and after a few passes around the office, I was told, then confirmed by another employee, that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So, they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose, but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer, mom, mage
I will have to review this product at the end of the summer to give a better idea of the help/quality of the product.  My first impressions were that this was a small amount of stuff.  I also think that it stinks.  I am going to use it in a compost bin, rather than the recommended ground idea.  I don't like to leave compost on the ground, as it attracts rodents.  So far my stuff has been in there for three weeks.  Will update again later.
I have been using this product for 30 days so far, and will update this review when I have reached 90 days.  My compost pile is actually in a lidded bin designed for this purpose.  I have a combination of yard waste and kitchen waste in the pile.  I've not had very dramatic results composting in the bin by itself - it just seems to not decompose very quickly, despite following the general directions for this process.  So I thought perhaps this additive would speed things up.When I first received the Ringer product, I sprinkled a good cup or two into the compost pile as is.  It was going to rain the next day, so I didn't water it in.  I have noticed so far that the pile seems to have sunk more than what I'm used to seeing.This Ringer stuff smells like a barn, uh, natural fertilizer if you will.  While the cardboard box helps reduce the odor somewhat, I decided to store this in a tightly lidded plastic container, so that I could keep this under my sink without the sink cabinet beginning to smell.I keep a small bucket on my counter for compostible fruit/veggie pieces.  I have started adding a small scoop of the Ringer product to my bucket before I take it outside to the compost pile.  I use a plastic cup that comes with liquid laundry detergent, and I add what amounts to about a tablespoon.As I said, I'll update in 90 days to let you know how it continues to progress.
I have been composting for almost 25 years. We produce a lot of kitchen waste as well as garden waste, and have a yard full of leaves. My father composted long before it was popular. He started about 45 years ago and I learned from him. In order to compost well you must have oxygen, moisture, organic matter and the bacteria to break down the waste.Just as happens in any wooded area, all of these elements are present and occur in good time naturally. If you wish to speed up the process; it requires some work and the addition of micro-organisms. This is where the Ringer Compost Plus comes into the picture. Here is where the micro-organisms come from.Am I sure this product has all of the right organisms for my waste, how can one tell? Only time will be the judge. In from one to three months I can add to this review. I would add.... why would Ringer sell a product that will not work, since it is a product which is generally re-bought if it works well.Also,organic gardeners do compare notes.It is important to also make sure your compost gets the other things it needs. A rolling barrel can be purchased or just turn the compost pile periodically with a shovel and keep it moist. I do not like shovel work and I am cheap, so I made a composting unit out an old water well pressure tank that had failed. I mounted it sideways  on a simple 2x4 frame. It's about the size of an oil drum. I cut a door with a reciprocating saw, hinged it and added a latch. I added a shaft through the center that sticks out of the ends and they sit on the wood frame, (Like a hamster wheel). I can spin it to mix the compost which adds air and moisture through out. Maybe in 90 days I can give Compost Plus 5 stars.
When I first bought a rotary barrel-type composter I was really excited to get some nutrient rich material for my garden.  Unfortunately it wasn't that easy.  I followed directions but it never seemed to do what it was supposed to do.  The grass stayed green and wet and the leaves stayed dry and brown.I started using the Ringer Compost Plus over a month ago and I can honestly say that it has made a difference.  FINALLY I am getting the type results that I had been wanting.  There might be another way of accomplishing this without a compost starter but for me this is working just fine.
I started to use composts when I went to Master Gardener school. It is a wonderful way to get rid of all the food scraps and peelings that you usually through in the garbage.There is more to composting than just putting scrapes on the ground you can actually use vacuum bag dust (if there is no food) I also put my hair cuttings, newspapers and leaves and grass clippings are also used. Letters and junk mail can be cut up and tossed in also.  All  you have to do is toss all of this once in a while and you come up with compost.  I am lazy I never turn my compost I leave it out and my chickens have a ball scratching up the compost.  I wind up having the best soil for the summer garden.Ringer 3050 Compost Plus is a great product it has lots of good micro organisms that literally eat up all the waste and turn it into compost.  Sure you can get a good soil without it but this product speeds up the porcess and adds lots of good organisms that add extra nutrishment to the mix.All you do is lay down the foundation and then add the amount  you need for the size pile you have, turn it a few times wet it down and within 3 months you start to see the results of the composting.  You can use the fresh soil for anything to grow, plants vegetables, flowers shrubs and even sprinkle it on the grass..
I got this for a friend who is 80.  He had told me he was looking at them at a local hardware store.  I told him I would check online for reviews and prices.  We agreed this was the one for him.  And it was 80 bucks cheaper than the store.He really likes it but has to go slow.  He wanted the electric one because he didn't want to use a pull cord starter.
NICE
Fiskars Shear Ease Grass Shears are the best grass clippers I've ever used. We bought these locally and had a choice among 3 different clippers. Of the three, these were the most expensive, lightest in weight, and also were the easiest to open/close.  I was going to get the middle-priced shears because we don't use them that much, but decided to purchase the Fiskars instead. I'm glad I did. They are very light, easy to cut with and don't require a lot of force. The blades are sharp and remind me of Fiskars scissors. I didn't have any trouble with my hand getting pinched, but I can see how it might be a problem. I suggest wearing gloves if you think you might be prone to pinching or blisters when you use these.  The rotating head came in handy when I trimmed around railroad ties. The blades are already grass stained after being used for approx. 20 min. It's suggested that you clean the blades after each use & oil them once in a while for longer life. I can see how grass stain build up could eventually make the blade  sticky requiring more hand pressure to open/close them.  The blades are fully hardened stainless steel. I expect them to remain sharp for a long time.These shears have a lifetime warranty.
Though I have several string trimmers, there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines, I'll be in big trouble, and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks.  The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well, and though I only use them a few times a year, they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely.
Has the usual (very slight) fade after 5 months, BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything (live in SB,Cali and we get moisture/sun every day). The material is thick and sturdy...I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great. Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different, to me, that what it looks like in the photos. Will update after a full summer if it holds up and doesn't crack, then bump up to 5 stars.
I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota, where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover, but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me, this is a minor drawback, but others might find it more objectionable.
Well made and does the job. Unfortunately it doesn't reach all the way to the ground and doesn't have tie-downs, but other than that it works great.
Used these in my rain barrel all summer and we didn't have any mosquitos breeding in the standing water. Done.
These seem to keep the bugs at bay if used properly.  I use them in any standing water.  Pots.  Low areas of soil or grass. Just keep away from pets and kids.
The summit mosquito dunks 20 pack is a great deal at 17 bucks as compared to what I normally pay for a 6 pack which is around 10 to 12 dollars.  These typically last for about 30 days each time I put one in my small 6 x 5 x 2 pond.  I use a half dunk as that will suffice for an area that small.
All trimmers are like writers, they need good lines. The Weed Eater line is perfect as it is made for this trimmer and buying in bulk saves dollars!
You must buy this if you buy a string trimmer. The string breaks often so you need extra refills of the proper width.
There is really not that much to say about this product.  If you need 0.065 inch diameter monofilament replacement line for your string trimmer, this spool is competitively priced at about five dollars for 200 feet.  Just make sure this is the size you need, and not the larger 0.080 inch diameter line.If you really want to buy in bulk, you can get the 2000 foot roll and save even more.Weed Eater 952711559 0.080-Inch by 2000-Feet Bulk Round String Trimmer Line
I have a Weber gas grill with a smoke box at the side.  The first thing I used was made of tiny little splinter type things.  Too small too fast.  These pieces are larger;  most are too large to fit in the smoke box.  I hate having to wield a hatchet to break them up.  3/4&#34; to 1&#34; would be a lot better.  However once these catch the flavor is right on.
Great tasting hickory. I would give it a 5 but some of the pieces are too large to slip between the bars on my Weber 320 and so it only gets a 4 since I need to use pliers to move the grate and drop in the wood.
makes good smoke taste
These are just super.  Throw them in a cup for thirty minutes to soften them, then the food absorbs all of that sweet apple smoke flavor.  Yum, yum.
I wanted Poulan brand oil, and this was the only place I could find it. More expensive but it works great. Nothing to compare it to, but I'm happy anyways.
What can I say about chain oil? I works to lubricate the chain on my small chain saw, and that's what it's supposed to do.
I can now save money and feel confident on how my soil is doing. I test my garden and lawn at different times of the year. This way I can always try to have my levels exactly where I want them.
I like the 10" size.  It holds a substantial pot, whether you change the plant three times a year, or keep one perennial as I do.  The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes.  While it is not heavy duty, it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely.  Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet, or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia.  Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years.
I have several pot holders like this one on my deck. This flower pot in particular is pretty sturdy. The only thing I would change is for it to come with a little instruction book or an explanation on how you get it to fit on the railing.
This came packaged quite well, and I did not have any missing parts.  The brackets were on the holder itself, with zip ties and they were easy enough to find.  The instructions were clear as how to hang this properly, and installation time took less than two minutes.It is holding a 10 inch pot of geraniums and it was easy to attach to the fence post.  I would order this again.
This attractive black pot holder installs easily. I appreciated the versatility as it can fit 2 x4" to 2x 6" inch railing. I am not mechanically inclined but was able to affix this to my deck with no problems. It is designed with a "bumper" which prevents the pot from tipping. The black color should blend with just about any d&eacute;cor.This is a convenient way for me to keep a pot of fresh herbs in close proximity to the grill on my deck.  The hardware seemed a bit flimsy but so far it has held. This is a good way to bring a color to your deck, balcony or fence. Recommended.
The holder itself is made fine but the harware is really cheap.  It will hold a large pot, which is nice.  I prefer to look for a holder that will fit over the rails of my porch.
I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot, I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side, depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want, so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds.
This is a good, standard pot holder.  The metal construction is sturdy and it keeps my plant perfectly perched on my wood railing (a plus because some of the non-adjustable holders I've found are meant for a skinnier metal railing and don't work for my situation).  So functionality wise, these have been perfect.  But aesthetically, it still pretty utilitarian looking.  There's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration.  Because of that, I like using this with a pot that is well designed and pretty on it's own.Aesthetics aside, it functions as expected and is perfect for people (like me) whose railings are not a uniform size.
Decent quality though not quite as sturdy as I would have wanted.Good news though, it fits 6" or less rails with an adjustable arm.  My package had all the items included.  Some folks complained the brackets weren't included but I noticed mine were just lying in the bottom of the box separate from the rest of the item.  Perhaps the customer missed them or perhaps the shipper missed them.  Not sure.  But without those it is useless.Holds a 10 inch pot.  Looks nice.  Just wish the metal was a bit better quality.  I worry it might wear, bend, or break over time.  I will update if this occurs.
This is a metal holder for flower pots. It is fairly basic, not decorative but if you just need to put your pots of pretty flowers out on a rail it will do the job.Some reviewers complained of parts missing but mine was complete. It took me a minute to figure out that I need to turn a screw to loosen the parts and then tighten it up but that was easy enough. Seems to be a good product.
Overall this is a nice flowerpot holder for a deck railing. It is adjustable to fit a range of railing widths, and holds up to a ten inch pot. It blends in well, and holds a heavy pot securely. It is not permanent - I had no problems removing it and repositioning it (after removing the pot, of course).On the downside, the construction quality for something that is going to be outdoors 100% of the time (and often wet from rain or water coming out of the pot) is not as good as I would have liked it to be. It's all steel (painted) held together with welds. My concern is rust - it would have been nice to have it be made of stainless, or have a plastic coating on the steel to help prevent/minimize rust. I'll certainly be bringing this indoors in the winter, and most likely will need to spray paint it regularly to keep it rust-free, especially where it may get scratched from a clay pot.But so far so good. It's a nice addition to the deck, and I very much like that it's secure but not a permanent installation.
This simple flower pot holder will hold most 10 inch flower pots. It has a strong metal frame with a black vinyl coating so it holds up well against weathering and it's rust resistant. It's very easy to get set up and is fully adjustable. It should be able to hang on most deck railings, balconies and maybe some fences that have a flat top on them. It's very strong and shouldn't have any problem holding even a really heavy pot.
I have this attached to my rails on my back porch.  I just planted a bunch of geraniums(red and white)and put the pot into the holder when I was done.  Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over. But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product. It looks better when you get it. When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got!
It is flexible, can hold 50+ pounds (lbs), and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl. thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets.  You can ignore the manufacturer's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches.  When using only 1 or 2 bracket's bolts (of 3) closest to the pot's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat (bar) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp's flat (bar) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches.  It is safe to use just 1 bolt, as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force, which can very little pull (shear away) the bolts, one of which can easily handle.  However, the overall look is less than inspiring.
This pot holder is really sturdy, much more than any other pot holder I have tried of its size.  It also has a lot of flexibility in the size of the brackets to adjust to different railings or fences.I tried this flower pot holder out in a couple of places before I found one that had the best sunlight and water possibilities - morning sun and only partial cover by a porch roof.  Then I decided on a great kindness to the plant, a vine that doesn't like trouble, and I put it on the side of the fence that faces my husband's garden instead of mine.  His side has about 90% better chance (okay, 100%) of being watered in a timely manner.  I have the general attitude that if plants are meant to live, they will -- except during the drought, and then even I showed better sense than that.The only thing I could have wished from this would be for a little more depth.  The size of the pot that will fit in here really is 7 inches at the bottom.  I repotted the vine I was putting in here to make it shorter but I may have trouble with the vine later.  :D
The flower pot holder is adjustable to fit.  It is fairly sturdy and is easy to assemble.  You will need a philips screw driver to put finish assembly.  The only thing that I am not happy with is that put zip ties all over it and it was hard to cut with regular scissors.  I found that to be annoying.  But, I still find it to be a nicely made product.
The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired, but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence, and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong, and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason, my set came with four extra metal brackets, and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets, which are metal, like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them, unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around.
We have coyote fences in my neck of the wood which are Latilla wood rods wrapped around an iron post. It's not always easy to find something which will hang easily on the inside of the fence, which is why I was interested to see this planter design. I find it works perfectly although it may be just a tad too flimsy for anything with a substantial weight. That being said, I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely. The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while. It's a nice idea and I will recommend it to my neighbors who are always trying to figure out gadgets so they can hang flowers on their coyote fences.
This is an adjustable pot hanger that will work on most railings, decks, etc.It definitely does not have a high-end look, and I do wonder at its durability, but it'll work for most situations.If you need a lot of these it could get pricey.
This product works well for what I want it to do - fit on an oddly sized apartment complex's railing.  It is adjustable.  Just works.
Having a balcony pot holder makes my garden more interesting.  Since it can be adjusted fairly tightly on the ledge, it won't fall down, and the plant will not accidentally topple over the way it would if I just placed it on the balcony ledge without a pot holder. Staggering the plant pot heights from high to low allows each plant to have an individual focal point, and the pot holder sits up the highest on the ledge so that's great.The holder is easy to adjust with a variety of three holes per side and screws to secure it.  However, my balcony ledge is a little wide so I can only use one screw per side.  That isn't really a problem since my pot is balanced correctly thanks to the pot's non-tip bumper in the back bottom of the holder.  Also I like the fact that the holder is light weight and black is preferable, though it also comes in white. In addition, it is easy to move around or change the position of the pot and readjust the screws.  The only negative about the screws is that they are a bit difficult to tighten by hand unless you use a tool. Once it is all set up, it seems very secure and looks great on my balcony.
