I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, "sprinkler watching" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on "low gear," which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the "nose" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain "jump the track."  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs.
This sprinkler seemed to be a perfect fit for what I needed but unfortunately I had to return it.I have about 4500 square feet of grass including backyard and my yard is someone weird shaped, so I figured this sprinkler would work well for me.My first complain is its very slow so I am unable to track how much water this is really consuming. I am a college student and stay at home dad, I don't have the money for a high water bill.Second complain is that's it a heavy piece of metal and I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy. I don't mind lifting weights but I don't wanna lift while I'm working in my grass, this is an expensive sprinkler and I'm not leaving it outside at night so carrying this inside every night is somewhat of a hassle.Pros- I like the coverage it gets, it covers a lot of space and it left me having to only use it a few feet of hose.Setup was pretty simple, I can recall a few times adjusting the sprayers and running off getting my pants soaked lolOverall I give it a B- I think you should just stick with your regular sprinkler, save yourself the hassle and skip this purchase
It's hard writing a review for this Flexogen garden hose because it has a couple big problems, but something else about it makes up for that one problem. Read on:One thing you have to know- pretty much ANY garden hose you buy will tangle if you don't wrap it the right way. However, some hoses it won't matter if you don't do a good job wrapping it. Unfortunately, others (like this one) are sort of cheap and get knotted easily, so you DO have to take the time to wrap it correctly or else the hose will be damaged over time. I guess if you're not the type of person that wraps the hose when you're done with it (and just leave it sit in the yard) none of this will matter. But in my house we have to wrap the hoses.This means, if you drag the hose across the yard, you might have to go back and straighten out the knots because knots WILL most likely happen. And they will happen in three or four different spots on the hose. To me that's a sign of a bad hose. If one knot occurs that's ok. More than one knot and the hose is bad.However, the one thing that makes up for the knot problem is that I've NEVER had a problem with this hose squirting water where it shouldn't. You see, it's hard for me to say whether this Flexogen hose is bad or good. It has problems, but if you can deal with the knot problem you will have a good hose that will last a long time.I'd say using it just to wash your car isn't a bad idea, but dragging the hose across the yard to rinse off things (and water the garden) IS a bad idea because the knots will continue to occur, so you'll have to keep walking all the way back to where the hose begins to straighten it out.  If you think that's not a problem go ahead and get one.
I read all the positive reviews and was excited about it. Now im excited to replace it with a plastic rain bird sprinklerPros: Solid build, strong material construction, quick performer, very easy to adjust the spray pattern.Cons: It does not have a gasket on the bottom thread so youll need to add some plumber's tape to get a solid seal. It has some overspray that goes beyond the spray pattern which is disappointing if you wanna keep from wasting water. Expensive! At this price, I could have purchased two plastic Rain Bird sprinklers.Other: I recently tested three different impact sprinklers (on video) and so far the best seems to be the plastic rain bird, youll see my video review from youtube this one and the plastic one if you view the plastic one.
It installs easily, and it works.  What more is there to say about a product like this.  When you have a weed-whacker, eventually, you will have to refill the spool.
I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday.  It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!!  I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any.  12/30/08  I now have a complaint!  The light in this unit was faulty.  It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22, 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING!  Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit.
All products of this type are not effective for mosquito control, so if that's your intent, you must look for an alternative type of apparatus.  Bug zappers like this use UV light; it's been proven time and again that mosquitos have 0% attraction to UV light!  Oh, sure, the octenol attracts SOME types (not all) mosquitos, but the way this device is designed, the octenol cartridge hangs on the BOTTOM of the unit, away from the electric grid.  Mosquitos that are attracted have absolutely no reason to go inside the grid, because once again, they are NOT attracted to UV!All this device will do is kill a bunch of UV-attracted bugs, such as moths and mostly harmless aquatic-type insects that would NEVER have come near your home anyway if you didn't have a bright UV bulb shining in their faces.  Oh sure, by statistical chance, you'll kill a few mosquitos just by chance one flies in there by random but we're talking about less than 5% of the mosquito population will do that.  5% erradication is not going to solve any of your mosquito problems.  Folks, this is all scientific proof, so please don't believe the huff and puff of marketing schemes to make you believe otherwise.  If you need to control moths or non-mosquitos, then this unit might be good for you.  Otherwise, look for something else.
After a major fly infestation in Southern California this summer, I wanted something a little less offensive (smell-wise) than theRESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trap(s) I'd been using to great effect. I did my research on Amazon and Flowtron was the hands-down winner. Although our entire lot is only 2000sf, I decided to spend the extra few dollars on the 1-acre model.It seems to work well, because I hear the thing buzzing all night long, and the housing definitely leaves a lot of space for insects to get in--one morning I found a praying mantis stuck in it. My major insect concern, though, was flies, and because they're only active during the day, the Flowtron is moot. And I was really looking forward to seeing some of those biting flies get their just deserts. If the mosquitos are getting theirs, maybe the ants are hauling the corpses away before I can do a body count.So what insect population am I decimating? Moths, evidently. The problem is, I don't mind the moths! One day I'll have a bigger backyard and then I'll give it a real workout (and an updated review). Still, I have no regrets about buying this unit.
SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job, but didn't last that long, and was expensive to replace. The pesky "flies" go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract "non pesky" bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away, so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside, and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy, but that is how I feel :)
Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent, but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room.

July 18th, Just received the first bug zapper. Currently giving it one star rating r/t it being DOA. As always, Amazon stands by its products and has excellent customer service. I also bought the shepherds crook that is 48" tall that was purchased by many others, and IMO it is too short. The instructions state to hang it 6-8' in the air. If this is  true, this crook will be insufficient for optimal bug zapping. Hopefully I'm wrong with this one!I'll update when I receive my replacement unit.UPDATE JULY 20thAmazon got me the replacement device with enough time to spare for the party tonight, which I'm exceptionally happy for. The first bug zapper is back in the box waiting to ship back, and the new one is out waiting for tonight for some bug carnage. When I opened the package (which was NOT damaged) the first thing I notice is the electrified grid is bent and misshapen. I tried to push bend it back, but it looks like it is a factory defect. The bad thing is because of this defect, the safety of the device is decreased - I can tough the electrified grid with my fingers without a problem! I'll see if later I can remove the lightbulb so it'll allow me to correct the metal bending a bit more. I luckily don't have children, however if I did they would have zero problems zapping their fingers.Flowtron is DEFINITELY not scoring big points with this device thus far! We will see how things go tonight.UPDATE AUGUST 1stThe bug zapper has been working out great. I can't tell you the thousands of annoying insects this thing has fried. On a cooler night it went crazy. It was the best serial killer I've ever seen. The Mosquitos have had a severely noticeable decline. Previously I couldn't leave the back door for more than 5 minutes without receiving multiple bites, and now can sit outside for 30 minutes with a rare bite attempt. Huge improvement! The zapping grid is still a bit bent out of shape, but its obviously working, so no complaints!One note: In the directions it states, "The (product number)15 and (product number)80 are designed with a three pronged (grounded) plug). The (product name)40 is made with a two pronged plug and should be installed with the appropriate plug recepticle. ... NOBODY sells 2-prong extension cords anymore! And with the literally 1' cord that it comes with this is KIND of a huge thing! I guess we'll see what happens with the 2 hold cord in a 3 hole plug!
This does not make a huge difference in mosquito's bothering us.  It just lets us hear them die once in while. There is a perverse pleasure in that.
the first thing that happened was that the two end caps fell off. where? i don't know. but i hope to find them. i really think this is a 1 inch capacity lopper. in my experience there is no way this can cut 2 inches of wood. what kind of wood can it cut 2 inches of? yes it is a great tool but for 1 inch branches or less. i am happy that i bought it but it is for light duty and it does a great job of light duty work. i have been outside clearing a lot of branches and brush and i cannot ever see this cutting 2 inches of anything.
On a brisk February day the mighty Spudman purposely trod to the extremes of Spud Acres to cut some kindling for his fireplace and test out his new 32" Corona anvil lopper with a stated two inch capacity. He laid out some fallen branches of varying diameters and with arms like pistons began to cut. On smallish one inch wood he was mostly successful with few drops of sweat shed.An intimidating 1.5" branch tested his mettle and the lopper's metal, but with his brute strength Spudman prevailed. However he met his match with the imposing two inch diameter branches, stubborn wood that even he with his new Corona couldn't master. Frustrated, he tried his tool on a thick piece of rotted wood. Success! But just barely.The dejected Spudman walked back to the house, sat down, and read the glossy attachment that had been tied to the Corona.32 inch compound action - check24 inch fiberglass handles - check8 inch non slip foam grips - checkCuts up to 1.5 inches - chabonga!He returned to Amazon and read the product page again. "It don't say nothin' bout 1.5 inches," he griped.Since he had scored a warehouse deal and bought his loppers for pennies under 20 dollars, he decided to keep them. IThe Corona will keep company with his little Fiskars and the Ace telescoping-handle loppers in the garden shed. Spudman will continue to use his Corona loppers for the one inch wood. For the thicker stuff, he'll use his little Black and Decker 18V battery powered chainsaw or just snap the sticks into pieces with his Herculean arms."Made in Taiwan to Corona's exacting specifications."
I originally purchased this to keep stray cats out of my raised beds.  The material, however, is too flimsy and if the cat (or any other large animal) really wanted to get into the beds, it wouldn't have too much trouble cutting through the netting with its claws.  So I had to pursue a different path to keep the cats out.I did, however, keep using this material to keep birds and other unwanted pests (moths, butterflies, etc.) out of my garden.  Having another pair of hands around to help with installation is good because this material tangles easily and snags on just about everything, including itself.  So you need to exercise care when putting it on otherwise it will rip.  I also realized after a few months of use that the mesh size is too large so moths and butterflies can easily squeeze themselves through the netting and make their way to the plants.For the price, it's a decent product.  I'm thinking I can get at least one, maybe two, season's worth of use before I have to throw it out and start with fresh material.  Next time around, I will look for a stronger material that I can reuse for more than a couple of years.
I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons, but with the help of another person and two long poles, we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away, it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled, before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing, what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit, but I don't want to kill songbirds, certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away, not kill them.
Easy to handle but came with no stakes or any kind of tie-down. Also, no directions about how to wrap tree. Spaces seem small enough to keep out birds but it really should come with sample pics or directions. We had to take ours down because we wrapped it too tight and the trees were dying.
A couple of years ago my husband decided to shove our old mower in the shed and buy this push mower with the sharpening kit and grass catcher. His motivation was that this mower would not pollute and was ecologically responsible.While it isn't hard to maintain or use and it can be adjusted for height easily, I am a finicky type and I really don't care for the job this mower does. I miss the good old days when my lawn looked perfectly manicured with neat paths of freshly mowed grass.The positive in regard to this mower is that it cuts a wide path which theoretically is time saving and efficient. The negatives are more numerous. The handle on this mower has fatigued 6 times in two years. I have ordered replacement handles a couple times after duct taping proved to be a poor fix at best. The grass catcher has been replaced twice because it fell apart. We are on our second sharpening set. The most irritating aspect  of having this mower is that it does a poor job if the grass gets too long between mowings. The weird weather conditions this spring has resulted in my grass seeding twice and growing like crazy. Long strands of germinating grass stand in contrast to the parts that actually do get cut. Most of the time, my husband mows the lawn twice in an attempt to get it even. Usually that makes little difference as to the lawn's overall appearance.This is a cheap mower. It might be great for someone who has a small yard, but my yard isn't small. This mower Isn't even close to my grandpa's old push mower that really tamed an unruly lawn and was solid.  Last night I had to order a new handle and another sharpening kit.Today I am going to buy a nice power driven Toro and I'll mow the lawn from now on.
I love push mowers - quiet and when the blades are sharp, they do a great job. This goes for this mower, too. It is ideal if you have a small lawn or want to get a little exercise while mowing. The downside to any push mower is that apparently they require a special skill set to sharpen the blades & most garden shops do not sharpen the blades.  I was able to find one place that sharpens blades in the entire area and it is not cheap. It's not a good idea to do it yourself, quite dangerous, & dull blades are useless. The blades seemed to dull very quickly, if that is possible - maybe they weren't very sharp to begin with. I hope more people will buy push mowers, which will force more shops to consider getting the tools so they can offer sharpening. I have 4 friends who all have the same problem. This has nothing to do with the mower itself, just know that before you buy it, research your area to make sure there is someone who can sharpen it for you.
Have a good place to put it. It certainly isn't mobile. But you can put a lot of seeds in here.
I had never grown from seed before, but I wanted to plant some morning glorys this spring.  I tried to direct-sew last year but that was an epic fail.  I realized if I really want them I need to start them indoors.Off to trusty Amazon I go!  I sort of hastily bought one of the top seed starters that showed up in the search.  I did what it said, and alas I have (some) morning glorys in addition to some basil and cilantro seeds I had sitting around.  I had average sprouting, but I would always attribute that to the seeds more than the plastic trays!I did feel that the plastic cover is VERY flimsy, it actually doesn't fit on the top very well.  I suppose its not that big of a deal because the top isn't really on very long, but I would have appreciated it being a little more sturdy.The bottom tray is a bit more robust and I haven't had any issues as I've moved the full tray a few times.So far its served its purpose, but now as I've done it once I might look around for some different/better options in the future.  Try a few things out, etc.With that said I wouldn't mind using this one again, especially as its inexpensive but I would like to see what is out there.
This is a decent item, but a little flimsy. The holder does not hold the soil discs well and the plastic container bends very easily making it hard to mve without caution. It gets the job done, is a good price, but I might try a different brand next to see if it is sturdier.
In theory, this should work. I don't like how you can't see if there is anything in it. It sometimes will get knocked down so will look like its trigger and there's no real way to tell without opening it. This morning trap was knocked down, and I walked it all the way out into the wood to release oocupant only to discover it was empty.This trap might work okay, but I think the mouse cubes are alot better.
Recently I've been researching mice and other vermin as they pertain to farmstead habitation.Knowing that they must be removed from chicken coops and feed storage areas, it's nice to have options that do not require poison, nor snap a mouse/vole/rat to death and leave it for animals to pick at and possibly get sick from.Your cat, dog and other pets may get access to dead animals in traditional traps, so these enclosed live catch traps seemed like a great idea.I purchased four and placed them on a shelf where mouse droppings were noted.  I also places a motion activated camera so I could better see how they were or were not being trapped by the device.Within one 24 hour period, three out of four traps placed were tripped with nothing at all inside.  Upon video and still image review, a Deer Mouse had trotted over the top of the three traps that were tripped and of course activated them without being inside.The third trap remained unsprung, but the Deer Mouse only sniffed the opening and failed to enter.With all four traps re-set for another go, the Deer Mouse now just scampers around each trap and doesn't bother with them at all.I have added a photo of the setup and mouse to the collection of photos submitted by buyers/reviewers.I like the idea of the tilt trap and in theory it's great, in practical use it's simply not effective.  There are many solutions to this problem:The most popular is to simply put a cardboard box over the tilted UP end, through a hole that is cut just slightly taller than the trap at the fulcrum.  This allows the trap to activate, but does not allow the mouse to stand ON the tipped up section.  As this is an innovation which isn't already a part of the trap, I am giving my two star rating on the traps as designed.It also wouldn't hurt to make them larger with an adjustable balance weight... the buyer can of course make any number of modifications and the system is already being copied and improved by other companies... I guess this is an example of another weak patent registration process.So, I sadly would not recommend these to friends and others wanting to rid themselves of mice quickly.... but IF you enjoy the process of problem solving and using these as a starting point, you will certainly foil the mice and end up collecting them in short order.Look for the design which has a housing over the tipped up portion... it's better.
I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap; just couldn't bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house.  I posted a picture; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill.  I found that I was "waiting up" and checking the mousetrap every half hour, because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there.  A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes.
We have  been feeding hummingbirds on our mountain in North Carolina for years now. The hummers have 2 clutches a year and, by late in the season, we will have 30 or 40 of them circling the feeders, claiming their territory and buzzing each other in some mock "hummingbird wars".  In August, we will empty one of these in a day, so we have to have multiple feeders to keep up.  This is the feeder we have always bought and they are pretty durable but once in a while a black bear will wear one out for us-so we keep a couple extra.  The feeder hangs on a piece of electrical wire that goes under the lid on top and the other end gets bent into a loop to hang on the hook.  But now they have decided to shorten the wire until it is just a few inches long after making the loop and tying the knot under the lid. I know the company must have saved about a penny on the wire length but it doesn't work for us now - I have to use a 2-step ladder to hang it.  So, I'm off to the home store to try to find some red electrical wire that I can use to replace the one that is way too short.Beyond that, this is the feeder to use.  The glass jar cleans easily with a jar brush and the yellow flowers at the bottom pop out so you can reach in with an old toothbrush to clean the inside. The 6 positions works way better than the 4 place feeders for us due to the number of hummingbirds that are trying to feed simultaneously.  Just giving it 3 stars - hoping the company rethink their board-room decision on the attachment wire.
This product is well made and works well; however attempting to clean both the bottle and the base is very difficult. The base is sealed and with many small hard to reach spaces inside I can't see how it can be cleaned. The neck of the bottle is very narrow. Even with a bottle brush it's hard to reach all the area inside.
I like the product being glass and so do the hummers. It would be nice to see PP improve the rim or perch to a more durable one as it becomes flemsy and easily breaks away from the base over time. Also the the yellow ports should be changed to red so as to discourage bees.
I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean. This feeder is way too large for my liking, you need a lot (tons!) of sugar syrup to fill it up. It also took a week for my hummingbirds to go near this feeder and even now it's their second choice to my other smaller feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. And I don't think they are very attracted to this feeder due to its flat yellow flowers, instead of the pretty raised ones you get on other feeders.
Works as expected.  Attracts humming birds and others.  Decent value.  As stated in many reviews needs a hook system and requires you to figure that out.
The bee guards worked great but the reason I gave it only three stars is the price. Over a buck a piece is more than it should be in my option. If it wasn't a gift to my dad who enjoys his hummingbirds I would have kept looking for a cheaper place to purchase them.
These did not fit my feeder, but I super-glued them in place. The "basket" part also falls off of the "stem" part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue, so if you try this work-around, be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry, too.I like feeding bees, and they have their own plate of sugar water, but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky, although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today, a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it, bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems, I guess!
Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton. Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22-inch Weber with hinged grate that I love.The WSJ is small, somewhat solidly constructed (mine, while unused, has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover - not good).However, most folks use this Weber as a portable grill. Weber, for gawd's sakes, incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle! (i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degrees).The stove's best feature, the ability to cook using fewer coals, is also its drawback. This stove is best suited for slow cooking, delicate kebabs, fish, hot dogs, and burgers - not for hot, quick searing and grilling of thick steaks.Other drawbacks are the vents, which do not (at least on my unit) rotate smoothly. And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers - i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stove.Also, being lightweight, this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session, resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals - especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height (cooking on the ground with this thing can be down, but for many folks, may be uncomfortable). I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legs?All in all, this stove is OK - it gets the job done. I like Weber products, even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 years.I hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18-inch (given away), my 22-inch (8 years going strong), and newest acquistion, the Smokey Joe Silver.
the grill is fine, but what i was really hoping was the clean up of the ashes was actually "one touch".  perhaps you can get used to it, but removing and re-attaching the ash-catcher is a bit of a pain.  there are much better ways to design an ash catcher that would be easy to remove and re-attach. oh well...hopefully weber will spend some money on a re-design for the ash catcher in future models.
Great grill that cooks just like a Weber!  Whoever changed the handles from wood to nylon should be fired though... they have obviously never grilled before.  This handle gets HOT!!!  Who wants to put a glove on just to open a grill... this isn't the smartest move unless Weber is attempting to save trees (but they should remember where charcoal comes from).  I won't buy another Weber if it has these cheap handles.
Alright,I am one that loves to grill, but doesn't know anything about grills themselves, really. Due to monetary situations I had to grill on the cheapest possible grill... The green Sunbeam camper grill. I'm sure you know what grill I'm talkin' about. For over 6 years it has been my grill of choice (hey it was only $10!) and has treated me well. Over these years I always dreamed about owning a "real" charcoal grill. I wanted the American icon, I wanted the Weber One-Touch. I heard all about how durable and well built it was, how it will last for 10 years+ and how it's just a step above the rest. After actually purchasing this grill I have a bit of buyers remorse. You see, before actually buying this I was looking at a grill from Char-Broil. It had the ash catching pan like the One-Touch gold, it had space to put plates and such (sorta like the One-Touch Platinum) and it had grates with adjustable height, not to mention all of this came at a price just $5 higher then the One-Touch Silver! Anyways, for the last 2 years I wanted nothing more then the Weber so I got it. Once I started puting it together I realized that this grill just doesn't seem to have $80 worth of craftsmanship. The legs are super-flimsy hollow aluminum pipes, very cheap. The itsy bitsy tabs that hold the bottom grate are slightly uneven so my bottom grate is a bit wobbly (also it's possible for the bottom grate to fall because the tabs are pretty small). A wobbly bottom grate probably doesn't make a lick of difference when it comes to grilling, it's just that it wasn't right, it's just one of those little annoying quirks. I guess I expected everything to be heavy duty. I expected solid metal legs and such. You can find an identical grill from Char-Broil for less then half the cost! I hear that Weber is a step above because they are built to last... well my cheap $10 Sunbeam is 6+ years old and I've never had any problems with it, it's all about how you take care of it. Personally, I think for the $80 price tag of the One-Touch silver, you should at least get the hinged cooking grate, but you don't.There are good things however. First, it's just nice to have the American icon. There is a certain feeling that comes with grillin' on the good ol' Weber kettle. There are a TON of accessories made for it and replacement parts are extremely easy to find. The one-touch system is pretty handy (although hardly one-touch).Overall I am still happy with the purchase, I love looking at that grill. It's probably gonna grown on me more and more as years pass by. Based on price I decided to get the Silver version, but the Gold might be worth looking at. Afterall you get a much better ash-pan (I modified my silver to be just as good though... just a little creativity should do the trick) and you get the hinged grate with the gold (although you can just buy this grate for $15-$20 and stick it on your Silver if you wanna)Choose... but choose wisely.YEAR UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------Okay, now it's been over a year since I posted my original review. This really is a great grill, I wish I could bump the stars up to 4, but I can't... Amazon wont let me. Some of the minor quams I said previously still apply, but this baby cooks a mean dish! I have abused mine for a year and it runs like brand new.What really made me do this update was when I grilled on a buddy's kettle. It wasn't a weber kettle and it shows. After a year of using this I got to know this grill really well, I got used to such high quality materials. This grill really is above and beyond most other kettle style grills.I do wish I would have purchased the gold though. The ash pan that comes with the silver is not much use if you're grilling in any sort of wind.
Has caught mice, but only the smaller ones. Has also caught voles, but again, only the juveniles. Perfectly humane, but rodents, even if left in a trap like this overnight, tend to eat each other.  So yes, the trap works, but in  my experience, not the solution for anything but the smallest rodents.
We purchased this mouse catcher last year when we were suddenly inundated with winter lodgers in the basement.  At first, this trap did a fine job, but then it just petered out on us and stopped working.With items like this it is hard to say where the fault lies, so we are giving it Three Stars.  We had better luck though with the Woodstream Havahart Mouse Trap.Three Stars.  Leaves mice sweaty but ready to live outside again.  For us the trap stopped trapping after a couple of months.
so, I was trying to save some money and avoid buying an electric or gas powered de-thatching rake/power rake.  I thought this would be a good idea, and I will say, it works as designed but it is HARD work.  Now, this being said, my lawn has a pretty thick layer of thatch because I have a mulching, push mower.  I don't bag for multiple reasons, but bottom line, I needed a way to thicken my grass up.  The only way to do this is either aerate or remove the thatch, which I chose the thatching rake.  I worked my butt off for about 2 hours and had gotten only about 20% of my yard complete, if that.  Not sure if it's supposed to do this, but the head would swivel over about 2-4 rakings, and you will have to flip it over, to get the preferred angle.  It might be meant to do it like this, but I typically don't read directions.Its ok, nothing great, nothing horrible.  I will say the quality seems good, it's got a solid wood handle, and I think it will last longer than I'll even care to use it.  I suppose, in a pinch, you could swing this thing around and do some damage to zombies.  however, I would prefer a piercing/slicing weapon for zombie battles, for obvious reasons.
Dethatch your lawn with this rake ONLY if you really have to!! This tool is head heavy, so your arms will get really tired, unless you are in super shape. I will allot one week to do the front lawn. I am still sore from using it on 1/3 of the lawn. It will remove everything including green, which will leave your lawn looking terrible.
I used this rake to thatch our front lawn this fall.  It was very labor intensive since we have a large front yard.  I think in the feature I may try an electric thatcher to save time.  I was also disappointed by the fact that I saw the same rake at my local big box store for 10 or 15 dollars cheaper.
This lasted me about two years before the plastic handle broke off.  For the price, I am surprised it lasted as long as it did!  I am sure I dropped it more than enough times.  Overall, I do not regret this purchase.
I gave these only three stars because of how they do and feel in your hand.  They will slip in your hand because there a bit slick and hard to hold.  There ok for small cuts and not having to use them a lot at one time.I wouldn't buy these if i had it to do over again.
I've usually found Fiskars gardening products to be innovative and effective, but there's usually a kink in the design.  I still swear by the Power Lever shears because the blades move parallel and effortlessly, but the kink is the retaining pin which is a pressure fit which simply loosens with use as the hole in the blades enlarge.  As to this very lovely and innovative Power Gear lopper, well, let's say there are a lot of kinks.  As you may have discovered, the handles break and the blades are fragile.  Just how fragile?  Check Home Depot's website for feedback on this very lopper and you'll even see pictures of the chipped Titanium blade.  It happens a lot, a whole lot.  Quality control may well be to blame, but the material used in the titanium blade is just not solid or steel.  My blade broke or rather chipped the first week of use and the broken surface revealed something that looks like pot metal.  The material in the blade looks like a composite, a grainy composite.  If you look at the blade you'll see that's it's very hefty and designed to withstand a direct applied force, but apparently not a force related to twisting, which would act against the cutting edge with increased leverage due to the unusual depth of the blade and its almost rectangular shape.  So you have high tech materials that when working, operates as advertised, save for that extra span needed to clear the blade around let's say a 2 inch branch.  BUT here's the good news:  Fiskars has replacement blades.  Here's the not so good news:  Fiskars charged me a reasonable $7.99 for the blade, but a very, very hefty shipping and handling ($4.00 for the handling) charge of $11.39, making the modestly priced blade $19.38 to purchase and receive.  The replacement blade (they're determined by the distance between the mounting holes)is steel and shaped like traditional lopper blades:  no more composites, no more thick blades, which tells you something.  As to Power Gear hedge shears, well , count your blessings with the lopper, because there ain't no replacement parts for the hedge shears from Fiskars, and their kink is the composite Power Gear mechanism, which breaks teeth with a passion, rendering the unit useless, unless you have a similarly wounded twin, because the mechanisms are comprised of two sets of power gear parts, that are interchangeable front and rear.  There you go, have fun.
it looks like a well made high quality piece of equipment. brand new right out of the box both handles fell off. i guess i can glue them back on but this is a brand new tool under warranty.update: i glued the two handles onto the metal arms. it works great. it is very powerful. i like it. it has enough leverage that it can do the big jobs easily.
Because of the length and the power gear, you have to spread your arms wide in order to make this 2" cut, which can be troublesome in many cases, if you ever come across a power gear2 design, i'd suggested you buy it instead, a 27 inch power gear2 also cuts 2" while your arms don't have to do spread eagle all afternoon, this one serves the purpose, but tiresome after 15 minutes.
I bought these a year ago but hadn't used them much.  I just began using them this spring and loved them - would have given them five stars until today.  Ironically I just ordered another pair yesterday because they are so easy to use - lightweight and sharp.But today the orange clamp that keeps them closed when not in use no longer does its job and they stay open all the time which makes them bulkier to carry as they are much less compact with both blades and handles splaying out.  That's the reason for only 3 stars. After today's malfunction I wouldn't order them again.  Plus the price has gone up in a year from $8.68 to $11.79. They are VERY useful - I just wish they were sturdier.
Fiskars just doesn't seem to be what it used to. These are alright but they do have problems. When pruning with the blades at a downward angle, the locking pin slides down and locks them when you are in the middle of using them. I've had to play with them and hold the locking pin back with my thumb while I use them. The blades cut well but I wouldn't say these are worth the price.
Here in Houston I go through one of these reels every 3 years give or take a bit. What happens is the central support for the wheel simply snaps and the reel then hangs at an odd angle. Soon, it will just fall off. At least it gives a bit of warning.Examining the carcasses of my dead reels I've learned that the plastic bleaches in the sun and the heat and then becomes brittle. It just crumbles. If the reel is full of hose, that extra weight doesn't help much either.I'm going to try knocking back to just 50 feet of hose instead of the full reel of hose. My experienced guess is that will work  better. Also I'll spray some UV protectant on the hub before I mount the reel. That may help.So why do I keep buying these if they don't last too long? Well, for one I've got my holes drilled in the brick and I really like just being able to slap the new unit in place of the old one without drilling even more holes for some new reel which may or may not last any longer than this one. Also, I don't see where anybody makes a side winding reel that is that much better than this one for the price at this time.
I bought a STA100 at True Value Hardware this morning. It ran $23.99 + tax = $25.50. (With a store buyers card). It's slightly different than the one I replaced, requiring me to drill 3 new holes. Not an issue with me. Like other reviews I've read, the round parts that are on either side of the wrapped hose were also warped. That means it came from the factory/shipper that way. There was no damage to the shipping box. Perhaps the heat from the sun will help straighten that out. I also read their 5 year warranty, which I doubt I would ever use. The defective one needs to be shipped back to the company at owners expense, they will fix or replace it, then you must pay for return shipping. That is NOT a good or reasonable warranty. Still, I'm satified with my purchase. UPDATE: IT DIDN'T EVEN LAST ONE YEAR. WHILE I LIVE IN ARIZONA WHERE IT'S HOT, THE PLASTIC DRIED OUT AND FRONT PART WITH THE HOSE FELL OFF AFTER BREAKING. IT'S NOW USELESS AND IN THE TRASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. OR AT LEAST DO NOT BUY ONE THAT MOUNTS ON A WALL. CHANGE MY RATING TO A 1 OR 2.
I have not used this product yet, but it is very heavy and lots of wood chips came with it. I am looking forward to having the time to fool with it.
I love this grill, it is deceptively small from the outside. You can probably fit 8-10 burgers on it. It takes up a third of the space as my old "Grill 2 Go" portable grill. It has an attractive dark green finish. As others have said, it heats evenly unlike most grills which focus the heat along the burner.The only reason I'm giving it three starts is because Amazon (and the Char Broil) site lists it as having a propane tank included. From reading the Amazon description and some other reviewers comments, it should've come with a smaller propane tank. According to the Char Broil site there should be a 20 pound tank. I sent Amazon an email followed by a phone call, and they stated that there should've been a tank, so they immediately sent me a new grill, had it the next day, great customer service! But this one, like the first box said on the outside "LP tank not included." I called Amazon now, and the rep agreed that there should be a tank, and sending a third unit would be pointless as it would probably not have a tank. Amazon offered me a $30 refund to cover the cost of a 20 pound tank purchased locally, which was an acceptable resolution.
With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets, kill them while they are torpid, and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring.
Changed from 1 to 3 stars. 'Worthless' was initially noted, as the YJ's often walked in and just walked back out. It will trap some initially, but later catches flys AND hornets. The bags often have defects. This 'type' of bag device is great for flies (get the 'Big Bag' fly type as it stinks more like a ripe out-house and holds lots) but this (YJ type) smells like rotten fish (better to smell bad and catch things that sting you). Get the 'Big Bag Fly Trap' type like this for flies but use Rescue yellow plastic traps for YJ's. (W.H.Y traps are worthless so read the reviews). These will trap some flys and YJ's and a few Hornets going in for live food. Hornets will not fit in the hard yellow Rescue YJ traps, but hornets do fit in these, and do go in after flys and YJ's.Hornets are very unique and there seems to be no attractant for hornets, except people, and other live insects. Stick with Rescue (hard yellow-domed plastic type) for YJ's. This type, made for flies, work 'great' for flies. Hornets seem to hang out at the bag-type fly and yellowjacket traps to capture live insects. Sometimes these traps and the fly traps capture hornets (that is why I switched from 1 to 3 stars) that go in looking for live flys or maggots but it is not real common. I find one hornet hangs out at he top of the trap at a time, and when there is a hornet there the other bugs disappear. When it is gone the other critters reappear. These traps smell like rotten fish, which is fine, and the fly traps smell like outhouses, which is really strong if the wind is wrong. Hard to eat near the fly traps. I have trapped several hornets that go in due to the activity in the bags.Hint: If you add a very little non foaming, non smelling, dish soap to any water-type trap the insects drown quickly instead of crawl out, dehydrate, wear-out, or over-heat. These critters (YJ's and hornets) only know to sting and are constantly hunting for food for their hive, to feed the larvae (more future scavangers). They sting live bugs and bury them in with the growing insect to feed on while they are in suspended animation = creepy).Update 8-7-13:I still think these are not as good as the reusable Rescue hard trap (for yellow jackets) which you can re-bait:Pros:-They do catch flys and some YJ's.-They do trap some hungry Hornets looking for live critters.-It is an attractant for flys, YJ's and Hornets (rotten fish smell and activity)-It comes with attractant; just add water and a lead to hang it with.Cons:-They are firm plastic bags, flexes but not soft like a baggie-type, and some have arrived with holes (punctures) in them, which I used duct (Gorilla) tape on to cover then fill. This can lead to a stinky mess if you fill any in the kitchen. I do not know a way around this type of bag and think 'it is the best they can do' for a bag.-Holes develop on the seams after a while. Maybe from the weight of the water.-You have to keep replenishing the liquid that evaporates (I use a little wine/apple juice/sugar-water with a dab of non-fragrant, non foaming dish soap; do not use hot water).-They are one-use and throw away (before tossing I recommend draining the fluid outdoors, away from the house, letting the bag dry out, then throw away in the trash - stinky mess with maggots from flys). I do not recommend just putting a smelly liquid-maggot-filled bag in your trash.-Many yellow jackets tend to walk-in and walk-out, as do hornets and flys.-Stationed at most bags there is a sentry Hornet that posts itself at the entrance and it keeps all YJ's and flys away. Hornets prefer live catch. Other flying insects seem to be afraid of them, and I have seen some Hornets try to sting a bug (from the outside of the bag) that is inside the bag, and they try to catch any that fly around. This problem tends to keep many flys and YJ's away from this type of trap.-I have seen Hornets stationed at the 'fly traps', too, but I have trapped many flys in them so they get 5 stars. I have seen Hornets go in and sting maggots but have not witnessed them flying out with them, not that they don't.-these do not come with a hanging device (so be sure you have one on before you fill it).-you must carefully cut the bag with scissors around the opening to pull out the entrance device before filling and hanging.
This was a nice idea, but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder, the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it, because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table, which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers.
I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak.  After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack.  I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water.  I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals.
If you're a lightweight and looking for something to scoot you along, then this is for you; however, if you're a little on the heavy side even the slightest, the wheels on this hesitate to move smoothly.  The reason is these do not have wheels that are totally rounded on the inside as well as the outside.  Picture a wheel cut in half and each half goes on opposite sides of the garden stool, so the wheel itself is not very supported on the inside.  Now, I have another garden stool I got from Home Depot.  The wheels are round on the inside and out, much stronger, roll smoother and have a seat which you can pick up to use as a handle to haul supplies, kind of like a kid's wagon.  On this you cannot.  So, as I said, if all you want is something to scoot on and you're a skinny-mini type of person, then this will do well for you.  Otherwise, try your local garden center.
This is a very sturdy little item for yard work, but it is very low to the ground to be handy to sit on if you have any back problems or you carry any extra weight.  Would be nice if it was a few inches taller.  The storage compartment under the seat is kinda inaccessible, and it would be nice if the seat popped up so you could get to what you store in there.  Would also be nice to have a "tongue" so that you could pull it along.
As a serious bird enthusiast, I have a fairly elaborate setup to attract them and have many.  This feeder seemed a good addition, but there are problems.  To begin with, when it arrived the black cap that covers the spring mechanism in the interior bottom of the feeder was loose in the box.  I don't think it was supposed to be as the directions didn't mention it and it was quite hard to reattach.  The feeder is really big, but not big enough for me to get my arm all the way down inside it to replace this part.  I finally got it placed by using a reacher/grabber gadget, but couldn't get it pushed down firmly.  As a result I expect problems sooner or later.  Right now it's working, though.The directions did show how to attach the pieces of the top, but I found it annoying that you can't set the feeder down with both the lid and the dome pieces attached as they come apart.  I figured out that the dome shaped cover piece is supposed to stay hung at the location you've chosen and only the tube with its lid is to be removed from the underside hook for refilling.Regarding the refilling:  On the good side, the big open tube is easy to fill with most scoops and can accommodate a wide mouth funnel that further speeds filling and minimizes spilled seed.  On the down side, detaching and reattaching the lid is awkward since the tiny side wires of the lid have to fit into equally tiny holes pierced in the tube, and which aren't easily visible since they are slightly recessed under the lid.  You have to squeeze the tube a bit to make it wide enough for the pins to get inside, then releasing it lets them seat if you have them in the correct position.  These holes are very near the top of the tube and should they break when the plastic is hard, during the winter, for example, the whole feeder becomes useless.  The whole weight of this feeder hangs on the two little holes in the plastic which are only about " from the top of the tube. Only time will tell how long the feeder lasts and given the fact that one assumes squirrels will be jumping on it, trying to get at the seed, I have concerns.Another issue I have with the feeder is that the perches are very short.  So far only the tiniest birds have been able to feed from it, the chickadees and wrens.  Others may get the hang of it and I put the best no mess seed in it to encourage them.  I'll just have to wait and see.I have several feeders, all of which are very sturdy and need to be. For one thing, they can easily tip over on the uneven gravel where I fill them, which I have to do as often every other day during heavy feeding times.  They are almost never without many birds vying for the best perch and suffer regular attacks from crows and squirrels.  Both these marauders mostly enjoyed the tray feeder as all the others are tube feeders and squirrel proof (not that they don't get worked over).  I hated to have to remove the tray as some of the birds I most prize seeing prefer it, but the crows and squirrels drive me nuts.  So far this feeder has deterred both, which is a definite plus.Considering how expensive this feeder is, I expect it to do a good job at both satisfying my birds and deterring squirrels--and it has to last a long time.  I'll update after an extended trial period.  I've only had it up a week at this point.  Maybe it will grow on me.Update 9/18/13:  I left my other feeders empty for a while so the birds would work harder to use this one and the finches and titmice have decided it's okay.  The bigger birds still can't get purchase, but at least it's useful for the smaller ones.  It was easy to refill.  I feel a bit more positive toward it at this point.Update 10/12/13: Not feeling so positive anymore as the top broke off while refilling today making the feeder essentially useless because you can't rehang it.  Some super glue might work to reattach the hanging wire to the lid.
I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are, was different. They support all the weight of this big bird feeder, and its heavy when filled...its good its a big one, filling less often interests me. BUT...the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this, and I am thinking in time, just from the elements and the sun/heat that with taking this apart to fill, refill, etc the plastic will fatigue...then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels can't even TRY to get into anymore.To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder. On the upside, it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made, it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions.
This is a decently made product, fairly sturdy and easy to put together. The nut holding the hook together seems to be too small and threaded incorrectly, but it appears to be holding together fairly well none-the-less.Squirrels still mange to use this product as their very own buffet, but they are not able to chow down as fast on the sun flower seeds I fill it with as they can with some other feeders. That is saving me from having to re-fill this as fast as I have had to fill some other supposedly "squirrel proof feeders".The mechanism on the bottom where the food come out is very clever in that it tilts and provides no way for the squirrel to hang on for more than a few moments before dropping to the ground. I am sure that given enough time, the squirrels will find a way to bypass this.What bothers me is the price. This is a fairly high end product for what it is. The only other feeders I've used that are in the same price range is byDroll Yankees YCPT-360 Tipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder(although I am sure there are more expensive brands out there) and my Droll Yankee feeders have withstood the test of time. I've had some of them now for 6 or 7 years and they are still doing an outstanding job.If this product last even for three years it might be worth it, but the look and feel of the plastic makes me wonder if it can hold u to frigid winters, sharp beaks and claws and high winds without damage
I also had the wrong-sized nut/bolt to tighten the baffle, so getting the top hook and baffle off and on to add seed has been a pain. I've been meaning to get another nut for it, but just haven't had time.Assembly is easy, though I have to admit, I didn't quite see how to get the top off an on initially. You have to kind-of squeeze the sides of the plastic tube to get the top off and I wonder how long that'll hold up before it cracks. It does seem to be very study plastic, but we'll see. I do have my doubts about two little metal prongs in two little plastic holes holding up to 3lbs. of seed for extended periods of time.This feeder holds a LOT of seed. The birds took to it immediately. To date, we have not seen any squirrels on it, nor try to access it.I currently have two other feeders from Droll Yankee with lifetime warranties and they are still holding up after six years. Based on this cost and the quality issue with the top nut/bolt, I think there are better options out there.
Between the weight controlled port closure and the tilting and wobbling dome, this bird feeder certainly lives up to its claim of being squirrel proof, BUT it lets so much birdseed fall out of the bottom as the base tilts under the weight of even the tiniest bird that squirrels and large birds can gather up as much birdseed they wish.Probably not quite the solution to the problem you were looking for.Note: The bird feeder comes mostly assembled, and I made no attempt to check the already assembled parts.  After a month one of the perches somehow unscrewed itself and fell off.  I recovered the perch and the nut but could not find the locking washer.  If the locking washer was never there, that would readily explain how the perch came off, and when I checked the other three they were still tight.  So it might be worth a couple of minutes of your time checking that all four perches are screwed in tight when you first unpack it.
It's sturdy, a plus. It's engineered to keep squirrels from damaging it and eating the feed. That works too. It's attractive, another plus. Add that up and you get about 2 and a half stars.BUT...BUT...BUT...The design is not only unfriendly to the squirrels, but it is alsoBIRD UNFRIENDLY.I waited a long time, several weeks to review watching the feeder just off my patio where hangs several other feeders. During that time only one house finch ate from the feeder, only once. The design is not one that readily attracts birds. They have to discover where it is the feed is offered. It's almost hidden unless they actually perch. They don't want to do that.Other feeders with a mesh feed reservoir nearby were super actively being used at the same time this new feeder was ignored. So if it's called a bird feeder and the birds don't like the design, then that's a giant multi-star negative. I can't recommend this feeder over the other styles, even though it is strong enough to discourage the bushy tails. Less expensive feeders are not squirrel detracting, but for the price, perhaps could be replaced once or twice at a lesser price. And they will allow you to watch birds actually eating seeds.Bottom line: keep looking. I really wanted this feeder to work, but it will not be used much longer. I'm listening to the golden finches and chickadees who said "No."
We have some pretty fat squirrels in our yard that have managed to get into every bird feeder we have.  It has been about a summer month and I am actually surprised to say that we have not seen them eating out of this one.  We have seen them look and survey but we have not seen them even try to get on this one.  So far it has worked well to keep the squirrels at bay.  The two downsides to this feeder are that there are only four posts/holes for the birds to get to the seed so only one or maybe two birds will eat at one time.  The other downside is the ridiculous price.  At over 70 dollars one might as well invite the birds out to dinner and a movie.  I can't imagine how the manufacturer can justify the price for this thing.  The top and bottom are metal but the tube is just thin plastic.  How pissed would you be if you bought this filled and hanged it and it fell and cracked the tube?!
It's really almost too big a bird feeder and the perch legs are too short.  Only little birds can land on the legs and they're not likely to do so with such a massive feeder.  It's expensive, it's difficult to clean because of the way the lid attaches to the base. The feed holes are too small as well. I would pass on this; just too many negatives.
I have this hanging outside for a month now, and I'm still waiting to see a squirrel fall off it. They don't seem interested in investigating it yet - perhaps the dome is doing its job of keeping the squirrel away from the perch. The perch is supposed to tilt when a squirrel clings on to it, both denying the squirrel access to the birdseed, as well as throwing it off balance and possibly off the feeder.The feeder comes with the top unassembled. My first problem with it came when I tried to assemble it. The nut provided did not hold the dome securely - when I put a light pressure (say, 2 pounds) on the dome, it will push the nut off the hook. I called customer support, who offered to replace the entire feeder. I decided to get a replacement nut from the hardware store instead. Strangely, I could not find a nut that fit exactly, with either metric or Imperial threading - so the problem might be with the threaded hook. However, two metric threaded nuts worked where 1 didn't.The reason why I'm worried about how long this will last is that the seed tube is made of plastic. Near the top, a metal rod goes through holes on either side of the tube. There's no reinforcement, and this being a rather large feeder, a lot of weight is being supported by a bit of plastic.There also doesn't look like a good way of disassembling the bottom of the feeder in order to wash it properly.I haven't yet seen a squirrel being thwarted by this yet, so I'll rate it based on my observation of it so far. I'll update the review when I have more information.
This is an attractive looking, functional feeder and was easy to assemble. The only problem I had was that the unit shipped with the wrong size nut needed to secure the baffle to the hook. Nothing I had at home would fit properly either. I took the hook to my local hardware store and the correct nut is a metric size. Twenty cents later I had the correct part and was able to complete the assembly.I have had the feeder hanging in a tree for a few weeks now and the little birds love it. They took to it within a day or two. [It sometimes takes a week or so for the birds to find a new feeder. I have four other feeders in my yard so the regulars are used to finding food here.] The larger birds have trouble with the little perches. This keeps the Grackles and Starlings from emptying the feeder but it also discourages the Cardinals.The squirrels and chipmunks have not been able to get to the seed by climbing the feeder - however - there is a fair amount of spillage from the tray which ends up on the ground. The chipmunks are having a feast sitting underneath it. The additional of a seed catcher would be nice.The true test of a feeder is whether it will withstand a Midwest winter and ever hungrier squirrels as natural food supplies dwindle. Right now the squirrels aren't that interested. They are curious and jump on it, but don't try too hard. I'm also concerned about the sturdiness of the plastic and how well it will hold up when temperatures go below freezing. I will update as the seasons progress.
ok i was so hoping to love this bird feedersadly i do notfirst off right out of the box i had to call in to get a new hook for hangingwhenever we tried to screw it in then hang it up all came crashing right back down againthe nut was too big so there was simply no way to tighten it like it was supposed to begot the new one it and same thing happened so had to finally just go to a hardware store to jimmy rig iti see in reading reviews we are not the only ones with this issuethen other issue we have is not the easiest thing to fill with the feedand once all the way full wowzers is it heavy we had to change the hook it was onbecause of the weight then i just finally hung it right from the treethen on the issue about being squirrel proofi get the concept but with ours they still try to mess with itand shake the sillies out of it and once in a great while they do manage to knock it hard enoughthat some spills out of it crazy i know but i saw it happen for myselfnow granted maybe out beasts are just more crazy than othersreally they did not get tons of the food not like in the other feeder that we havefor the price i am not so convinced this is the right feeder for our birdsthey really do not seem to like it all that welli see them on the other feeders more than this onenot sure if the poles maybe are too short or whatwe have blue jay cardinals blue buntings and many other small birds too numerous to name them allthe little ones really do not like it at allthe bigger ones i see on it more than the little guysi had to give it a 3 because i feel the design could have been betterand i had to be the one to figure out how to get the top to even work rightand i really feel it is simply too big but maybe that is just for our situation
There really is a lot to like about this bird feeder. I live in the Pacific Northwest in extreme Western Washington, and this is now one of 6 feeders that I have so YMMV (your mileage may vary).I have waited some time before adding this review to observe how my birds have adjusted to the feeder. It has taken some time, but they are, very slowly ,and very gradually, becoming more used to it and using it a bit more. The chickadees and the nut-hatches are finally responding and are feeding from the feeder with greater frequency. The slow start to use this feeder seems to be that in order to get to the seed the birds have to stick their heads into the openings, something many birds seem to be hesitant to do it seems.The Good:1.  Very well constructed with quality materials. This feeder will last a long time and, I think, will hold up to weather and use.2.  It performs as advertised, and it really does thwart squirrels, and for my location, raccoons as well.3.  The top also also has the added advantage of keeping the food more dry in wet conditions thanks to the overhang from the anti-squirrel proof curved top.The Not So Good:1.  Many of the birds seem very hesitant to use this feeder, as mentioned above it may be because they really hae to stick their head into the opening to get to the seed. I use a "premium" blend. Perhaps another sort of feed mix would be more attractive to them> I'm not sure since this blend has had them doing through 20#of seed in a week generally.2.  The level of seed has not gone down much in this feeder after nearly three weeks of use. The birds have been coming to the feeder a little more each day though, so I am cautiously hopeful. I hope that they will gradually become more accustomed to the feeder, but it is a slow process for them it seems.3.  I have not had such a slow response to any other feeder, and Perky Pets feeders have always been a favorite choice for me.So - you see that I don't have a very solid positive answer for this feeder, nor can I say definitively that it does not work. Perhaps the species that you generally attract may make a difference?We attract chickadees, nuthatches, flickers, woodpeckers, various finches, cedar wax wings, juncos, doves, and a host of smaller birds. I have a year round population.I want to love this feeder because it really is made well, but at this point, about 3 weeks after purchase I have some reservations. I have seen an increase in use since I first put it up.
Our last two birdfeeders have been smaller Perky-Pet models and they've been fine. Priced at about $20, and perfectly serviceable and bird-popular even if squirrels have easily solved them.So I wanted to see how Perky-Pet's high-end "squirrel-be-gone" model would work. I did not pay for it, but got it free through the Amazon Vine review program.As a product it's well-made and while I think a smart squirrel will still get some food out of it, I do think this will make it difficult for them. The way the food dispenser tilts and wobbles will make it very difficult for an animal to maintain a long grip. They'll fall, and while they'll come back, they'll fall again.My other feeder, the squirrel could just hang out until I squirted him with water. This one will make them work much harder, and hopefully he gets tired of it and moves on.But is that worth $75? I just don't see how. Bird seed's not that expensive, so even if a squirrel does eat a bunch of seed, how long would it take for him to eat $50 worth of seed? However, I only deal with one smart squirrel - so if you've got several, then it's a different issue. Still, the price seems high for what is basically a fun luxury item.This is a big feeder. I have the tallest shepherd's crook, and this hangs down far enough to be difficult to see under the railings of my porch. Luckily, we can see two of the four portals even if it's a little obstructed. The point is that this is a large 3-pound feeder, and will be a big change if you're used to those smaller, cheaper versions.The size is matched with quality. This has some weight to it, and is not one of those cheap plastic models that seems to age very quickly. I think this model will have a longer useful life. I usually get rid of a feeder once a year, usually after winter, but I bet this one would last.Ultimately, while I like the product and I think it's well-made and should live up to most of its claims, the price makes it so I can't go above three stars. But - a $75 feeder that last 4-5 years is better than paying $20 for a new feeder after every winter. So IF this lasts 3-4 years I would have a different opinion.The birds use this fine - like any new feeder, took a few days, but once they got used to it they all sit there and eat all day.
A rather large, mostly plastic feeder intended to deter squirrels.It's larger than I expected, and flimsier.  The tube isn't quite as rigid as I'd like, the top is attached by a single small bolt/nut, and the bottom is attached via a single spring.  I'm not sure how many seasons this construction will hold up through the variable, wet winters we have here in Maryland (frequent changes from cold to warmer).The unit arrives mostly assembled.  For storage, the top has to come off (since the top is a "baffle", it flops over in storage).  Since the feeding ports are only at the bottom of the feeder, I had to hang it a little higher than I had planned (so it was still visible from my ground floor windows).  Even so, I have to stand near the window to see the feeding ports.The large capacity means less refills are needed, but between lots of seed sitting out, and the design that seems will encourage seed to stick to the bottom of the feeder, I'm concerned I'll get moldy seed and have to scrub this thing out more often than I like-- I prefer the kind where I can easily dump out the dregs without scrubbing or washing.The baffle is pretty garden-variety, and I've seen my squirrels handily climb over baffles like this one (it's not particularly wide nor does it swing/swivel vary hard). The bottom design is innovative and seems like a squirrel clinging would cause the port nearest the squirrel to close, but the crafty little rodents may be able to twist their bodies to still get to the port on the other side.So far, the only birds who've discovered the feeder are chickadees who are trying to get seed from the ports but seem off-put by how far in they have to reach to do so.  That means at this point, I'm not sure how well the feeder works, since neither most of the birds nor my squirrels have discovered the new source of food.  I'm not sure if it's the unusual feeder configuration (my usual feeder is a hanging platform with an anti-squirrel grid), or that the temperature fall has meant lots of other food options for the local fauna.  I'll update once I get more activity, particularly of the furry kind.UPDATE: The chickadees figured it out first, and still are the ones who most like this feeder.  The tufted titmouses use it some also, but I haven't seen any larger birds on this feeder.  The only squirrel observed was eating spilled seed under the feeder, rather than trying to get into the feeder.  One morning I found the feeder in pieces on the ground (nothing broken, the nut/bolt apparently came out of the hook), which might have been the result of a curious raccoon-- but reinforces my concerns about the feeder's construction, so I'm maintaining the 3-star rating.For the time being, I like the idea of this feeder but am ambivalent about the design and durability, especially at this high price point.
I have tried numerous supposedly squirrel-proof feeders over the years.  This is a pretty basic design.  The top keeps squirrels from crawling down fro the top (but they can still jump from nearby branches if not carefully placed).  The bottom is on a spring that closes when the weight of a bigger squirrel (grey) lands.  However, some smaller squirrels, like red, or chipmunks are too light to lower the bottom and can access the seed.These kind of feeders usually work well for a year or two, then get knocked down by deer or bear and the top gets chewed by something (probably the grey squirrels).  They do work pretty well until that time.I have had it hanging for nearly 6 months and have had very little bird interest.  I think it is because I primarily use black oil sunflower seed and they just don't come out well from this feeder.  The benefit of this is that squirrels and deer are not able to tip the seed out. The downside is that the birds also have trouble.  My other feeders are filled with birds and empty quickly.  This pretty much just sits there unless the other feeders are emptied.  I could switch to a seed mix, but the majority of that goes uneaten.  Safflower would probably work, but that isn't very popular in my area.I do think it is very hard to fill.  I had to add an s-hook between the feeder and top baffle to be able to hang it easily.  I won't buy another if a bear steals this.
We have several bird feeders outside our breakfast window and have had a terrible time with squirrels. Our feeders hang from a pergola-type structure build over the window and the squirrels climb up the sides of it and actually leap onto the feeders. I jumped at the chance to review this Perky-Pet Squirrel proof feeder. I have used Perky Pet products in the past (their hummingbird feeders are the best) and always been pleased with them. This bird feeder, however, has been a disappointment.First, the good news: It appears well constructed and it holds a lot of birdseed. It is fairly simple to put together and hang. I've had the feeder up almost one month now and I can report that yes, it is squirrel-proof. They have not been able to get to it.But now, for the bad news: the birds don't seem to like it either. I filled all 3 of our feeders, this one included, and while the other 2 older feeders were empty within days, this feeder still remains almost full of seeds after almost 4 weeks. I have seen birds perched at it but the feeder just isn't popular with them. I suspect that the openings near the base (where the birds have access to the food) isn't obvious to them and they have to stick their heads inside to actually get to the seed. Perhaps it is just sunflower seeds that don't do well in the feeder. I will plan to try another type of seed and ammend this review if there is a difference.
The assembly is easy and the design is good but not perfect as it does not stop small chipmunks getting at it. But this feeder prevents squirrels from feeding on the seeds. I have used this over the past one month and we have few chipmunks in the yard to cause enough trouble at the feeder. When a squirrel jumps at the feeder, the metal dome tilts and wobbles to throw the critter off balance. The weight-activated base also tilts to close off the four feeding ports. The feeder is designed satisfactorily and the metal dome and feeding base is well constructed. The glossy heavy-duty powder coated finish protects the feeder from sun and rain. I have rated three stars for its quality and overall performance.1.Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder
I immediately found that the quality of this feeder is really good. The metal parts are thick and heavy and have a good coat of gloss paint. It comes almost fully assembled as all you need to do is put the top dome and the inner top cap on. So now for why I feel it needs a 2.0 version. First the clear plastic cylinder that holds the feed has two small drilled holes at the top that the inner cap clicks into with pins. I know that its just a matter of time before the holes start to crack and then split and no longer hold the pins. I think they need to reinforce those hole areas with something (i'll use some duct tape of something myself). The other problem and this may just be an oversight is that there is a nut that you use on the inside to fasten the dome/hook hanging knob. Well, that nut is bigger than the hook/screw and just falls off and doesn't secure the dome at all. I called the company and the telephone number on the instructions insert are wrong so I went to the website to verify. Once I got a person on the phone they were very polite, apologized for the bad part. They had initially told me to return the feeder to Amazon and get a new one since it was brand new. I had to mention that I was doing a review thru the Vine program and she immediately said it would be no problem to send out the one part to fix the issue. I also asked if anyone else had called about this issue and she said she hadn't heard anything but would mention it to the appropriate department.Squirrels are clever critters so i'm constantly changing/rotating out my feeders to try and keep them guessing. Some will still figure out a way, as most jump on it and hit it hard enough to make the seed fall out. Which is what I think will happen on this one but I don't think they can hang from it like a bat and eat from it. It is heavier than most feeders so be aware that it really needs a strong line or what ever you are hooking it on to. I did notice (and this may change in the future) The price is $72.00 on Amazon but on the Perky-Pet website its only $59.00 Its way too expensive for a bird feeder but it is made of good materials and sturdy. For me if it wasn't for the Amazon Vine program to get this, i'd pass on it because of the high price.
This is a nicely made feeder, easy to assemble, fill with seed and hang.  I have had it up for about a week and so far no squirrells have  been able to get to the  food!  I have it hanging from a shepards hook  that  is cemented into the ground! The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made, easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!  I can't imagine anyone paying that kind of money for a bird feeder that is suppose to keep squirrels out of it.
We haven't had a bit of problems with squirrels, chipmunks or other pesky thieves stealing birdseed since I put the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be Gone IV feeder out. At first I tried regular birdseed, but the birds didn't seem to care for it. They couldn't (or maybe just wouldn't) dig through the mix of seeds to find their favorites. After seeing the seed level not going down, I decided to swap out the seed for black oil sunflower seeds. The only birds to use it (and still very sparingly) are the goldfinches. Everything here still prefers the other feeders and will pretty much ignore this even when the other feeders stood empty for a few days.The feeder design itself is really interesting. It is large and holds a nice amount of seed (up to 3 pounds!), so you are not filling all the time. The cover is not attached to the feeder, but instead the feeder hooks to it, allowing the cover to wiggle and not let any creatures to sit comfortably on the top. The perches are attached to a free moving base that will tip and close off the food so any unwanted visitors cannot get to the food.This feeder really seems to work well, but my birds don't seem to like it. Maybe this winter will be different as food becomes more scarce.
I let the feeder hang for about a week under 4 different trees.I would purposely put some bird feed on the ground in hopes that they would eat it and then move up to use the feeder.For some reason I never could entice them to try it.Even squirrels climbing neighboring trees and the tree it was hanging from ignored it.The design seems to make sense but I think the main problem is the way the little metal perches are sticking out instead of being in front of the seed dispensor like a more traditional feeder.Maybe when the ground is covered in snow it would draw birds to it.Or maybe in the spring when birds are busy making a nest they would try the easy supply of food.But here in the late summer/early fall they just avoided trying it.
I bought these to clean my hummingbird feeder. I didn't realize they were so short! They are really only good for cleaning out the flower part, but not the glass part of the feeder.
After using a heavy metal mower for years, this was a blast of fresh, light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER, we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend, and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then, too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next....
I wish it had more pockets but I got what I paid for. As I have used it I have found I could use more pockets but it is of good quality and is exactly as advertized.
It looks a lot nicer than it really is. It doesn't fit an ordinary size bucket so I had to go buy a bigger one...
I don't know if these helped or not.  The bars seem too far apart to actually kill a mosquito on the zapper.  The sticky things also fall off after a week or before.  Might be a design flaw in the zapper as there is not a solid surface to stick it to
It sprays water but the cats just walk beyond the area that gets sprayed. They don't seem to care.They (I have two) have a tendency to break. The settings dial never worked properly, and even when turned off for four weeks somehow ate the battery.Animals must be large, probably raccoon or bigger. Definitely doesn't go off for birds or squirrels (though butterflies immediately in front of the sensor sometimes did.) For me it is a source of aggravation and would probably serve me better used as a projectile.
Everytime I forgot and walked out onto the the lawn, I got sprayed pretty good.  That's the problem with this unit. You either have to leave it on all the time and get soaked or remember to turn it on every night before you go in..........or buy an outdoor  timer and hook it up to the hose, which I ended up doing.  The Deer ate 25 flats of impatients I planted last year....... along with 15 Hostas, Daylilies, Verbina, Phlox and anything else they decided to munch on.  Bought these toward the end of the season so I'm not sure if they did any good to deter the deer...........they pretty much ate everything before I  got it.  We'll see next year  ( 2013 growing season) and report back.
It seems to turn on at slightest motion and I think the frequent on-off cycles cause it to eat batteries.  I've gone through a 9v battery every 2-3 weeks so far using this.
The first problem I had was with the leaking pass-through cap. I covered the threads with thread tape to fix that, but that really should not have been necessary. (Minus one star, since most people will not have thread tape.)The next problem was that the water shoots too high in the air. I wanted to aim it at the base of some bird feeders which a raccoon raids every night (climbing over the raccoon baffle), but it was going over the entire feeder from about 10' away. (Minus one star.)Next, I tried moving it to a flower bed where an armadillo often digs, but even putting it on the downhill edge of the bed and slanting it down as much as I could while still being able to get the stake into the ground, the spray was still too high and WAY too long. (Minus one star for not being able to scale down the spray distance to below 15'.)On the positive side, the device uses an infrared sensor, meaning that it keys on moving heat, so that branches blowing in the wind should not set it off. (Add back one star, since the cheapy alternative would have been a simple motion detector.)I'm hoping that having the spray go over the armadillo's head, plus the noise, will be enough to scare him off, but I would have preferred to have it actually hit him with a direct blast of water.
this was my second one, I guess I didn't learn the first time. it also died the first season.  it was great at first. then it just stopped noticing anything walking by. it also started to leak at the hose after a few weeks but if you don't leave the hose on, it doesn't work at all. I think my next plan is electric fence.
Seems to do the job. One disappointment so far is that the zapper net is actually much smaller than other zapper swatters out there. But this is the only one we could find that doesn't have the protective layering hence it still works better than the others despite its smaller size. When some genius figures out that this design in a larger size is the way to go, it'll be a bestseller. But for now, we have this one.
Well, as I only received this about three weeks ago, and the box says very plainly that it takes 60 to 90 days to actually see what the results vis-a-vis this product and my collection of well-dried leaves and garden waste will be ... so I must defer final judgement at this point. Unaided, it seems to take at least six months to produce anything usable, so any promise of improvement on that is well worth waiting fore. I'll update the review then!
I have a black thumb. I can kill just about any plant known to man (including cactus during a drought). Since I've had little success with growing anything edible in the garden, I figured I'd give composting a shot, with the hope of livening up my roses (the one thing I can grow because I pretty much leave them alone except for pruning the bushes a couple times a year).I started my compost pile about a month ago, and I have to say, it's been fairly successful. It definitely has the strong, "earthy" scent one expects from rotting fruits, veggies, and garden cuttings. It's definitely doing something to the stuff I've been adding to the pile--coffee grinds, egg shells, fruit peels, veggie trimmings, dead plants, leaves, etc.The thing is, I don't know how much this compost additive is responsible, if at all, for the results. I think I probably would have had a pretty ripe compost pile anyway, but I just don't know. What I will say, though, is that I don't see any mold or mildew or anything else that would prevent me from continuing to compost.One thing I will suggest if you're new to composting, as I was just a few weeks ago, is that when you start your pile, you need to start with some variety in terms of size and waste. However, make sure you don't leave anything that's too big. I started with the branches I trimmed from my rose bushes. I should have probably cut everything down to no larger than 6 or 8 inches long, but I've got a few branches that are over a foot, and I don't know if it's because of the number of branches (they started out as about half my pile) or the size of the branches, but they are very difficult to turn with the other stuff I've got in the compost box. I thought about cutting them down, but given the effectiveness of the heat and sun (and the Ringer), I'm not willing to touch it with my hands (gloved or not).I know I've got a ways to go before the compost pile will be ready to apply to the rose bushes or the fledgling garden, but I'm looking forward to doing an update then.
This stuff is easier to work with than earthworms, not too smelly, and a little goes a long way.  It's great for starting your compost pile, and now is the time to get some, to nourish your spring and summer garden.  As with any other similar product (such as fertilizer or plant booster) start with a little so as not to burn plants.
I've had a "passive" compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years, I'll start a new pile, and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening, I thought a more active, rapid compost would be nice, so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions, kept the pile moist, turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference, though honestly, I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster, but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter, then maybe it will work differently or better for you.
I purchased this exact model from my local "Wal-Mart" and actually paid more than I would have here, but I needed some clippers and fast.First off, they are not rigid at all..  What I mean is, as long as you are clipping a few blades of grass, you are ok, but really put it to use, and you soon find that it will lock blades and not function. This is due to the very poor construction.  Too much "slop" between the blades often make either both blades lock together or separate so much that nothing is cut.If you really want a good set of clippers that actually work, look further as this is a "novelty" item more than an actual functioning tool.
I bought these to take care of a mosquito larvae problem in my bog garden. They work well and the frogs are not bothered by them at all. I have a few rare green frogs in the bog here and the dunks don't harm them at all. This particular package, however, was very dry and it seemed like they just crumbled after hitting the water. It does not reduce their effectiveness at killing larvae, but it's not a very attractive result, especially if you have water lilies or water plants. You end up with a lot of bits of cork floating around and getting all over everything. Guess that's better than a bunch of mosquitoes, but...
Ok....I have not had to re-string my weed-eater yet, but two things with this item. I bought this because it was recommended by Amazon with the purchase and the cost was reasonable.The things you should know..............1) Realize you are purchasing a spool of trimmer line, not a package that you can just plug into your trimmer. When I get to where I have re-strung the trimmer I bought (the GreenWorks 21212 4 Amp 13&#34; Corded String Trimmer) I will update this.2) The string seems to be of a much heavier gauge than what shipped with the trimmer. Again, I will update when I re-string, but I am hoping the replacement string will work fine.Again, I don't know all the specifics, but  I wanted to alert people to the oddities I encountered in the purchased and visual examination.  It may work just fine and when I get to that point where I am actually using it, I will update the review and star rating.
I just bought four bags of these chips from Home Depot for $16 plus tax. I'm disappointed that while Amazon usually beats the price on most items, the price in this case is double what I pay at HD. These are nice chips and do a great job in my smoker. On the Weber main site, they list the price as $4.99 - so for Amazon to have a retail list price of $12.99 is simply incorrect. Buyer Beware!
These apple wood chips make smoke but I have found that I prefer hickory or mesquite wood chips rather than apple.
A decent quality product that appears to be more or less accurate however, I'm not thrilled with the fairly ambiguous rating system for the test results:  I conducted all four tests on a veggie garden soil sample.  The pH test was great - clear results.  The N, K and P test parameters are pretty loose, though.  Essentially, you can tell whether your soil is deficient but it's pretty difficult to discern the difference between the &#34;adequate&#34; reading and the reading indicating an overabundance of the given substance.  I posted a customer pic on the vendor's listing to illustrate results.  Who knows if they will post it.  I don't think I would re-purchase this item.
The mechanism of this flower pot is very interesting. The part that hooks over the ledge is removable. It has three awkwardly positioned screws on each side that allow the back hook to slide to accommodate multiple sizes of railing. The screws are a bit cumbersome to adjust. I would only recommend this flower pot holder if you are trying to hng on a non-standard size rail.
When I originally set this up on our front porch railing, I was very pleased with the ease of it.  I was able to do it rather quickly and without assistance.  I chose to put a flower pot that has trailing vines in it, that way the frame would be hidden a bit and it looked great.  If I were to rate this item on that alone, it would get 5 stars.  But then I was at our local hardware & garden center and saw similar pot holders for half the price.  I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.  So for this I do drop this item down to 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good item, but why pay more than you should? I definitely recommend shopping around if saving money is as important to you as it is to me.
So this flow pot is adjustable, can attach to deck railing, and will, in fact, hold a flow pot.  So as far as meeting expectations to the letter, sure, it worked out.  It's OK.But actually using it brings up some downsides.  The metal, while strong, when supporting a wide-based pot, seems like it's taxing its available strength to hold the bot up.  Also, depending on the pot, the side rails may be too high or, in my case, far to low to hold a tall pot in a way that looks and feel secure.  Nothing has broken or fallen out, but...I'm just waiting for it to happen.Overall, it's an OK adjustable pot holder, but it doesn't impress me very much and really isn't any better than average.
While I am happy that this flower pot holder seems sturdy enough to hold a fairly large pot, weighted down with soil and water, I'm not sure how long it will hold up in outside conditions.The basket comes with two removable 'L' brackets that can be positioned with the 'long' side up an horizontal to the ground for wider railings or short side up and horizontal to the ground for shorter railings. There are three bolts and nuts to hold it together.The problem started for me on the install. My prefab (plastic) railings are just a hair too wide to use the short side of the L bracket so if I use the long side of the bracket it sticks out into the basket area by inches. Which means that any flower pot put inside is then hindered by the brackets taking up some of the valuable area to place your pot. I also had trouble trying to tighten the nuts to keep it together since they are underneath the bracket arm. You have to tighten them and then put it back on the railing.There is a part that rests against your banister to keep the basket in a level position.It's nice but not great. Since everyone's railings are different, I guess designing a better one is a tough task. This one is recommended with some reservation.
First of all this does what it is supposed to and in that it is a fine product.However,Took me awhile to figure out how to get it to work (directions not so clear and not 100% self explanatory)The screws and slides allow for probably most desk rail widths.  But the tricky part is that there is a support on the pot which requires that it be braced against a post or a baluster/picket.  My deck railing has a very old style (and no longer code) style "X" between posts.  This left very little spacing options for where the pot could be placed.  From below it looks lovely but a direct look at it the two anchors to the railing don't looks so neat (tempted to place a pot on top of them to hide them).
ON the positive first, this planter is what it says- a hanger for potted plants so that one can mount on rails or other horizontal surfaces. The paint and fittings appear to be weather resistant- so I don't anticipate anything rusting out.  The wire frame is heavy enough to adequately support a pot, soil and plant.  The mounting system is designed well, I hung this on my deck rail and feel comfortable it will be good there.  It looks nice and the black color I choose doesn't conflict with anything.The negative is in the hardware.  I don't want to be too insulting, but it literally looks like someone at the factory said, "hey, we've got a bunch of these- use them!"The hardware consist of flat head slotted screws that come up through the bottom of the part of the frame that goes over the rail.  That seems like a good idea, except the bottom of the frame is an non-camferred slot- so the screws stick out.  The nuts on top are plastic acorn nuts that don't have a metal inside.  This makes them easy to cross thread, easy to over tighten and generally, difficult to deal with.  It seems to me that a combination of a carriage bolt (so you didn't have to hold the bottom, it would hold itself) and a better nut could have made this so much easier to deal with.So, maybe what I'm saying is that this is a perfectly acceptable hanger- but that its harder to deal with then it should be.
As an avid gardener with a deer problem, most of my plants are in hanging baskets and I was really hoping this flower pot holder would expand the possible places that I could use for more new plants.However with the rather limited ability to adjust the support of this flower pot holder, I quickly found that I would actually have to buy some lumber and add a wider board to either my fence or my house to accomidate the CobraCo holder.The package states to use the short end of the enclosed L shaped clasp for 2 to 4 inch railings,but actually it will not go below 2 and 2/4 inches, so the claim of wood top railings up to2 and 3/4 inches is actually incorrect, this flower pot holder will not fit on anything smaller than2 3/4 inches.Of course, now that I know that, I had to reconsider where to put it as my fence railingsare the standard 2 inch wide boards that are actually 1 1/2 in (38 mm) wide. Dimensional lumbersizes are calculated from the size of the green wood, which shrinks as it dries.Recommendation, mixed feelings here, if you have a deck with wide enough railings, this would work well, but for most fences it would not work.
On the product label it says this pot holder is "for decks, balconies and fences".  The planter has U shaped brackets that are designed to slip over a flat 2x4 or 4x4 or 2x6 railing, but this design doesn't work on a privacy fence.  My fence has no top mounted 2x4 so there is no place to hook the bracket.  I even tried screwing the brackets into the fence's 4x4 post, but the pot's brackets are 4 1/2" apart so that didn't work either.In the end I just hung the pot on the wooden support of glider/swing that I have on the patio.  Not exactly where I wanted the pot holder, but an okay place I guess.
I previously rated the Kness Tip Trap, so there is more info.there.  This trap looks good and should work, but it didn't catch any mice.  Setting the trap doors is a little tricky.
I've had success corralling the little buggers with the two-dollar Tip Trap and the pricier Smart Mouse House, but they catch only one mouse at a time, and I have yet to find a plastic trap that, after the 3rd or 4th use, the critter hasn't gnawed his way out of (my mice chew through plastic like it was cheese).  On the other hand, this Havahart device frankly befuddles me (maybe the mouse as well).  If I had a couple of hours to devote to it, I might be to figure out how to set the matrix of wires "just so" for both ends of the trap to spring shut (why 2 ends?).  I've got enough time to take the little creatures on Sunday drives into the country, but getting the hang of this gadget is beyond my skills and/or patience.  If you consider yourself a "pro" with a heart, maybe this'll pan out.  I'm returning mine and going with another fragile, plastic green "crack house."  (It works quite well for the first 2-3 weeks, before the mouse has ripped it to shreds.)
My fault, I should have ordered the next size up. The description was not that accurate.The openings for the generator handles leave much space for snow to pass through.
The cover is thin and not as durable as it looks in the photo or as described 'heavy duty'.  There are two holes for the handles if your generator has one.  Not totally comfortable putting the generator outside or even covered shed.  Better to leave it in closed shed.
I ordered this product to clean bird seed off my back porch. It works if held close to the seed but I don't recommend it. It takes a l o n g time to charge the battery and it does not hold the charge as long as I expected. It is too big for a "sweeper". I usually like B&D products but this one, not so much.
I picked up a factory refurbished one of these at a Black & Decker outlet store for less than half the regular Amazon price. I think it's worth having around at that price (three Hamiltons), but I would be really disappointed if I had paid full price for this blower. It's just not that powerful, and the battery life is pretty short. However, it does have its uses, so it has earned a place in my garage.This "sweeper" (light-powered blower) is a snap to assemble and is very easy to use. It has two speeds -- on and off. I used it this afternoon to blow off the garage floor and front porch. It handled leaves and dust just fine, but it wasn't useful against cobwebs, which is really what I had hoped to use it for. I guess they are too sticky to be removed effectively by this, so I had to break out the old broom. Oh well.If you can get a good deal on one of these, go for it... especially if you have other Black and Decker products that use the same 18V battery. I have aBlack & Decker GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger(model NST2118), and having an extra battery and charger around for that is handy. But if you weren't already in the B&D; system, and were looking to pay full price, I wouldn't do it.The Black & Decker NS118 is made in China.
This product used to include 2 batteries. But, B&D; has dropped it down to 1. The cost of each battery is around $30 to $35. I found the last one in my local Lowes store that still has 2 batteries. The blowing capability is low, but sufficient for hard surface. The blowing duration with a fresh charged battery is around 15 mins. It's convenient for quick job. I drop 1 point due to its limited power, I drop 1 more point because the included battery is dropped from 2 to 1.*************************************************************New updates....I bought it, tried it and returned it.After one month, I bought it again.....even it comes with 1 battery only.Yes, this cordless blower is weak to effectively blow leaves in the lawn, especially if the leaves are wet. But it indeed is quite capable in blowing leaves on hard surface (like the driveway).While I have no problem using other corded lawn tools, like mower, hedger trimmer, line trimmer, but I found it is very difficult to manuver my corded blower. Specifically, the cord itself is messing up the leaves while I am trying to pile up the leaves with the blower. So, cordless blower is the choice for blowing leaves around driveway, front entrance door. I still use the corded blower for leaves in the lawn due to its much stronger power.This cordless blower is very convenient and effective for light duty tasks like sweeping the driveway, front door area, backyard deck...This package comes with only 1 battery. That's sufficient for about 20 minutes blowing per each charge. So, plan your cleaning job to be done in 20 minutes, or to get a 2nd battery.
Will do the job of cleaning up after a day of cutting the lawn.Works best on smooth artificial surfaces like walkways, driveways, and garage floors. Will NOT help much with fall cleanup particularly on grass surfaces as it quickly loses power and is underpowered for this kind of work.
This blower works well on hard surfaces and holds a decent charge. I use it only for blowing out the garage and walkways; easier to use and not get fumigated with a gas blower for small jobs. I have 2 other hard surface blowers, but this one is so much better; easier to hold and maneuver and blows harder than the others.
Works very good for continuous trimming. Wish had gotten a longer trimmer, as the reach of a 12" trimmer is only 4". Actually shorter, due to the curve in the string, which actually reduces the reach to about 3".But, as long as I know its limitations, we get along OK.
It is sooo totally hot, sleek and shiny, I will pour oil over it and... oh, wait, sorry, that's another review I hope to do someday... this review is for a plastic heating mat to get your seeds asproutin earlier and, hey, there seems to be no other brand out there to buy. This sure does make it an easier purchasing decision.The mat is the right size for one of those seed sprouting kits, but beware that some of them are made of amazingly cheap plastic and leak. It is not a good idea to submerge this pad, although it seems to be sealed up and safe for the typical spills.It seems to work in getting the seeds to sprout, in April on the west coast. My only goal is to have tomato plants going earlier this year.Another reviewer mentioned putting an insulating pad underneath and that would make sense, especially on a concrete or metal surface.But, you ask, how can you give a simple device that actually works only three stars? I bought one of these a few years ago at a box store and it failed in only one season. I also think the price could be better. That is one demerit for every displeasure.Now, about that fun review...
I have a professional quality heat mat from a grow store, this was  a back up. Its smaller, does not quite fit a seedling tray, and is cooler than the pro mat. It is working, seedlings are up, but for more starts I bought another one from the grow store. so this is an ok buy, the pro ones are bigger for the same price.
Went together easily enough. The hanging string design is a bit wonky and is hard to really get level. I've found these size bulbs are difficult to find locally.It serves its purpose, but I think there are better options for the money.. though they do require a bit more DIY spirit.
These pruners are, of course, classic. Thousands of excellent reviews, storied history and millions of happy customers.I am not one of them.The F-2 can cut through all sorts of plants without difficulty thanks to the brilliantly sharp blades. These are excellent for ornamental gardening, but I find them unpleasantly dangerous and annoying for vegetable gardening.Cutting vegetable matter (raspberry canes, garlic stems, squash branches, etc.) quickly results in a gummy blade that does not open/close well. Obviously cleaning fixes that, but most people, including me, don't typically garden with a rag in hand. Further, cleaning the sharp blade becomes a dangerous proposition and has resulted in cuts as the blade slices through the rag to the skin.I spend my time working in the kitchen with sharp knives and in a wood shop with heavy machinery including many types of power saws - I've never had similar fear of lacerations in either location.This is also not a tool I feel safe allowing anywhere near my child. He's spent enough time in the garden that he knows how to use and treat properly pruners (with constant supervision.) I won't let him touch these.
I have been mixing a heaping tablespoon of diatomaceous earth (food grade) into my morning coffee every morning for one full month.  I cannot say I have noticed any physical changes for the better.  I have not experienced any of the following that so many other people say they have experienced while using this product:No improvement in skin conditionNo loss or lightening of pigmented spotsNo improvement in joint functionsNo regrowth of eyebrow hairNo increase in energyNo regularity in BMNo improvement in tooth enamelNo passing of internal parasitesNo improvement in hair and nail growthNo weight lossThere is nothing that I can honestly say is a positive improvement to my health after taking DE for a month.  I'm not saying it won't help you in these areas since so many others have seen great improvements in their health,  but either I am super healthy already (which is definitely not the case) or it simply isn't doing me any particular good.  Not everything works for everybody.  I am concerned about how radioactive it is and when I can remember to ask my husband to bring home the office geiger counter I will get him to test it for that and report back.  I have no idea exactly where they dug this DE up and it could be near leaking nuclear power plants or next door to radio active waste dumps for all I know.  I sure hope not though.UPDATE: 4.25.14This past week-end my husband tested the diatomaceous earth with a geiger counter and found no significant radiation beyond background radiation.  This is good news for those who consume a lot of it.
I have had 2 of these.  Lost the first one in a divorce.  Had it for many years.  Replaced heating element twice, possibly my fault for not cleaning it.  Body and grills never rusted.  Did an excellent job smoking tons of food.  Decided to order the new one.  Love that you can place the grill on the smoker barrel for height when grilling, no more grilling on the ground.  Also stoked about the added door for refilling water and adding chips.  Assembly was quick and easy.Was disappointed to see the dome is scratched in multiple places, and the water bowl had several dents in it.  One of the dents was so deep I am surprised it did not make a hole, but the paint is gone around the dents and continuing to flake.  Not bad enough damage to warrant packing it back up and sending it back, but still disappointed with the result.There was no apparent damage to the packing material, so assuming it looked that way when placed in the box.
Though the design of this unit is pretty good for the money, the cheap Chinese manufacturing makes it a waste of money.  Out of the box the powder coating paint was damaged both on the lid and the water basin.  Though this may having been from shipping, there was no evidence of any rough handling.Along similar lines, assembly of this unit is pretty tedious.  Lots of very small nuts and bolts that have to be applied.  The second evidence of cheap Chinese manufacturing was that one 1 of the three handles went on correctly.  The tolerances for the mounting holes in the handles were off, requiring me to have to force the bolts into them, and bend the handles to make them fit.I would recommend that you consider a more expensive gas or charcoal smoker.  If for no other reason, the electric version is not water resistant.  What do you do if you have it out on the deck or patio, smoking some meat and it starts raining?  You don't have many options.I contacted the manufacturer about it arriving with damage.  They suggested that I buy replacement parts from them.I recommend that you buy a traditional wood fired smoker.
These pads are useful where you must be on your knees a lot.  If you must clean up, work on the car, or other activities where you must kneel, then having one or more of these pads might be a good idea.
This pad could be larger and thicker. It seems a little overpriced for what you get. When they say ultra light, they aren't kidding. I also left this outside for a couple of days by mistake. It survived, but was the worse for wear.
This Snap-E Mousse Trap by Kness for $3.45 was set for a small yard rat (Woodrat I think) and it was sprung the next morning, but no rat.  I'll rebait and set again tonight or tomorrow and see what happens.  It sets easily and the Bait bowl is good for seeds or peanut butter.  Will hold up to rain and wet as it is plastic.  I will Modify my review if I feel it is required.  It's OK.
Hey everyone,I bought this looking for a cheaper alternative to my Jobe's organic fertilizer hoping this would save me money. Sadly, I have yet to see any results from this. I applied it to herbs, veggies, etc and had no change in the plants at all.I decided to do a side-by-side comparison between the two. I'm comparing this product toJobe's Organic Vegetable & Tomato Granular Fertilizer 4-Pound Bag. Here is what I got.I'm testing this product with squash, all the squash has been started from seed.With Earthworm Castings;Pro: Holds more water, so less watering.Pro: Better price.Con: Little to no growth. It's been a few weeks now.WithJobe's Organic Vegetable & Tomato Granular Fertilizer 4-Pound Bag;Pro: Fast growth.Pro: More leaves, and has blooms.Pro: Seen results within a few days.Con: Price.Con: Don't hold water like castings.My suggestion so far: Mix them both together.If anything happens to change with this I will update my review. But right now the castings appear to help very little.
The squirrels quickly learned how to open the lid. One morning, I awoke to see a large grey squirrel scrunched up INSIDE the hopper, chomping away at the seed! I chased him away, took the feeder down, and made an insert of heavy 1/2" hardware cloth. I opened the top and crammed the hardware cloth over the seed (I made it to come way up to the top but didn't fill the seed to the top, hoping to discourage the squirrels) and re-hung the feeder. That worked for 2-3 days, until the squirrels learned that once they opened the lid, they could push in the sides of my "wire cage" to get to the seeds. So there he was again, inside the hopper, wedged between my wire insert and the window. The squirrels later learned how to remove the insert! My idea didn't work. Secondly, this feeder is usually sold complete with the pole sections, the grounder and hardware for mounting, for the same price as this one. This is the feeder only.
I've had these loppers for about a year now. They have a wide jaw and can ratchet through some fairly big limbs. However, they tend to bind, to jam in the open position, and the handles flex too much and can pull right off the blades, although they are easily reinserted.I do not regret the purchase, but these loppers need to be somewhat higher gauge. They are delicate for the force that you can apply.
I'm generally satisfied with this purchase - I mean, the hummingbirds use it, so what's to complain about?  The actual materials and construction do feel a little chintzy, and after filling and flipping over for hanging, I always end up with a hand streaked with sugar water.  Acceptable, but nothing special.
This is a good Hummingbird feeder, but once you start feeding Hummingbirds, this is way tosmall.Once the  Hummingbirds started coming to the feeder, I had to refill this at least 3 times aday.I then bought the BIG large feeder, and had to fill it everyday.Please do NOT buy the colored hummingbird food. The Red Dye is Unhealthy-poison to the Hummingbirds.The red yellow feeder and sugar attracts the hummingbirds not the red dye.Your can mix your own hummingbird food using :1 cup white sugar, too , 2 Cups hot, or warm water to melt the sugar.Stir very good till all the sugar is melted.. It should be a bit thick.Do not give it to the birds till it cools down.Do not be discouraged if it takes a few weeks before the hummingbirds find your feeder.I could only give this a 3 star for the small size.
One was well packaged and the other not thus the plastic bird banches that stick out one was twisted off,  Both had different tops.  and unsure if they will even survive one season,  Was very disappointed in these,  They look nice but are very cheap
At this time in 2008 our yards were a haven for over 12 hummers so it off to the Amazon hummer store.  We bought 2 new ones including the Pet 221.  My first reaction was this will be just perfect for them because they can sit while eating and even thought the construction is somewhat shoddy it would work well for the birds.  The little area to collect ants is well placed.So now comes spring and hummers we were excited to watch them and their new eating holes.  We made no changes to the formula or any other item except the feeder itself.  No hummers.  Well, almost no hummers.  A ruby red buzzed us several times at each location but would not feed.  One day while putting one of last years feeders one actually sat on the feeder while I was emptying it into the plants.  He fed and told me he did not like the new ones.  Well, not really.  But why would one hummer feed from the old and not from the new.  Right now it is time to retire the new feeders and revert to the old.  It is possible that the new has an odor in the plastic that the hummers do not like.  I do not know.  For now this has been a waste of money.
Update 5/15/14:I do like the look of this feeder, but after using it for a while, there are issues.  The biggest issue is that rain gets inside the feeder from the top (where the cardinal is).  The food ends up wet, clumps, and molds.  I've started putting in a very small amount of food and tilting/shaking the food forward toward the opening.  Also, the locking mechanism (turn cardinal to lock lid) has become very difficult.  It is hard to get it to catch properly so the lid remains lose.  Maybe if you live in a very dry climate you wouldn't have a problem - but with Florida's afternoon rains, this is not the best choice.Original review:I was pleasantly surprised by this bird feeder!  First, it is very nice looking and larger than I expected.  The "weather vane" turns to unlock the roof.  Lift off the roof, add bird seed, then reattach lid.  Easy!!!  The weight triggered perch closes off the food if squirrels or large birds get on the perch.  There are 4 positions to vary how easily the perch lowers and closes the food supply.  Nice looking, easy to use - I'm definitely happy with this feeder.
The Squirrel Be Gone birdfeeder is undeniably attractive.  Painted fire engine red, it is shaped like a barn, with a tray that is meant to just bear the weight of birds, nothing heavier while they access the feed from small openings, with a metal handle that fits in the side holes for hanging and a little weathervane piece on top, which by twisting you can open the removable roof part and fill the feeder with seed.Mine, however, was shipped without any kind of instructions in the box, although I was careful to make sure I didn't throw anything resembling them away by accident.  I received it in several pieces: four bolt parts, the barn part, a red base-looking part (which I assumed was meant to provide some kind of "anchor"), plus the handle which attached to the sides.  Feeling vaguely like a preschooler with a Fisher Price toy, I untwisted the weathervane handle and tried to bolt the big red base piece onto the bottom with the screws using the appropriate screwdriver. They kept falling out, regardless of how much I tried to tighten them, although the smaller "anchor" part stayed on without bolts.  The next step was to figure out where the bolts did go.  Unfortunately, repeated examination of the holes did not yield the answer.  Two holes on either side were meant to attach the silver handle, which I did without trouble. So far, I can put the feeder out on a flat surface or table, so the birds can enjoy the feed, but I doubt that that's going to keep out the squirrels.Overall, the feeder does look like it would be successful to foil most squirrels, but I can't really grade it on that. So I'll give it three stars, and hope that other reviewers are much more helpful.  I don't know whether it was the lack of instructions, some glitch in the specific feeder I got, or my own incompetence that's responsible for this experience, so I'll just wish anyone who does purchase the feeder luck.
I wanted to replace an old bird feeder that was similar in style to the Perky-Pet Country Style Squirrel-Be-Gone.  Because both are weight activated, I falsely assumed the spring-action mechanism and construction of the Perky Pet would also be similar, but I was sadly mistaken.We discovered upon arrival that there are no directions.  In our case, inserting the metal handle into the feeder wasn't much of a challenge (our older model hooks in the same way).  Those who have never owned this type feeder might be scratching their heads wondering how everything connects.  Perky-Pet could easily avert assembly frustration by including a few instructions.Our older model is constructed of heavy gauge metal.  The hinged roof opens up entirely for easy seed re-filling and shuts back up tightly.  The Perky-Pet is made out of lighter metal with lots of sharp edges.  The weathervane cut-out, although cute, is a badly designed seed-filling port.  It just doesn't open up or shut very well, and seed filling is cumbersome.  Crafty squirrels use the weathervane as a good grasping point and toe-hold.  They easily outwit the feeder and help themselves to seed (see customer image).  I figure it's only a matter of time before they learn how to open up the weathervane port too.  Only a portion of the roof comes off, and it leaves a gap between the stationary roof and cut-out weathervane.  I have had this feeder only during snowy winter months, but I wonder about water seepage into the seed chamber when spring rains finally arrive.The weight activated perch bar is controlled by an adjustable spring, something akin to paper clip strength.  No matter which setting I use, it mysteriously moves to a different setting.  Living in a woodsy area, I don't know which animal to blame for that, but our old feeder had much sturdier spring settings that stayed in place.  We never encountered this problem.To its merit, the Perky-Pet does feed birds and if the spring stays in place, it also keeps out bigger pesky birds.  Maybe in your neck of the woods it will even keep out squirrels, but as my picture attests, it sure doesn't around here.UPDATE:  Just as suspected, the squirrels finally figured out how to open up the weathervane (customer photo). Now they make a daily raid.  Not many birds even use this feeder so I'm taking it down for good.  Perky-Pet should omit "Be Gone" from this feeder's name and simply call it "Squirrel Country House."
It's cute, no doubt about that. The photo shown here is not exactly what the product looks like though. The "weather vane" serves as a handle for removing part of the roof in order to fill it.  The weather vane has to be turned about a quarter turn or less to "unlock" it, allowing you to lift part of the roof away.It's biggest flaw is the sharp metal on the roof.  The photo doesn't show how they cut out a square area of the roof that you lift to fill the feeder. The edges of this square metal piece that lifts off are rather sharp. They tried to dull the edges some, but the metal is relatively thin, which makes it relatively easy to cut yourself. Very poor design, and unfortunate. The outer edges of the roof itself are the same way.Durable metal, but the roof should have had more safety built in, such as rolled edges. Also, it's not as easy to clean as the "tube" type birdfeeders.
I do understand electronics and how these things work. For my curiosity I purchased one of these and opened it to verify the design. From my observations I found that it is a very basic 'Linear' charge controller design to prevent Lead Acid batteries from getting overcharged & severely undercharged. Nothing more nothing less.It does work as advertised and your costly lead acid batteries do not get 'boiled' from prolonged charging in strong sunlight as the circuit merely shuts off power flowing to the battery once it reaches the cut off preset of +14.2 vDC. It then waits there illuminating the 'Green LED' till the battery voltage drops to below 13v and the cycle repeats. It does not have enough brains to 'trickle' charge at a 'float' charge level after the initial bulk absorption phase has completed. Therefore lead acid batteries that have SOC more than 80% Especially the ones that do not have any phantom loads and do not get used that often may not get fully charged with this basic design. In reality you are actually losing ton of Solar Power going nowhere using this basic ON/OFF switch sort of design.It however does have beefier QTY 3 Blocking diodes in ''parallel'' on the + VE bus line to have lower forward resistance? when the charge controller delivers power to the battery. This seems like a good idea for delivering whatever the solar panel has to offer to the connected battery minimizing loss, But as they are not thermally coupled I do have some concerns about thermal rundowns on one of the diodes in extreme situations. That explains why certain people have had their controllers blow up for no reason. - Makes sense?On the plus side, When these work, These Blocking diodes prevents any current from flowing back into the solar panel at night and does not drain the battery when left alone unused. This also prevents any damage from back-feeding voltages getting into the solar panel itself thereby protecting it from accidental abuse of reverse polarity. This also explains why the charge controller works only when there is Sunlight falling on the panel as it uses 'Solar' input voltage to illuminate the LEDs. You cannot view the state of charge (SOC) of your 12v Battery even if it is fully charged - until a partial sun shines on the solar panel! to activate the circuit.Bottom-line: For the price you pay you do get a 'basic' charge controller that may suffice certain installations that are rated to use 100w or less Solar panel capacity & for batteries with need for low amps for charging but for real utilization of your precious Solar energy and storing them into your Lead acid batteries you need to invest little bit more and get a 3 stage Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) Solar charge controllers.Three stars! from me. Thanks for reading my review!
This Fly Web Fly Trap is actually much larger than expected and did work somewhat to help control my fruit fly infestation. We tried three products side by out of desperation and here are the results after 48 hours:Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap; used as directed, caught 2 fruit fliesFly Web Fly Trap; large plug in light based trap with sticky pads, caught 11 fruit fliesFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack; the old standby, not attractive but effective, caught at least 32 (perhaps more)The Fly Web product performed right in the middle of the other two products we tried, but no telling how many it would have caught if it was the only product we used at that time. It also only comes with one sticky pad (which turned out not be an issue since the card was far from full), but refills are availableFly Web Glue Board 10 Pack.We are sticking (mild pun intended) with the Fly Paper Strips going forward.CFH
We live in the country with horses on our property and cows on our neighbors. We have large fly traps (Stinger 80 Watt - 1.5 Acre traps) setup away from the house to attract and kill flying pests. I bought one of these to deal with the pests that inevitably make it inside the house.We are house training a puppy, this involves long periods of time when doors are left open, and hence a lot of flies getting in the house.When I set up this unit I counted 12 flies in the kitchen. Sadly, half of these remained the following day. It did catch some flies, but doesn't seem to attract them as one might hope. I tried placing the unit in various places, and ensured the only light on at night was the one from the trap.It will catch some flies, but it is not going to catch them all. I'm sat watching a fly just 6 feet away from the light who is happily wandering around the counter top with little interest in the light at all, even though the light it the brightest thing in the kitchen right now.Another point to consider when choosing this unit over an electric one:The sticky pad surface is illuminated by the light, meaning all the catch is displayed like a gruesome killing field; in comparison to electric killers that typically have the insects fall in to the bottom of the unit. The electric method comes at the expense of that annoying arcing sound as the insects get zapped, this unit is silent.
this is well built and serves it's purpose functionally.my complaint is that the hole inside the shutoff valve/bearing is considerably smaller than the width of the hose connection.  when putting this on, you are basically blocking off around half of the capacity of whatever is after it in the chain.i use it at the end of my hose, right before my gilmour quick connects, so that when i change out my sprinklers and nozzles, i don't have to walk across the yard to turn off the hose so that i don't get sprayed (so lazy).  it works fine, and i haven't seen any real loss of range with the water, but i think the change would be noticeable if i put another hose after this connector.
To start with I do a lot of gardening. I have over 15 species of fruit tree in my yard, a 1000 sq ft garden, and also have a wide diversity of flowering plants in my yard to promote species diversity, attract beneficial insects, and, of course, for ascetic appeal.I use this humidity dome for both cuttings and seed starting. To cut to the chase the product does indeed work as intended with some caveats.Lets start with the heat mat. The heat mat itself works as intended. It keeps an even and warm temperature, but the diagram says to place it under the hot house, so the perfectly heated mat sits below not one, but two pieces of plastic with air in between them. Plastic is not a good conductor of heat, so the mat becomes far less effective if used as indicated. For myself I have a fluorescent tube light hanging a food above the humidity dome, so the heat inside stays a nice 85 degrees Farenheit.The dome itself has 3 vents. 1 at the top, and one on each side. Even with a number of adjustments airflow is stagnant. I open the dome and let a fan sit on it for a few seconds in the morning and evening to prevent stagnant air accumulation.Also it comes with a very, very small sample of Clonex, which is inconveniently placed in a package that makes dipping cuttings quite difficult. I get the product placement thing, but they didn't plan that one out too well.I'd rather pay less and skip the Clonex. I do however own and use Clonex religiously as I have found it to be the most effective rotting gel around. I just don't want a messy and small sample pack of it.I decided on 3 stars because all my cuttings and seedlings have done quite well, however, they also needed regular attention. An ideal humidity dome would require far less attention. on top of that the instructions tell you to place the heat mat in a spot that reduces its effectiveness.
I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better.
This does not come with the pellets. It also does not say that it does. Maybe the description has been edited after someone complained, but it clearly says that its a "72-insert tray" NOT that the inserts are included. Here are some tips.If you don't want to spend the money for more jiffy pellets at least get a good seed starting soil or add a B-vitamin fertilizer to a traditional potting/garden soil to assist in healthy root development. If you use a traditional soil with fertilizers be sure to add a diluted plant fertilizer when sprouts appear. Seedlings burn easy, you do not want to over-fertilize them. This will make transplanting difficult!!Mold can grow very quickly, which is why commercial hydrofarmers use fungicides. Root rot is one of the most common killers of hydro grown plants. You can purchase a good fungicide for around $8. If you get a concentrated version be sure to follow the dilution directions exactly. More is NOT better.You should also be aware of your water quality if you are using tap. Some municipal supplies are highly chlorinated and/or not pH balanced. This can result in sprouts that appear then quickly burn, yellow and die. If you want fantastic results get a pH/Chlorine kit ($20, or you could even get aquarium test strips to make it easier/cheaper) and check your water before beginning any sort of hydrofarm. Additives can be purchased to alter the pH, if your water is highly chlorinated, use filtered with a hydro-fertilizer.Some of the heat mats are not calibrated correctly, its a factory issue. Be sure to place the heat mat on a solid topped table, not glass, and to be extra careful (if you're worried) place a towel over the heat mat to help diffuse the heat (this will not negatively impact the effect the heat has on the seedlings). The heat mat is not even required, you could toss it as long as your hydrofarm is indoors and gets sufficient sunlight throughout the day to maintain warmth. They do not mention all of these things because if they make it sound complicated they don't sell as much product. In fact it is all VERY simple. There are just a few extra steps one should take if they are serious about obtaining great results. My personal opinion, steer clear of Miracle-Gro, use Schultz NPK 10-15-10 ($ the one with the eyedropper, very cheap) or Fox Farm ($$$ if you want to spend money). My grandparents were orchard farmers, I've seen these cheap plastic cloning trays work very well for many years with the proper pellet inserts and fertilizers.
This Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer is handy for automatic watering of trees and shrubs. It operates on two 9-volt batteries. It consists of a motor-operated valve and a timer.  The user attaches the female coupling of the valve to a hose bib and the male coupling to a garden hose or drip irrigation pipe.  The timer can be removed from the assembly for easy programming.  There are four watering cycles per day; it can be programmed to run seven days or any day(s) of the week, or every 2nd day or 3rd day. The timer can also be turned on manually.  However, each cycle or manual operation lasts only up to 6 hours.  I found it inadequate because I use the timer for drip irrigation, which by its nature can last a lot more than 6 hours.  Other than the short duration, this Orbit timer runs well.
Good news is it has held up for a couple of years, bad news is I had a hell of  time programming it, and it was very expensive.  It's not an easy unit to set up, but it does work if you figure it out.  I won't buy another (there are others on the market that work as well that are cheaper and easier--more like a digital watch--to program).
Mine lasted for two seasons ,it worked well while it worked,,,,,I have used 4or 5 different timers and none of them last more than 2 seasons,,,My next purchase is the Orbit 91213....looks nice,,we will see.
This unit is easy to program and was the closest hose timer that resembled  controllers on irrigation systems.  You can set days to water, set the start times and duration of 4 individual watering times a day, manually override, delay 24hrs for days it rains... perfect.  However, this unit will not be adequate if you have long runs where every little bit of water pressure counts.  When open to water, it is restrictive and you will lose some water pressure.  A shame really.
This 5.5-inch plastic and metal dome-shaped device when placed in a birdbath, armed with two D size batteries, wiggles the water creating silent concentric ripples from end to end. So why would anyone spend twenty or more dollars for a contraption that looks like a breast on stilts and just sits in the backyard birdbath? A fondness for concentricity? A touch of avian eccentricity? A passion for safe electricity? A love of simplicity? Read on.Rationale for the Water Wiggler from Allied Precision IndustriesStill water in a container eventually becomes stagnant, the sides and bottom of the water's receptacle becoming green and slimy with what we technically call gunk. The still water is also an attractive destination for mosquitoes, a safe place for these critters to lay their eggs ensuring the continuation of the vile species. A spinner on the bottom of the Water Wiggler agitates the water (but not the parched birds), creating continuous, gentle ripples in the birdbath's water and discouraging, maybe even preventing, mosquitoes from laying their eggs in birdbaths. The moving water is said to attract birds and more importantly "helps prevent the spread of west Nile virus by eliminating still water in birdbaths.Product Features:Easy to install. (Unless you are very, very short, Shleppies!) Just set it in the water. No Wires! No plumbing! No cumbersome extension cords!Operates on just two D-cell batteries for a full season of continuous use. (Unless you live in a state with one yearlong season.)Operates 24 hours a day. (Great for those night owls)Silent. And very quiet too.Full one year warrantyMay use in the winter to agitate the water and attract more birds. (Probably won't discourage too many mosquitoes in the winter)In the Backyard Birdbath on Spud AcresWe used the water wiggler in one of our three birdbaths for two seasons, and despite my initial skepticism, seemed to fulfill most of its promise. The birdbath with the wiggler was by far the most popular, attracting many birds for baths, drinks or a ringside perch. A birdbath housing a Water Wiggler still has to be cleaned, just a little less often. I know I felt so much more comfortable knowing I wasn't contending with despicable mosquitoes or putting myself at risk of contracting a mosquito-borne disease. What does one do with a perpetually wiggling device while cleaning the birdbath? Sometimes I held it in one hand and cleaned with the other. At other times I enlisted a helper to hold the wiggler while I cleaned and refreshed the water. And there were also those times when I just laid the little round wiggler on its back.Several times a season I found the wiggler on the ground, spinning away, just wiggling in the breeze. I can only guess what manner of varmint villain caused the displacement of our innocent wiggler. Raccoon? Possum? Owl? Eagle? Or maybe one of those mischievous squirrels that live to antagonize. Except for the most recent occasion, it was just a simple matter of rinsing off and replacing the little wiggler. Several weeks ago, however, the entire heavy, cast concrete birdbath was totally toppled, the water wiggle lying in pieces on the ground. I tried to reinsert the spinner but it was too misshapen. Its one year warranty hadn't expired, but in our anguish neither Mrs. Spudman nor myself thought of contacting Allied Precision Industries for a replacement. The damaged wiggler now rests somewhere in the county landfill. Since the fallen birdbath is so heavy I can only guess that the culprit this time was a large raccoon, a deer, or one of the wild potatoes that lurk in the deep woods.VerdictI'm not sure if I'd buy another Water Wiggle since I'm not the one who bought the departed one in the first place. One must really love birds and backyard birding to spend such a hefty amount for this birdbath accessory. The West Nile Virus angle seems a bit far-fetched to me. I suppose in a small way one water wiggler in our backyard birdbath can reduce the potential spread of west Nile by an infinitesimal amount. Not providing any birdbaths at all would be just as effective, if not more so. All the birdbaths in the world combined are just a small percentage of the available breeding pools for mosquitoes.The wiggler's batteries are long lasting, and the rippling rings do seem to attract birds. The presence of constantly agitated water does seem to diminish the amount of yuck (technical term) growing on the birdbath's surface. But I'm still on the fence with this one, wiggling and waggling with my opinion. If you think the stated benefits are worth the price, then get yourself a Water Wiggler. Comments about the Water Wiggler on other consumer sites are mostly positive.
Fiskars is a respected brand and I'd buy from them again, just not this particular pruner. The sliding lock mechanism is easy to operate and the pruners have a good spring to them.When I first got this pruner, it worked great. The cuts were clean and straight. After about three weekends of pruning (mostly rose bushes), the blades started dulling and no longer cut cleanly every time. Softer plant parts like dahlias flower stalks get squished and caught between the blades, causing them to stick together and not spring back open. This can leave a messy cut with jagged ends of plant tissue and cambium exposed, especially with stems that have soft, fibrous outer layers of bark, like green rose branches. For woodier cuts like camellia, it is still fine.Sometimes holding the pruners upside-down from the orientation pictured in the product photo helps deliver a clean cut. So, I rate this pair of pruners only average, because it has the same problem as my previous pruner with squishing stems.
These were not as sharp as I had hoped.  They are better for indoor pruning or light outdoor pruning.
A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight, but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great, but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work, but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers.
I live on a corner lot and my yard is covered in trees.  This has difficulty with large leaves such a avocodo. I has also truble with macadamia nut leaves.  Small stuff it does great.  I have to rake first and then use this.
After putting this together I found it to be quite unnerving. It reminds me of a javelin. Sure it's long, but it wobbles! Do I really feel comfortable holding a wobbling chainsaw over my head? No. It cuts at the high height level but it is very unsteady and takes a bit of muscle to keep it straight on the branch. The problem is the saw blade head is just too heavy compared with the shaft and bottom.  It basically sways in the air.  I will not be using the extension rather I will just stand on a ladder to reach the higher branches. There really should be a steel pole in each piece to give it some stability. One more thing is that the blade cover doesn't stay on. It should have been designed with a clip of some sort.I'm one of those people who always throws away the product box, but I think I'll be saving this one in case it breaks.Comment Comment  Permalink
This is my fourth Black and Decker cordless product and I have rated it the lowest of the four.  It should come with two batteries.  Because it is a chain saw, it is very sensitive to the amount of juice in the battery.  If you have a low battery, it will grab the limb being sawed.  This is potential dangerous and/or could cause you to get the saw hung up in a limb 10 feet above your head.  Make sure you have a fully charged battery before starting a job.  A second battery would be very helpful to ensure you can get though any job.  The saw is fairly heavy at the head but the battery end does provide balance.  I bought this saw because a couple of my palm trees are too tall for me to cut from the ground.  I must get on a ladder to reach them.  The last time I did this, the sawing motion of my manual pole saw caused me to fall off the ladder.  Once I got up, I decided I was going to get a powered pole saw.  Since I had the other B&D tools, this was the one to get.  Please note, Black and Decker specifically warns against using this tool on a ladder and my review is not suggesting that you do this.  It works very well on palm fronds and seed pods.  I tried it on a crape myrtle tree, but found the saw bounced on the small limbs and did not give a clean cut.  Other reviewers have noted this as well.  I also found the pole saw too heavy for the large number of limbs which needed triming the crape myrtle trees.  You can adjust the length of the pole by removing the center section.  The saw handles better if you don't have the center section in, but if you need it, use it.  This is a good tool, if you understand the battery must be fully charged, you can handle the weight, and the limbs to be cut are thick enough to support the weight of the saw while it is biting into them. Amazon had this product to my house with in a week of ordering it.
The end you see in the picture with the handy plastic thumbscrew attached is actually a few threads shorter than a standard hose. I have a rain barrel that I wanted to use this with but it will not get a bite on the plastic faucet. My standard 50' garden hose attaches okay, as well as a quick disconnect adapter that I was using, but not this hose. Other than that is is a good quality hose and I will still use it to get water from my barrels to the gardens, just not as I originally intended.
This is a very sturdy and well made tool.  I think, though, that my soil isn't all that suitable for it's use.  I still end up getting a regular shovel, because I'm not crazy about stooping.
I use these gloves every time a bbq, so that means i use them at least once a week!  the gloves work great for taking hot meats out of the smoker.  Havent had any issues with these gloves EXCEPT for cleaning them, the exterior part is fine, but as soon as moisture gets on the inside of the gloves, it starts to kinda smell.  So make sure when you clean them that you dont get water in there.EDIT : less then a week after i reviewed these gloves, one of the fingers somehow got a rip in it and when i reached into a 200 degree pork shoulder without realizing of the rip... that was fun.  The other glove is still fine.. but now i need to order a new pair  :/  Lasted 6 months
I wanted to use these gloves when handling hot food and still have the use of my fingers, as when cutting a hot chicken. My problem is that they get very slippery making it difficult to hold food and try and cut or pare it. A bit of chicken grease on these gloves will make a chicken hard to cut, certainly with a paring knife. Grabbing a leg or thigh off a well-cooked chicken and trying to pull it off the body is hard because the gloves are so slippery.On the other hand, they certainly work for picking up food off the BBQ, like a chicken, pork butt or brisket, and they're long enough that you won't burn your wrists over the fire.They aren't very tactile, so I'm not sure there's an advantage to having fingers rather than a traditional mitt design. This is thick rubber, so you don't really get any feedback as you would with a thinner glove, and because the glove is very loose fitting, I found  it a bit hard to use if you're handling food.Clean-up is the same as washing your hands, which I think is a good thing. Simply put some hand soap on them, and &#34;wash your hands&#34; and the gloves are clean and ready for the next use.In summary, I like 'em, but after using them a couple times, wouldn't buy them again.
As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package, but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good, but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects, so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board, so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap.
The inflator is made well.  My only issue is the gauge which is hard to read.  The numbers should be larger.Update 11-2009  This will not work with needles for inflating a basketball.  I have no idea why.
Man, are garden hose attachment departments at the box stores dismal, filled with plastic Chinese junk. Not a quality fitting to be found. Luckily, Amazon has a wider choice and this Gilmour coupling is of high quality.The threaded part is nicely machined and the clamp is a heavy zing alloy. In fact, once on the hose you will notice that heaviness. Should last a long time and when that hose is finally replaced, years later someone will find this fitting in a shed, or buried in some weeds, and use it again, good as new. I know this because I found a couple of brass hose nozzles buried in the yard, fixed them up and they are as good as new, probably over 50 years old, maybe more.Hecho en China....as with lots of brass stuff now. Brass has lead in it, laws here are strict about lead pollution, likely not so much in China. As long as pollution is ok to export, this is what will happen.The Gilmour coupling seems to be the same as the Nelson one, but is quite a bit cheaper. You get quite a bit of heftiness and weight for your money but really, how much should even the best hose fitting cost? Two stars lost for that.

Very poorly made, the squirrels ripped this feeded apart several times until I just gave up. The squirells chew apart the plastic and have even tore the bottom out to get the seed.
I have had this feeder for about 5 years now, it has never fallen apart. I don't know what the other people are talking about-wobbling-if its hung on a tree or pole hook it swings a bit but how does a hanging bird feeder wobble? Anyway its not the best made on the market, but the birds seem to like it. It is a pain to take apart to clean and it should really have metal perches instead of plastic. The squirrels have gnawed off two of the perches since they hang upside down and eat the Safflower seeds (even tho they are not supposed to like it)I am ready to replace it now-but will be looking for a feeder with the metal perches instead.
We've been using earlier versions of Deer Off with regular success in protecting lilies and hostas from deer for some time. The Deer Off III version contains the same basic repellent ingredients (putrescent egg products and pepper extracts) as its predecessors, and provides similar protection.You'll want to avoid contact with the liquid in this container. While it won't make you gag, rotten eggs are a principal ingredient, and it certainly isn't a scent you'll relish contact with.Now, about the battery-powered sprayer. In short, it's rather silly. Mine did not work with batteries it shipped with. The motor ran, but didn't deliver any fluid to the approximately three feet of tubing that extends from the container. The enclosed instructions suggested replacing the OEM batteries with new ones. This solved the problem, and I was soon spraying with battery-powered delight. Which leads to the question: is this necessary? I think not. Havahart has conventional trigger-sprayer version of this product in 16, 32 and 128 ounce sizes: consider one of these instead and stop worrying about the batteries.The included instructions for the battery sprayer deserve a prize for one of the most obvious safety tips ever presented: "Never place the nozzle in your mouth".  Always good advice when the nozzle is connected to a container full of liquified rotten eggs!
Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer is a product that should probably be used in conjunction with other methods to ward off deer.I had mixed results after a couple weeks of testing on petunias, ornamental grasses and around my vegetable garden.  The smell is not horrible and once it's dry you can barely smell it. Be sure and spray away from clothing as the scent tends to stick to cloth, especially in humid weather.After applying this to my various above mentioned plants, I had some areas where the deer stayed completely away and other areas where they ignored the Deer Off and just ate whatever they wanted anyway. This could be because we're in a drought and I'm watering these areas keeping things healthy and perhaps the deer see moist, succulent greens WITH deer off as a better option than the dryer, less moist things they're naturally feeding on otherwise. But, given that they've stayed away from about half of my plants, I'd say that in a good year this repellent may work fairly well.The battery-powered sprayer is a nice novelty, but I would be fine with a hand sprayer as well. Either/or.  Three stars.
We were anxious to try this product because we have been having a huge problem with animals in our garden. The directions were easy to follow and the spray nozzle was very easy to use. However, the results were mixed. The rabbits and squirrels seemed to stay away, but the Deer Off had absolutely no effect on the deer that were eating our veggies. We used the product as suggested, but still the deer were getting a feast. I would not use this one again.
Results were mediocre.  It definitely did not work on squirrels!! I thought the battery operated spray unit would be a positive but it was not.  The sprayer broke after minimal useage.  I won't buy this product but will look for something more effective and a sturdier applicator.  Save your money!
I have been waiting until Fall to try this product, because the biggest problem I have with deer and rabbits is eating my strawberry plants after they are done producing for the year.  So I have sprayed the leaves with Deer Off a few days ago and removed the bird netting I keep over the plants.  The liquid is pretty thick and does not easily come out of the sprayer.  It took about 20 seconds or so to prime it, and then the liquid came out in spurts and large droplets.  The instructions say that there's a 'mist nozzle' that you can attach for a finer mist, but I didn't find it anywhere.The spray smells somewhat like eggs, but is not really that strong to me.  It rained a couple times since I sprayed, and the dried liquid appears to still be present on some of the leaves.  So far, none of the leaves have been chewed, which is a good sign.  I'll keep checking over the next couple weeks and if they are still there by then, I would reapply and call it a success.But, one thing you might consider.  Not all animals will avoid the repellant - it really depends on both the animal population and other food sources in your area.  If you live in a place where there is abundant food besides your garden, then this repellant will probably work for you.  Also, if animal populations are low, this will also likely work.  However, if you live in a high-traffic area for garden pests, or there is little other natural foods for them, or animal populations are high (thus making competition for food high), then this repellant is likely to not work.The best solution really is a physical barrier for the plants you want to preserve.  I use plastic 'deer fence' around my raised bed garden, and as I said above, I use the thin, nylon bird netting over the top of my strawberry bed.  This has worked extremely well, and I don't have to continually apply a repellant and hope that it will work (remember, it only has to not work one time for you to lose your plants!).  So I think this repellant would be best for plants that you really can't physically protect (like the tulips at my Mom's grave come to mind, or any other place where you cannot provide a physical barrier).  In these cases, apply liberally and often - say, once a week or so - for best effect.  Or the alternative is to use plants that they won't eat, like marigolds, daffodils, lavender, foxglove, phlox, iris, hyacinth, verbena, bleeding heart, and many others.  Rutgers has an excellent page listing 100s of landscape plants by deer resistance: (...)UPDATE 11/14/12:  Just an update to let you know that nothing has eaten my exposed strawberry leaves since I removed the netting and sprayed on the Deer-Off.  Maybe it really does work?  ... or I just got lucky this year and nothing has come by to eat them, but that's unlikely.
Guess I don't understand the difference between all the various varmints and how they could be immune to something that smells and tastes nasty to some animals and not others...Seems to be working to some degree but at the high price I have to wonder if it's worth it..  Rated this as 'It's okay' but if price was lower (it's only 64 oz) I might have a BIT higher opinion of it. Don't mind higher prices if a product does the job you need it to do.  That is, IF it does indeed prove useful over time....DC powered sprayer is great and is only way to go when you have old stiff fingers like I do, saves much pain and frustration...  I didn't prime mine with the battery power however, I tipped the bottle on it's side and put some pressure on the bottle to force liquid through the tube first... then it didn't take but a few seconds to get it out the spray head with power on.I also put the clear plastic sleeve back on that it was shipped with to hold the "holster" on the side of the bottle better...  otherwise it just hangs loose and is a bother when you carry it around.  You could also just wrap the middle with packaging tape etc.
My package arrived intact and was easy to assemble:  insert hose into the container, screw cap back on, and unlock the sprayer.  When done properly no liquid and its smell gets on your hands.  This is good for those who don't want to deal with any overspill, smell or residue.It took a while for the liquid to come through the nozzle but it did spray out evenly over the surface I was using this on:  a sun-drenched dirt area of my garden popular with cats in my hood.The spray does seem to keep the cats away.  I haven't seen new poop in a while.Two complaints, though.  This stuff is expensive and it doesn't last as long as advertised.  The battery-powered sprayer seems more like a gimmick to me.  I'd prefer hand-pump action instead.I live in the high desert where dry, warm weather persists long into the year.  We don't get deer down here (they stay higher in the foothills) but we do get our share of stray dogs and cats roaming through at night.  This stuff keeps the cats away, but so do other Havahart products that sell for much less.
In my neck of the woods (rural New Jersey) we are infested with Deer. Yes, they are beautiful animals but enough is enough. (I am sure they think the same thing about humans!) They will eat most anything and almost nothing deters them for long. We have tried every spray on the market, made our own concoctions, used those little zapping sticks and finally just fenced in the back yard and moved most of our plantings to that area.* We still have a few plants in the front that  the deer ravish, including a little Japanese maple they completely strip and eat the bark too. So, my hopes for this repellent weren't too high and the spray lived up to those relatively low expectations.The spray bottle itself is fine. I did have some issues getting the battery powered sprayer to work, the hubby stepped in, tightened the lid, kept constant pressure on the pump, was able to get it primed and we did get it to spray eventually. I personally don't mind pump spraying, so the battery powered feature wasn't a strong selling point for me. The spray is similar in ingredients, odor and effectiveness to most everything we have tried. It works as long as you apply it faithfully after each rain. 90 days? No way. I deliberately applied the spray, left the trees alone for 2 weeks (we have had a few good showers) and now have shredded trees and plantings.So, if you are willing to spend the time and the money to apply this repellent on a regular basis, it will keep the deer away. If you are not, try something else . . . prayer and a shotgun perhaps?*Last year we had one deer who would literally jump the 5 foot fence and leap from one fenced back yard to the next eating the neighborhood's plantings. He is gone this year, I assume someone had enough and shot him - lol.
I had trouble getting this to spray. Some of the other reviews offer useful tips on this problem.The active ingredients are similar to certain related products: "Contains putrescent eggs solids (4.63%), garlic (.001%) and capsaicin (.001%)." My experience with these is that they work well for up to a couple of weeks, although they need to be reapplied after a rain, or even after heavy sprinkler use. A downside of this formula is that the smell of garlic will permeate the garden.
First of all, the battery that came with it didn't work, so I had to buy new ones.  The lock switch on the spray head is hard to lock and unlock. It took awhile for the liquids to start coming out after I held down the spray trigger. Probably like 5 minutes. Anyways, once it starts, it work ok. Doesn't have much pressure to spray far. Anyways, after spraying like quarter of the bottle on my trees, entire backyard smelled like burned wood. I haven't seen squirrels on those trees so far and it's been 2 weeks.
As the title of my review says, the electric sprayer is excellent. It took probably a minute of priming (pressing the trigger with nothing coming out of the sprayer) during my first use before the spray started to come out; since then, it sprays right away when I pull the trigger.The spray stream goes about six feet or so, and it's easy enough to aim it at trees or fence or whatever. You can adjust the tip of the sprayer in order to make the spray more of less focused (that is, more stream or more misty).I'll use this spray bottle even after the repellent is gone. It will be useful for weed sprays, insect repellents, etc.The repellent itself has only been moderately successful in our yard. Our issue is bunnies and they haven't seemed to be bothered by the repellent - their activity in our yard after a couple of applications of the repellent is basically the same as before the applications.
I am not quite ready to make a large declaration of "Eureka" for this product. The reason is because we wanted to use this to see if it would help keep the rabbit and squirrel out of the garden and it isn't yet time for the big test as we just got finished planting. For now I can say I haven't seen an increase in critter and I haven't experienced any negatives from the product. I will make sure to update in a few weeks when things get ready to harvest to talk about how well the product really worked.I can say the product was easy to apply and the smell isn't overpowering. I felt safe using it near fruits and veggies growing (but did not spray it "on" any of the raised bed garden frames).Will definitely update in a few weeks.
I like the fact that Deer Off is all-natural or I wouldn't have used it.  It comes with a battery-operated sprayer that works fairly well and delivers a good stream.  I walked twice around my garden while spraying a steady stream of Deer off around the perimeter.  The sprayer should be flushed out with clean water after each use.The odor around my garden wasn't unpleasant to me.  An application is supposed to last for 90 days but long before 90 days I saw rabbits in the garden.  On the plus side I haven't seen any signs of deer in the garden, and they potentially eat a lot more than rabbits.So it's effectiveness is inconclusive but at least it doesn't hurt to try.
We wanted to use Deer Off on a weeping willow tree that deer have almost pushed over. They seem to think it's a good place to sharpen their horns.We staked the tree back upright and the deer have seemed to have left the tree alone. Don't know if it was the Deer Off, the time of year or because the deer could also smell us and where we touched the tree.Edit to add more information:When Spring got here, after planting our garden, we had deer eating our tomato plants right off at the base so we sprayed our entire garden with this. This Deer Off has seemed to deter the deer but it burnt our plants. Every plant we sprayed has burnt places on them.The sprayer is also not easy to use.
I must have read the "Please Read This Before Use" single sheet of paper six times to no avail.  My motorized sprayer simply would not work.  I primed, I changed batteries, and I would have even attached the twist on wand had I been provided one.  To put it quite simply, the well-meaning sprayer was a total dud.  I'd suggest that if you do need this product (and I do) that you invest in a reliableSolo 420 2-Liter One-Hand Pressure Sprayerand forget about the innovative, but flawed sprayer.The "Deer Off" itself does work and there are several positive things to think about.++  You can safely use it around children an pets, but take note that you will want to keep it out of reach as you would any product.  Think pepper here.++  It has USDA approval to use in organic gardens.++  I could not smell odor once sprayed, but it is offensive to those critters you don't want chomping on your plants.++ Deer Off will repel deer, squirrels, and rabbits.CONS:-- Unreliable, flawed motorized sprayer--  The critters may head for your neighbor's gardens (this can be either a pro or a con, depending on how you perceive it).--  It's difficult to use this product in larger gardens due to the limitations of the spray.--  If you experience heavy rains, application should be repeated.I'm conflicted in applying a star rating for this product.  I'd give it five stars had the motorized power sprayer actually worked because application of the Deer Off should have been simple.  On the other hand, Deer Off appears to be working using an alternate sprayer.  The squirrels are leaving the sunflowers alone and the deer aren't chomping them off at the stems.  And so, this entire packet didn't live up to what it promised and I'm having to compromise at three stars.  It would have been better simply to send the Deer Off sans the dud of a sprayer and include a hand-held one.
The local deer population pretty much rules my neighborhood. While the squirrels (A.K.A.--"tree rats") are entertaining, they can also be destructive. That's why I decided to give this product a shot. I was somewhat disappointed with what I received.The battery-powered sprayer is not very strong. The nozzle does not fan out the spray very wide nor far. That made it difficult to reach the branches of my trees that the little buggers like to nibble on.Thankfully, the product does not smell bad--something I was a little concerned about, considering that "putrescent whole egg solids," capsaicin and garlic are its active ingredients. I like that it is made of natural ingredients that won't hurt other animals (especially pets).It doesn't seem to have made much of a difference keeping the pesky critters away from our trees or out of the yard. Although I did hear a squirrel scolding shortly after I sprayed some trees in my front yard, I really can't say whether it's a truly effective deterrent to these animals.
We have a yard full of fruit trees that we never get to enjoy any fruit from.We also have a mature pecan tree and have to purchase pecans.The squirrels steal everything before it's ready to harvest.I was excited to try this and hoped it would allow us to sample some of the fruit we never get to eat.The battery operated sprayer is very nice, making it extremely easy to use.Our squirrels must be very determined little critters because they weren't phased by the product and continued to strip the fruit from the trees at their normal pace.Part of the problem may be their ability to leap from tree to tree without having to climb the trunks to get to the fruit.The product may work better under different circumstances.
I like the battery powered spray, no more pain in my hand, but didn't care for the odor.  It looks like it's keeping the animals away.  But I think it'd keep anything away (including me).  It works, but be prepared.
This works well but effectiveness drops off after a good rain. The smell also doesn't make it a great candidate for use near entertaining areas. While fresh it is effective, but the need to reapply coupled with the smell makes it less useful to me. The sprayer itself was useful and made the application pretty easy.
I can not say how this works for deer but did cut down on the rabbits. I have a lot less in the yard now. Easy to apply..
We have quite a few squirrels that love the pecans in our pecan tree.  That is why I wanted to try this product.  We also have deer that come into the garden and partake of the bounty.  I don't begrudge the deer a meal but not all of their meals have to be from our little garden :)My husband took the product and sprayed around the perimeter of the yard where the squirrels play, around the pecan tree and around the garden.  We were not distressed by the smell at all.  It was hardly noticable to us.The battery powered sprayer worked like a dream.  Wonderful tool for the task!As to how it works....I believe it really does help to keep the critters away.  We waited several days to see results.  In the garden there were no new deer tracks, so I believe that helped a lot.  As for the squirrels, I haven't seen any in the pecan tree where we sprayed right around the base.  It is separate from the other trees in our yard.  However, I have seen squirrels up in the other trees on the higher limbs.  I think it keeps them out of the yard but I think it does not keep them from jumping from tree to tree on the higher branches.  Luckily the pecan tree is far enough away from other trees so they cannot jump to its branches, steal the nuts and jump back.I think the product itself is good.  You have to consider the environment you are using it in and the habits of the creatures...such as jumping squirrels.  We have not had a problem with rabbits so I do not know how it works with them.Overall I think the product does what it says it will do...I also think the squirrels can adapt if you have a lot of trees together.
I have used many different brands of deer and rodent repellent over the years and they all work relatively well.  From coyote urine to rotten egg solution to chemicals, they all provide short-term solutions to pests such as deer, rabbits, squirrels, etc.When I lived in an area that we did not landscape due to the mountain-nature of the property, it was pretty easy to spray this stuff on, and be done with it until the rains came.  Summers were the worst, and an application each month covered it for the most part.But now, I live in a more suburban community, bordering an off-road park.  We have a TON of rabbits eating the grass, and it drives my boyfriend nuts.  So, we tried this.  And yes, it works--until the sprinklers wash it away.  It seems to wash away quickly (like, every couple of days we have to reapply it).Springtime, when the sprinklers aren't used as often, might be a better time of year to use this product.  But for summers--especially this summer in California--nothing seems to help in any real way.
We were eager to try this product because we have a problem with squirrels coming onto the screened-in porch to snack and hide their nuts in the flower pots. Unfortunately the sprayer took a very long time to prime before it started spraying liquid. We actually thought the sprayer was defective because we heard the batteries whirring but no liquid was dispensed for five minutes or so. Once it got started it was great (though I'm not sure that anyone really needs a battery-powered sprayer because when the batteries die you're stuck with a non-functioning product).Anyway, we have now sprayed and will report back with an update on whether it keeps the critters away. One other note, we have used deer-repellant in the past. Normally the stuff smells horrendous. This one does not, so that's several points in its favor.
Well, I am once again reminded that there are no miracles cures to keep animals from eating (hold your breath) ANIMAL FOOD--otherwise known as my landscaping!I try to have a sense of humor about the constant tug and pull of loving wildlife AND my beautiful flowers and shrubs.After spending a lot of time and money trying all manner of products and techniques to have both wildlife AND said greenery, I am finally yielding to the wildlife.This product will likely be my last attempt to keep the critters away.  The Havahart worked okay for a few days on a few areas of the yard.  The cost and time it would take to consistently protect all of your landscaping would be insane.  You would have to spray A LOT and repeatedly and this is just not cost effective.  In addition, I'm not sure the results are any better than a home-brewed garlic/red pepper spray you could create for pennies.I will say that I was surprised that a rogue gang of armadillos that had created severe damage in my lawn were evidentally extremely turned off by the Havahart.  We had trapped one and evidently the others were savvy to the trap.  We put this all around the areas they were burrowing and haven't seen the remainder of the gang since.The time-honored technique of enjoying venison stew and smothered rabbit isn't an option in my suburban neighborhood, but it is most definitely the ONLY technique I know of that allows absolute perfection in your garden and landscaping.  The second best is to do some type of repellant (I'll stick to garlic/red pepper brew) and hope your neighbors leave their yards unprotected and full of more delicious plantings than yours.
Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer. This product is easy to attach the sprayer nozzle on to the container. The sprayer reached a good distance and got into small places that other containers are not able to reach. We have noticed a decrease in the squirrels around our wood piles and bird feeders. There are still several chipmucks. I applied this around our pool deck to deter the deer from eating my plantings. My flowers seem to be lasting longer now. There is no strong order or unpleasant smell.
This does a good job of keeping the deer and rabbits away from my currant bush and ornamental plants.  However, I have to spray more frequently than suggested.  One treatment is supposed to last three months.  I'm lucky if it lasts one month (which is why I knocked off two stars).
I was ready to protect some plants that have become deer favorites on our yard.I unpacked the deer off, started reading the description, and found the warning that left me puzzled:I am paraphrasing but it goes something like:"Apply to just a portion of your plants first and wait a few days. Product may kill some plants"This stopped me from applying the product, since I wanted to do a little more research before applying it after reading such warning. Unfortunately the deers came the very next morning and ate most of what I wanted to protect. Obviously it was bad timing, but I wanted to let others be aware that the product warns us that it might kill the plants.It did not seem to damage the plants when I did apply it, but the warning itself leaves me wondering if it's something I want in my plants.As for the product itself, the jury is still out and I will update it later this summer after more plants bloom.
I had high hopes for Deer Off repellent, especially since it is also supposed to keep away other animals such as rabbits and squirrels.  It did seem to keep the rabbit away from my flowers and plants.  However, the deer that come into my yard are either smarter than I am (very likely) or they are just not bothered by the smell.  It didn't seem to keep the deer away at all.  On a high note, I did notice less "activity" in my flower beds from the neighborhood cats that people refuse to keep inside their homes.  That was defnitely an added bonus that I was not expecting.The smell is definitely not pleasant, but I don't think there is an animal deterrent spray that does smell good.  I would like to rate this product better than 3 stars because it did help with the local rabbits and cats, but it didn't seem to do anything for the deer -- at least from what I can tell by the types/locations of flowers and plant that are still being used as midnight snacks.
I have a lot of rabbits that pass through my yard, nibbling on clover, which I don't mind, and my ornamentals, which I do. My solution has been a combination of fencing off some bushes and spraying others with my home made hot pepper spray: I gallon of water, one tablespoon of liquid soap (Ivory works well enough) and a tablespoon of the hottest Chinese hot pepper oil I can find. It works, sort of, but requires constant reapplication, especially when it rains. This product seemed like it might be a more effective solution.But for a real test, I decided to take it over to the home of a friend of mine who has a problem with deer that nibble at her ornamental bushes and chew her hostas right down to the ground. I phoned her up and proposed a test, and she quickly agreed. We met in her back yard, where I assembled the spray pump. Hose reaches to the bottom of the gallon jug? Check. Safety switch off? Check. Vent clear? Check. Nozzle opened? Checked. I pulled the trigger, and the pump whirred to life, making a satisfying sound. I waited for the liquid to appear. Nothing. I kept waiting. Still nothing. I removed the pump from the jug and checked to make sure the feeder tube wasn't blocked. I unscrewed the nozzle to make sure it wasn't plugged. I fiddled with that thing for ten minutes, and never got anything to come out.I note that other reviewers have run up against this very same problem, which suggests to me that a lot of these units are defective. That's a pity, as I had high hopes for this product. I thought about transferring the liquid to one of my pump-up sprayers so I could at least test the liquid and see how well it works, and I may yet do that, but as a ready-to-spray repellent system, this products gets a failing grade.
I wanted to try this product to see if it would help me in my quest to get the squirrels out of my attic. Each year I get a new batch as they return to the same spots to nest. My eaves have now rotted out as they have urinated in their nests and relocated a lot of the fiberglass insulation. This created a moist environment and wood rot. Not to mention the sound of little feet scurrying around in the morning on the ceilings.I have tried strobe lights, ultrasonic emitters, automatic arousal air freshener sprays, metal critter traps, and even shot a few with a pellet gun. Nothing has worked and new ones come back. I am going to be redoing the eaves with concrete hardie board to try to keep them from being able to enter in the first place. They have chewed holes in the ends of the eaves and made their own holes in the past.I tried this as one last ditch effort to stop them before the renovation begins. I was hoping to find something that would repel them and hopefully also deter them from trying to come back again next winter as they must be leaving some kind of scent markings to know to return to the same place each year. Alas it seems that those two young squirrels and their mother are rather unfazed by this repellent.I do like the electric spray wand. It worked well to spray this thick soupy yellow tinted slightly odorous liquid into the tight, hard to reach, shrinking triangular eave area of my attic. But alas they seemed to like it too as they are still there! Not even noisy grunt, chirp or call from one of them. I wouldn't have known that I did anything except for the fact that I did spray putrified egg as an ingredient all over my attic and their nesting areas. I wished it had worked. Maybe I am being a little overzealous with its intended use, but still, I saw no repelling feature about it with these squirrels.Have to give it 3 stars. I do like the spray wand.
I have used this trying to rid my property of the cute, but pesky rabbits and squirrels. I have sprayed heavily and find that it does keep the rabbits away but it does NOTHING for the squirrels!!! I really was hoping it would do something to keep the squirrels away. We also saw a racoon walking through an area that I sprayed heavily. I don't know how it works for deer as it is very rare we see a deer around our property these days.  If your problem is with rabbits, then this is probably going to help, but if you have a squirrel problem, I hope you have better results than me.
I have tried pretty much every kind of deer management products on the market, and these repellents are marginally useful at best.Most repellents smell strongly and wash away after even a light drizzle. This product tries to correct these shortcomings. It does stay on much longer and the smell is much fainter, but herein lies the problem: it does not deter deer very well. Eventually, only the corner of my garden protected by theBird-X YG Yard Gard Ultrasonic Animal Repellerremains completely unmolested.I do like the battery-powered sprayer and plan to keep it for the regular repellents after this bottle is used up.
