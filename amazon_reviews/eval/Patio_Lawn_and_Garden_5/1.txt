UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no "waves" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did. While it's still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a "lightweight" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it's more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a "no-kink" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality.
I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee. After a short time, the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement. Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty! Now Gilmour is selling them. But it's the same hose - "Flexogen". The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually, I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them. Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say "This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package. Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp., so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement.
I am with a very small number of reviewers here that I have to wonder how this silly thing got that many positive reviews. I have a small backyard, but was constantly attacked by mosquitoes everytime I went out. I have no standing water or what so ever. My neighbors might, but this thing is supposed to cover an whole acre.I followed the instruction, hung it a good distance from the porch and let it go. Oh, I also add the flowtron tape that came with the device to the bottom. A few zaps here and there, but nothing spectacular. I left it on out there for a week, and saw no difference. Still got attacked by mosquitoes. Two weeks, same thing. After a month, I gave up and took it down. There is no point to waste electricity. Oh, it served one purpose: light up that corner of the yard some.So, don't waste your hard-earned money on this thing and electricity. I am almost sure you will be disappointed. This thing will go on my next trip to Goodwill.
This light is pretty worthless.  It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but didn't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population.  I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable.  The bulbs blew after 1 season.  Replacement bulbs are $40 each plus shipping.  It takes 2.  That is $90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $80 for the whole unit.  Thanks but no thanks.Unfortunately, the only thing I've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices.  They are all unreliable too.  Skip the zappers and traps and use deet.
Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass, but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block.
I was really looking forward to trying out a reel mower and living a life of maintenance free mowing. It didn't work out. The second time I used it, the grass had gotten a little high, so there was a lot of back and forth action. It took forever, really. I know that this product isn't meant for that, but that was my situation. Anyway, as I was finishing the handle came apart. There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together, and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing. The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.Yeah, I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing, but that should not have happened. I followed the assembly instructions to the letter. It was really a very simple assembly. I didn't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions, though. I was very disappointed with this product.If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL (like leaving town for a couple weeks), this mower may be for you.If you have a sloped, lumpy yard, do not buy this product. Just don't. It is so hard to use. I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice, flat yard, but as it is this thing was worthless to me.
Save your money - Use Styrofoam cups with a blend of soils - this was a ridiculous and very expensive attempt at greenhouse gardening .............
I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this.  I also read the reviews raving about this hose.  Since these hoses are maid from remnants; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get.  My luck wasn't good.  The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately.
This grill has one major flaw.....surprised it is still being sold due to product liability. The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces...like your deck, your pine straw, or house. For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires, you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks, but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills,  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task. If you value the property you live in, or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence, avoid this flame thrower.
The coons steal the bait from this trap at will. I've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it wouldn't engage the trip at first. They advise putting bait past trip plate, but the coons just reach through the mesh and get the bait, another serious design flaw. There are traps that work, this just in NOT one of those. Save your money!
Yes, these are way easier to open. I have a near phobia about things that snap..especially mouse traps. I can not, physically it is impossible for me to open an old board/metal mouse trap. I know, weird, but it just freaks me out! So, I got these and was so excited! We keep our dog food in the garage and pet food draws mice. Every spring/fall we get them in the food or the garage itself. So I tried these traps. Lots of them. I go for total overkill (pun intended) when it comes to killing anything lower than my ankles! Well, these do NOT kill anything. They spent weeks with nothing in them. But the old mouse traps (my hubby sets them) had about one every few days. He just reset his and laughed at my 'old lady' traps. Sigh. I know these look great, and they are super easy to use, but they will not kill anything. I have now read the other reviews and have no idea how anyone could give these a positive review. Also, the thought of having a LIVE mouse to deal with? What a gross, awful, torturous hassle. No thanks. Hope this helps!
I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap. There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs. As a result, the flea trap is of no use to me. These refills are of no use to me as well  and that is why I can give only one star. They cost only $5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item. I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option.
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result, it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.  I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner
I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!!It was worth a try, but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.  :>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application.
I have been doing yard work for 40 years, so I am no "backyard rookie".  This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it. The "PowerGear" fell off and couldn't be reattached firmly to the pruner. I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say, everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product. Poor products deserve bad reviews, both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered. Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit. That said, I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly.
This would have been a zero star review if I could have done that.  Yellowjackets would fly around it but would not enter.  After three weeks I tried to return and Amazon didn't even want the POS returned, just gave me a credit.  I guess not having to return it is worth one star.
Don't waste your time or money on this peace of pretty plastic.  Using the bait that came with it and the bait refills I bought extra, it never trapped one yellow jacket in an area well populated with the little pests.  Save your money and get a good fly swatter and some spray for the nests.
We had hundreds of wasps in our tree so I ordered one of these, followed the instructions and waited for the massacre.  NOT ONE DEAD WASP after 3 weeks of use.  I changed bait for 3 more weeks, nothing. I changed bait again and still nothing after another month.  I half expected the wasps to build a nest around it. Bah, annoying.
I have a time to time yellow jacket problem where I live so I bought a yellow jacket trap and this bate to help with the problem.  I followed the instructions and hung it in an area well populated with yellow jackets.  I left it there for weeks and it never trapped one yellow jacket.  Yesterday I took it down and threw it in the trash.  Waste of money.
I know the difference between yellow jackets, honey bees, bumble bees, paper wasps, and bald faced hornets.  It was yellow jackets that were harassing my hummingbirds at the feeder. With the originally supplied attractant I caught no yellow jackets in this trap.  With Dr. Pepper I caught one in a week.  Another bait might have worked better but the Rescue reusable trap with apple juice worked somewhat so I stopped using the one-time use trap.
I am guessing the 'attractant' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES, and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds (thousands?) of flies inside the bag. It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK. It's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross, a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse!Find a different solution.
When I received this product, the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer. They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder. The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware. Since I received this as part of the Vine program, I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.We gerryrigged the baffler, but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious. So far after 2 weeks no birds. It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.Why the one star? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging. Not worth the time and money. Buy something for less money. A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to. We have six feeders and no squirrels. Now deer are another thing altogether!
Issues with the feeder:-the nut that is to secure the top hook to the cover is tiny in size and ill fitted to the size of the hook.  It was impossible to secure it, and thus the top wobbles a bit.-tube plastic, part holding the seeds, is a bit thin.  It has to be squeezed slightly in order for the 2 prongs that hold the top on to be inserted, which gives me concern it will not hold up well in windy conditions.-seeds (1/4 to 1/2 cup) fall out of the bottom when filling the container and/or anytime the feeder is set on a solid surface.-bottom portion wiggles around the tube, seems way to loose, maybe that is why so many seeds fall out.-It does hold a lot of seeds, but the rather flimsy construction and materials gives me pause for concern. Especially considering the entire thing is held together by 2 tiny prongs, one in each side of the tube top.observation:-only very small birds have room to land on the tiny perches-the holes to feed from are very small, and there is a gap between the opening and where the seeds actually are, so again, only a small bird head will fit inside the hole to reach the seeds.Opinion:For the price, currently $73 on Amazon, there are better, more sturdy options. I have and currently use several cheaper and better feeders than this one.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- So after only a few weeks, I had to take down the feeder as the bottom was falling out.  And changing the rating from 2 stars to 1.
All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct. The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed. On the feeder I received, the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it's stuck to a window. Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups. Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it's not worth paying the postage to send it back. Despite the much higher cost, I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects.
This arrived on the 19th and I started using it the last week of Feb. It is now March 4th and it has stopped working. No, it is not the light bulb, I changing it  a few times and still nada. So about 7 - 10 days use and it is broken already. Total waste of money.
The only thing in this that should be there is sugar. The rest is stuff you shouldn't be adding to your feathered friends diet. This stuff is also three times the price of baker's sugar from any old grocery store, four times the price of regular granulated sugar that takes a little longer to dissolve. This is a bad buy, bad for the birds and bad for your pocket.
I picked up some of this  mix last summer at a local agricultural center.  It's an old brand that is easy to find, and the price was right.  My first outing with it last summer was a total bust.  I mean I mixed the stuff, put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees.  If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it, they were obviously disappointed for they never came back.  Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it.  At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late. I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north, (the ruby throated).  It's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you.  But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on.  I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing.  (I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper, but just not worth the mess and trouble to me. Just my opinion, but its stands).  I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon.  Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand, I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth.  I love it. It's definitely a little pricier than this mix, but well worth it, trust me.  I don't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills, but I don't really care.  I found something that's reasonably priced, easy to use, and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it.  In conclusion, I don't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers.  Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc.  My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it.  It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here, but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me, and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season. I have left a link to the Mills brand, and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work...Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet, 3-Pack
There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix. There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds.  This is reason enough to not buy this product.  Buy a product without the dye.Better yet, just buy sugar.  Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.  Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved.  You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food.  Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION.  DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey, use only sugar.  Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds.  Sugar Only!
Hummingbirds are wonderful.  They're amazing, unique birds, but you don't need to buy anything expensive to draw them to your yard.If you want a feeder, try this one:Perky-Pet Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feederor something similar.  I've used this type for years and you can't beat the fact that it's glass, and that you can buy new bee guards.  (They get moldy.  Don't bleach...replace.You can get a good feeder for about ten bucks and it will last for years.As far as food, you can do two things.  Plant plants that hummers and butterflies and bees like; or buy a gallon of distilled water and some quality sugar.  You don't need red dye, and shouldn't use it.  It's bad for the Hummers.I was going to send a Feeder to my nieces, and when I looked at this product I was appalled to find that Perky Pet is still producing such a formula.  Their bad.It's cheap to have hummingbirds.  And easy to make your own hummer-chow.  Don't buy this.
I love Perky-Pet feeders, but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything, especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil, and 1 part white sugar, let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this, you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes, and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar, and small insects.
Big and floppy, When you tighten them it feels like you cut off the blood or they fall down off the knees.
I wore these twice and they skinned the .... out of my knees. Yes, I had the straps adjusted correctly. Won't use them again. Use a kneeling pad instead!The kneeling pad has worked beautifully! No more skinning my knees.
This does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself. The chemical is toxic to touch per the package warnings and it's not easy to get the cartidges into the light as instructed. Save your money....not worth the hassel.
Using these in Japan. I have used them previously in Canada. They were sent to me by family since I wouldn't have purchased them again. In my case at least, Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate...at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night. It was the same back in Canada, at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind. If the mosquitos' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great...if not, then what? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these...I would just hang another zapper. I'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective.
I was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death (literally). He ate three to complete stumps in two days and was working on his next one when I got this in the mail.I anxiously set it up and learned much about it in the process. I see most of the people here praising it for getting rid of deer, and it may work well for that because they are large targets. It also does disturb smaller varmints but not in the way I expected.Thie product is very difficult to review because while it works somewhat,  a 60 dollar product is not necessary for smaller, less intelligent and less numerous pests.  It is probably great for an area infested with pests though, hundreds of deer or tons of groundhogs, but something much simpler could be used in your average garden setting.The idea of the product is cute and simple enough. It is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler. If the Scarecrow sees anything that moves, it fires the sprinkler off for about five seconds. It then waits 8 seconds and repeats.The problem is that with smaller varmints, they can hide behind the plants, and when the Scarecrow is aimed low, every plant movement (breeze blowing a cucumber leaf) sets it off unless you turn the sensitivity down so far that it won't go even off with you dancing in front of it.When set to scare away smaller pests, this device falses constantly on plant movement and only sees the varmints if they are totally exposed in front of it, which rarely happens in my garden jungle. The motion sensor concept doesn't work well because everything moves in the garden including the plants. It has a false detector that suppoesdly automatically shuts down the sensitivity if it is falsing too much. It doesn't work well. We have watched the Scarecrow go off every 10 seconds for an hour non-stop with nothing in front of it but plants moving in a very light breeze.The good thing, and the dichotomy for me, is it appeared to get rid of the pest. We have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing OK. So for that, I wanted to give it a much better rating than I otherwise would. The sprinkler does appear to scare away most animals, but it cost me $60 to save $10 worth of cabbage.Cats, dogs, groundhogs, squirrels, rabbits, etc. appear to be driven away by it. And the battery has lasted several weeks. I just can't give it anything but one star because it doesn't work the way it claims and is very expensive for the average Joe. The device works more like a random sprinkler shooting water at random time intervals depending on the breeze.A better product, and one that is actually affordable, would be one you set up that randomly fires a sprinkler every few minutes.  It would be much cheaper and just as effective.  You may be able to recreate it with a timing device that runs on a battery and a $7.00 sprinkler, or just a generic timed sprinkler you use when you notice a pest is bugging your plants. But if you have tons of deer, then this may be your only viable solution short of a major fence or wall.There is another reason the product is very annoying. You have to have it hooked up to the hose all the time. I have to have a hose reeled out across my lawn at all times to reach the garden from the water faucet on my house. It is in the way much of the time, so has to be moved about all the time for family gatherings, lawn mowing, kids want to play in yard etc. But I did discover an alternate use!! Kids love running in front of the Scarecrow. :-) OK, now would you pay $60 to entertain your kids?  OK, so sell it as that.  Much more useful for that purpose.If marketed as a garden tool, the motion sensor should possibly be a heat sensor or something that can discern better between mammalian presence and a leaf in the wind. The sprinkler is little more than a cheap lawn sprinkler attachment. I am very torn in my rating because here is a device that basically did what I wanted it to do, scared away a varmint eating my plants. It has a major cool factor and is a fun conversation piece loved by the kids. But it falses constantly and is difficult to deal with unless you want to run an underground hose to it and it is expensive.I am giving it one star because it works, kind of, but it is not what it advertises itself to be.  A motion sensor cannot work in a dense garden for small animals.BUT YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT!  This would get 5 stars as a kids' toy!!  So maybe as a combinational use product it gets more stars?
I added teflon to the water connections,  and still leaked but the sensor would not work with the water on.  Dry test worked fine i would hear the click.  But once I added the water and did nothing.  My home is a 1990s house with great water pressure and this device was just terrible.  I also tried the havahart water auto sprinkler and both are great in theory but are terrible on real conditions.
I don't own these but saw them at a flea market. No question in my mind why they were up for sale (but should have gone in the trash IMO!) My friend discovered -- the hard way! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin! Mind you, this friend is a large manly guy, not easily affected, yet he howled and dropped it! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices, nor my father with his pacemaker, or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen. What were they thinking!?!?!?
This is the cheapest made product I've ever owned.  To insert the 2 batteries, there is no flap that you open.  You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver, then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor.  Insert the batteries, put circuit board and switches back in, insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut (3 each), hoping the screw doesn't fall out while you're holding the nut.  Are you kidding?  I'm returning this, because I don't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries.  I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries, you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle.
I bought this product along with composter (compost wizard jr. 7 cubic foot compost tumbler). First, I examined the box trying to find ingredients, none of them was listed, so who knows what it is. It made me feel uncomfortable, because I do not know if it is there natural ingredient or some kind of chemical. Also, I would like to do some research on this product if it really works or not, but since there is no disclosure of ingredients, you stuck to "take their word for it". Plus, what if you have an allergy for it, but since their no information what inside; it can be a simple dust as far as I know.Second, I followed the directions and added this mystery chemical into my compost. I do not think it made a difference at all. My composter does its job with or without it just fine, it is black and generates a lot of heat, I water it or add greens to keep it moist, and turn it weekly. Did not feel any speed up whatsoever. Nature and composter do what they supposed to do without this gimmick. Don't waste your money!!.To speed up the composting and introduce viable bacteria, I added (as book on composting recommended) about a gallon of already made compost which already contains all the necessary bacteria and organisms, so they can start working on new pile of compost.
Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days, you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill, at a cost of about $4 each. Depending on what you pay for the propane, attractant and CO2 cartridges, it sums up to a cost of $20 around or more at each tank refill. Since you have to refill the propane tank, replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days, this adds up to an operating cost of over $400 per year! I'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying.
It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring, including wasting three of the "clean out" cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product.
This product is a waste of money.  It will only last for one season and its' effetiveness was minimal.  Two other folks on the street bought one as well and had the same experience.  After mine stopped working (the first time), customer service was marginal at best.  I live in the south and I got a little desperate to solve the misquito problem.  Save your money and buy more cans of bugs spray.
One of the costliest mistakes I ever made was purchasing this device (actually two of them!) to control mosquitoes in the yard.  Yes, it caught mosquitoes, but it did not eliminate the problem; the yard was still a mosquito zone despite two operating machines.  The problem was that while the machine does catch mosquitoes, it does not catch enough of them to make a serious dent in the overall population.  It was not until I sprayed the yard with Cutter Bug-Free BackyardCutter Bug Free Backyard 32 oz Ready-to-Spray Hose End Insect Repellent Concentrate HG-61067, that I finally got rid of the mosquitoes.I did not like this product for many reasons:  it had a high initial cost, it required replacing the Octenol attractant (more $$), and the propane tank needed refilling about every 3-4 weeks (more $$).  In addition, it needs an electrical cord plug-in nearby, and one has to replace the mosquito catch nets (more $$).  Basically, it costs too much to operate, takes too much on-going maintenence time and effort, and most importantly, it did not eliminate the pesky mosquitoes!  So now I have two of these things taking up space in my shed.  I will not sell the devices because they simply do not work to control mosquitoes.  They will be future landfill items.Save your hard-earned dollars and avoid this product and its clones.  Use the Cutter Bug-Free Backyard spray instead.konedog
Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006, after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them, there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon, but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away.
I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad, the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board.
I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with!We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about nature and other living beings!  Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this , but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you cannot throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison!Terrible product!
After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests, none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read "6"... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon, so these tests give unreliably "alkaline" results). The purified water test also came out "alkaline".  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result, 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K, P, or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes, 20, 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read "adequate" for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either, so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So, all in all, it was a tremendous waste of money and time.
No way does this product perform as promised.  And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work!I don't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck.  At the top of the rail, one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat.  Any which way we tried it, it did not hold, would not grip the railing and kept falling forward. The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing.  How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing?  Only if you assemble it OFF the railing; then you can't get it ON the railing.(I think I got all the parts:  I received the basket, two L-shaped arms, six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts.)
I have a few B&D; 18volt tools and I decided to buy a weed whacker and this electric broom.  I was in for a surprise.The weed whacker works great and the battery lasts for ever...as an FYI!I charged the battery the day I received it...a full charge of about 18 hours..to be on the safe side.  Put the battery in and went on to do my cleaning around the deck etc....  Yes there was air...it was OK..but not enough to sweep much.  15 minutes later it went to half power, and 10 minutes later it DIED.My first reaction - the battery is bad, lets try a different one and if that is the case I can call B&D; for a warranty replacement.  NOT the case...all batteries in this thing died in less then 30 minutes and thus this is useless for me.Other B&D; 18volt tools, including the weed whacker work for 45 minutes plus and usually have full power for the first 30 minutes.Sorry B&D; but this is useless, IMHO.  1/5
Plastic bag with a few metal rings.  Within a few weeks the metal had pushed through the plastic edges so water would just run out the sides.  The metal also started to rust and the whole thing looks as classy as a bag of trash hanging on a hook.  If this was free, you would still not want it.  Get a pot and a tomato cage. ;)
I ordered three of the Topsy Turvy Upside-down Tomato Planters last spring for the summer of 2006, thinking it would be great for saving space in my small garden area.  I ordered it and had my husband install hooks on our south-facing back patio.  When they arrived, I inserted the plants just as described and filled them with the best possible bagged soil I could find.  Not only did they not grow any better than the traditional ground method, but it was too heavy for me to lift up to the hooks.  My husband (operates heavy equipment for a living and very strong) even had difficulty doing the lifting once they were filled with soil, both when they were installed and then again when they were taken down in October, with our first frost. If you are not strong enough to lift 50-100 lbs, don't purchase. Considering the trouble I had with this product, I would not purchase this item again, and would recommend that if you have any disabilities as I have or are elderly, try the traditional method. I'm thinking about having my husband build me some small raised beds about 2 feet off the ground!
Now im a green thumbaholic when it comes to trying anything new in the gardening world. I love the feeling i get when i literally cant wait to open the box and try it out and see the results... Nothing was different when it comes to this topsy turvy. I bought two for my mom and one for myself to test different varieties of tomatoes. Well to make it short, the harvest was embarrassing. I had a crimson cushion in both mine and my mothers plus one in a 1 gallon and one in a 3 gallon pot for the ultimate test of durability, watering, nutes, and overall yield per plant. Well the 3 gallon performed the best, giving me way more than 5 pounds of tomatoes easily every couple weeks. The topsy turvey even underperformed the 1 gallon and thats hard to do. These crimson cushions are HUGE and PLUMP, almost as big but not as dense as a beefsteak and in the T.T. they looked like cherry tomatoes, the color was , flavor was missing, and most of all the beauty of the plant just wasnt there. Great idea gone bad since this a path off of vertical growing. Vertical can get you 10 x the yield of any ordinary plant in any size container, but this is not as good of an idea as originally thought up. Hope this helps, stick to nature and dig a hole, dont have one than buy a 3 gallon pot and reap the benefits. One love my friends
This kneeling cushion was used for the sole purpose of gardening. The foam may be water resistant, but it is not very thick and your knees can feel the sticks underneath it. The foam does not have a protective coating like other kneeling pads I have used, and therefore it takes the shape of whatever it is sitting on (for instance your knees and sticks below your pad). The kneeling pad could be improved for gardening; therefore, I would not recommend this product for gardening.
A baby red squirrel...well....this is his dream buffet...attaching photos! I will attach 5 photos as proof...He's a cutie and he is very photogenic! I bought three of these. Scroll down to Customer photos the last 5 photos are mine... It's a very cute squirrel but to call this squirrel proof is totally FALSE!
I only had to keep this for one day to realize that it had a manufacturing defect which may or may not be evident on others.The cutting blade only has a washer on one side.  When you try to cut something as large as 2&#34; the blade will bend to the sideand cut into the stop.  Bad deal.  I returned it for a friskas which I am happy with.
Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then, the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months, but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody "improved" them.Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet, so I don't know how these will perform.
Although I have come to the conclusion that where a product is made is no important to me (it is made in China), I am giving this bird-feeder four stars because it is well-made and very attractive. It looks just like a barn on my daughter's farm. It is red, has a weathervane on top, windows and a metal roof. It is supposed to be a deterrent for squirrels who sit on the bar because they weigh too much. Our backyard squirrels hang upside down on the post and get into anything, but so far they  have not been attracted to this feeder. I have the old feeder up in the backyard and the birds loved it. It is just blue and clear plastic- we stopped putting birdseed in it when the new Perky-Pet Country House feeder arrived. It has been up for six-days and today is the first day that I was able to observe a sparrow actually eating seeds from it.  Apparently, the birds are taking their sweet time in adjusting to their new source of bird food.  We feed our squirrels peanuts I buy by the sack and because we gave a resident feral cat who is blind and old, we also get a possum and very big raccoon coming to our back-door to eat cat food and drink fresh water. This bird-feeder is an attractive addition to our small back yard and I trust that in time our usual back yard birds (Cardinals, Finches, etc.)  will return. The Mourning Doves eat the seed that falls to the ground and since there hasn't been that much activity at the new red feeder, they too aren't visiting us too frequently. I am giving them all time to adjust to their new food source.Well, here is an update: after using this bird house for approximately two months, it has broken. The metal rod that holds the rooster on top (this secures the top of the opening where seeds are poured into) has vanished. This morning I found the roof of the birdhouse on the ground and cannot find the rest of the pieces anywhere. Perhaps an outraged squirrel or large bird came along and broke it to get at the seeds inside. I now would recommend that you do not buy this bird feeder unless you just want it for decoration.
As a few others have posted, in here, the quality control on this Chinese unit is poor.  The wiring on my unit was reversed.  Once I set things right, the unit worked correctly for about four months before complete failure.  My battery died in the bargain, due to the unit failure that allowed my battery to drain completely with no load on it except this unit and the solar panel.  I'll try one more and then update this review.  Update:  I just ordered: KINTREX SPC0601 Solar Charge Controller - 7Amp, 100 Watt,...  At just $10, on this site, it's a far better deal and has an extra indicator light for low charge condition.  The connectors should mate up perfectly if the pictures are accurate. As far as the reversed wiring goes, in all electrical applications with connectors, an exposed contact is normally the ground, coming from a power source.  The hot side is recessed and/or shielded to keep you from grabbing it and then a grounded object or contact, which would result in a shock.  This scheme is reversed, obviously, in the non-powered side of the circuit, ie., the thing you're sending the power to that mates with the connection just described.  When I called Sunforce's rep, in Canada, and spoke with him, he denied knowledge of any other incidents of reversed wiring.  That's really curious, as others have posted about the reversals, as I mentioned, above. UPDATE: 4/2011- The Kintrex unit works flawlessly.  You are well-advised to go with it and leave the reviewed unit, as above, alone.  It costs much more and is inferior.
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily "Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles. The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. I received a reply from Carol that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders. She also said they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder. Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic plastics without it. This feeder has many _great_ properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so.
Before ordering, I was afraid of having a cheap plastic bearing inside.  No where in the internet, including manufacturer's web site, I could check the spec on this part, nor anyone of reviewers commented on the type of ball inside.  This one does incorporates metal ball bearing, but have a similar characteristics as $0.99 plastic part, badly leaking water at the joint.  Time wasted to make it function like a simple shut-off valve, in order to save time required on returning, just priceless.  Now, I understand why unusually high number of negative feedback on this junk.  Over last few years, we have become so acquainted to junk imported from China, it's just amazing how some users will tolerate badly designed and manufactured pats.I had no idea that designing a water shut-off valve was such a difficult task, that requires a special skill.  It's made to leak, no matter how much connector is tightened.  I thought Gilmour was a reputable American manufacturer, and I'm totally off.  Do engineers at Gilmore check the prototype before sending its design to full production, or do marketing people actually check if it's viable product?  Please do not write reviews without thoroughly checking them first, or post phony reviews your untruthful reviews are wasting other people's valuable time.
This would be a great timer. It is easy to set. Keeps the settings when you change batteries. Resists water. Allows manual override and lets you remove the timer from the valve to program. The big problem that it shares with most of these timers is lack of reliability. Mine stopped working within a week. The company was very easy to deal with and offered to ship a new one next day but I need a timer now or my plants will die so I will return it to Amazon.
Granted, out of the box this API water agitator doesn't look like much. Packaged with (3) metal legs, (4) rubber anchors and (1) metal agitator, set up takes seconds. I slapped in two D cell batteries (not included) and placed this unit into our bird bath. I like the fact that no wiring is required. It is quiet. The continuous agitation does repel mosquitoes. There is a rubber gasket in place to prevent water seepage into the motor housing. Trust me it doesn't work.I'm not a big fan of the snap in metal legs. The legs have fallen out of their slots on more then one occasion. I get about three months juice before its time to replace the batteries. I add algaecide to aid in keeping the water clear. It must work because I see both birds and butterflies dropping in for a visit. Now the bad news. It didn't even make through the summer. The high price tag on this lemon is another reason to think other options.
I was never able to get this to extend and that was a real pain, especially since I bought it for my wife, who is short and catch reach the top of the van. Also, don't mistake this for an ice scraper; it has rounded edges meant to remove snow without scratching the roof of your vehicle.
The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor, and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds.
As mentioned in other reviews, this is NOT for cars and trucks.  I bought it for use on the riding mower, filling smaller cans and for my dual sport bike.  It's virtually impossible to fill any of these without spilling.But worst of all, it split along the seam at the top and sloshes gas out when carrying and fills it's storage area with fumes.  Forget it!
I have this and several other cans with this new stupid design (thanks liberals) due to all the tree hugging environmentalists. You end up spilling more gas with these new cans and need 3 hands to try and use it with some success. These are worse for the environment then the old style which were fine.
I purchased this fuel can because I have a small diesel Kubota Tractor. I needed a five gallon can in order to fill the tractor's tank. The tank on the tractor is conveniently located on the top of the tractor. I have found it pretty much impossible to fill the tractor with diesel from this can without spilling all over myself, and all over the ground, creating both a safety and environmental problem.The ill conceived idea behind this gas can is that the pour spout is rigid and you have to rest a lever on the pour spout on the rim of the gas tank, pushing up on the lever, and then releasing the flow of gas. This does not work at all. You end up having to manually pull the lever up with your hand. Remember the can is 5 gallons, and it is too heavy to try and support with one hand. So, for this device to even come close to working, you need at least 3 hands, and preferably four. In frustration, you finally take the pour spout off, and pour directly from the can into the tank, which pours diesel all over yourself.Making the device even more useless, it does not have a vent opening anywhere, so even under ideal circumstances, you can not pour from it.One wonders if they even ever tried to use this thing before they sold it.AVOID ! ! !
Too heavy and kink. Hard to carry around. Expensive to much for female gardener. I am not able to drug around to water my flower beds.
These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal, that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts, on the other hand, need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove, despite being well made and attractive, is no good for holding hot items. At best, it protects hand and arm while grilling, if you're using tongs, lets say, over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it.
I LOVED this filler & gauge, until I started blowing tires. I had a hunch the low price for this gauge was too good to be true. Although the convenience of the filler/deflator is fantastic, the quality of the gauge itself is horrible. After blowing two tires on one recent trip, I used two other quality gauges to verify the pressure. It turned out that my tires were all over inflated by 15-20 PSI. I filled them cold like I always do (either in the evening or the morning), but they were way over inflated. This had never happened to me before. I have two of these inflators (one in the garage and one in the RV), so I pulled out the other one to double-check the gauge on that one. Compared to my other two high-quality gauges, that one was off by almost 10 PSI too. So I threw both of these in the trash and stopped using them. It's a shame too, because I loved these things. It's not worth it if the gauges aren't accurate though.
Written in the blush of new ownership:  Let's be clear, this is not a go into the forest and cut wood for the winter chainsaw.  I bought this saw to use as a shop tool for preparation of blanks for woodturning.  Having said that, it cuts very well, has sufficient power for the purpose, is not too loud and is well balanced.  It is well made for the duty for which it is designed.  Several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic.  Mine is metal.  It looks like it might be pretty light, but it is metal.I expect it to hold up well under the use that I intend for it.  I would expect it to hold up for normal home tree maintenance use.  I would not expect it to hold up to days of bucking logs.Cold experience:  Over the past 10 months or so, I have cut about 10 short log sections into chunks and cut some vertically for bowl blanks.  I don't think this constitutes a lot of use.  The painted name on the bar is barely marred.  The chain is still quite sharp.  Today I was cutting a log vertically which is the easiest cut for a saw as you are cutting with the grain.  Chain is nice and sharp, everything is great, except suddenly the motor is running and the chain is still.  Fast forward through a lot of diagnostic stuff to learn that the sprocket in the inside of the saw is in fact plastic and has in fact melted.  I was looking at the outside sprocket when I said it was metal.My money was completely wasted.  This saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated.  The best part of the whole thing was when I called Poulan customer service at 3:55 PM Central time and was told that the "general questions" section was closed, their hours being from 8:00 to 4:30 Central time.  I can't speak for customer service but their engineering department is clearly closed.Avoid this purchase.
These are not brass.  They are made from cheap pot metal (recycled mix of aluminums) covered with a thin brass plating. (The similar looking Orbit brand is made this way too.)  They will work well for a while, long enough to lure you into writing a great review for them, but they will eventually fuse to the real brass fitting on your hose and your faucet and may not be removable without ruining both your hose and the faucet on your house.  Before they get to that state, as the metal deteriorates, they will begin to dribble, so you will be tempted to tighten them further, making later removal impossible without damaging your hose and faucet.  Since the metal is aluminum, not brass, the inserted piece will scratch a bit each time you insert it or detach it, and over time this accumulation of wear will cause it to leak at the fitting.  The black plastic over the fittings will twist and fail to grab the knurled metal beneath it, so you may have to use a wrench to install.  Again, these will work very well for a year or so, and after that you are cuing up for a big problem.  Gilmore alleges a guarantee on these, but other reviews have said they do not respond if you call them on it, so your only recourse would be if Amazon would cover it, which is unlikely at the point where these will start giving you trouble.  Either way, they aren't going to pay for your ruined hose fitting and faucet.The good news is that there is a better set available on Amazon, also made by Gilmore, and unless they have cheapened the design or materials since I last purchased them, they are far superior: Gilmour 09QCGT 2-Piece Green Thumb Brass Quick Connector Set for Hose
I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake, but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground.  The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps, but again, the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder.  I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience.  Sorry to have to give it a one star, but I can't find a reason to even go for two.
The instructions for this product are easy to follow and I had it ready to spray, theoretically, within seconds. However the sprayer just wouldn't spray. I checked and replaced the batteries. I took it apart several times and still couldn't get it to work. I read the directions again and noticed a phone number with the pledge that the company's highest objective was to serve the customer. So I called and got a toy company. They informed me that they had been bought by another company and they didn't have a forwarding number. I got on the internet, located a working number, and finally got to talk to a human being after the usual push button 1, then 2, and so on. She said she would be happy to send a replacement product. But I needed to get a specific number off the bottom of the package. I hunted down the package but alas, the number had been defaced. Too bad for me and I was unable to get a replacement.I decided to just sprinkle the product around my flower garden but it didn't have any effect at all. So maybe the liquid needs to be sprayed directly onto the flowers which was impossible to do without the proper sprayer. So basically it was worthless. I've tried other products from this company that worked. Maybe you will have a different experience.
it was easy to assemble, it was easy to use and gave a continuous full spray and that's all it did. The rabbits came last night, and I sprayed it about 8 p.m 3 times with the spray being just inches above the plants to give full coverage. I did that 3 times just to be sure and the plants were fine. 10 1/2 hours later, all the 25 ft. row of collarobi (sp) had been eaten down to the ground and the same with the two 25 ft. rows of beets. They even ate the tops off the onions about 5 inches down. It DOESN'T work. All the fancy packaging and the battery powered spray doesn't matter if it doesn't work and it doesn't.... I have fence around the entire area so rabbits and squirrels are about all that get in, coons and skunk and deer can't. Save your money............. put barbed wire around your garden...UPDATE: I tried this 3 times and nothing worked about it, including the motor on the sprayer. I had to pour it into another sprayer to use it and YES, I turned it off after spraying and I even put new batteries in it and nothing..... The spray handle with the motor for spraying was the only thing that worked in the first place and now even it is useless...
I ordered this product in desperation.  The rabbits and squirrels ate most of my garden.  I got this product and applied it around the perimeter of my garden area as the label says not to apply directly to plants you plan to eat.  1 day things were good then my peas disappeared.  I am very disappointed.
When I saw this offered, I jumped on it.  So far the deer had eaten all my lily's, including my day lily's and were beginning to start on my tiger lily's.  Add in the echinacea and my beautiful garden was almost gone.  As soon as this arrived, I began spraying.Assembly of the unit was easy.  Batteries were already installed, so it was simply a matter of unscrewing the cap and placing the siphon hose in the canister and tightening the lid.  Unfortunately, the batteries were dead.  So a run to the store for new batteries.  Try again.  The sprayer began spraying when depressing the trigger button.  (Batteries should be packaged separately so they don't run down, me thinks)Sprayed the flowers and the area around them.  Given the smell of this stuff, I was sure it would work.  (Yes you can smell it and it is vile).  One caution, don't spray on a windy day if you have to stand downwind of the sprayer.  I could feel the hot pepper working in my nose and mouth.Went inside and waited to see what would happen over night - would the deer be back?In a word, yes.  From the amount of deer dung (copious amounts) on the ground around my flower beds, it was more like a herd instead of one or two.  As I walked closer, two rabbits jumped from the  echinacea and hopped across the yard.  All the day lily blossoms were gone, as were the heads of my tiger lily's.Does this stuff work?  In a word, no.  Maybe it's just the wild game around my place, but it seemed to me that Deer Off was more like a salad dressing attracting the animals instead of deterring them.
I sprayed this all around my house to deter ground squirrels.  Well first of all, it took a couple of minutes for the pump to prime instead of a couple of seconds.  Then, when I was about 3/4 of the way around my foundation the sprayer started to sputter and refused to spray any more even though there was still about 1/4 of a bottle left.And last but not least, the squirrels don't seem to be the least bit bothered by the smell.  Even my dogs don't seem to be bothered by the smell.  In fact, they like to lay down with their noses stuck under the door right where I sprayed the stuff hoping to keep the baby squirrels from squeezing under the door and eating all my dog kibble.Since I live in the burbs, I can't judge how effective it is against deer and rabbits but don't waste your money if you have squirrels.  This has absolutely NO effect on the little critters.
I was excited to try this product out to protect my roses from hungry deer - but I could not get the battery operated sprayer to prime.  It seems an overly complicated design for a simple product.  Now I will have to pour it into a traditional sprayer to see if it works.
I was so excited to see this offered through Amazon Vine! The deer are making their way around our yard and gardens this summer. They tend to come (and go) in cycles so this was a perfect opportunity to try this product. Or so I thought.Assembly was a cinch. Batteries included (and installed). All I had to do was take off the cap, put the hose in and tighten the cap. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when they said you have to hold the trigger/hose down low (in order for the liquid to reach the nozzle)...that's how siphoning tends to work:) ~ After just about draining the batteries, the liquid *finally* started coming out. Of course, I had to replace the batteries after I'd been spraying for about three minutes. Not sure if the batteries are cheap, old, or should just come packaged separately with the spray.Within two days, the deer were back and were snacking on my plants. I had tried spraying it at the base of a shepherd's hook as well to deter squirrels from getting at the bird feeder. Well that worked like a charm. Not! This concoction smells quite a bit like vinegar and that's about all I could smell. If you want something that will work and I mean REALLY, REALLY work, try Liquid Fence. I've been using this product effectively for about ten years. You can get it in mixed form (a bit cheaper), or in concentrated form (which is what I buy). That is more expensive, initially, but it is well worth the cost. Here's the link, I hope it works:http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Fence-113-Repellent-Concentrate/dp/B000NW777E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341177361&sr;=8-1&keywords;=liquid+fenceThis stuff stinks to the ends of the Earth and beyond! Rotten eggs, vinegar, garlic and tons of other great, stinky stuff to keep the deer away. It doesn't work on squirrels though (I haven't found anything that does). And you have to reapply as new growth appears (deer loooove the tender greens!) and/or if it rains or you top-water your plants. Re-applying due to water and growth is essential for this product to work. You WILL smell this when you spray! Don't be downwind of it:) ~ it dries odorless in several hours.I would not recommend Havahart Deer Off. HIGHLY recommend Liquid Fence:)
It's absolutely amazing!  I am an animal whisperer.  All I have to do is spray the Deer Off around my landscaping and the critters they come a running.  Not only is the salad bar open, but I'm obviously using a peppery salad dressing that the critters love. Whooo hooo!  Isn't that how it's supposed to work?
I have a problem with squirrels jumping on my bird feeder and knocking all of the bird seed all over my deck. I sprayed this solution on the outside of the feeder and the deck railing and it seems to have no effect on the squirrels.
I have a bird feeder on top of a 10' pole, which I thoroughly soaked the Havahard Deer Off.  5 minutes later a squirrel climbed up the pole through the Deer Off.  I chased the squirrel away, and he was back in another 5 minutes.  The Deer Off did not even slow him down.What DOES work for me is greasing the pole with automotive grease weekly.  I had hoped that I could apply the Deer Off less frequently.  I also worry about poisoning the squirrels, since they obviously remove the grease from the pole physically, on their underbellies, and then lick it off.
I was only able to "spray" with this for a minute or so. Then the spray turned to a stream which dripped off of everything. I changed the batteries thinking that maybe the batteries that came with it were old, but that didn't help at all, so it's a mechanical fail.I'm a person who cares about the environment, and the packaging disturbs me. The holster is plastic and doesn't have a recycle number on it, so that will end up in the landfill. The battery powered sprayer doesn't either, so the outside of that will end up in the landfill. Even though I'll see what I can do about recycling the insides, I'm sure many people won't and that will also end up in the landfill. To save the earth I'd rather buy this in a gallon jug and use my own pressurized tank sprayer than fuss with a battery operated sprayer. Environmental fail.I put this in my own tank sprayer.  Even after three applications on my purple coneflowers, the squirrels are still eating the flowerheads. Product fail.
I have moved into a neighborhood teeming with wildlife: deer, raccoons, rabbits... As much as I enjoy it, I'd also like to have some landscaping. After carefully researching deer-resistant plants, I re-landscaped the whole yard with those choices. For additional insurance, I followed all of my neighbors' advice & bought deer repellent. I chose this one as it specifically includes rabbits in the description of animals repelled by this product whereas the local nurseries could only steer me in the direction of deer resistant plants.  I recognize that when animals are hungry they will eat anything but I used this product exactly as directed, we have not had a great deal of rain, & the rabbits & deer have eaten everything in my yard.  According to the directions, it still should be working for at least another 6 wks. My neighbor uses a product called Plantskydd, also non-toxic & it really seems to work. It has an odor that would gag a sewer tank repair person but it does air out & still seems to keep the animals away.  I would recommend that over Deer Off.
I received this Yard Butler Sprinkler Stand as part of Vine product reviewing. I had read a review of the unit before I ordered it about the threads in the stand being a problem. Yes they are a problem.  As I tried to put in the sprinkler that I had just purchased, I was very careful, I found that the sprinkler would not go in straight and the sprinkler end thread was being ruined. I looked at the threads in the Yard Butler and they were  clearly not tapped properly. If I would have continued it would have ruined my sprinkler head. It was not a question of lining them up, the Yard butler threads were bad.Since I have the tools and knowledge of threading  and tapping pipe, I re-did the Yard butler threads and it accepted the sprinkler and works fine. The problem is that most people who would buy this expect it to work without having to machine the unit to make it right.
I returned this product before I used it.  I have chain saws but thought this would be an easy grab-and-go item for smaller jobs.  But the thing requires oil every ten minutes of use.....and it takes a little doing to uncover the oil hole and do the job.It just seemed like an expensive toy that would be more trouble than cranking up the chain saw.
I purchased this for use in my basement, cutting wood for the fireplace. I liked the lower jaw idea to avoid digging the chainsaw into the floor.  Unfortunately, the design is extremely poor.  The upper "jaw" kickback cover actually hits the chain when closed.One of the illustrations in the manual shows this upper jaw open perpendicular - when opened this far, the rear of the jaw actually impacts the chain. The chain cuts a large oval from the rear of the cover.  When the jaw closes, it often does so at an off angle, actually hitting the chain, chewing up the upper jaw and dulling the chain.  The lower jaw also closes crooked about 50% of the time, causing the chain to cut into the lower jaw!A photo on the box shows a person obviously cutting above shoulder height - yet one of the first warnings in the manual is to never cut above shoulder height!  This is common sense, but who approves the marketing and packaging?!?The upper jaw has no "stop" except a small plastic flap. This broke off the third time I used the saw.If you run the saw with no wood in the "jaws," the jaws snap open and closed as the chain randomly impacts them!  NOT SAFE!When it cuts, it jams easily. Pieces of "thready" wood that a normal saw would kick out, get jammed up in the small gear that drives the chain. This has happened several times.  Cutting dry wood - no problem.  Cutting green wood, the "thready" pieces are a constant problem, necessitating the removal of the chain cover.The automatic oiler seldom works.  I have to manually oil the chain.  I have tried calling B&D;'s toll free customer support number. I can never get a hold of anyone.  I am regretful I purchased this shoddily designed item.  I will add some photos showing the problems.
I purchased these and then decided to run to Home Depot and see if they had them so I could use them sooner until my package arrived from Amazon. Home Depot had another brand called Revenge. I used the 4 from Revenge, each one smoked like they are supposed to. a few days later when the Giant Destroyers came, I needed to use those too and unfortunately, they didn't smoke, they shot a bright angry orange flame as if it was a blow torch. The GD's you have to thread the fuse into the bomb which I thought was dumb. I also found that the GD's smelled with stronger sulfur and couldn't wash off the smell from my hands. I don't know if they work or not as again they were blow torches and not smokers. Won't buy these again. Maybe i got a bad batch? won't take the chance again though.
This house may (or may not) leak, but it has a much more serious problem.  My new hose reel requires female fittings on both ends of the leader hose and this 10 foot leader has a male fitting on one end and a female on the other, so it's useless.  My new reel requires a female fitting for attachment to the reel and it of course requires a female fitting at the faucet end (as do all faucets).  Also, the product smells really bad, so I'm returning it to Amazon.
Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. The manor in which it stays open does not function properly at all. Real bad design!! There is no making this junk work. STAY AWAY. USE SOME OTHER TRAP!
Well, for starters I live in Wyoming where deer in the yard is a menace, and if you are trying to start a yard with deer around forget about it. For three years now we have tried to re-landscape and resurrect our yard. Our high desert location is a major hurdle, but as our neighbors lawns prove it can be done the greatest enemy is actually the deer.These rods were just one more thing we tried and failed with. To be fair the scent that they are treated with is acorn which would be a completely alien scent to the deer in this area although I was hoping that it might lure them anyway. The rods were ignored. Also, I believe that the rainstorm that has hit us in the last three days might have shorted out the rods some how, as birds are roosting on them.This was an interesting idea and I was looking forward to seeing how it would pan out. So far the only thing we've tried that has actually had any degree of success with has been straw. We covered the entire yard with straw to try and protect it for the winter and the deer actually seem to hate that. They won't even walk on it. Unfortunately when we raked it up for spring they're baaaack!
When I requested this, a key bit of information was not listed on the Amazon product page.  This info. is printed on the outside of the box & it says:Very Effective - Suburban Area.  Deer density is low.  Damage is mild, infrequent, unpredictable.Effective - Suburban Area.  Deer density is medium.  Damage is moderate, frequent, predictable.Effective (if repellent is moved as deer travel pattern changes) - Rural Residential Area.  Deer density is medium to high.  Damage is extensive, frequent, predictable.Not Effective (A fence is the best option) - Rural, Non-residential, Agricultural Areas.  Deer density is high.  Damages is extreme, frequent, unpredictable.I see this & say oh no!  I am in the "Not Effective" category aka "do not buy this item - go get a fence"  I go on line & view the page thinking it must be here & I missed it.  Nope.  The above info. is not provided.  Now you have it so you don't unknowingly make the same mistake I did.Because I already committed to the product I gave it a go following the instructions.  I chose a path the deer take past our young fruit trees.  I put the lures along the path.  They did nothing.  I moved them in a tighter range after seeing the deer eating the tops of our young trees.  Added more scent (you do this once a week) & the deer are out there everyday.  No matter how tightly I have placed these together to protect even a tiny area as if I was not in the country or putting them along the path of the deer as directed it just doesn't work. I did not place them far apart from each other even though we have a lot of land.  I still followed the directions by choosing small areas to cover.  I want that to be very clear.As far as the assembly goes, they were not as easy to put together as I thought.  Before you snicker, read.  Everything was very easy except trying to fit the middle pole into the bottom pole.  On all 3 poles I had extreme difficulty.  I thought I would end up breaking the little hard plastic tabs.  I followed the assembly directions exactly & because of this the ends were charged & scented - all 3.  I'm at my garden bench with charged polls rolling around while I battle it out trying to get a seemingly simple task accomplished.  I grabbed a slender metal garden stake tried to keep the poll from rolling & discharging on the other polls or by the back of my arm hitting it while I tried to do 3 things with 2 hands, push in the tab, push the poll into the bottom & hold it still on the bench while not hurting myself.  I know it probably sounds pathetic but I really did have a heck of a time with the bottoms.  I would recommend putting on the bottoms first so you don't have to worry about the charged tops & then assemble the rest per the directions.  I think I would have had a much easier time if I did it that way.  For once, it would have been better NOT to follow the directions!At this point after weeks of using these I'm not even sure what to do with them.  I guess I could move them yet again, but I just don't see the point. They are still out with the few fruit trees & they are scented with lure, but why?  They just don't do a thing.
I was hoping to use this in the non-fenced part of our yard, since that is where the deer shred our flowers.Be warned, if a bird alights on this, they will get a shock. If a fox or dog sniffs it, they too will get a shock.Not to mention children, and since we don't have a fence in the front, children do cut through out yard.So, maybe if you live out in the country this would be useful.  But if you live in the city and you don't have a fence and there are children around...
**** Revised Review as of 6/16/11 ****I originally gave this product two stars and said it was "ineffective". I am revising this to, "causes more deer damage". It actually increased the number of deer visits to our yard, which is NOT a cottage in the forest (suburbia as noted below). After giving it two weeks, my family begged me to please remove the "repellents" because they were bringing too many deer into the yard. My son erected a more effective measure (metal wire fence) and this seemed to do the job for about the same amount of money. Bottom line, I tossed these worthless (actually, harmful) units into the garbage can after removing the batteries. Avoid them unless you want more deer. If you do want more deer, it's cheaper to go to the hunting supply store and buy the acorn scented deer attracter, soak a piece of cotton with it and leave it on a stick or something. It works about the same as these things, and it will be much less expensive.**** End of Revision ****We live in a suburban area  in California's "Silicon Valley" with paved streets, curbs, lawns, gardens and ... deer!!! Out plants are eaten year-round by deer. They come down out of the hills where they live and trot down the paved roads a mile or so down to our home. We've tried a lot of methods to either protect the plants (fences, wires, predator scent, etc.) with mixed results. So, when I had a chance to try out this new "Electronic Deer Repellent" my hopes were up for a while.The term "repellent" is somewhat misleading. these stakes are supposed to work (they did NOT work for me) by using a deer attracting scent (acorn is the one that comes with the set) to bring deer in contact with the wires on the top of the stake. The wires are charged up by two AA batteries much as an electric fly swatter, if you have seen or used one of those. The deer are supposed to be shocked when they put their nose on the wires as they attempt to get to the source of the acorn smell. So, the deer can't be "repelled" until they are "attracted". The theory is understandable, but our results show it is seriously flawed in practice.In order to save your reading of the rest of this review, let me say this product had no positive effect at all on our deer issues. In fact, it may have worked to attract more deer!Details:1. Packaging: the product comes in a compact cardboard container that has three of the units. They require a modest amount of assembly. My set came with the requisite two AA batteries for each stake, but then this was a set for review. I don't know if the commercial product has the same. The box is about 19" x 4" x 4", which means it is easy to ship. The packaging seemed adequate to protect the goods, but not frustrating to open.2. Assembly: I asked my 14 year old daughter to assemble the units. She did so with relative ease. The instructions and tasks to be done are simple. The units come in three main pieces (spike, lower shaft, upper shaft with the power head), plus the two batteries. She had a minor struggle getting some of the plastic lock buttons to engage with the holes in the metal shaft, but it was not epic. Overall, it took less than ten minutes for her to finish. We will upload the video later this week.3. Activation: The most difficult part of the use of these "repellent" stakes is to add the bait. You must stuff some loose cotton into holes in the top of the stakes and then add some drops of deer-attracting scent (the kit comes with acorn scent). Inserting the cotton requires you to have a small stick, flat blade screwdriver, or similar to poke the cotton into its place. Then, you add drops of scent. The scent must be re-applied every few days.4. Quick test: since our family has used electronic fly swatters for a few years, we thought this product may have some possibility of success. So, after putting it all together we tried to shock ourselves with the wires - which is against all the instructions and warnings provided by Havahart - and felt very little shock. Very, very little. As in, not enough to bother us at all - less than you'd get from the door knob in your home after walking across the wool carpet. In our opinion, probably not enough to worry Mr. Deer.5. Testing: the instructions claim 1100 sq ft coverage and we followed them to the letter.  Our results were that MORE deer seemed to visit that part of the garden and that more deer returned later. We are giving it a few days just in case.Bottom line: it's a crock!
I think I ended up purchasing this due to the wonderful color choices.  I chose Yellow, its super easy to see in the grass.  That's where my positive review of this product ends.  It never worked correctly from the start.  All functions worked great, except the soaker.  It sort of just squishes water out of a little bit of all of the other functions and around the edge... Comparing it to any hose nozzle I've used in the past this isn't how the soaker function is designed to work.  It wasn't hardly worth my effort to send it back.  The other (and more important to me) functions worked so I just dealt with it.  I have now had it for right about two months and I realized the little metal piece that holds the on/off grab bar on the "on" position is missing.  Now THAT was a function I deem essential.  I used it all the time.  I think two months is a little bit short to fall apart!  Its possible that I got a bad apple, but I wouldn't buy the identical model to replace it.  I'll try something else.
This nozzle seemed to be well made and it worked great for a few weeks.After about 2 months of occasional use (maybe used it 4-5 times during that time), the whole nozzle started to leak water everywhere. Another reviewer mentioned that the internal components of this nozzle are made from cheap plastic and will break easily from regular use, and it seems they were right. No pressure at all on the trigger and there is water going everywhere. I just turn on the hose and immediately this nozzle starts leaking water.Don't waste your money, get something better.
For two days, I've giggled with glee upon seeing the unit's flashing red light of SUCCESS. That was until I kept coming up EMPTY and disappointed the bugger got a free meal. I've reset and refilled with a few dog kibble about 10 times and zapped NOTHING! I've been dry toweling the plates after every 3 entry and departures to avoid dirty build up that could impede the powerful, much desired RAT DEATH RAY.After attempting to access the Ratzpper.com website which is UNAVAILABLE, I called the 1888-DEAD-RAT several hours ago without a callback. Now those furry critters are catching a break until I get sturdy traps and toxic waste disposal gloves. I HATE mice, rats & most icky rodents and have no plans to continue running a fine dining establishment for them.This contraption is too blankity-blank expensive to be a bust. In case you haven't guessed it, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this thing!PS CALL Amazon Customer Service if purchased through them for a refund.UPDATE 1/22/2013A smart and pleasant Technical Support person from Raticator called with helpful hints. Having a moist cloth/paper towel leading to the front of the Ratzapper acts as a WELCOME MAT to a "shocking experience" when the critter makes contact with the metal plates inside. The Raticator company provides support temporarily for Ratzapper which is no longer produced. With that in mind, you need to consider that when getting a Ratzapper. Getting a refund and finding a consistently working pest eliminator is my goal.
I have 12 bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard. A lot of the bird food falls to the ground. This works well in feeding large birds that are too big to perch on the feeders. It also attracts many squirrels. I have separate feeders for squirrels but they are not satisfied with just their feeders and gobble up the bird seed as well which leaves very little for the big birds. I sprayed Deer Off around the bottom areas of the bird feeder poles in the hopes that squirrels would be repelled. After the Deer Off had dried the squirrels returned in full force to their old stomping grounds. I swear I could hear them giggling at me.This product should be labeled "Rip Off" based on its cost and lack of performance.
Perhaps the squirrels in my yard have developed a fondness for "putrescent egg" or find the allure of bird seed and budding leaves offsets the supposed repellent tastes and odor of "Deer Off." I've followed the direction, applied this product twice to the same plants, shrubs, and area. I coated the bird feeders and ground around them with Deer Off, and I also liberally applied it to the aerial access points via tree limbs and trunks, bushes, even stairs.The squirrels remain undeterred. They continue raiding the raised beds, climbing to the bird feeders, and generally seem unperturbed. If they were wearing clothes pins on their noses or had tiny gas masks, then that would be one thing. So I still have to dispatch the Aussies to chase the squirrels when I catch the varmints in the act.This repellent does work during the time I am actually spraying it on stuff to the point it coats surfaces and drips to the surrounding ground. I think, however, that my presence may be the deterrent during those moments of respite from the rodents' continual engorgement.
I got this to put on vegetable plants that were being decimated by squirrels. When I read the instructions it said to not apply it to any plants that produced edible foods, that it was not safe on human food. As that was the point for this product, which is kind of marketed as a natural repellent (I was imagining it was wolf urine, or something) this is pretty much useless for me.
The squares are about 4x4 inches.  Animals just get tangled in it.  Birds can fly right through it.  It is an AWFUL product.  Look for &#34;deer&#34; netting at your local feed or hardware store that is made from fish netting type material.  Waste of money.
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily "Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles. The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. They replied that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders. They also explicitly stated that they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder. Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it. This feeder has many great properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives (of which there are many) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so.
Well, it worked for a little over a year. I used the trimmer twice a month with no issues.I noticed the blade was getting worn down and quite dull. Changing the blade proved to be the downfall of the trimmer.To change the blade you insert a screwdriver in the slot behind the blade to lock the hub. The metal around this hub is very cheap pot metal. The metal hub broke apart in 7 pieces when trying to remove the blade nut.I hope everyone has better luck than me, but I won't buy another one.I'm kinda miffed that this trimmer only lasted 13 months. They shouldn't be disposable.
Tried this for a Month with no results. The unit no has moisture and corrosion and has died. I waisted money on this one. I swabbed the plates to keep them clean and kept the peanut butter away from them. Too bad I liked the idea but it's back to the old Victor 'finger whapping' old fashioned trap.
I've used every mouse trap on the market over the past 20 years, so I have a pretty good perspective on which ones are most effective (at least for New England mice).I tried this electronic trap in a an attic where several other types of traps are also installed and catching mice.  The electronic trap never caught a single mouse.  Eventually the batteries died.  Between the zero success rate, and the need to feed it batteries, I put this model at the bottom of the list of all the different types of traps I've tried.The old fashioned snap traps are the cheapest and most effective traps.  Unfortunately, they also come with significant drawbacks:  They're unpleasant to deal with after you've caught a mouse, you can't use them where children or pets might find them, and they're a little tricky to set.  Glue traps have similar pros and cons, and they have the further disadvantage of seeming inhumane (even if you don't have an emotional attachment to mice).The best trap I've found, by far, is the Victor "Tin Cat" model.  It's a metal box with one-way trap doors.  Mice seem to find it irresistible, and it can catch several mice in one night (in fact, it's almost as if the first mouse in the trap attract others).  The biggest downside is that it's a "live catch" trap, so you have to check it every day and then take it far away from the house to release the mice.
In order to unlock the pump handle you have to turn the handle the same direction as you&#8217;d turn it to open the lid thus releasing any air still sealed in the reservoir and misting your hands with the chemical in the reservoir.  So, once you have the pump handle unlocked you have to wedge your fingers down onto the collar and twist it to re-seal the lid.  Then you pump it up, press the handle back down and lock it back in place.  You have to go through this process every time you want to pump the reservoir back up.  I returned this item the same day I opened it.
This is a certifiable piece of junk. It lacks sufficient power to cut anything.  Worx has a similiar product with a decent battery. I replaced my B & D with the Worx and it does a better job.
We've had many trimmers over the years. These by far are the worst we've ever had.The problem is the design of both the grass shears and the mini hedge shears.  They do not cut anything. They are dull and set too far apart to effectively cut anything.Plus for a 7.2 volt, which should be very powerful and have a long life battery this machine fails.I usually love Black and Decker items, but these were returned after 10 minutes of attempted use.
Unbelievable expense when adding in green house expenses for such a poor yield.  Very disappointed in the way all has gone so far ........
This is a great little feeder.  Sticks very well to the window and doesn't get poopy (let's not talk about the window sill beneath) and holds a pretty decent amount of seed.  My acrobatic squirrels can leap onto it when I forget to throw out enough critter food to appease them and after at least 3 years of doing so, they finally broke it.  So today I'm ordering another one.  Nothing fancy here, just a durable and fun bird feeder.Updated 5/29/2013: the replacement I bought has a quality control problem with the suction cup portion that holds the feeder to the window (kinda important).  One of the suction cups was noticeably thin and seemed to have a hard time holding onto the glass.  Turns out (after cleaning the glass multiple times, moistening the cup or not moistening it) that it just won't hold onto the glass for more than, say, 30 minutes.  This is without any squirrel attacks.  It just falls away.  So half the support for the thing is just not there and shortly after you place it, it will sag to one side hanging on the one good cup and look really, really sharp (not).  Oh well, at least I got one working suction cup instead of none.Yes, this is a very inexpensive item but it's not a high-tech or complex item to get right either.  It's meant to hang onto a window.  If it can't properly do that, there's a problem.  This is likely a sample defect but it should never have gotten to the end user in this condition.Fortunately the remains of my old one were still in the trash bin and I retrieved the old window attachment part, which still works fine, so I'm good for now.  Glad the trash pickup wasn't a day sooner or this thing would have ended up in the bin the following week.
I've never heard of the company that's selling this.  And I'm glad, because when products like this, they'll be out of business VERY soon.I'm not going to detail every problem with this thing, but perhaps enumerate a few:1.  The stain is applied completely unevenly.  Some pieces are much darker, and there are run/splotch marks all over.2.  There is no protective material around anything in the box.  This leads to problems later in the life of the bench:a.  There are numerous spots all over that have had their stain rubbed nearly completely off.b.  A couple people come with pegs in them:  all but two come broken.c.  A long piece that appears to be provided for additional stability:  broken in the box (no visible damage to the box.)3.  The top wood grain in the picture looks nothing like what I have.  It's just more of the same "stain" glopped all over.4.  The wood pieces, especially the center support piece, doesn't line up correctly.  It's about an 1/4 of an inch too short.5.  Want to call the company to ask for spare pieces or warranty info?  Too bad for you:  there is no contact information anywhere, save for the outside of the box - the same place that has this product incorrectly labeled "OUTER DOOR BENCH."  The correct label:  a bunch of broken scrap wood.The only redeeming factor of this entire piece of garbage is that the instructions aren't confusing because of a bad translation:  there are a total of 4 words, and some weird picture/diagrams that aren't entirely accurate for putting this thing together.Don't waste your money on this.  It's absolutely horrible.  If you happen to get lucky and they figure out that padding small pieces during shipment is a good idea - and hire some QA for other aspects, it's still not a very good product:  most build-it-yourself pieces, when you screw them together, have the metal hardware generally hidden from view.  Not this gem:  the "official" pictures here appear to be some cheap 3D renderings and not an actual product picture; you can see screws in the legs and across the top ridge in the real thing.A bad design for a bench from a company that likely has no quality assurance.  Do you really want to waste your money on it?
I assembled this bench  right after it was delivered.  I expect MUCH MUCH better quality for the price of this bench!  The directions are bit confusing because the wooden parts are labeled A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, etc and so  is the hardware .It is not very  big, you could fit two people but it would be tight.The quality is poor. There are all kinds of marks, places where the finish was gone do to damage.  There were a couple of places where big chunks of wood  were missing but they  put the finish right over these areas.The finish is very splotchy with areas/spots that are a different color  than the finish. Many scratches, digs, rough areas on the wood. It looks like they may have used  a wood filler in some areas and instead of sanding those areas down and staining to match the wood they just put the finish over these areas, but it did not adhere and the wood filler comes off.It looks like they  used odd pieces of wood, (pieces maybe leftover from other projects that they didn't want to waste), or collected leftover wood from  a lumber yard, I do not know . I do know this bench is poor quality  and I question how well it would stand up to the elements.  I think I will sand it a bit and use some marine grade polyurethane on it .It might work better as a plant stand! or instead of a fire pit bench you could use it to burn in the fire pit!!I took several photos but you can only  do a video on here . I would never recommend this bench to anyone. Way over priced for the quality and construction.
I got this product hoping it woud keep squirrels away from my bird feeders. I have six squirrel proof bird feeders. My squirrels, Mensa members all, have figured out how to overcome the "squirrel proofing" and eat the bird food until the feeders are completely empty. I placed generous amounts of Critter No-Ridder under each of my feeders. As soon as I walked away the squirrels were back and I could hear them giggling and winking at each other as they brushed away the No-Ridder whle giving me knowing glances. This is a genuinely useless product, at least as far as squirrels are concerned.
I did not have any success repelling rabbits with this product. I wish I had though, because I hate rabbits and they're ruining my lawn.I had much better luck using this product:Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered SprayerGood luck!
I I have a skunk that has taken up residence under my sidewalk. I tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating. It just kept digging. I covered its entrance with bricks, it just pushed them aside.Then I found this Cridder Ridder, which seems like just what i needed. I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it's own scent...The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced!This may work with deer, but apparently not skunks!
I have a severe squirrel problem around my house. The chew the cable line outside, they have even been in the house one year. I also have a large chipmunk population that creates other issues as well. I thought, hoped, prayed that this would work. It didn't. They are still all over. Don't waste your money folks. I suspect I'll have to start trapping them and "re-homing."
Either I got a bad batch or this doesn't work. I have some young seedlings I've been trying to protect from being dug up by armadillos and dogs. The dogs just keep marking the spot and the armadillos dig right through it. Totally ineffective for me.
To test this product, i sprinkled a layer onto an area of my yard that one of my cats has taken to using as his private litter box. It's bare dirt, dry, sheltered from the wind.I used about half of the package, which claims to cover 300 square feet, on this area that's approximately 75 square feet. I didn't intend to overdose it so badly, but it's very hard to estimate how much you're shaking out over what square footage. (In case you don't feel like doing the math, that means i used about twice as much per square foot as the packaging says is necessary.)Day 1: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, sniffed around, and meandered off. I didn't see him set foot in that space all day.Day 2: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, dug a hole, and did his business.So even at double strength, this product deterred a housecat for all of approximately one day. One windless, rainless day. That hardly seems like something worth spending money on.And speaking of money, you're paying for something that is, by weight, less than 1% active ingredients. That means about 0.8 ounces of this product is important, and the rest is filler. And those active ingredients are basically black pepper and a little bit of something like cayenne pepper. You can buy a 2-3 ounce container of black pepper at any grocery store for a few dollars, so why pay more than $20 for this? Even if it worked, it would be a waste of money.
The product label says to apply at the rate of 1 lb. per 40 square feet. Impossible to measure the rate of application and when using the narrowest opening on the spout the 5 lbs. were gone in about 50 square feet (???). If it had some color to it you could a least see where you've been with it but as it is it blends in with the grass so well you can't tell. I used it to circle my peach trees to keep the varmints away and so far it appears to be helping but it will be very expensive to have to reapply every rain. I think I will look for a cheaper alternative or I will have the most expensive peaches in the country.This is a follow up to my review. It has been about 4 days since I sprinkled the product around the base of the peach trees. It has not rained but today I was watching the squirrels running through the "protected" area without even noticing it as they continued stealing my peaches. So much for that idea!
Maybe my New Mexico critters are used to spicy food (this is the home of green chile after all) and the capsaicin and black pepper in this product just made them want to grab some chips and dig in.  I put this around 2 rose bushes that the rabbits and ground squirrels have been chewing on.The squirrels and rabbits happily snacked on my roses with this product applied liberally to the area around the rose bushes.  I watched them sitting on the product, eating my rose bushes.Perhaps they tested this on squirrels and rabbits who have no taste for chile.  Mine were yelling for me to throw out some tortilla chips.
This is the Chinese Fiskars product line. All their shovels are made there, and I have repeated problems with their D Handle shovels. The blade is not aligned properly with the handle. The handle is cocked at an angle so that it twists the wrist when using it. I have returned several shovels to Amazon, and now I give up. And, yes, it is not pre-sharpened. And, no, it came with no PVC sleeve. If Fiskars wants to cheapen their image with this poor quality, I will be thinking three times before I buy Fiskars in the future.
Fiskars 8-Inch Hatchet is very dangerous. You can cut off a limb or a protrusion from a hand if you don't know how to use this. The level of training it takes to competently instate yourself with the knowledge of "Hatchet chopping" is about 2 years.Most people pick this up for recreational use at the local fish pond or RV camp and meet disastrous results, which result in the trip to the local hospital ward. I can not endorse a Hatchet that is so flauntingly dangerous. If you need wood, you can buy it somewhere or hire a vagrant to cut it from a forest.I implore you, Do not use this!UPDATE:I've documented numerous cases where the use of the Hatchet has produced a variety of injuries, ranging from simple cuts to the loss of a limb.UPDATE #2:Certain counties in Louisiana have banned the Hatchet.UPDATE #3:Many films have glorified the use of Hatchets in murder complots.  Hatchet (2006), The Baby (1973), Hatchet for the Honeymoon (1970), Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet (2009), Deep Red/Hatchet Murders (1975), and Strait-Jacket (1964).  Hatchets should be outright banned.There is even some offensive American southern metal band formed in Florida called Molly Hatchet.This is a notable abuse of an already dangerous "tool".

I&#8217;ve got critter problems this year and moles tend to be a constant. And as a result I&#8217;m trying a few different things. My usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so I found myself checking out the ingredients. The main ingredient is bromethalin, a far cry from my inoffensive castor oil. I do want to drive them off the property, but what I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to ingest it.We do have other animals who trespass and I&#8217;m using other &#8220;stay away,&#8221; but natural methods. What I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to dig for this in hopes of a nice snack. Not that I like the presence of red squirrels or chipmunks when they invade my home or outbuildings, but don&#8217;t want to use this very toxic poison. Think I&#8217;ll take a pass on this one.
Apparently someone tipped off my mole that these strange colored fake worms may not be healthy to eat. My mole runs around happy as a lark and would not touch this fake worm with a ten foot pole. I will have to try a different method to get rid of this unwelcome guest because the fake worm does not do the job.
All I can say is that the 5 people that reviewed this product MUST work for "Tomcat" cause these little "worms" are as much of a joke as every other mole bait out there.  I have used 5 boxes of these (yes, literally 5 boxes) and I have had NO success whatsoever.  Granted, I must be a fool for spending over $100 on one product, but I have tried everything else and was desperate.  Don't waste your money.  Not sure what else to tell you to try though, outside of making sure that your yard doesn't have grubworms.
Not sure these work, I bought to boxes and still have moles.  If it killed any I can't tell.  To expensive as well.
I have alot, alot, alot of moles in my yard.  Or are they voles?  I'm not sure.  I find little holes everywhere, and I find big mounds everywhere.  Maybe mine are hybrid mole-voles.  Whatever they are, they do not like Tomcat worms.  Never even touched them.
Not sure if I got a bum trap or what, but I have a real hard time getting my trap to set.  I have other, smaller mouse traps and have no problem setting them, but I just can't get this one to reliably catch.  It ends up being really stressful trying to set it. Not sure if mine is just defective.
I bought some of these Tomcat brand at Lowe's - which look the same as the Victor brand.Little did I know that the spring/catch don't work as well. They are more difficult to set, & so far, the bait is eaten but the trap doesn't spring (on all 3 units). The Victor brand works much better.
We get mice every winter. We've tried plugging holes, sticking around peppermint and mothballs, and we have mice. We bought these traps, put peanut butter on them. The mice ate the peanut butter, the traps did not spring. They are total junk and we went back to Victor. There was a reason these were the only ones left on the store shelf when went to buy them.Jim said the problem is when it's set the platform is high and it seems that a mouse would have problems setting it off, the trigger is not sensitive.
So far, I appear to have only one mouse and I thought getting these traps through Vine would solve the problem.  It hasn't yet using sll four for more than a week.  I practically expect a thank you note from the mouse for setting the bait out every night.  Since I got these for free through Vine, I do wish I could give a better review.
Dont waste your money on on this. Use rock wool instead. I called the company asking what kinds foam is in their kits and they wouldn't tell me they described it as bio degradable special foam - so I called a couple of foam companies asking questions and experimented a bit. What worked best for me and is drastically cheaper is rock wool instead.
I purchased one of these plastic rain birds about a year ago and was very pleased. It does actually work better than the brass rain birds. So now I wanted to order some more and was pleased to see the price had dropped by a couple of bucks. So I ordered 4 more but low and behold these are not the same and of course not as good. My well is set at 70 pds. and with a 3/4 pipe and one sprinkler attached I can only get 28 ft. coverage max and there are dry spots that it does not cover. All four are the same. Shame on rain bird, they are ruining there reputation. I would gladly have paid the extra couple of bucks to get the same as I had before. They seem to have the same model number as the old one too.
This powder does not work at all. I followed the instructions meticulously and it seems that ants and spiders are laughing at my face!I assumed it would take a couple of days for the product to work so I waited. The ant "traffic" around my window did not diminish, no change whatsoever.I also tried this powder in a corner where we usually have spiders and they are happy as ever. So I had to go back to Raid spray (that does not fail).
With all the rave reviews I really expected this would work but it has not worked at all for me. I've been using it for over a month now both inside and outside. I put it along the baseboards in the kitchen because we live in the tropics and we get a lot of ants, spiders and roaches inside the house. I left it there for three weeks, its really ugly and messy but I was willing to put up with that if it worked. I never found the first dead bug just lots of live ones so I finally gave up after three weeks and cleaned it up. I went and got new Combat traps and I found 5 dead roaches the next day! I decided to try this on ants outside coming in up the outer wall into the window frame. Same thing, did not get rid of the ants, none of them and we have three kinds coming in. I tried it on carpenter ants living in the crotch of a tree, it did not kill them they simply moved to another spot. Did not work on Fire ants either they walked right through it and two weeks later I found them about three feet away in a new mound. I checked my doorway this morning after 6 applications in 5 weeks and the black ants were just walking over this powder without any issue, they didn't even move after all those applications! So what does this work on? Nothing. So far it has proven useless here, so based on my 5 weeks of using this I cannot recommend it. All it does is move the bugs not kill them.
Safer Brand Ant And Crawling Insect Killer, like any insect killer, is not that safe for humans and pets. It's main ingredient is Silicon Dioxide. Should you squeeze this super fine powder anywhere in your home- just remember breathing this dust, even in small quantities, over time can lead to silicosis, bronchitis or cancer. Children, the elderly or anyone with lung issues should avoid this completely. This fine dust becomes lodged in your lungs and continually irritates them, reducing your lung capacities. If you don't know anything about Silicon Dioxide, it's used for making glass fiber strands, among other things, and depletes water upon contact- thus drying out and killing the insects.I personally would never spray this super fine dust in my home, as who wants any health problems that could arise from silicon breathed into your lungs?  I'm sure it's safer outdoors, but I prefer those little metal ant discs that work well. The ants go inside, take the bait to the nest,  feast and die. I have found over the years that sealing up my home as best I can and dumping buckets of soapy water around the house works wonders. I never waste anything- after we wash the cars, the sudsy water gets dumped around the house. Soap, especially ammonia- makes bugs very ill. It won't kill them, but they'll find a better place to live after getting sick enough times. If bugs are a real problem, I'll use a liquid killer over a powder, as I can always wash my hands, but I can't wash out my lungs. When I read the label saying Avoid Breathing Dust and Wear A Suitable Dust Mask, I knew this product is not suitable for indoors and definitely not for me.
This product is unnecessary when competitive products from the same company exist -- such as the Tomcat 34532 Mole and Gopher Liquid Repellent, 32-Ounce.Tomcat's bait pellets need to be administered directly into the tunnels of the creatures. You need to be aware of the environmental impact it might have on birds, and the fact that it will be lethal to other animals, especially birds and pets. As if that wasn't enough, caution should be exercised when handling the pellets since they are extremely toxic and poisonous.Why attempt to kill the creatures when it can backfire and cause harm to the humans and pets and other wildlife, when a successful repellent solution exists?
I&#8217;ve got critter problems this year and moles tend to be a constant. And as a result I&#8217;m trying a few different things. My usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so I found myself checking out the ingredients. The main ingredient is zinc phosphide, a far cry from my inoffensive castor oil. I do want to drive them off the property, but what I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to ingest it.We do have other animals who trespass and I&#8217;m using other &#8220;stay away,&#8221; but natural methods.

Well, I bought two of these and used as directed, and the moles just continued to destroy my yard.  Save your $10 after shipping and get rid of your yard's grubworms.
At first I thought this product might be awesome -- the idea is that you find an active mole tunnel (the directions tell you how to determine that) then you use the pointy end to open a hole and then put some of the pellets into the tunnel so that the mole will eat it and die.However every time I used the product as instructed the moles never returned to that tunnel. I think this was for two reasons.First the test to find an active tunnel is to push said mounds done then check to see if they are back up the next day... the process of using the bottle's pointed end though also collapses part of the tunnel and if I were a mole and my tunnel had a collapsed section two days in a row, I'd find me a new tunnel (which is what they seemed to have done).Second the process of making said hole to pour the pellets into not only collapses the tunnel around it but actually blocks off the tunnel at that point.  Once more the moles just made a new tunnel.Very disappointing.
Wasted money. We bought a couple of these 10-12 years ago for $8 each and they were great tables! Haven't had to replace them until now as they do eventually degrade in the sun like all resin/plastics do.However, THE PICTURES SHOWN HERE ARE OF THE "OLD" MODEL!!! but what you get is a very cheap and flimsy newer model. The top of the old ones were smooth and of thicker plastic. The tops of these are so flimsy and thin you can see the ridges where the top is molded to the support brackets underneath.While it doesn't affect sturdiness (or lack thereof), the bottom supports shown do not extend beyond the legs. I mention this only to show you the difference between the "really great" tables and the newer "really cheap and flimsy" tables.STAY AWAY from these, especially if you're thinking you are getting the same quality tables as they used to be. These are nothing more than a cheap knock-off version of those old, very good tables - very sad. We're so disappointed. Considering these were $10 MORE than the old ones, I was really hoping to get the same quality stuff. Fooled us this time, won't fool us again. We're staying away from anything with this brand from now on.
SInce I have watched a mouse run right past a trap baited with this gel, I don't think it works particularly well. I am still doing better with the traps baited with good old fashioned peanut butter.
I put this in several traps in an area where I know rats are (my attic), but it didn't attract any rats. That's pretty much all there is to say.
This is more rant than review, so appreciate it for that, or not.Toro does not sell parts to fix these, nor for the previous 51598 model. The idea is to throw them away after a season or two (two in my case). This is not right and it is not appreciated at all and makes the device NOT RECOMMENDED even though it works well. I will check out a Sears blower because they have parts and nice parts diagrams. Maybe there are others.Mine was the usual smoking motor. Electrical motors have been around for a long time now and there is no excuse for making one that only lasts a few running hours. Simply just cheaply made junk. Don't blame the Mexicans who assembled it, they aren't responsible for the engineering or specifications and just put it together as well as anyone else could have.The CEO probably got a bonus for this. Let me do my little part to maybe prevent a couple of sales.This is disgusting and no amount of blowing power makes up for it if the company sucks.You have to wonder what other cute surprises this company has for you in their other products, even the big ticket stuff. You can assume this is an indication of what they chortle about around the boardroom table when they are passing out bonuses in a circle.Read all the reviews of those who have dealt with their service centers. There is a pattern there, one of essentially ripping off the customer and then treating them poorly. At least they should be gentle.I certainly suggest you keep looking and at least consider another brand.********************************* Update****************************I took the blower apart to see if I could fix this before I tossed it. The smoke was not coming from the switch as it appeared, and what others reported, but straight from the motor. I used light sandpaper to clean the armature and also the end of the brushes. It has since worked perfectly for many leaf-blowing sessions, even at full power. Maybe there was some sort of manufacturing debris or chemical on there that caused some sort of resistance or simply lit up. Anyway, not too hard and saves you some money and you don't have to throw it in the trash.
Ok, I purchased this Hose on July 22, 2013.  I received it on Saturday 24, 2013.  Is light and it looked like it would last.  I liked that it has Lifetime.  The hose was leaking and bulging by August 18, 2013.  I always made sure I empty it after each use.  It does get partial Sun, not all day nor does it get Sun on the entire hose at any given time since we have two backyard trees.  Amazon was great and when I called them on August 19, 2013 they immediately shipped a replacement.  I figured, all manufactured good can have a percentage of products with factory defect, no harm done.  The second Hose arrived on August 20, 2013.  On September 4, 2013 the second one exhibit the exact issue.  Called Amazon and they refunded my money.  I don't think two defective Hose in such a short time is a fluke and I'm tired of packing a hose to ship back every month.  I will now go back to doing research. In the mean time I have to water 14 planters,10sq feet of garden area with two, 2 gallon watering cans, let the fun begin. Last, I thought of contacting Gilmore but, if this were to continue I would be out around 5 bucks every month to ship the ends to Gilmour not to mention the hassle.
In my experience, it always takes a few days before for the birds start eating from the newly hung feeder, and this feeder was no exception.  It is the second feeder in my front  yard, the first being a Brome.  And so far, the birds still prefer the Brome to the No/No feeder.  The No/No feeder has very little rain protection for the seeds, as the mesh part, where the seeds are, is completely open.Also, if purchasing this feeder, it does not include a hook to hang it in a tree, just the handle on top of the feeder.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- changing rating from 4 stars to 1.  The seeds stay piled up in the middle of the feeder and do not slide down to the tray or sides without help.  So I finally removed it from the tree as I find it to much work to keep shaking the seeds down.  And I really dislike the fact of taunting birds with seeds just out of reach.
I was surprised when this arrived and it was only the metal support brackets.  From the original title, I was expecting a flower box with the adjustable brackets.  The directions included were useless to me, and the pictures weren't much help either.The completed project was a rather flimsy bracket that tips forward from a 4.5&#34; railing.I cannot imagine this bracket holding much weight.  Perhaps fake flowers, but not potting soil!
Despite being &#34;adjustable&#34;, there is no good way for me to mount this on the rail surrounding my deck.  (In case it matters: I have a 2-by-6 horizontal top rail, with a horizontal 2-by-4 rail centered below and parallel to it, and 5.5 inches separating the top of one from the top of the other.)The thin metal rack has adjustable brackets to fit a variety of top rails, but then there is no good way to stabilize it...it just hangs loosely on that top rail.  The rack includes an extra metal section that seems to be for stability, but my railing is such that it won't actually connect to it.  Probably with some extra pieces of wood, and maybe some tools to bend some of the metal on the holder, I could make it more stable, but I would rather not go to these lengths for a flower box holder.Without some stability, this can barely hold anything except the lightest of flower boxes.I think CobraCo has some quality products (I have a copper fire pit from them that I really like), but I don't care for this at all.
I was rather disappointed in the Bird Scare Tape.  Within two days I had birds trying to carry the tape off.  They would get it in their beak, then try and fly away.  It didn't provide much of a 'scare' to the birds.
Very disappointed in this product. Set it up according to instructions but I did not get a single moth!  I think that the pheromone lures were not strong enough and they just said forget it. Some of these "Safer" products are great for the environment but dont do the job well or at all.Pass on this-get a stronger scented trap system.
I read the other reviews and did not believe that so simple of a product could be so bad. This is a laughably bad product. It falls apart after one or two uses. If I owned a store I would be embarrased to sell it. If I manufactured it, Iwould do so under an assumed name.
I do not buy fancy bird food - sunflower seeds and generic seed and mealworms. I usually get it at the grocery store for around this price but with one snowstorm on top of another it was hard to get to the store so I ordered it from Amazon (I have Prime - thank Somebody). I have about 14 regular doves, several bluejays, a couple of pairs of cardinals, a small flock of starlings and innumerable junkos, sparrows and finches and one practically tame robin who gets the mealworms. Keep in mind, everything is still covered in snow, ice really, and they do not eat this.So this one star review is from my birds and who have given this feed The Bird.
This Victor Fly Magnet did NOT solve the FLY problem on our patio and throughout the back yard. In fact, we don't usually have a fly problem, but this trap brought them to our yard in huge hoards - some flies found their way into the trap - but most just hung around the patio, rushing inside every time we used the door. Finally got rid of the fly problem by getting rid of the Victor Fly Magnet! NOT recommended.
The short of it is that this trap was used for at least 2 months using peanut butter as bait and it did not catch a single mouse or rat.  I've read that others have had far more success, but it didn't work for us.The batteries are nearly impossible to get into the unit and there the switch does not tell you if the unit is on or off.  Because it's not clear whether or not the unit is powered up, it's potentially dangerous, as you could shock yourself.Because this unit did not work for us, I cannot recommend it.
UPDATE--After a few weeks, we hadn't caught anything, and the 4 C batteries were dead. Put in fresh batteries and tried it again. Two weeks later, the batteries are dead again, the food bait is gone, and I give up on this contraption. Great idea, but it just doesn't seem to work.Whether you live in the country, suburbs, or city, eventually you will be faced with a rodent problem. We've had issues in our crawl space. We first used cheap traps. Unfortunately, they were difficult to set and sometimes only maimed the poor critters. We then purchased a scary looking trap that did the job. However, it was so gross we ended up throwing out the trap and all.We are now using this device in the crawl space. We haven't caught anything yet, but we are sold on the idea that we don't ever have to touch the rat. Although expensive, this seems to be the best solution.
This pool rake is sorry quality and doesn't last.  It did not last even one pool season.  In fact it broke after 2 months of use.  The netting is OK but the plastic frame is weak and broke rendering the tool useless.  Don't waste your money!
I received the package late, the package was dumped upside down next to the door, and after refrigerating them for a day, i found the majority of them were dead. I would say under 100 actually survived to be released. Not very happy with this at all.After doing a little research (a little too late, but whatever, i found you can order them directly from High Sierra, which you can find online. Again, that is High ?@@#$# Sierra). Most of the distributors apparently purchase from them first, so why not avoid the middle man? I will be (no shipping costs either).
I hate to gripe about this purchase as I enjoyed releasing the few ladybugs that I did receive. Suffice it to say that I hand-released most of these little ladies and was done in under an hour. There were a number of ladybug corpses, but still only about 100 or so. I don't know what this company is doing when it comes to parceling out these bugs, but they need to find a new method.As for what the bugs did after they were released, well that isn't the company's fault. They do tend to wander off. Still, I keep seeing ladybugs near the release location and there were only about 100 of them to begin with. I feel like the few bugs hanging aroundI'd make a stink about being ripped off if I thought 10 bucks was worth the aggro. Still, this is definitely a case of "buyer beware". Go try your local nursery for bugs if you need them, that way you'll be able to see what you're getting before you shell out the money.
I had my first chance to try this today, killing a wasp that got in the house. A bit of delicate task, considering we're allergic. The Executioner failed miserably and definitely didn't live up to its name. It didn't even stun or slow down the little bugger, let alone injure or kill it, despite multiple direct hits. In the end, a rolled up magazine combined with a squish under a shoe took care of the wasp.But further investigation showed the "Executioner" to be totally useless. I tentatively touched it myself and felt nothing. Full hand on the metal; still nothing. Changed batteries. Again, nothing. The only thing this does, as far as a I can tell, is turn on a little red light in the handle to make you think it's working. Big, fat waste of money.
We have had this tiler for a few years now and since we were moving, just stored it until we were moved.  So, moving aside, we drug this thing out and guess what? It worked for a little bit then quit.  It wouldn't restart, and then the motor started smoking!  What a ridiculous machine!  SO wish I would have saved the money on this thing and bought the other tiller that's the Number 1 seller on amazon.  This thing is a total piece of junk!  And, I'm now out the $330 I paid for it.  Brother!
We purchased two of these. We were excited to get them quickly and we put them together with no problems. We knew they weren't going to be the highest quality, but we thought they would do the job. We put a total of 6 small plants (herbs and vegetable seedlings) split between the 2 greenhouses. We also put things like our small shovel, empty watering can, and bag of soil on the bottom shelves. There is no recommended maximum weight listed on the product listing, the box, or the directions. We figured we should be okay since we had much less than what is pictured on the box and also on the product listing here.Not even 24 hours after setting these up both crashed to the ground. Pots broke, plants were tossed upside down, and everything was a mess. It was difficult to get everything out safely since the plastic was zipped up and the opening was facing the ground. Once we got everything out, we noticed the plastic supports on both of our greenhouses broke. They could not hold the weight. That is unfortunate considering there wasn't that much sitting in the greenhouse to begin with.We will definitely be returning both of these.I wouldn't bother wasting your money on this. We've decided to spend a little more and get a heavy duty rack like this one:Seville Classics SHE18487 18-Inch by 48-Inch by 72-Inch Shelving System with Wheels, Chromeand then wrap heavy duty plastic around the back and sides. For the front, we are going to attach a second piece of plastic with velcro so it is removable. Same effect, but at least we can be certain it won't come crashing down.--In case this review doesn't scare you away and you are still curious about the dimensions between the shelves:-There is 12.5" between each shelf.-The top shelf has 20.5" of space at it's highest point.If you are having trouble keeping the wire shelves flat across the supports, you can bend them slightly downward so they fit better. This stopped ours from moving around so much....well before they came crashing down. :/
I bot this hoping it would protect my feeder but the squirrels got right around it.  At first they would fall off, but then they eventually figured it out.  Also, in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off.  Hook is lost in the snow, had to buy a new one at hardware store.  Can not recommend this.  Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40, see if that works.  Otherwise it is on to another feeder.
This bird feeder is a total piece of crap.  It's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together.  Two of the flimsy connection prongs immediately broke upon insertion.  I doubt the product cost 25 cents to make.  Avoid this poorly made feeder.
I have been using this for over a year in order to really give it a chance.  I've used it on various potted plants as well as plants in the garden.  I really wanted this stuff to work but I wanted to be objective.  I only used it on half of my plants of each variety to see if there would be a difference.  Soil, fertilisers, care, light etc were all the same but only half got the "Superthrive".  ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE.  It didn't seem to harm the plants but also made ZERO difference to growth, flowering, size or taste.  Obviously some people love this stuff but I can't see why...placebo effect?  If it was as spectacular as it claims, then why wouldn't it be a standard product for all commercial growers?  Bottom line for them is money and obviously they see this as a waste...as do I.
This review applies to ALL Miracle-Gro brand fertilizer-feeders, includingMiracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden FeederMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed Starter KitMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Feeding SystemandMiracle-Gro 100511 LiquaFeed Advance Starter KitI totally agree with ALL of you who have posted on the "rip-off" index of these products. My "other half" bought these one of each type at local home improvement warehouse on two different occasions thinking how easy it would be to use. She did not realize how EXPENSIVE it would be for the LiquaFeed Kits, it just looked EASY. Not only are the refill cartridges costly, the things LEAK, don't dispense evenly and is basically garbage! (Maybe she has learned on 2nd time around, then again ... )Miracle-Gro bulk granular water soluble fertilizers of various types are great! I have never burned any plants with them (see note below) and have healthy excellent looking flowers, plants and few veggies. But Miracle-Gro equipment is JUNK, including this item and Miracle Gro Lawn & Garden Feeder Miracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden Feeder.  They are made of BRITTLE plastic, as I stated LEAK, do not mix & dispense fertilizer well, and break easily.AVOID these products.( NOTE: I do apply in cool of morning or after sunset here in HOT central Texas, and after going around fertilizing ALL plants, come back and "mist off" any fertilizer that may still be too concentrated on leaves and water plants. )
Squirrels learned in a few days how to get around this.  I wasted my money but you don't have to.
Didn't like it, returned it, it didn't work at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal wire cages, and this caught nothing.  Sorry, charlie--useless to me.
The lid will not stay snapped shut, thus the suction needed to draw the water into the plant is not present.  Could not get it to deliver water to the planter.
I followed the instructions that accompanied this loser and the results were poor. The lid on the tank will not stay closed. I had planned to use this outside but without the lid staying shut this would be an excellent hangout for mosquitos so I left it outside for only about a week and a half. I dropped (pushed would be a better word) the "hose" through the hole in the lid. Instructions say insert it until the tip reaches the bottom. I pushed the entire "hose" through the hole and it never reached the bottom but remained suspended in the water about two thirds of the way down. The tank hangs on the side of the pot all lopsided and really looks as tacky as all getout. No water ever transferred from the tank to the flower pot during the week or so that I left it outside.Not sure where this was made although there is a USA address on the cardboard but it does not say "manufactured in". However I would not blame any manufacturer for not wanting to admit to making this butt-ugly and worthless recycling candidate.There has to be a much better offering of plant watering products than this. Look elsewhere for something that has at least a smidgeon of quality which this does not. Stay away from this - far, far away.
2nd UPDATE:The sensor was empty today. I thought I made a mistake the first time this happened. Since this has happened three times & the two sensors I've been using for years still have water in them, there must be something wrong with the Plant Sitter. I noticed that the Plant Sitter feeding tube is smaller in diameter than the sensors I've used for years. Maybe that's the problem. I don't know for sure, all I know is that the Plant Sitter sensor is not siphoning water like it should be.My rating went from 3 stars to 1 star.UPDATE:After setting this system up using 3 sensors (one that came with the plant sitter & two I previously owned), I thought everything was working normally. After a few days I checked each sensor again to be sure each was full of water. I was surprised that the sensor that came with the Plant Sitter was empty again. The other 2 sensors were full of water - like they're supposed to be. I soaked the empty sensor for 15 minutes then re-filled it with water. I will check in a few days to see if it is empty again. If so, I will update my review & reduce the star rating.~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEWI've used self-watering probesSelf-Watering Probes - Package of 5for indoor & outdoor plants successfully for many years. I use gallon milk containers as the water reservoir.  The CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter works the same way way as the ceramic probes I used in the past & it comes with its own 1 quart reservoir.To use self-watering ceramic sensors:~Remove cap~SOAK the ceramic cone/probe  10-15 minutes in water (Cobra forgot to add this important step to its product label instructions)~Fill the cone/sensor ALL the way to the top then recap it.~Push the ceramic sensor into the soil. I always make sure the ceramic portion is completely pushed into the soil.~Fill the reservoir with water.  To feed  your plants, add a little liquid fertilizer to the water.~Drop the feeding tube into the water reservoir making  sure it rests on the bottom. (For the Cobra Plant Sitter, drop the end of the tube through the center hole on the reservoir's lid)~Cover the top of the reservoir so that the water won't evaporate & so mosquitoes won't get in if you're using it outside. (The Plant Sitter has a lid, but the lid doesn't snap closed. To keep the lid closed, I put a rubber band around each side of the reservoir. If I was using the Plant Sitter outside, I would cover the center hole & the feeding tube with aluminum foil)~IMPORTANT: Always set your Plant Sitter up a week before you leave to be sure it's working properly. (I noticed that the water level in the reservoir hadn't changed in a week. I pulled the ceramic sensor out, removed the cap & saw the cone was completely empty...that's why it wasn't working. I filled it back up, put the cap back on, pushed the sensor back into the soil; by the end of the day, the reservoir's water level was going down)...see my UPDATEA few tips:~Larger plants will need at least two ceramic probes/sensors.~Depending on type, size & season, a plant will require from 8 ounces to 32 ounces of water weekly. I find that for my plant in a 6" pot, the Plant Sitter's one quart reservoir will water it for approximately 2 weeks.~If you rely on the Plant Sitter to always water your plants, you should water the plant from the top once a month.~The level of the water in the reservoir should be below the cap on the ceramic sensor. Raising the reservoir increases the flow rate; lowering it reduces the flow.~If the reservoir runs out of water, you need to refill it & you will also need to refill the ceramic sensor.The Plant Sitter's reservoir is a nice translucent color, not flashy or showy, so it won't detract from your plant. It's too tall for some of my smaller indoor plants. So I sit it near the plant instead of hanging it on the pot.I added two more sensors & am using the Plant Sitter to water three plants at a time. The center hole is large enough for me to thread two feeding tubes through it, but I had to put the other tube under the lid; two rubber bands are holding the lid closed. I'm sure the reservoir will need to be filled  often, but the plants have been so thirsty lately that I haven't been watering them enough. I'm expecting happier plants by using the Plant Sitter.Amazon's product description is confusing to me. It mentions both a 1 quart reservoir & a 2 quart reservoir. I received a 1 quart reservoir & one ceramic sensor.Made in ChinaThis is a 4 star product, but I deducted 1 star because an important step was not included on the product's label instructions & the lid doesn't snap closed.~~~~~~~~
Although not a bad concept, and upon seeing it you think, "Why not?  I'll give it a try," this item works better in theory than in practice.You can't really rely on it to keep your plants alive.  I think another review said you had to siphon the thing first.  That kind of takes away the "automatic" idea.  Maybe my expectations of the product were a little too high, and my review sounds a bit harsh, but when I see automatic, I want something truly automatic.Not only that, the system is a real eye-sore.Maybe plant sitting technology is still in its infancy and hopefully it will improve in the future.  I'm glad to see other users were able to get something out of the product.  I wish CobraCo the best of luck and hope they can some day live up to my higher expectations.
This is supposed to be a hummingbird feeder, not a nectar fountain....... It IS big, and once assembled, it looks attractive. It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers, which kept popping out and flying onto the floor, but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive, looked very nice.Adding the cylinder, which I had thankfully  filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup, was an unwieldy process, But  I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place, and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers. Had it been dripping out from under ONE of the flowers I might have been more forgiving but ALL the flowers were leaking. Nuh Uh --  I just installed a new balcony rug and there is NO way I am going to hang that on my balcony.Like some of the other reviewers did, I will disassemble it, and GLUE the flowers on to see if THAT helps. If that doesn't work then this product is  waste of everyone's time.
I do love the size and the 6 ports to feed from but I can already see it is hard to open and fill and get closed right again so it doesn't leak. I don't really expect this to last more than this season. Don't get this size unless you have a lot of hummers coming because you should refill your feeder and clean it once a week so if you fill it full and don't have enough hummers to use it up there will be a lot of waste. If you don't need that much just fill it half full. You can always add more if needed but be sure to clean your feeder every time you put more syrup in it for them to drink.You really need to push firmly on each piece as you put the feeder flowers on and the center parts. If they aren't on right they will just fall off so you'll know if you did it right or not. The stand for the hummer feet are on securely because they have little cut outs for them to fit tightly before screwing them tight onto the feeder. Just take your time putting these features on so you don't break them.UPDATE: The little yellow centers in each flower that are snapped in independently are coming off. The Orioles keep playing with them and they are coming off even though I had them on securely. Now there is an opening large enough for any bird, fly, wasp, etc. to get into the juice. Not a good thing. When this is empty I won't use it again. Spend more and get a nice glass feeder, they are the best.
I've been a tomato gardener for 20 years now, and support means everything.  This "cage" might be good for a determinate tomato, but for an out of control, constantly growing indeterminate variety, especially with large fruits, this will be useless.First off, this item came ridiculously bubble wrapped, and was extremely frustrating to get undone.  I managed to break off 3 snaps, rendering 3 of the supports useless.  Is that my fault?  Yes, but in my defense, the bubble wrap was so tight and glued, and wasn't easy to open up.The stakes themselves are too short, 5' and "Strong steel core stakes" is laughable at best.  These "Strong steel core stakes" are the same stakes available at Home Depot, Lowes, or any local nursery, and while they're okay, "strong" is not a word I'd use to describe them.  You want strong, get rebar.I ended up putting these "Strong steel core stakes" around an obelisk that I am using for my cucumbers, which fit perfectly when I attached the 2 remaining rows of the supports together.
The materials that this Aerator was manufactured from, were worthless.  I took it out of the box, and went outside to stir my compost pile.  Two days ago, I had removed the sticks, which had mixed into the vines, leaves and such that were in the pile. This left me with about a foot of well degraded plant material, mixed with dirt, and random fine roots.  I started to jab the pointed  end into the pile. However, the wings which are suppose to fold down and then stir the pile, simply stayed up. I would pull them down manually, and when it was placed back into the pile, they'd immediately fold back up. &#34;At least the bottom tip is mixing up the mulch&#34; I thought to myself.  After about 15-20 minutes, I looked at the tip, which was bent to the side about 45 degrees. The cheap paint on the steel (?) had flaked off the tip too.Usually garden tools last a lifetime. In fact, I have garden tools I inherited from uncles long dead, so they are lasting TWO lifetimes.  Nevertheless I can accept if a garden tool only lasts a few decades.  Or at least lasts a few years.  But when you get a tool, and it only lasts a FEW MINUTES?  Perhaps the company changed the materials that they make the aerator from, or they changed the company that they subcontracted to mold the metal tip. If you look at other recent reviews, others have also encountered the tip bending over, or the wings that bend down so you can stir, not bending down.  I hope the company fixes this problem, because this seems to be a good tool for mixing the compost pile.  Unless you have a shovel.
Unfortunately I'm not able to recommend this product as it appears to have poor quality control. This arrived with a broken handle/hose bib despite no evidence of wear/tear to the box or packing. Basically unable to use in current condition and trying to find a replacement hose bib that fits to repair isn't worth the time or effort of driving across town with this thing in tow. AVOID.
I have two gardens, one off of each end of the house. They need a lot of watering. It's always been extra work adjusting the water flow from the hose. (Walking back and forth to the house each time). I tried the hose "Y's" which have a switch to adjust the flow at the garden, but they're on the ground, generally upside down and are hard to adjust since the levers are very small.The Bib Extender has been placed next to the garden with the hose attached. With the faucet on at the house, it is an easy and convenient way to adjust the water flow.  It is up a couple of feet and has a good faucet handle. The shaft which goes into the ground is very solid and the whole unit is simple. I did find that it is important to use a pliers to tighten the hose connection onto the Bib Extender to prevent leaks. I also find this true on the house faucets since the "rubber" seals are generally plastic, not rubber anymore. I have had the water on at the house for a few days and see no problem with leaking. I will just leave the water on at the house and use only the Bib Extender for turning on and off the water and making adjustments.As of May 24, 2014 the on/off handle broke off in just normal use. The product should not be purchased.
I have many styles of bird feeders all around my yard. This seemed like it would be a pretty addition; one that I thought would look lovely outside my window.  I loved the idea that it closed when something heavy landed on it. I have other feeders that do this so I thought that this would be made the same way and react to weight the same way as the others.It did NOT.  When anything heavier than a goldfinch landed on it it would close---and STAY that way.  At first I thought I just had very stupid birds - they would land on the feeder and then hop around like they were looking for a port they could eat out of.  But when I went out to see what was wrong, I saw their dilemma. They just couldn't find a port because the whole thing just closed and stayed closed.It was this way not matter how I adjusted the springs.I don't want my feathered friends to starve, so I will be taking this down right this minute.
I would have rated this feeder a "0" or - 1 star if available. I bought this feeder about 9 months ago and should have taken it back then. The birds liked it at first, then stopped feeding from it even though it was 3/4 full of seeds. When I took it down, I saw that the remaining 3/4 of the seed were wet and matted together in a moldy "brick". It took about one hour to "clean" it and clean up the mess in my kitchen. Neither the lid nor the base is removable for cleaning, so there's no way to remove and clean the seeds from half way down to the bottom. To prevent the squirrels getting the lid off, it's designed to pull up a little way and tilt to the side for adding seed.If you turn the feeder upside down to shake out the old seeds, the lid (spring mechanism) pops back in place. That doesn't really matter because the seeds are wet and compacted into a brick anyway. I had to push a 13" screwdriver into each port and try to loosen the seeds while running hot water through the top (cold water didn't work). I must have used 10 gallons or more of hot water and ran the garbage disposer the entire time I was attempting to clean this horrible "feeder". I bet it cost me $5 to clean the feeder.It's impossible to reach downward with a screwdriver to force the seeds loose, and you can't clean it because you can't get a brush in vertically. It's a HORRIBLE design. Once I flushed and poked most of the seeds out, I soaked the feeder in a big bucket of soapy water, then flushed it again. I still did not get out all the old moldy seeds.Since I could not get inside to dry it, I had to set the feeder on the floor near a heat register for THREE DAYS to dry it out. The birds left my yard and it took a couple weeks before they came back.After all that work, I decided that the wet seeds must have been a fluke -- perhaps the result of a heavy sideways rain or snow. So instead of returning the "feeder", I filled it again. Duh!! Within a week, the same thing happened. I took it down.It's been 9 months since I bought it, but I'm returning it to Lowe's tomorrow.This bird feeder is readily available for $19.99 at ANY big box store, yet online stores still try to sell it for much more. This feeder isn't worth 50 cents EXCEPT...for the fun of watching the squirrels try to get the seed. They cannot, and after less than a week, they gave up and went away. After that, I couldn't even use the feeder for fun.Buy a Brome feeder, and buy a 16-18" diameter clear dome to hang over the top. It protects the birds from the weather while they eat. Of all the feeders in my yard, birds prefer the one with the dome. 10" and 12" domes don't protect the birds or the ports.UPDATE:  I never complained to Woodstream Corp. about this feeder. However, Woodstream saw my review and a Customer Rep. sent me the nicest letter! She said "Your comments concerning the design and experience cleaning this model feeder have been shared with our product development team." I believe Woodstream genuinely cares about customers and making good products. To make up for my inconvenience with the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, Woodstream sent me a Perky-Pet 337 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder as a replacement. It has three tubes so I can use 3 different kinds of seeds, and the lid comes off by unscrewing a large knob on top. Much easier! I didn't like the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, but I LOVE Customer Service at Woodstream Corp.!! It's top notch--more than a 5-star rating. THANK YOU, Woodstream.
It's an interesting design but has a major flaw: The feeder tube is plastic and squirrels chewed through it in just a few weeks. Now the seed just pours out and the feeder useless.
When I germinate seeds in peat pots, I put the pots in cooking trays and keep some water in them which effectively becomes a self-watering container. The Jiffy pots held up well. These basically fell apart when I tried to plant the germinated plants.I would not use again.
I have used the peanut butter Suit cakes from this company with great success to the point the birds fought over it, HOWEVER this Suit DD-24 melt into a blob in 90 - 100 degree temperatures we have been having and the birds take one peck and leave it for seeds. Now I'm stuck with 11 more of these things.If my birds become active (I'll give it another 2 weeks) with this I'll update and make an edit but right now it's thumbs down and I should have ordered more of what worked before (peanut butter suit).
It appears to just randomly beep!Sweeping the same area gives different results very time. No volume control, so when it beeps its very annoying.I tried to locate some buried copper wires without success. They are buried 1 foot deep and this thing missed them and then beeped in other areas doing one pass but not the other. I even went over an area that had the clear line of where the ire was buried, and it didn't beep once.Yawn. Waste of time.
Before I start this review, I do need to preface it with the fact that I ordered this from the Warehouse deals section here in amazon.  It was used, so I don't know if that is a factor or not.That said, we had to return this saw.  It never did cut through anything at all.  The chain kept falling off, no matter how many times we put the thing back on, it just wouldn't stay on.  Even took it to our neighbor, who is quite the handyman to look at and well, his opinion of it - you really can't say those types of words here!  I suppose if we reordered it again, new this time, that it might be different.  I'm not taking a chance, however, and I'm ordering the McCulloch here on amazon instead.  We've had 50 years of success with their chainsaws and well, guess I should have ordered that one in the first place.My purpose for writing this review is a bit of a beware if you're ordering something like this from Amazon's warehouse deals.  They don't check them very well sometimes when someone returns them and you can really wind up with a "dud."  Something as dangerous as a chainsaw can be, that could be quite worrisome.  I've had other items from the warehouse that had mismatched parts and after I returned them, they put them back online for someone else to buy!  Brother!  Just be careful, sometimes you really get what you pay for, or don't, in this situation.
I really so wanted this to be a 5 star rating, but!I ordered this after the snows of last year to be ready for the new year snow.  I only needed it now because some neighborhood boys made me an offer I could not refuse and they shoveled me out the last snow.But the Mid Adlantic storm hit us hard in Jersey and I could not get any takers so I dug out my new machine.I bundled up with scarf and hat and I was ready.I was so excited to try my new toy.I pluged it in and nothing!!! Not even a whirrrr. Nothing.I changed outlets, a different cord still NOTHING!!I had to shovel what I have 'cause another one is coming tomorrow, urgh!I took it back to our local place I got it from and asked if they possibly had another, no.There were 5 standing in the corner, dare I ask? They all did not start and were going back I am not too angry, in fact I am going to try again since I believe it is a good product in general.If I hear anyone mention that granny (that is me) should not use this because it is heavy I will scream. They can come to my house and try out how heavy it is to shovel 2 feet of snow with a hand shovel.  I know I would have to shave the snow blah blah blah, but I know it would be a lot easier than what I just did.Don't even mention condos (been there done that) and nursing homes (will never do that), I can probably shovel faster and longer than any youngen'  :)If I get another one that works I hope I can up the rating, I am happy it works for most of you. Happy shoveling
Isn't the main feature of this gas can supposed to be that it cuts off automatically? Well, it does NOT do that and I am amazed at the rave reviews others have posted. Yes, it can be no-spill, but you have to cut the gas off manually. If you expect it to cut off automatically you will have gas everywhere. This is a deal-breaker for me and the source of my deep disappointment and disgust with this product.I followed the instructions and watched the videos on the manufacturer's site and the first time I tried to fill my edger's tank it overfilled and gushed all over and I had to quickly release the pushbutton to stop it.I tried again on my mower and it also never shut off and flowed over the sides of the tank. This gas can is a ridiculous waste of money.I bought three of these having blindly believed the good reviews, the videos on the manufacturer's site, and what seemed to me to be the soundness of the concept. Well, I now have some expensive gas cans that are no better than the traditional ones they were supposed to replace.I contacted the company and tried all their suggestions. These included making sure the cap is on super tight, making sure the spout is vertical down into the opening, and pushing the green button fully. Do those things and the gas is supposed to stop flowing when the tank is full. That would be great except that the gas continues to flow at an alarming rate as gasoline gushes everywhere. They do not shut off; they never shut off until the button is released.I have three of these silly over-hyped gas containers and truly wasted my money on them. If you are expecting them to shut off by themselves as advertised, you will be very disappointed, as I am.
These are great chairs, if you never take them outside, or let them get wet.Both of the ones I ordered rusted within three weeks (see pic posted in customer images), so I sent one back for a refund, and kept one.The reason I kept one is because I really do love the chairs, from the color, which is unique, and a perfect match for pool water, to the comfort, which is amazing.  REALLY comfortable, and I personally had no problems with the locking mechanism (it IS very cheap plastic, though, so I doubt it will last more than a couple years if that).BUT, the rust...big problem.  Obviously they didn't coat the hardware (screws and such), as these rust first.  Next the metal to metal contact areas of the chair rusted (they just spray the powder coating on, so this is just a poor spray job, since it IS possible to get this right).  This is a major problem since this is all along the frame, and immediately visible.Based on recent reviews vs. first reviews, I also believe Strathwood either changed manufacturers mid production, or the manufacturer themselves changed the process, or machinery...because the more recent reviews complain about rust quite often, but older reviews do not (and some of those even state they have left outdoors no problems).
I have reviewed a couple of other mouse traps (the green plastic Smart Mouse Trap & the Havahart 1020) which work perfectly - this trap sat in the same garage where I am catching a mouse per day with the other traps, and its caught nothing in months.  It is a novel idea that I appreciate as an engineer, but mice avoid it.
I want to start out saying that anyone that wants to save a mouse is borderline retarded.  They are disease carrying vermin on the bottom of the food chain.  When caught by a fox, cat or other predator, they are slowly torn apart live or chewed live.  Setting one loose in the woods thinking you are saving it will likely do one of two things.  1. Sentence it to a much more violent and cruel death.  2. Allow it to breed so you can have hundreds (yes, hundreds) more in its place.  And many of these will find their way into homes.I tried these traps along side much much cheaper glue traps and snap traps.  The glue traps and snap traps were effective.  Not one of these caught a gosh darned thing.  When placed adjacent to traps of other types, they never touched the bait on the door entrance and never went in, but were snapped or glued instead every time.The mice choose the death traps over and over in favor of these useless pieces of plastic junk.  And now that I have them, they will likely end up at a local dump for 50000 years before they break down.Nice.
Useless product--didn't work for me at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal cages and thought this would be a good alternative, but never caught one critter.  Sorry, charlie.
Sorry, but this did not rotate smoothly. It squeeked and chunked around at an uneven rate and just did not work on my relatively new Weber Genesis NG model. I called Weber and they said that each year the models change slightly, perhaps just a few centimeters which may prevent attachments from fitting correctly. The lady's final bit of information: &#34;Things aren't always perfect in the manufacturing process&#34;.  Many people have called attention to that ring &#34;handle&#34; at the end of the rotisserie. I too found it to be a terrible design flaw.You can't grab ahold of it to remove the rotisserie, it's very awkward, and very hot. Sadly, I had to this item.
Do not buy.  The thumb is offset at a angle that makes gripping impossible. I boought some welding gloves instead.
I ordered this to replace the basket on my Weber that had become rusted.Although it says it is the correct replacement part on the label it comes up short. Beware when ordering this product. Not sure if the mix up is on the manufacturing end or not.
This item was something I was anxious to get. But after receiving it I was a little disappointed.  Extremely small...smaller than expected.  the first time I used it, the handle jammed and when I tried to extend it the couple inches that it does extend, it was stuck. I dont like this item at all and would not recommend it. Go to the nearest hardware store and buy a small camping shovel. Does much better at 5 bucks or so.
This product gives me nightmares. Unlike the mostly successful Rat trap from Tomcat, this trap does not kill the mice but maims them instead. Whereas the rat snap trap would have an occasional rat that would get caught in with a paw instead of the entire body, this trap doesn't actually have enough power to kill the mouse. This means that you will have to do the job yourself if you catch a mouse in the trap. To add to that, the mouse in the trap will be bloody, in pain, and in a lot of shock from possibly being stuck in the trap for hours.This is just not worth it. Stay away!
Of all the Tomcat products, this one has to be the worst. If it works at all, it tortures the poor mouse victim.  If you're a sadist into torturing little animals, this is for you.  If you're a decent person, get something that's more humane to take care of any rodent problem.
I really like the Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap version . . . powerful, easy to set, and well-designed for a reliable catch/kill.  I looked forward to good results from this Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap, and in fact had a ready test subject targeted, as my daughter had been reporting a mouse intruder in her 100 year old Victorian home with dungeon like basement.  I told her to hold off on deploying her old wood traps so I could  try out these just-received Tomcat Mouse Snap Traps.This mouse version of the trap was indeed, like the rat version, easy to set.  Just push on the heel of the lid, and it pivots and locks open.  That was where the good times ended.First problem was stolen bait.  I didn't have any of the recommended "Tomcat Mouse Attractant Gel" in my possession, so I tried pressing on a little glob of trusty sharp cheddar.  Problem is there's really nothing to press the bait onto but an essentially smooth plastic bait/trip platform.  I suspected the bait might get stolen.  It was.  And the second try also.  By this time, I was sure the mouse would be back for try number three, as this trap was just essentially functioning as a feeding station.This third try, I fashioned a paper clip to slip over the edge of the bait/trip platform and help hold the bait in place.  It worked.  A successful capture this time, but . . . .It didn't kill the mouse.  I was left with the task of having to put a trembling badly injured mouse out of its suffering.  I felt as sorry for the little guy as I would have a suffering dog or cat, and felt terrible for having put it in this state of injury.  I have trapped many mice over the years with the old-fashioned wooden Victor type traps.  Nine out of ten times (or more) they produced an instant kill.  That's what I'm looking for.I give the Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap a star for being easy to set with no pinched fingers, and they are indeed not likely to injure your children or pets.  But I consider these traps unacceptably inhumane and will not use these Tomcat mouse traps again.
After using the old wooden mouse traps for years, I discovered they just don't seem to work as well as they used to and mice would often lick the traps clean.  So, I began buying different traps to experiment and see if I could find a better trap.  The TOMCAT REUSABLE MOUSETRAP was one of the traps I tried.  The traps say that they offer a "clean to-touch disposal" whose "patented design is guaranteed effective".  I should have contacted the company about that guarantee because these traps do not work at all. I tried using these traps for a week. Each morning I would awaken to find the traps still set, but licked clean of the peanut butter and cheese. After trying to catch mice for a week using TOMCAT REUSABLE MOUSE TRAPS I gave up and threw the traps away. Even though the wooden traps aren't as reliable as they used to be, they at least caught a mouse eventually. These traps are a waste of money. DO NOT buy.
