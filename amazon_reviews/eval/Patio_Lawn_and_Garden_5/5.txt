This is a high quality 8 ply hose. I have had good luck with Gilmour hoses in the past. A good choice in hoses.
I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars, but that's my fault not a product fault.
I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50, 75, and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase.
I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks
After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8", but this is 3/4".There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink.
This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i don't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern.
I'll buy more of these come  Spring. Holding up very well to the extreme heat and cold of Idaho.  A bit on the heavy side, but that is what makes them last so well.
This is a good quality hose that I use to connect to my &#34;Scarecrow&#34; so as to keep the deer away from my plants. It sits in the sun all day long and so far shows no sign of degradation.
I bought a cheap hose that didn't hold the pressure after 2 days.  This bad boy hold the pressure and doesn't leak.  Its not even expanding.  Great quality hose.  I will be keeping them in mind when I need more length.
I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.  I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.  slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.  I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me
For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product.  They just can't be beat for the price and/or guarantee.  This hose is typical of a Gilmour item.  It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products, comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them.  Quite a company!
It's been outside in the hot (South Florida) sunshine 24/7, and still flexible. No crackles, and remains in great shape!A real bargain!
I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.  I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )
I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a "brake" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)
This little hose was purchased to add on to my other 50 foot hose due to the very humid and oppressive weather this last month in the Northeast.  It is very flexible and easy to handle and allows me total reach of the back perennial garden.  i would recommend this hose
This is definitely a good quality nozzle. It is similar to the &#34;old fashioned&#34; type nozzle we had as kids. It gives differing spray patterns depending on how far you squeeze the trigger.
It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.
I am very happy that I bought this nozzle. It is exactly what I wanted. Good quality and I highly recommend it. I really need it too.
I have bought many types of nozzle over the years and this old timer which I used to use when I was growing up served me well this past season.
Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get "prettier" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if "pretty" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a "lock on" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no "medium" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual "problem", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is "too good"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a "closed" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then "open 'er up" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT "Gilmour 572TF".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in "bargain bin" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a "Gilmour 572TF", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the "Gilmour 572TF", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those "prettier" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in "bargain bins", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a "pretty" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will "sacrifice" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) "pretty" sprayer nozzles, which have "fallen out of favor" for various reasons.
I've tried all sorts of nozzles for my hose and they either break, get stuck on the end of the hose, or don't have enough power to really blast things with water. This nozzle is durable, easy to remove, and super strong!
After hearing so much about this unit, and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood, I decided to give it a try, even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!
Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.----------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch!Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment.
I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12" away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren't in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I've been very lucky so far, I've been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.I've only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it'd be fine for watering a really large area that hasn't been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement.
I always like this hose, it's reliable, less prone to kink and stand up a lot better than any other garden hoses I ever bought!
The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had, and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year, but very long, hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty, but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose.
Short review:  This hose is amazing, Made in the USA, tough as nails yet flexible, will not kink EVER, and I love it.  Buy it now.Longer review:I bought a home depot memorial day special hose for $19.95 (same size as this one) and thought "how different can hoses be?  this one says kink free."  Three months of hose torture ensued, with me trying various tactics (e.g. only moving hose when it's pressurized) to try to keep it from kinking.  That damn endless kink hose is now in a pile in a garage ready for donation.  It has more kinks in it than a Russian porn movie.  Every time I used it I became more and more frustrated and thought longingly of this twice the price hose.Take my advice, buy this hose, it is worth it.  It's also nice to see it's Made in the USA - at least something is.  Amazing warranty. Even in cooler weather it stays flexible.  Great brass fittings.  They are right, this is the last hose I'll ever buy.  Please, Gilmour, don't try to save on cost in the future - keep this hose just the way it is!Hope this helps.  Did I mention I love this hose?
I thought I had already reviewed this hose.  We love it!  It is strong and it attaches easily and smoothly to each other (we bought TWO 100' lengths) without leaking.  I expect these hoses to last us a terrifically long time.
This hose is 100 feet and it makes it halfway around my house.  A high quality hose for the price.
Even my landscaper said the Gilmour Flexogen 10058100 8-Ply Hose 5/8-inch by 100-foot is the BEST! YOU JUST CAN'T KINK IT!
I really like this sprinkler. It works great, the pattern of water covers the distance that they said it would. Others I have purchased did not do so well and some did not last very long. I think Rain bird is a good company that I can rely on for good quality. Kind of rare now days.
For years I have purchased impulse sprinklers that work for a while, then plastic parts broke.Now that I have the Rain Bird I am certain that this well made sprinkler will outlast all the others.It is easy to adjust and gives good coverage.
I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet, but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further, but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly, and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now, i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation.
We have unfiltered irrigation water - and the sprinkler heads get clogged with weeds, etc.  This one seems to be more tolerant of that - and it really has a reach for distance.  Good weight also helps keep the sprinkler in place
These sprinkler heads are well made, very functional and easy to use; changing the settings is quite simple; highly recommended
IMO, the gold standard in impact sprinklers.  Buy one (OK maybe four) and be done with it.Rain Bird has built this right for decades and it's a wonder why so many other companies cheapen this simple design.
I used to use a really primitive manual edger that I inherited from my father. Blistered hands and time wasted, I decided there had to be a better way and this is surely it.Edging is one of those necessary evils if you want a great looking house. I don't edge every time I mow. Usually I do it every other time. The first time out after a long winter, edging usually takes a little longer. After that, edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower.
At the risk of sounding like an idiot...I am 45-years-old. I have been a homeowner for nearly 20 years. And I have NEVER had a power edger. I have edged my lawn for almost 20 years with an old-fashioned, manual edger. Finally, after too many blisters, a sore back, and just plain old laziness, I decided to treat myself to the Edge Hog. And boy...Am I glad I did! Right out of the box, I could tell this was a quality product. Assembly couldn't have been any easier. Just attach the top handle to the bottom handle. No tools required! And everything else is pre-assembled. I had used a power edger in the past. Like maybe 30 years ago when I borrowed one from a friend so I could get the lawn done quicker and go play ball or something. But for all practical purposes, this was my first time. And it was easy as pie. I had no problem getting the hang of using the Edge Hog. The edging was done fast and easy. What a difference, too! No more raggedy edge like I got from my manual edger. Instead I now get a nice clean "professional" edge. Finally! And my back is so much happier!! The price on this product is competitive with other retailers. I had a $25.00 gift certificate and am an Amazon Prime member. So for about $65.00 total, I am now the proud owner of this quality Black & Decker edger. I highly recommend this product. If I could give it 6 stars, I would!
I had a previous Edge-Hog for a little more than 8 years when the motor brushes finally wore out.  I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $30, but then I decided to just get a new one.  There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model.  The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.The older model had a &#34;swing open&#34; cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection.  The first day I used it, the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield, but not enough to really bog down the blade.  I unplugged the unit for safety sake, but unlike the older model, you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud.  If you use it on dry ground, the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.I am hoping to get at least eight years out of this unit, like I did with my last one.
The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn. I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer. The string trimmer did a choppy job, but the B&D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn. Before this purchase I dreaded the job. The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus. I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself. Anything that makes that job easier (like this edger) deserves five stars. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job.
dang this thing does some work, i just grab the handle and off i go, my lawn edges never looked so good.
This is the latest version of an edger B&amp;D has been making for at least 20 years, and there are plenty of the 20 year old models still in use. It's nearly silent, much easier to use than a gas model, and seems to  cut better with less stalling than my neighbor's 3.5HP gas model.
This edger does the job and more.  I give it my highest recommendation.I hadn't edged my lawn since last Fall when my gas-powered edger bit the dust.  We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida.  It propagates by spreading tough, vine-like runners.  I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.  This edger cut right through them, which I didn't expect, given the toughness of the grass.  But it never hesitated, except on some very stuborn growth.  I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.  I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I didn't want it to go.  Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets.  No more gas and oil mix, no more new spark plugs, no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start, and it's relatively quiet when running.  Just press the trigger and go.  Love it, love it, love it.
I love this edger!  I have been using it for almost 2 years, and it is still going strong.  It has plenty of power, yet is easy to maneuver.I get a beautiful, straight edge along my sidewalk from using this tool.  It is so easy to guide in a straight line.  I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas, which has worked much better than a trimmer.We had a gas powered edger before this one, but it was too heavy for me.  I actually enjoy yard work, but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage.  Now that I have this electric edger, which is significantly lighter without the gas tank, as well as a manual mower, I do most of the yard work, and love it!
I've purchased a lot of B&D product and edger is one of the best! The trench feature is a great addition and it works great.  I can edge my small yard in minutes and I don't have to worry about mixing fuel or having to winterize my equipment.
If you need an edger, and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger, this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most, and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light, too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer, or not edging your lawn at all, you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger.
So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find your self strung out.
This &#34;Black & Decker AF-100 String Trimmer Replacement Spool&#34; is exactly what I needed for my Black & Decker cordless weed trimmer. This is east to install and it works as well as the original spool that came preinstalled on my trimmer.Works as expected!Highly Recommended!CFH
If you have a Black and Decker string trimmer that uses auto-feed string, this is the spool to buy. The string works well. The spool snaps in easily and you don't have to mess with rolling a spool with bulk string.
This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!
This is a direct replacement and works great. My only gripe is that this particular weed eater uses way to much line.
I bought this for my black and decker trimmer and where else would i buy these? its not worth driving to the store and look in different eisle to find something simple as these. Also amazon always seem to have the better price.
At the time I purchased these replacement spools the official Amazon description listed only GrassHog NST2018 as compatible model. I can confirm that it works with the new GrassHog NST2118Black & Decker NST2118 12-Inch 18-Volt Ni-Cd Cordless Electric GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger.The automatic feed spool on GrassHog advances the string without needing to bump on the ground. The benefit of this system is that cutting is easier as it constantly replaces worn out string, the down side that the usage of the string is faster than when done manually.I have tried wounding the string by hand and found it a bit cumbersome and a bit time consuming, so I figured less than $5 per spool is not to bad to save me 5 minutes of time wounding and dealing with jammed string. Each spool contains 30 feet of 0.065 inch diameter round line. It is factory spooled and is wound tighter than when I wound the spool by hand.To replace the spool:1. Remove battery2. Squeeze the tabs on the spool cap to release it3. Pull the empty spool out by pulling directly away from the housing4. Clean out the housing from debris5. Make sure that the level that controls the spooling  is aligned with the edge of the housing6. Take a string from the new spool and feed it through the eyelet in the housing7. Push the spool into the housing and rotate it until it feels seated and the tabs of the spool align with the holes in the housing8. Put the cap back on9. The string outside the housing should be 5 3/8 inches, if it is longer than this length use scissors to trim itCollage of two different views of the spools in this package attached under customer photos.Overall, I am pleased with the spools - they should take me through the next couple of summers!Ali Julia review

Works as expected, no surprises of any kind. I'm now on my 4th three pack and will get a 5th when the time comes.
Bought for the following trimmer...This little trimmer really eats up the weeds and tall grass. Much better than any other cordless trimmer that I've tried. Battery life is above average and charging is fast. I do have the B&D; Blower that uses the same battery so I have a back up should I need it. I'll edit this review and add to it after I've had the opportunity to use it longer but so far, I am very pleased with the product.
so good, Bought these as extra to have them on hand and the one my weed eater came with is still working. Will order more as needed, I am all for no muss, no fuss......
I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer.  It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff.  On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim, so no cutting of the line is necessary.  Yes, it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself, but for roughly $4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort.
I looked around at several websites, and multiple options on Amazon and this was the best deal I found.Fit into my Black and Decker Trimmer perfectly. Just snap in and go.
For years, I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out, the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding, the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)
Simply - these reels are inexpensive and easy to replace and install. They seem to last pretty long also. Highly recomend
It took many years for my Black and Decker Gross Hog trimmer to use up all of its string.  Changing the empty string spool was a snap, and the new one works perfectly, just as I would expect.  No complaints.
My string trimmer is a great light duty tool and works very good. I bought the extra spools of string for two good reasons it is much cheaper through Amazon than our local retailers and with fuel for the auto's being at $3.35/ gal. this saves 3 trips to get the string and luck being what it is chances are when you give out of string the retailer will be out also. Good Buy from a good outfit to do business with(Amazon.com).Thanks again,Denny
I've started winding my own spools now.  These are very convenient, but you really pay a hefty price for that convenience. I'm buying bulk string now and use my drill motor to wind it onto the empty spools.
super easy to swap out and last a long time, unless you are chopping concrete!  I use these all the time, as I feel they are worth the extra cost for the convenience.
I use this on my 18v trimmer.  It seems to last forever.  Changing spools is a little tricky, but once you do it the first time, it really isn't an issue.  Three spools will probably outlast the life of the trimmer - which I think is pretty well made.
I know it's a lot cheaper to re-string your own spools but these are really convenient, and without the hassle of doing it on your own.
This is the easiest replacement string to install on a weed wacker. No mess ,just place it in lock it and then go tackle your yard!
Easy to replace. Summer worth of string in these three spools. Carefully handle so that the string doesn't be OEM uncoiled prior to install.
I put these in a cordless 18 volt Black and Decker trimmer and they have worked flawlessly.  Just have to put them in the same way the old one came out with no tools just snapping them in place and letting about 4&#34; of string out and they feed the same way.
Works great and is easy to replace spool of line string for my Black & Decker 20-volt battery/cordless weed trimmer!  Good value when purchased in package.
I made the mistake of taking the spool that came with my B & D LST136 cordless trimmer and experienced what it would be like if I tried to save money by buying cord in bulk and winding my own spools.  I painstakingly wound the cord from left to right and from right to left as instructed in the manual.  I dropped it a few times and had to begin again.  I did it right because the cord does advance automatically in my trimmer, but I have to say I am glad I purchased spools that are already wound.  When I have to replace the spool that came with the trimmer, I will be careful to hold the cord tightly against the spool!
BZZZZZTTTT.... ZAP ZAP.  Dead bugs all over the place.  I didnt use any of the mosquito attractant packs or anything but this thing does get rid of all the bugs around that are flying around if you have any lights on outside.  Its fun to catch beatles and throw them into the zapper  :D
I bought this hoping to kill mosquitoes. I plugged it in and watched the beautiful zapping. After a few nights of this, I did some research and found that 99 percent of those zaps were useful bugs. I decided to return it after killing hundreds of useful bugs in my yard and maybe...maybe a mosquito or two.
There's not too much I can say about something as simple as a bug zapper other than -- it works well, it's silent (except when zapping bugs), it DOES attract and eradicate mosquitoes and other flying insects, and it's only 15 watts.Happy with my purchase.
Only draw back I could come up with is my girlfriend is convinced the light is attracting more bugs from the neighborhood. lol.  We have a pool and a pond, along with wetlands on our property, so we simply have a lot of bugs.  This thing is working constantly while it is on.  The zapping can get quite loud, but it is doing its job.  We have it set up about 20 feet from out deck, and 15 from the pool.  You don't want it closer, as it will bring bugs around.  They are attracted to it...which is exactly what you want! Just not right next to you.  Cord it short, so you will need a heavy duty extension cord.  I hung mine on  a trellis, but if you don't have something to hang it from, you may need a sturdy stand...this things is pretty massive, and has some weight to it.
Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend.
The unit is certainly getting a workout after the wet summer.  I have not had any issues with the unit becoming clogged.  I used a timer to save the unit from operating during the day to limit electricity use and save the bulb life.  An unintended consequence of this unit was that I was able to light up a fairly dark area in our yard that gives an added sense of security.  I would recommend.
Great price and it attracts bugs. It is on the side of our house and it seems to be helping.
Can't say enough good about this unit. I did a LOT of research before buying one and have to say i'm very happy with this choice. It make a big difference on our back porch so long as you follow the directions. You want it mounted AWAY from where you're relaxing so it attracts the insects away from you. This thing zapps them non-stop. Sometimes we just sit on the back porch and laugh at zap after zap. :)
I purchased one of these for my backyard that is about 1/2 acre and has lot's of foliage and a koi pond.  I built a stand for it and placed it about 20' from our patio, on the oppsite side of the koi pond and it seems to work very well.  It utilze's an arc of electricity to kill the insects that are unlucky enough to go to the light.  There are verticle bars surrounding the lamp that when a insect touches two of the bars, the flowtron utilizes the insect to complete the circuit until there isn't sufficient insect left (burnt up) to continue the arc.  Generally this is a fairly quick process (ZAP) however the occasional moth or larger bug will fly in and you'll hear a nice zaaaaaaaap or sizzzzzzzle until enough is "gone" to break the arc.Maybe it's morbid - I enjoy hearing the zap and the occasional sizzzzzzzzle because that is one less nusuance bug to bite my family, my guests or my dog.  I can whole heartedly recommend this product!
received this yesterday and installed it. it replaced an old one by flowtron I have had for 10 years. this one is for 1 acre and the light appears to be very intense. it was zapping last nite.
i have not taken this out of the box yet but it looks great. note: it is recommended that this be located a certain distance from the house it protects...and it requires power.
I do love this bug zapper, but I noticed there weren't as many dead bugs around it as I thought there would be, seeing as we have a heavily wooded property complete with creek (lots of bugs!).  One late night, almost midnight, I went out into the side yard with my dog so she could do her business, and saw BATS flying from the woods and zooming by the bug zapper, then back to the trees again.  The bats were picking off the bugs that were attracted by the bug zapper!  How cool is that?!?  I am such a city kid that I made myself a cup of hot cocoa and sat by the back door with the porch light on, just watching the bats go back and forth.  Since that evening, I've seen the bats almost every time I happen to go outside late at night, so I guess my bug zapper is doing well to keep our local bats fat and happy.  (I'm glad to say the bats are in no danger from this zapper due to the grid guard, btw.)I've had this 80 watt model for over 3 months now, and it works beautifully even though it's exposed to the wind, rain, and hail.  Depending on how warm the weather has been, I'll take the leaf blower to it to clean the bug zapper every week or two.  With the leaf blower, the bug zapper swings around wildly, but it doesn't damage this sturdy bug zapper!  All bugs come off easily.I also have this zapper on a light-sensitive timer, so it comes on at dusk, and off again at dawn.
I love hearing the zap zap zap.  Have been using this thing in South Florida for over a year now, and left it out to brave quite a few storms, and it's still going on strong.
This thing is a bug terminator zapping any bug that comes in. At first it got pretty clogged up (lots of bugs in FL) but the lizards and frogs have done a nice job cleaning it up for me. It&#8217;s to me a necessity here if you want piece from the mosquitos.
We just received this unit this week, and can already note an improvement in our yard. We have used dunks for some water gardens we have, and have been impressed with the Flowtron unit thus far. A lot of dead mosquitoes every morning. We hook it up to an outdoor timer and run the unit automatically from dusk to dawn.  It will take about three weeks for all the eggs to hatch and mature then we'll see a great reduction in mosquitoes.It's been a very wet in North Texas and we have a bumper crop this year. Am going to explore mixing up some hot pepper and garlic--recipes are available online as a barrier. We hope a combination on factors can help rid us of a heavy mosquito population. Have not noticed any beneficial insects on or under the grids.We compared brands and sizes and selected this one due to reviews of others on Amazon. Recommend the bigger wattage for better attraction of flying insects--with mosquitoes being our main target.
We found the 80D not much more to buy than the 1/2 acre 40D, and it likely does provide a wider area of coverage.  It will use more electricity, but I intend to put it on a sensor, so it will run dusk to dawn.  As others reported, we found a pile of carnage after the first night....mostly mosquitoes.  Read the instructions about locating and baiting....ours is forty feet upwind of our hot tub, patio, and screened porch so the black light and scent bait draws bugs away from us, and intercepts those coming from upwind.  Far enough away from food and guests to avoid the health hazards reported, and the &#34;zapping&#34; is not obtrusively loud.Ours arrived with a small plastic tab laying in the bottom of the tray.  Investigating, I discovered a self-tapping screw had cross-threaded during assembly, breaking off one of four tabs used to secure the safety cage.  This would not have easily been detected by Quality Control at Flowtron.  I contacted Parts and Service.  They had me email my Amazon receipt, and immediately sent me a replacement cage.  Nice service!
At first I didn't like this Corona pruner because it didn't seem to cut well.  Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide, and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces.
I needed some loppers to cut some branches on some trees, decided to go with these because of the price and all the positive feedback.  They work flawlessly and now I can keep my house trees trimmed to where I want them.
Corona makes the best quality gardening equipment.  I own pruning saws as well as the hand pruners.  Most importantly they last forever! I have experienced so many other brands that give out after just a little use.
I have used a number of pruners, but these are my fav.  Sharp and powerful.  Like the fact that you can sharpen them rather easily extending their value and lifespan.  Great for all my needs.
I really love these pruners. They are heavy duty (up to 1 inch). They are more reasonable than some similar Felco pruners I bought (which are also good). I recommend these.
These clippers are great.  Easy to grip and sharp enough to really get the job done.  I like the locking hook that keeps them closed when not being used.  Also, the red handles are a big help to spot them when you've laid them down among your clippings.
I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally, my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this, and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands, it hasn't stuck or jammed, and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right, other reviewers. :)
I recently purchased these pruners in a package that contains a second pruner that also cuts string and opens boxes. Lifetime guarantee, and both at the local Costco cost the same as the one on Amazon.
I am a landscape contractor and we use a lot of different hand tools. There are a number of very pricey pruners out there but I have found that these operate extremely well at a fraction of the cost of some others. They are forged heavy grade pruners with nice grips. Just keep the blades oiled and clean.
this is a very good product.  i laid it on top of 4 metal fence posts at the corners of my strawberry bed.  it is surprisingly strong.  it gets snagged on just about everything, but does not rip.  it keeps the birds and cats out of my strawberries.  i will be buying more in the future.
Okay, I'm not using this netting like the other folk, but perhaps you too are  looking for a solution to THAT deer that's so bold he doesn't hesitate to come up onto the porch to nibble the delicious buds off your potted plants.My particular problem this year wasn't that, but it was that someone was dining on the new garden I put in the front yard.  Now, you can't exactly put up deer fencing -- at least not attractively-- at the front of your lawn, but you can protect your plants, it turns out, with this netting.What I did was cut the netting into small swaths which I lay over the plants.  LOL, it apparently has an unpleasant feel on the tongue.  The dear deer hasn't even eaten the lettuces I've got tucked in here and there.  And the best part is that the netting is invisible.  At least I can't see it.So try this out and see if it works for you.  It's allowed us to grow plants that none of our neighbors dare try here in deer-country Virginia.One note of caution:  You need to check periodically to make sure that blossoms don't work themselves into the netting.  I've had to work some free so they could open.Pam T~happy gardenerI'll report back if there's a failure at any point
When I first got this thing, I must admit, I was really dubious. It looks odd and gimmicky. Well, using it in my garden has turned me into a believer! It works great on my thick, clay-heavy soil - quickly cultivating the ground, breaking it up and preparing for my attentions. It works great and I highly recommend it!(Review of Garden Weasel Gold Garden Claw Cultivator #91306)
I planned to use the Garden Claw for stand-up cultivation of my raised beds, and it will be great for that; it's perfect for SFG-style beds.But this is the best part: I've discovered it's perfect for helping me dig post holes for my grape and kiwi trellises. I'm a 4'10" disabled woman with bad knees and a bad back. I just don't have the upper body strength to ram a post-hole digger into the clay soil in our fescue-matted field, and the two big, strong men in my household always have something more pressing to do.I discovered the Garden Claw makes a circular hole that's just a tad wider than the post-hole digger does, and I can loosen six or more inches of clay soil and roots in no time. Without strain! Then I can use the post-hole digger to lift out the loosened soil, or I can just spade it out into a bucket for use somewhere else. As weak as I am, I can get two 2-foot holes dug before I have to rest.I've been frustrated because I've been too broke to pay someone to come put these trellises in and worried because I know the vines will be here before I know it. Thanks to the Garden Claw, I can put in my trellises all by myself! It paid for itself the very first day. So far, I'm delighted with it.
Everyone I know advised me against getting a reel mower.  I was cautioned that they don't cut well and they're hard to push.  But I didn't consider a gas mower an option (too expensive, noisy, hard to maintain, and dangerous), a corded electric would be too cumbersome, and a rechargeable would be impractical because there is not a convenient place for me to charge it.  So I took the plunge and bought this one.I'm completely intimidated by all things mechanical, so I was worried about assembling this mower, but it really is easy.  The only thing you have to do is screw the five sections of the handle together, then clip it onto the mower body.  The instructions were adequate (3.5 stars there), even for an assembly-phobe like me.  The current configuration does not require any tools for assembly, but there was an add-on bag of washers and nuts included with my mower that are recommended for a more securely assembled handle.  If you opt to use the new nuts instead of the original wingnuts, you'll need a wrench.After just fifteen minutes or so, I was up and running.  To my delight, the mower pushes easily, even through long grass.  And it's very entertaining to watch the grass being rapidly snipped off.  I felt like Edward Scissorhands.  Who would have thought mowing grass would be so fun?  I was a little tired and winded when I finished (in a good way), but I had been practically running with this thing because I enjoyed it so much.  I kept looking for stray patches to go over again, but, alas, the mower did such a good job, when I was finished, my yard looked like a golf course.A few facts about me and my lawn to see if my wholehearted recommendation will apply to you:  I'm female, plus-sized, totally out of shape, and usually quite sedentary (one reason I thought this would be a good idea).  I had never mowed grass before in my life (didn't have a yard before last summer, and then I accepted the fine services of a neighborhood girl with a ride-on mower who worked cheap).  My yard is about 6500 square feet, level, fairly flat, and covered with long pine needles all over the place (the mower didn't even notice them).Some older reviews address a couple of problems that are no longer an issue:  Scotts now (late April 2007) packages the mower with the cushioned handgrip already on, and the apparently easily loosened wingnuts (as already mentioned) can now be replaced with regular nuts (not mentioned in the current manual, but included in the box with a note).  Scotts should have included shorter bolts with the new nuts (since you now don't need the extra length the wingnuts required), but this is a trivial point.  Put your wingnuts on after the new nuts for a more "finished" appearance.A reel mower might not be suitable for everyone and every yard, but for me, it's fantastic.  It's quiet, easy to maneuver, non-intimidating, good exercise, fun, environmentally sound, and inexpensive.  I couldn't be happier with this mower.UPDATE 1-17-13I used my mower for the whole season and never had any problems with it.  The next year, health issues forced me to again use the services of the neighborhood girl to mow my lawn.  Then I got married, and my husband wanted nothing to do with a reel mower (though he admitted that it was cool, he'd always used a gas mower, and that's what he wanted to stick with, though I HATE the noise and smell when he mows).  So my Scotts sat in storage for years, and last fall Hubby finally convinced me to let it go.  I sold it for $50 to a single mom with a tween daughter who was going to mow their small lawn.  I let them try it out on our grass, and they were both immediately thrilled and couldn't wait to get home to use it.  I felt like I was kind of passing on a torch.  There's something wonderfully enabling about this mower.  If I found myself again being the person responsible for mowing a small-to-medium-size lawn, I would definitely buy another one of these.
Works like a charm. Put it together in a few minutes and cut an overgrown yard at a cabin. Had to make two passes - one at the highest length and one at desired length. The tall weeds did not cut, but I cut them with a lopper. Much easier to maneuver than my power mower and trimmer-mower.
I have had many people look at and watch me as I mowed our lawn for the first time with this reel mower and all I could think is that these people think I'm going green... well I'm not. I have always lived a conservative life, recycled (still do), and so on. And not because some celebrity told me I should or whatever, but because it just makes sense to do so. So with that out of the way, onto the actual product.When gas prices peaked last summer we stopped using our lawn tractor because it used just too much gas (and it didn't cut the grass all that well to begin with) and just used our self propelled Honda mower. Well after the tractor sat all summer we decided to just sell it and buy a reel mower and so far it has more then paid for itself.The first question EVERYONE asks is, is it hard to push? Plain and simple, NO. These new reel mowers are lighter and are better designed so they are much easier to push then the old Leave It To Beaver style reel mowers. Also the rear stabilizer wheels also makes it easier to handle.The second question that is asked is, how well does it cut the grass. Well that depends on how tall the grass is, how wet it is, etc.. A reel mower cuts with a sheering action (like scissors) instead of a tearing action that is associated with a rotary mower. This leaves your grass in a much healthier state then the tearing action does. Now I will say that it is harder to cut tall grass and we have to mow more often, but that's the nature of the beast.After mowing the lawn for a few weeks with the Scotts 20 inch reel mower I can actually tell a difference in the grass, much better and healthier looking.The only gripe I have is the handle is a bit flimsy and wobbles a lot... kind of a pain when you execute a turn. We'll probably end up welding it together so it doesn't wobble.All said and done it's a bit more work then using our self propelled Honda, but produces a much better looking lawn.Pros:Fairly cheap upfront cost.Little to no upkeep.Leaves your lawn looking awesome.At least ten times quieter then pretty much any rotary mower, thus allows your to keep your windows open when you are mowing.No fumes (darnit I love the smell of gas!).20" mower path.Cons:Made in China...Some plastic pieces, not sure how they are going to last but we'll see.Wobbly handle.
I really like this mower a lot.  I have owned a Brill and Sunlawn, but I like the Scotts classic better than either.  I do have a 40 year old Scotts Deluxe that is substantially heavier and which I like the best of all.  I use the old Scotts Deluxe for mowing my own yard and leave the Scotts classic in my trunk to mow rentals.  Here are my pros and cons.Pros.1. Heavier than others.  That makes it less likely to slip when going over uneven lawn or wet grass. It also has more reel momentum making it cut tall floppy grass and leaves better.2. Handle comes off easily.  There are little clips that hold the handle in, but I do not use them. I just pop the handle on and off, making it easy to store in my trunk and use any time.3.  No gas, much, much lighter and smaller than a gas mower. Of course this is true of all reel mowers, but it is an important point for me.  I can leave this in my trunk and not worry about gas fumes or about refilling gas.  It is always ready to go.  With the handle off, it does not take up too much of my trunk and it is light enough to easily take in and out of my trunk.4. Durable.  You might not think of this with a reel mower, but it saves me nice money in maintenance.  I actually mow several rental lawns weekly.  With that much mowing I have to take my mower in for maintenance every year.  Also I have bent the crankshaft on multiple mowers.  The only maintenance on this is sharpening the blade.5.  Easy to sharpen the blade.  This mower is made by American Lawn Mower, which means it can use the very easy, very cheap american lawn mower sharpening kit available from amazon and tons of other places for under $20.  I like the kit and feel I get a better cut with this mower than I did with the brill or sunlawn models.6. Quiet. Maybe it is a little louder than the brill, but it is still super quiet.  If I feel like mowing in the middle of the night, just because I can, I do and it bothers noone.  Now when I use a gas mower, the noise really bothers me.Cons.1. Handle is super flexy.  They really cheaped out on the handle. The sunlawn and brill models are much stronger.  It works and lasted a heavy use season, but it will not last as long as the body.2. Tough time with weeds. Like all reel mowers, this thing does not like to mow anything that is tall and floppy. This one handles weeds and tall grass much better than average, but you should still try to hold down the weeds and cut weekly if possible. That being said my sister often forgets to mow her weedy lawn for a few weeks, and I am able to mow it with my Scotts classic when her sunlawn would have more difficulty.
I was not sure if this mower would work for me, seeing as my lawn is &#34;too big&#34;, bumpy, and pretty weedy as I don't use chemicals on it.  But I took the chance and am very glad I did.  It's much easier to manage than the gas mower I was using (not self propelled),  and does a good job on the lawn.  If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you, but I don't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there.  The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs, which was another concern of mine.  I mow each &#34;section&#34; of my lawn once per week, so the grass does not get too high.  Also I switch mowing directions each time.  If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably isn't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass.  Using this mower might take me a bit longer than using the gas powered one, but not by much.  And it's a whole lot quieter and easier to maintain.
I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards, although that wasn't always the case. When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old, heavy manual mower, something that soured me on manual mowers for decades. But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers, and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower, but without the noise, the vibrations or the fumes. I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand. And get a can of Boeshield protectant spray (also available from Amazon). A quick once over with the Boeshield from time to time will greatly extend the life of your mower and keep it easy to push.

I like this.  No need for gas and it cuts very nicely.  I use it in south carolina and my yard is not big.  It is good for my application.  Good work out!
We purchased a chicago 2-flat about a year ago.  I bought a used $10 reel mower that was awful, but got us through the dry summer last year.  I knew we would need a new one this year.  After watching for sales that never happened I turned to trusty amazon.  So far, I'm completely satisfied with this lil guy!  We have a relatively small yard, so the 14 inch width is completely appropriate.  I also was super impressed at the way it handled long grass.  I know these mowers are notorious for not being able to handle it, but I was pretty pleased.  It may not have cut the long grass like a gas mower, but it really was completely acceptable.  Like a few other reviewers have said it does get stuck on any little twig.  So you might have to stop a few times to bend over and pick them out, but if you're the reel mower type I would assume bending over a few times isn't out of the question.  You can't beat the price either!  I had no issue with the assembly, it took just a few minutes.  After watching my neighbor reel over his in short strokes to get through the yard I was even more glad that I have this guy!
I am a avid gardener, I take care of the flowers and my husband takes care of the lawn.  We have had too many cases of lawmmower blight;by definition - the weed wacker or lawn mower cuts down my flowers and bushes.  After too many cases of lawnmower blight, I bought this little mower for trimming near my flower beds that are naturalized (lawnmower blight does not happen at mulched beds).This is a great tool!  Very sharp and easy to push, perfect for what I need it for.  At first my husband was slightly insulted by and for the reason of this pruchase, he even snickered when it came out of the box, but when he tried it he loved it and is now using it to trim by our driveway as is cuts lower than our "big" mower.Highly recommend for very small lawns and trimming, remember it is 14 inches wide.I JUST LOVE IT1
Works great, I needed this to start impatiens seeds from Burpee -- they're so small they resemble grains of sand, you actually dip a toothpick in water and use the surface tension to pick up and deposit each seed -- THAT'S SMALL. Keep the transparent lid on until the seeds have mostly sprouted, then remove the lid and slowly "harden off" the plants by exposing them to the outdoors and eventually sunlight over time.I wish I'd ordered two or more of these. It's much, much cheaper to start flowers from seed on your own versus buying them at the local Home Depot or nursery. I already ordered more impatiens and I have some vincas I want to get started for the warmer months. Buy some decent potting mix or seed starting mix, or if you're really crunchy granola run some garden soil through your oven @ about 350 degrees for an hour to sterilize it. I like to add some perlite to soil mixes. I also like to water the soil BEFORE THE SEEDS ARE SOWN with Miracle Gro. The transparent dome will maintain humidity while the seeds are sprouting. I'd use a decent plant mister (Couldn't insert product link, URL is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010H748S/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details) to keep the seedlings content.Great product. I really wish I'd ordered two or three of them.
Very convenient and easy to start seedlings.  They are sturdy and I have reused them more than once.  I recommend these.
I purchased this item locally at a discount store for much less, so be sure to check around before you buy.I purchased two, knowing that with my history I'd be lucky with 10 percent actually sprouting. But I was wrong! My granddaughter and I did the first tray together. She poured the water, then I counted out the seeds for her to plant. Her Mom and I did the second tray after she got bored. Within three days the first of the plants were up. It has now been 8 days and nearly every pellet has seedlings. I have already had to move the first ones (cantaloupe) to a large peat pot since they are five inches tall! I am using one of the top covers under the four large peat pots.Almost all of the others are 2 inches tall, but still fragile.This will be my first garden grown completely from seed, and I will definitely use this again next year!Edited, All of the plants are in the ground and doing well! Tomatoes are sprawling all over the place, Zucchini have flowers, even the cantaloupe are starting to perk up now that the weather is warmer.
You can't beat the price for this kit and it's so easy to start seeds. I used this for the first time last year and followed planting and disk instructions and had over a 75% germination rate! Between the cost and ease-of-use, this is a great way to start seeds for outdoors. Just keep the little pellets moist and you'll be good to go.Some seeds need dark to germinate, so make sure to read your seed packets!
I've used this and a few other similar Jiffy products the last several years to start seeds for my garden. They are very easy to use (add hot water per the directions to expand the included pellets, then plant seeds per packet instructions) and less messy than using seed starting mix in flats--and perhaps even easier as well, though probably a bit more expensive. A clear plastic cover/dome is included to help germination. When the seedlings are ready to pot up or transplant, the netting tears off very easily and allows for transplanting with minimal root disturbance. Some people also leave the netting on and I seem to remember reading that it's supposed to disintegrate, but that hasn't been my experience. You do have to be careful with larger-rooted plants (squash, etc.) that you take care of them before their roots start to grow through the netting, otherwise you'll probably shock them more if/when you remove it. Finally, I like the square shape of this tray because it allows me to evenly rotate the plants under my grow lights.However, there are a few things you should know that don't seem to be made clear. Jiffy sells refill pellets so you can use the tray again, ideally saving money--but they have several similar-looking products that take different-sized pellets, so you need to know which ones you need. This 25-cell tray takes 42mm pellets (not 30, 36, or 50mm, which they also sell). Jiffy sells the 25-pack ofJiffy 5777 Refills, which are the right size. They used to be almost as expensive on Amazon as this complete kit, but as of my writing they are now an add-on item for about half the cost. Beware of third-party sellers; for example, I see a 200-pack of supposedly 42mm pellets,Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets, but they were actually the wrong size, so I had to return them. You may also be able to find them locally. Just be sure you get the right size, which is the 42mm size, sold under the "Jiffy 5777" name. Jiffy does not make sizing clear on either the original product or the refill, both of which would be a great help.Finally, I will note that because of the availability of refills, I was hoping to save money by re-using the tray for a few years and just replacing the pellets. However, after saving two trays from last season (both inside under good, climate-controlled conditions), one became slightly warped and curled up towards the outside, making it undesirable for use since I'm not sure if my plants would fall over with this slight curl of the tray. It also developed a small crack in the bottom, which is important to be aware of if you're using (and watering) these inside as I assume most people do. Obviously, these are just thin plastic and not something I'd expect to keep for years and years, but I was hoping to at least get a couple years' use out them. This works better sometimes than others.In summary, I've used this product for a couple years now, and it's definitely become my favorite method for most plants. I plan to continue to use this product for as long as it's available--just be warned about refill sizes, and perhaps be careful about how the tray is stored if you're hoping to re-use it for the next season.
A family of field mice moved into the house.  They are soooo tiny I wasn't sure what trap to use but this looked the lightest.  I caught the whole family within a few hours - even the babies. The secret as many have already said is keep in in their path and along the wall - I knew where they were coming from so it made that part easy.  Also, like already mentioned - just a dap of peanut butter - especially if trying to catch small mice.
Having read reviews of several different live traps, had no idea which was best.  So, bought about 4 different ones.  THIS ONE WORKED.  Put them all out with peanut butter and had no sign of any activity except this one.  Didn't know how many mice we had, but caught three with this one and zero with the others and no escapes, it seems, from the others.  They were all put in the same general area.  This one worked, was easy to set, easy to bait and easy to release the mouse.
This chain fit great for my Poulan Pro electric saw. This is also an older company that has a great website to help identify exactly what model your specific saw requires. It is not directional, so you don't have to worry about any arrows facing the right way. I just used it and I forgot how powerful my saw was. Getting old ones sharpened can be questionable when new ones are this cheap.
I HAVE A 18" CRAFTSMAN CHAIN SAW THAT CAME WITH A OREGON CHAIN THAT I HIT DIRT AND DULLED IT REAL FAST.THIS REPLACEMENT CHAIN FITS AND WORKS JUST AS WELL AS THE ONE IT CAME WITH AND IS ALSO HALF THE PRICE OF SEARS.
This chain fit my Poulan 18&#34; chainsaw perfectly and was wicked sharp. The price was just a fraction of what I would have paid at a hardware or Tractor Supply store.
as advertised..... Oregon Chainsaw always delivers a good product. I've bought lots of their chainsaw chains over the years and haven't ever been disappointed with the quality...... good product..........
Nice quality replacement chain and fit perfectly. Seems to hold its sharpness better than the chain that came with the saw. I find it less trouble to just replace the chain rather than try to sharpen them.
It was half the price of the same chain at Sears and came in two days. It saved me a ride and I have a pile of wood.
Bought two for different chainsaw models and am pleased with the quality of the chains.Sharp as new!Excellent price. Just be sure your chainsaw is compatible!
I switched from a skip tooth chain to this semi chisel and it cuts much faster and less vibration. On my 40 volt electric saw it really makes a difference.
I buy these chains at my local hardware store for about the same price as Amazon charges. They work perfectly for my Husqvarna chain saw. Be careful to make sure you get the correct chain. There are many different variations on 16" chains, and just knowing the brand of the saw doesn't tell you which will be the correct one.
This S56 chain fits my Makita UC4030A electric chain saw. Price is cheaper than Home depot by about 6 dollars. At this price I will keep a few on hand and sharpen them later. Oregon's web site lists what chains fit which saws.
Do not assume from this listing that the S56 16-inch saw chain will fit your 16-inch saw!!  If a photo of the back of the package were also included in this listing, you could zoom in and verify which models of the brands listed on the front view it will actually fit (Well Duh!!).  Additionally, while listings for some other Oregon chains advise we use the selector guide found at Oregonchain.com, most do not!  Oregon makes an excellent saw chain. Each and every listing should prominently provide explicit instruction that potential buyers need to first verify the correct selection for their particular make & model, before ordering.  Do they look at all those questions customers post (will this fit my xxx model of my xxx brand)?My father's Remington 16-inch electric, Model 1630A actually requires the S58, even though entering that make and model into Amazon's Search field brought us directly to this listing.  Unfortunately, we only discovered the mismatch when our shipment arrived and we found that it was not listed on the back of the carton containing the chain.  A visit to the Oregon website (also suggested on the carton but nowhere in this listing) revealed that the S58 is the correct choice.....even though the description and photo of the S58 at Amazon states "Fits Echo, John Deere and Sears Chain Saws" with no reference to Remington!!! The Amazon listing for S58 contained an advisory to first check the selector guide at Oregon.  That advisory is not included on this listing!  So, it did not do me much good to shop on Amazon versus visiting the local "big box store" when their listing resulted in the shipment & my return of the wrong product!  Are you going to reimburse my time/$$ to return 3 chains?  Come on guys!  Do you really monitor the responses to your "Did we miss anything?" links?UPDATE  (12.7.2013): Well!  I have already heard back on my return (it really pays to use the "return function" that can be found under your "orders history")and have received a complete refund!!  The email reply also promised this issue would be forwarded through channels.  Hopefully, this will result in a hyperlink being inserted below, with an advisory to first verify exactly which chain fits your saw make and model.  BIG TIP NOT EMPHASIZED ENOUGH EVEN AT THE SELECTOR SITE:  "count the number of drive links in the chain you have now, and write that number down someplace where you can find it".  S56 chain has 56 drive links while S58 (and our Remington's old chain)has 58!!I my case, the selector guide gave 4 different alternatives of 58 drive link chains for the electric saw we use behind the garage to cut up wood for splitting.  Since I have years of seasonal experience, and use a large, gas-powered, chain saw with an aggressive style of Oregon chain to fell and section trees in the woods, we chose the aggressive style chain (WARNING: this = "far greater chance for kick-back and IS NOT for the unwary user") which was also available at Amazon.com (not the S58 but the 91VXL058G).Lastly, this disappointment is one of the very few I have experienced in my many years and many $$ spent as a customer of Amazon. I use Oregon chains on my big Stihl saw, and have found that they cut a long time before dulling, and can be filed or re-sharpened many times over.  Recommend them highly.PS to the guy with the Poulan Pro...OMG!!!  For kicks and giggles, I looked up your saw on the selector guide.  There were some 15 or more choices and some were 56 link and others 58 link.  Yours is the best example I can see, where knowing to count drive links on the current chain is soooooooo important.
I don't have any problems with this and neither do the birds. We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives, they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway, I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it, then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors (sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet, ask me how I know).I have not found it difficult to clean. Once refilled I take it out again, still upside down, and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out. Then just screw it back in to the cap.

I've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears.  I've tried decorative blown-glass ones, lightweight plastics ones, and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies, including Garden Treasures and this one, Perky Pets.  I've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards.  If I could keep away ants, then I couldn't dissuade the bees.  And ultimately, each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods.  Finally, however, I think I've found The One, although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version (4 parts water, boiled, to 1 part sugar).  There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I'm giving this feeder five stars because it's the best I've encountered after eight or so attempts.  It's not perfect, but it's darn close.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
I am using this with the Audubon Hummingbird Food packets. It is easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning. I am in a serious competition in my neighborhood with many hummingbird feeders and mine is quite popular. We can sit on our deck and within a few feet the hummers come and feed and are interested only in that and hassling each other.
THEY LOVE THIS ONE. IT'S THE CADILAC OF FEEDERS. IF MOLD BUILDS UP IN THE GLASS JUST FILL WITH DILUTE CLORINE BLEACH AND LET STAND FOR A FEW HOURS. IT WILL CLEAN IT UP.AND WHEN YOU FILL IT TRY AND STAND VERY STILL BY THE FEEDER AND YOU CAN OBSERVE THEM FROM ONLY INCHES AWAY. IF YOU DON'T MOVE, THEY CAN'T SEE YOU. BUT DON'T TOUCH. THEY'RE MUCH TOO FRAGILE.
July 28, 2012 Update"Talk about discrimination.  Our bunch so far this year has grown to 5 and they are just as much fun to watch as before.  This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard's other two feeders.  The key to this year's success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full.  I am here to simply order two more.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.April 29, 2012:  They're back and still as beautiful as ever.  This year so far only two have shown up and I cannot determine their sex or anything.  They are still skittish and will not come to me as in the past.  It takes time.  They use these Perky-Pet 209s almost exclusively even though there are 2 other brands up.November 18, 2011:  Just a quick update.  The feeders are down, the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well.  After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best.  I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule.  No leaks.  No broken roosts.  Nothing negative.  My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside.  I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well.  Can't wait for springtime and their arrival.In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet.  We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back.  With all factors the same, i.e., sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why.  They will not tell me.  When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there.  I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food.  When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food.  When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less.  Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones.  The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip.  If simple, hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care.  We use 1 cup sugar to 4 cups boiled water cooled to room temperature.  The hummers are absolutely delightful and thank you Perky-Pet for the 209s.
I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older Perky Pet, 4 flower models.  The old 4 flower model has a design flaw which sometimes led to dripping and also attracted ants and wasps.  The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well.  It is over-sized for our needs, so I just fill it with less food.  Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.  A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers, fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top. It works great, the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days!I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent, highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010, Just bought my 3rd...
It's spring and time to bring out the hummingbird feeder.  This is one of the most popular models and there are lots of reasons.  It's a simple design, has six feeding stations, has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces!  I've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder (wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind).  Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are, the more you'll have to refill the syrup.  Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar' is good stuff, but seriously, a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick.  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.To enhance your hummingbird traffic, supplement it with plants that look great.  The following are some of my favorites for various reasons:Butterfly Bush - comes in blue, ruby, pink and purple and attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.Bottlebrush - small evergreen tree or shrub.  Attracts hummingbirds, but can be messy with its flowers.Fuchsia - comes in bright red or purplish color and is great to hang next to your feeder and attracts hummingbirds.Morning Glory (vine) - multi-color attracts hummingbirds and grows quickly.Flowering red Currant - colorful background shrub that attracts hummingbirds, as well.Note that all these plants grow well in California, so check your local nursery for other suggestions.
Purchased these replacement yellow bee guards (which differ in shape from the image on the Amazon site &#8211; the guards now have a semi-globe shape), because I have the careless habit to walk out of the house and walk across the lawn, with a newly cleaned and filled hummingbird feeder held upside down.  On occasion, after a forgetful moment, I re-install the freshly cleaned bee guards before I reach the hummingbird location.  Once in a while, the bee guards have dropped out (and customarily I located them again.)  The last time I didn&#8217;t.  Long story, irrelevant to the product review, I just realize.  Be it as it may, I have no issues with the bee guards, nor (more importantly) do the hummingbirds.  This past season, the guards functioned flawlessly, to the delight of our hummingbird population (and frustration of the yellow-jackets.)  The only time (no joke) the bee guards didn&#8217;t &#8216;make it&#8217;, was when a black bear roamed the property and totally demolished all of our hummingbird feeders (no joke &#8230;)  I don&#8217;t expect Perky-Pet to take that into consideration (sarcasm.)
For the appropriate hummingbird feeder(s), these little guards are a &#34;must have&#34; if you are going to keeps bees and other insects from seriously messing up your feeders.
My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Excellent packaging!Quality of Gauge was evident -- solid brass fittings, clear 0-200 lb. increments and metric scale (atmospheres).A special Flat Rubber Washer (included) prevents leaks and helps keep water out of the housing. BE SURE the flat rubber washer is in place and fitting is tight to the spigot or manifold before water is turned on !! Don't dare lose that Flat Washer, 'cause a regular Hose Washer won't work !!IF you have installed the Flat Washer and tightened the Fitting properly before turning on the water -- and you see water inside the gauge, turn it off and SEND IT BACK as defective. Amazon's Returns Policy is the best in the on-line retail business, so it's a hassle-free deal to get an exchange or refund.Good Luck !!
This pressure gauge was almost half the price the one from home depot, but so much nicer - solid construction and does not leak. Seems to be accurate too.
This is a great little item to have when traveling from place to place.  I have a regulator on my hose but it is nice to know what the water pressure is  in cases where I had to take my regulator off to service it.  Gives one a little peace of mind so you don't worry about blowing your lines.
If you are going to install a sprinkler system than you will need to know your PSI. This does a great job at letting me know where I stand. Now I can plan out my system.
This was purchased to measure my water pressure so that I know what the psi in order to install a back yard irrigation system.  This gave me an idea on what to spec out during the purchasing of sprinkler equipment.  The gauge is made of metal and can be screwed into your garden bib or faucet.
Hose remnants at the local big hardware stores are insanely priced.Not so with this unit! Great price and solid quality!
This is a very well made product and is a good length for connecting portable hose reels to the spigot. I will buy this product again when needed.
I purchased three of these via Amazon (free delivery) for $8 each and back for more. Great value! I use them in combination with a 4 way connector set and adjustable sprinklers to water each of my raised garden beds with just one quick turn of the hose. Not only are they a much better quality than the sets supposedly created to do the same thing but the price is competitive too. Just the right size to daisy chain sprinklers and reduces the time required to tend the garden...perfect for raised garden beds where regular sprinkler system might be over-kill.UPDATE - I noticed many people complaining over quality...for the record I received the Black hose remnants as pictured. From the sound of it, there are various colors and quality issues. The black ones are very good quality with brass fittings.
Our 50-foot Gilmour hose was just slightly too short to reach the garden, so I picked up this "remnant" for those additional couple of feet - it works like a charm.  Pretty good price.  Not the highest quality hose out there (thin, rubbery and could kink), but is perfect for my use and great VALUE.  The one I got was just like the picture - black in color.
For a reasonable price these remnants proved fine for extending one pesky hose that was just a little bit too short.
Use these to hook up various pvc connections in my garder watering system.  Great length and price on these remnant hoses.
This was a recommended addition to my purchase of the "Frigidaire FAD704DWD Energy Star 70-pint Dehumidifier".  I use a gravity drain to a French Drain in the basement.  The dehumidifier is about 10' from a hole into the drain and this hose did the job nicely.  It comes rolled up and I had to run hot water thru it and then lay it out on the blacktop driveway in the hot sun to get it to lay straight.
Absolutely the best brush I've used.  The brush head doesn't go flat like others I've used and it does a great job at keeping my Weber clean.
As grill brushes go, this is pretty nice. The extra-long handle is great for doing a burn-off cleaning, and the metal clip is perfect for cleaning off the cast-iron grills available on the Genesis.Amazon's price is also 50% less than every store I've seen this at (Sears, True Value, etc.), so I may pick up a couple more as spares.
Before, when I went to buy a new brush I would always get the cheapies; I thought they were all the same, except some came in plastic while others came in wood or aluminum. I was wrong. You do get what you pay for when buying a grill brush, so buy this one! The bristles are stiff enough to clean up all the grit, yet soft enough to not damage your grate. The brush feels nice and sturdy, it feels well built. Also, this brush has a handy scraper on the end which is extremely handy with the really tough crusties (on your GRILL silly).
Bought this specifically for tailgaiting and it was perfect. We made sliders then made hot dogs and it cooked very well. Nothing but the best from weber!
I bought this grill primarily for when we go camping. This grills is ultraportable and it's a Weber so it will last.priced right with free shipping is a winner in my book!
There is plenty of grill space to hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, steaks or shrimp kabobs. Easy to regulate the heat using the vents.  Love that the lid can hang on the grill to block the wind or just rest there while flipping your food....frees both hands!
We love charcoal, we just do!  This little grill is good for our camper and the bottom feet fold up to hold the top on while in transit.  I love Weber, and this is a winner.
Bought it for camping and it is perfect.  The legs hold the lid down for transport.  And it has Weber quality construction.  Love it.
For years, I've been using a larger 22" weber grill, but when I moved recently I decided to get one a bit smaller to conserve charcoal.  After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews, I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver.  It is absolutely unbeatable, and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye!  While it doesn't have an adjustable-height grilling surface, it's quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you're looking for.  I've been able to sear fish, or slow-cook buffalo wings, just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement.  I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal, not briquettes, and both work equally well in this grill.  Cleaning is a breeze, and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago, hasn't even come close to needing it.As far as build quality goes, I really like the solid feel of the grill overall, but the legs could stand to be a bit sturdier.  They aren't as weak as some reviewers have said, but it certainly is the weakest point of the grill as a whole.  The plastic handle has never gotten too hot to handle, not as some reviewers said.  The diameter of the grill could stand to be about 1/4" larger, to keep it from wiggling around so much when you're brushing it.  The vents constructions seems fantasic, they are easy to open and close, yet stay put when you need them to.  Having easy access to both top and bottom vents allows for lots of experimentation with cooking temperatures.  I love this grill to death, and I point out that fact to my fiance every time i use it ("see, i told you this thing is friggin' awesome!").  Even when I buy myself a much larger charcoal grill in the near future, I will still use this grill every time I'm only cooking for 1 or 2 people.
In my opinion and as well as thousands of other Weber owners, this is a great product. I have had 3 or 4 of these little units that I just leave behind and have never had a problem with one.
Ive had this same grill for about 8 years now and its as nice now as the day I got it. Its big enough to cook pretty much whatever you need to cook on it, of course if you have a lot to cook it may take a little longer. Ive always had everything cook very evenly with more than sufficient burn time with coals. This grill is also small enough that you can take it with you for camping or going on your boat for a bbq on the beach (I just use a bungy cord to secure the lid) . If I need to rid of the coals I just put water on them turn the grill upside down and cover the coals in dirt, if the grill is still hot ill throw some more water on it then wipe it down and off we go..This grill isnt heavy so you can easily dump out the ashes in your trash can or where ever with minimal effort. Very great grill for the price and perfect for pretty much anyone!
I bought my first Smokey Joe in 1992.  I am finally replacing him... not because he wore out, but because I tore him apart to use the pieces for something very important.  (It's a long story... Smokey Joe was all I had or I would have been outside all night in my car).  Anyway, I am now replacing my first SJ with another.  I'm quite certain he will be chillin' and grillin' with me for the rest of my life.
I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also, there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us, it&#8217;s easy to assemble, it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go.
Hurricane Irene was on its way and our gas grill was DOA. Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime, because I didn't think to order a grill until a few days before the storm; it arrived on Friday.  We lost power early Sunday morning and did not get it back until this Saturday.  There are only three of us, so this was just the right size for us -- you can fit three to four burgers on the grill at a time.  It was simple to put together and very easy to use -- just roll 4 or 5 sheets of newspaper loosely, place them in the bottom of the kettle, put in about 30 briquets in a pyramid shape, light the papers and the charcoal is ready to use in about 20 minutes.  Spread the charcoal out evenly  and place the grill in place and you are ready to go.  There's an instruction booklet included.  It was really a lifesaver this week and will be used regularly from now on.  It's easily portable for camping trips, too.
You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people.
Okay, I'm an addict and this is actually my fourth Weber grill...I buy one every four to five years, use it often, treat it poorly, and when it starts to show signs of age, I simply spring for a new one. Until I discovered the Weber, I seldom even got a year out of my grills - so this is quite an improvement for me. The quality of the product, and the results I get, are topnotch, and today, I wouldn't consider any other brand (except maybe a built-in Hastings - but that's another animal altogether).I go back and forth between the 22.5 inch and the 26 inch version. The 26 is more expensive, but it offers quite a bit more cooking area. It also uses quite a bit more charcoal, and to my eyes, it doesn't heat quite as evenly. Instead, I've settled on the 22.5, and on those relatively rare occasions when I need more grilling area, I just run a second grill.One thing I especially like is that Weber is so popular, you can get replacement parts just about anywhere. It's nice to know that if I open the grill in the Springtime and the grates are all rusty, I can zip over to the local hardware store and probably find an exact replacement.This time I went for the blue version, but otherwise it's the same Weber I've come to love. Easy to clean, rugged - and it cooks as well as anything out there. I'm not a fan of gas grills...they simply don't seem to get hot enough for certain uses. But with the Weber and some quality charcoal and you're all set, no matter what's on the menu.Only very small complaint is that I've had some problems with the paint peeling off under the top cover. In the past, once I noticed this happening, I simply scrubbed all the loose paint off with a wire brush...curious to see if this one has the same problem.Really recommended!
I'm not even sure where to start!  I've wanted to add a charcoal grill to my outdoor cooking fleet for many years just for those few times that I'd like to cook more naturally.  I've used this one 2 times so far and can't believe I've waited this long.  I think it's saved me over $1000 I was going to spend to replace my 10 yr old gas grill.This grill and a couple Weber accessories make charcoal grilling a breeze!  I haven't grilled with charcoal in years and obviously I had cheap junk for grills in the past.The quality of the grill is great, but I expected that.  I can see it lasting years and years as many others have attested to.  I'll easily use it even during the week when I don't have the time I thought it would take and thought gas was easier for.  The first use and trying to get used to charcoal again was almost a failure because I almost choked the heat down keeping the vents closed.  When I realized that the steaks slowed down cooking and the kettle top got wet from condensation it hit me that I had the vents closed thus the fire couldn't breath.  All I had to do was open the vents and 'viola, in no time the heat was back up and going strong with no other help from me, just air.Yesterday I outdid myself with ribs. Although I did cook them a little to high, they were the best I've ever done both falling off the bone and the best flavor I've ever gotten.  I was using Mesquite chips as well but I've done that on a gas grill and cooked twice as long and didn't get near the same results.  It's amazing how the kettle makes all the difference in the world keeping the charcoal hot and lasting a long time.  I'm amazed!Clean up is much easier than I expected.  The ash catcher is awesome, even in high gusty winds.  Access though the grill for adding fuel makes adding briquettes and wood a breeze.Assembly was easy and took less than 20 minutes taking my time.The only con I can come up with was that on the top handle, it came out of the undamaged box with a chip of the porcelain coming off as if it had been hit.  It's small and by the handle and not exposing the metal so it's not a functional problem but with the box arriving in perfect condition, it's obvious it happened before being packed.  However, I'd be surprised if anyone could find it.All I can say is that I'm sold!!  Everything Weber that I've bought, from the grill to the accessories, have been top notch. Charcoal grilling is now a breeze and so much better than gas.  The old saying is absolutely true; having the right tools make all the difference in the world.  The Weber Kettle is absolutely the right tool!!  Being made in the USA is the cherry on top!To address some of the complaints in the lesser ratings:The handles don't get hot.  As hot as mine has been, the handles are easy to hold with bare hands, although I tend to use a mitt around a grill.  The new handles should last in any weather condition and much longer than wood as well.It would be nice to have a temp gauge but that's not hard to add if you really need one.  I can see the benefit but it's limited.The Kettle is not unstable if it's put together right.  If it falls apart after assembling, the legs aren't being secured fully as they should be, which is to tap them all the way in.  Rolling it isn't a problem but like with most anything, you have to be careful.  Depending on which way you roll it, one might be able to knock it over if not careful, but I've not found that to be easy to do.  Standing, it's as stable as can be.  Again, if it's wobbly or falls apart as one has claimed, the legs were not assembled properly.The lid DOES have a hook to hang on the side of the kettle; it's on the underside of the top near the vent.  It hangs nicely on the side of the kettle.
We have a similar model One Touch Premium home (Germany) and the quality of Weber pays off. I brought the old chinese bbq to trash today ;-).The Weber is very solid build and comes ready to go with drop pans and charcoal holders (wires). Bought a chimney from Weber since the reviews were so good. Tried direct and indirect, keep on training.Will not to back to chinese quality again.Since we live in Northern Germany usage of this bbq is limited to summer time, completed with a Q200 grill.
Our gas grill finally rusted out after 15 years. I was ready to spend $700 on the 320 but started asking myself why? Grilling outside is for leisure, take your time, relax and enjoy the flavor. So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years!This grill is so easy to use. I didn't get the chimney starter, I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine. I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes. The ash collector is fantastic, the ashes don't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes. I got blue, it really looks great. The little hook inside the lid makes it easy to set it aside so you have both hands.This is going to be a great summer - now if we could just get some sun here in the NW!
Order this blue grill a week ago and got a defect with 2 big black dent on the side on the cover exposing the inside metal. I was a little disappointed. Try to contact Amazon customer service on the web and was amazed that they have a "please call me" service. I just typed in my phone number and they call me right away. The return for a replacement is painless and they order a new one for me right away. All I need to do is put the damaged grill in the original box, re-tape it, leave it outside my front door. UPS was here the next day, pick up the box and return to Amazon. That was really easy.I finally receive my new blue grill today. It is perfect and only took me 10 minutes to assemble it. The ash tray needs a little adjustment with a plier and now it is working perfectly. I have ordered a work table and putting it in is a snap.  I also got the smokenator and it fit perfectly inside the grill. Try the cover and it fit perfectly and no gap in between with everything in place. I am a happy camper and ready to do some bbq this weekend.  The blue color looks really nice in my backyard for an extra $10.So do not get despair if you get a defect, just keep returning and you will eventually get a perfect one. It worth the wait.I am glad that I only need to return it one time. On my reasons of return, I mention this grill is defective and should not put back on the shelve and send to other customers. I also contact Weber and let them know about this so they can improve their product quality control in the future before boxing their products and send to the distributor.Hope this help and good luck.
We ordered this for the FIRST time on February 5, 2010.  My husband was so excited and rushed out to buy charcoal, cleaning brushes, etc.  When we got it and he opened the box we discovered one of the handles was bent, and there was a large section that had no protective paint over it, making us fear it would rust prematurely.  Needless to say we were disappointed.  He boxed it up and I called Amazon, and they were great!  They immediately sent us a return packaging slip, and placed a new order (at upgraded two day shipping no less) for us.  So, once we got all that straightened out and got the second one (which looked great by the way) we unpacked it and looked forward to making the chicken we had prepared.My husband put it together and brought it over to me and I must say, the blue looks a heck of a lot cooler than the basic black!  This is the upgraded model with the reservoir for ashes, and while I don't do a lot of grilling, my husband really appreciated this aspect of the grill.It was easy to put together, and Weber has a wonderful reputation when it comes to grill products.  The chicken we cooked on it came out wonderfully, though we have had a gas grill for the past few years, so the extra time a charcoal grill takes will take some time to get used to.All in all well worth the money.//Update March 2013: Wow. Has it already been over 3 years? I guess it has. This grill is still going strong. We clean it regularly, and keep it covered with one of the standard Weber grill covers. It has no rust and still cooks some great food. The ash catch is an absolute must have with the charcoal grills. Still very pleased with this purchase. Especially seeing as we've had other grills fall apart in little over a year.
I love BBQ. For convenience I have often used a gas grill, but really do love the taste of meat cooked over charcoal (PAH and NCA risks notwithstanding). I have often cooked turkey breasts for Thanksgiving, and particularly love the smokey flavor that comes with it! Alongside baked potatoes and fresh veggies (extra nice on the grill), I have a special meal that is actually healthy.So when my last gas grill bit the dust, we went back to the old fashioned way of cooking! Real charcoal, real delicious smell, real delicious flavor! I suggest that you consider using theWeber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter, so that you can have the purest taste without any chemical oders.A funny thing happened when a dear friend came by to visit ... Her son was entranced by the fact that we didn't have any fuel for our BBQ.  Times change, but old fashioned flavor doesn't. This grill made  the move with us recently and now sits on our new deck waiting for spring, or at least a nice sunny day!
Great Product! Makes it fun and easy to Bar-B-Que.I have a Weber Gas Grill and use it all the time. However when I want that real charcoal flavor nothing beats this Weber Grill. The ashes just fall into the bottom for easy removal.A great product and reasonably priced.
This is my second Weber...the first lasting me about 7 years. We like charcoal (instead of gas) and the Weber is a wonderful all-around grill.
When it came time for us to get a new charcoal grill I searched every site and checked out dozens of different grills, some costing many hundreds of dollars, all promising some advantage.Some units were really interesting, and not too expensive, but upon close inspection many of these proved to be tinny and cheaply made. The very expensive systems were very nice, but did not offer rotisseries and other useful accessories and were just too expensive for us anyway.So, we ended up with another Weber, the Gold Model. In the many years since our last Weber, there have been a lot of improvements that kept it attractive. The ash catcher really does make cleanup much easier and the vent system is more functional. The grill itself has the new flip-up hatches that allow you to add more coals and move them around without having to lift up the grill. I did that all the time with the old grill.The optional little bent-wire style of charcoal retainers do help to keep the coals out to the side when you want to use a drip pan in the center.Others have recommended the chimney style charcoal start for ecological reasons. It is also just plain faster to use as well, and it is made of heavy gauge metal that is both attractive and long-lasting.I love the optional rotisserie (see those reviews) and it comes with an extension ring that is also useful for other cooking options.We got the green colored kettle and it looks very nice on the patio. The general design and those odd white-wall tires give it a kind of vintage look.This is a well-made and very functional grill with all sorts of interesting available accessories that really work well. There is a reason for the popularity of the Weber. I looked, I bought. Hard to beat................Update 7/2012. Still good, used daily all summer and even in the rain under my porch cover. Something I came up with that could be interesting to the more dedicated user. I essentially bought a downed oak tree and have been splitting it for firewood for next winter. Had a lot of small, crooked, knotty, twisted pieces that couldn't easily be split. I cut them up into 1" cubes on a band saw, hoping to use them as briquettes in the Weber. A newspaper sprinkled with cooking oil got them started in the Weber chimney starter quite quickly. The secret is to be a bit patient so that they stop flaming and turn to glowing coals. And then you have a genuine oak BBQ, just like on a ranch. Very good, but a lot of work and dangerous enough even on a band saw. And it messes up the blade and rollers. The other more accessible method would be to simply start an oak campfire in the Weber, using regular old pieces of oak like you would in a fireplace. It would take some time to burn down to coals, but even more of an excuse to drink too much and then burn the food because....well, everyone has done this. Right? Anyway, flaming oak imparts a kind of bitter taste while glowing oak coals make it delicious. I do this research for you.__________________________Update 2, on cooking an expensive steak. This works and requires no skill. I went out and bought the most expensive steak ever, an organic, grass fed, free range whatever ribeye at a boutique market and the attractive butcher girl probably had her thumb on the digital scale besides. I about died when I saw the price. Hmmm, can't afford to cook this any way but perfectly.I once saw a YouTube video on how to properly cook a steak using high heat and this is my BBQ grill interpretation of that.Use the coal retainers to block off a section of the lower grill and fill up that smaller portion with lots of hot coals. It cannot be too hot in this case.Put on the cooking grill and let the previous session's grease flame off, which of course also heats it up hotly and is somewhat entertaining and makes you feel guilty about what you are eating...Put on the steak. Having those long tongs helps a lot. You can rub it with olive oil if you want, but it is unclear to me if that is necessary and it causes more flame-ups. No BBQ sauce though. Lid off! Deal with the flame-ups by maneuvering the steak around. Some people use a water spray. This is hands-on, attentive work.Stand by. It will cook fast. Have your other food well under way. Within minutes the down side will have that crust of goodness, short of burnt of course. Turn it over and do the other side. When that side is seared, remove the steak and insert a digital cooking thermometer, taking care to place it in the very center, from the side (not stabbed in from the top).  I use a Polder and the line from the sensor to the display seems to hold up in high heat, but don't string it out over the coals. Run it out the back. Set the alarm for 130.Put the steak back over the un-coaled area. The effect now is that this is a very hot oven, not a grill. Put on the lid, make sure all vents are open. Watch the temp rise, amazingly fast so don't wander off.Remove the steak, with tongs, to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil, resting it as they say on cooking shows. By the time everything else is served up, maybe 10 minutes or so, it should be ready to serve.This gives you a steak that looks exactly like the ones in advertisements, medium rare with a great crust.  You can throw it back on and in a couple of minutes the temp and doneness will go up. There is no shame in putting food back on the fire, but there is shame in over-cooking it! If you paid the big bucks for your meat, burning it will make you cry.BTW, this works for other meat like thick cut pork chops (thick ones are easier to cook properly). Use the same method, but run the temp up to 140-145 (145 being the new govt standard, and in fact it is the standard for all meat other than poultry. If you were brought up on thin, over-cooked pork chops (we all were) you have a revelation coming. Chicken parts don't require the high heat, but a quick sear and off the the oven part works very well for them.It is suggested that the steak be served with salt and pepper, applied after it is cooked as it may be a bad idea to subject the salt and pepper to high heat. The more expensive the meat, the less you should put on it. Cooks always suggest kosher salt and it is indeed very good for this, and ground pepper is better as well. I really think BBQ sauce is too much for expensive beef, but if you want to fancy it up, slowly heat up some butter and garlic and let it meld together. Strain it and serve it on the side, or simply pour it on. What the heck, you have already gone well over the fat grams or whatever for the month anyway...If you have to cook more than maybe 3 or 4 large steaks, you could fill the entire bowl with coals and then finalize them in the kitchen oven set very high, like 450, and with the temp probe stuck in the most representative steak. This gives you 90% of the grilling experience and taste.
I have used a number of different charcoal grills, and the Weber Gold is the best.  Unless you want to spend twice the price and buy the Weber Performer, which is a Weber Gold with gas ignition, table, and a place to store charcoal. Not sure why you would want to store charcoal outside where it can absorb moisture, but that is another story.First off the Weber is made with a thicker steel, so it retains the heat better than the cheaper, lighter, offshore made products.  The grill is heavier, so you can get more than one season out of it.  The ash catcher is great.  Its a must have feature.  Other units get ashes all over my deck, which is unacceptable, and a fire hazard on windy days.My Weber Gold is about 10 years old.  I replaced the cooking grate once.  It still functions perfectly.  It lives outside and only has one tiny spot of rust, where the cover got hit with a rock and it chipped the paint.  One day I will get around to sanding and painting that spot so it lasts another 10 years.  The aluminum portions of the grill are a little weathered, but still function perfectly.  I guess if I really wanted to I could polish them up, but a little oxidation does not bother me.The only downside I can even think about is the top handle.  It is plastic, not wood.  Sometimes it gets too hot to handle so I have to use a potholder if I am cooking at a very high temperature.  Other than that, it is the best charcoal grill on the planet.Sure you can buy one cheaper, but they will not last.  Buy a Weber and you will leave it to your children when you die.  And they will get many years of use out of it too!
This grill works great. I love the one touch ash disposal feature. Have purchased the Rotisserie attachment also, and I LOVE what these two peices of equipment do to my Roasting Chicken!!  It will Rotisserie a small Turkey also, leaving it so jucy and tender. Will be using this for many years to come.
I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time, finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time, we cooked a lot of meat, pepper, corn and etc, it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it, it's gonna get a lot more use this summer.
You can grill/ bbq/ smoke just about anything shy of a half a large animal on this. Im glad I went with the 22.5. Will move up to the 26 later when needed. There are so many things you can do with this when adding other attachments (smokenator, rotisserie, pizza oven, iron grates, wok, skillet, the list goes on).
This BBQ grill lives up to everything written about it and the quality is quite good. The new feature of detachable ash catcher is definitely worth having. This grill cooks burgers and steaks to perfection, once you get accustomed to how to arrange the live coals (using more or less heat, etc). I would recommend this grill for anyone wanting an excellent charcoal grill.
This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years.
Easy to assemble, though I will admit that one of the wheels keeps popping off the side when i roll it around my patio.  But then again, i rarely have to move the grill so it's not like it's a big deal.  The grill is large and easy to clean and the thing that stands out most with this grill is the ash-catching compartment on the bottom.  Plus my steaks taste way better using this thing compared to my previous grill which used propane
I purchased this grill, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter, it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill, so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned.
I bought this for the simplicity of clean up.  I wish the kettle had an adjustable coal grate to lower or make higher the direct heat.  It takes a while to get it just right with the right amount coal.  But overall great quality.
This is the best charcoal grill I have ever owned. I have cooked ribs at 225-250 and been able to control the fire easily. I used the 2-2-1 method on a rack of baby backs and never had to think about adding charcoal over 5 hours. By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes.  The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak.  I feel comfortable cooking on my wooden deck because of the ash pan. The only addition i would make is the Craycort cast iron grate.
That title was sarcasm, in case you missed it.When we bought a house almost fourteen years ago, I brought along a Weber Smokey Joe grill I had used when I was single.  We used it for the first several months of our marriage as our only grill.  Then we bought a Weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill for our new backyard.  We have used it regularly ever since.  It works for indirect cooking of roasts and chickens, it works for direct grilling burgers, chops and sausages, it works for roasting chiles and it works as a fire pit to burn hardwood logs to fuel my large offset firebox smoker.  This grill has been out in the weather without a cover for 13 years or so and it has held up beyond reasonable expectations.  Only within the past few months has the use, age and abuse begun to take a toll.  There are several spots where the porcelain has worn away that are rusting through or already have rusted through.  The wooden handles dry rotted away.  The nuts holding the aluminum airflow disc adjusters at the bottom of the kettle rusted off.  And I'm still using it.  I did a steak and some pork chops last night, using lump charcoal and pecan hardwood chunks I chopped up myself.  They were delicious.I also have a gas grill that is convenient but does not even come close to giving the good taste you can get from charcoal and wood fuel.  Trying to use a smoker box on a gas grill is futile for me.  You can't adjust the airflow through a gas grill.  The only adjustment is the level of the flame.  I constantly find the wood chips either just burn up quickly without producing much smoke or they never heat up enough to start smoking at all.  The gas grill doesn't get much use at my house.I also use an offset firebox smoker.  It's great for doing large size pieces of meat or poultry or multiple pieces of smaller items.  It does require frequent attention to keep the fire going and the temperature within the proper range.  Honestly, the Weber grills can do the same or better job for smaller cuts of meat by cooking indirect.  About the only time I use the smoker is when I have something too large for the Weber.It's time retire the old Weber.  I've already put a One-Touch Gold on my Amazon wishlist.  I think I'll use the old grill as a planter.  I can't imagine throwing it away after all these years.
We had a gas grill for years but opted to go back to a charcoal grill.  This Weber grill made our decision easy.  Outstanding medium size grill for the two of us grilling several items and works well for 4 or more depending on what you need to prepare on the grill.  Suggest using the Weber Rapidfire Chiminey for starting your briquets...it's great and makes your job not only easier but the food taste better without the use of starter fluid.  Great grill....great name behind it!!
I wish I'd bought one of these the day I first moved out on my own! For years I got by with a ridiculously tiny hibachi -- one day I found myself living in the suburbs and somehow rationalized BUYING A REAL BARBECUE! Due to my dyed-in-the-wool cheapness and extensive researching before buying, it was inevitable that I'd end up with a Weber 22.5" Silver Kettle Grill!YES the little tray on the bottom end is a pain in the neck. But I can't say it's really ever bothered me ALL that much! You'll want to use a charcoal chimney to light your coals -- I used to build a little fire with newspaper and sticks but the charcoal chimney is the way to go, and one chimney will nicely fill the coal area on the Silver Kettle Grill. Do not ever use lighter fluid or fuel-soaked coals. But you already know that.While you'll get the hang of burgers, hot dogs, steaks, chicken and bratwurst right away, make sure to investigate "indirect grilling" where you pile your coals on one side or the other (or both) and put an aluminum tray under whatever you're grilling. Like a pork roast or a whole chicken. The 22.5" Silver Kettle Grill has AMPLE room for everything you'd like to do. Including grilling a turkey! Easy to do plus incredible flavor!I recently acquired a "slide-aside" cradle for the lid which I like a lot,  and a clip-on tool holder, which is really handy. We use the grill several times a week. I've never found it lacking. There are a few techniques you'll pick up to turn out just what you like, such as brining chicken or pork prior to cooking. You really do not have to spend more than this to get an excellent tool which you'll use for years and years to come. Get this larger size, but don't spend more on non-essentials. It's a zen thing. In place of a statue of Buddha, we suburbanites have Weber Kettle Grills in our backyard. Grilling harkens back to caveman days, satisfying something very deep in every red-blooded American -- meat good. fire good. Weber good.Order the hinged lid grate for this size grill -- it's a neat thing to have when you need it. And make sure to try grilled pizza dough -- it doesn't ooze through the grate like you'd think it would and the flavor is incredible.The perfect shape of the Weber Kettle Grill makes operation just about foolproof. Improvise an improved ash catcher underneath (like a big metal bucket!) and you're in business. GREAT product! This is not a frivolous purchase, you NEED one of these!
So, I thought after fiddling with offset grills and barrel grills, it's time to try a kettle grill after all the hoopla from the UPS driver delivering all my other toys.  Well folks, it's worth it.  I had to get a covered grill that wasn't as big as my car for the front porch, after all the hollering by neighbors who saw the smoke billowing from my hibachi.  After all the charcoal experimenting with my barrel grill and its cousins and a Bodum  Fyrkat, I figured, what's new?  Well, a whole lot.  While related to the Bodum, the Weber is a whole lot more versatile, and can, if you wish create a range of flavors and textures.  While the one-touch system was touted as a handy cleaning device, where it really excells is as a controllable oxygen source.  Couple that nicety with movement of the 4-hole vent in the lid and  you control both the intensity of the heated charcoals with directionality.  When you're using indirect heat, the control of the temps lay with the oxygen adjustment, whilst the direction of the heat can determine the moistness as well as the degree of charring of the food.  The heavy steel as well as the brilliantly designed cooking grate that facilitates access to the coals make for a fun time at the cookery.  The Weber is iconic; it deserves that status.
My original Weber is 15 years old and still going strong. Replaced some of the inner parts due to age/exposure. No need for a protective cover, this grill is built to last.  Got this one for a lake house. No need to change from the strong horse.
There are a lot of reviews on this already.  It is definatley a 5 star review.  I have had quite a few different weber products over the years, and this is just one more.  I love the one touch clean out on the bottom of the grill, that is also the vent cover.  The old kettles had a bottom vent that was just like the vent on top.  That little tab would get warmer than you want to touch with your bare fingers.  The new one has a handle that doesn't get too hot to handle.  The vents open easily, and move around the ashes in the bottom, and push them out the vent holes.Just one little piece of advice.  When you are installing the legs, pay attention to which leg goes where.  The one that is different goes in the hole right under the handle.  I hasve both seen and owned grills that have the wrong leg in the wrong hole, and that makes the handle on the side, intstead of the front. It is an easy fix, but easier to pay attention the first time.
I love this Weber One Touch Silver kettle. Seeing the kettles my relatives have, but made years earlier, i am pleased that years later, it still seems to be made with high quality steel, a good enamel and tight engineering. The handles have gone from wood to a resin, but they work well. Grilling or smoking, this unit has proven itself worth the money.I wrestled between buying the Silver or the Gold model, but what swayed me was that on Weber's site, the Silver shows "Made in USA" while the Gold does not. The reviewers for the Gold, here on Amazon, state that the box says "Assembled in USA", or something like that. The Weber site has no mention of any of it. I decided to avoid the issues that some with the Gold were reporting and I went with the Silver. It is very solid and I am glad I did.
I had a Weber Kettle grill 20 years ago.  I had no clue what I was doing, but I still got great results.  Open the vents, put on the dome, and a little while later I had great food.  But I got tired of waiting for charcoal to heat up, and went on to propane.  I never got good results with gas.  After wasting way too many years destroying food on gas grills, I came home to charcoal and Weber.  This time around I know what I'm doing, and the Weber is giving me Fantastic results.  The 22 1/2 kettle is a great all around cooker.  It grills, sears, bakes and does a very good job of "low and slow" smoking.  If you only have the room or desire for one cooker, get this one without hesitation.  It won't smoke quite as good as a real smoker, but unless you're a perfectionist, you'll never know the differance.  The 18 inch grill is a great cooker too, but because it's smaller it's harder to smoke on it.  So if you have the room, get this model.  The lid and bowls are built like a tank.  I found the unit wiggles around where the legs attach, even though I assembled it correctly.  The older ones don't wiggle.  But that's progress.  I don't think it's a problem though, just an observation.  I was torn between 4-5 stars because of that.  They have been building these forever, so assesories and replacement parts can be had easily.Built solid, mutliple uses, food tastes great, easy to use.  Not much else to say.
I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking, use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate.
Bought this small Weber for use by my wife and me since our kids are all grown up nowadays.Easy to assemble, Weber quality as expected. We also bought the cover and are pleased with both.Cooking surface is not large; but, can easily accommodate three steaks and a couple of veggie skewers.
I've had the 18.5 Weber kettle for about 5 years and have been very happy with it. However, anyone shopping for a grill should consider the full-size, 22.5 grill.We bought the 18.5 because our family is small and I figured this would be plenty big enough. What I didn't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn't have the space, even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people, the 18.5 will serve fine but you won't have much versatility.Now that I've "grown" as a griller, I wish I had the One-touch Platinum. This model gives extra space, an ash catcher, temp gauge, sliding lid and 2 side tables. However, my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements. Kinda difficult to justify the new grill when the old one is still in great shape.
Can't beat Weber Grill's for sturdy build and ease of use. Perfect for small get togethers or smaller households. Would recommend easy start charcoal or get a charcoal starter that weber sells and pour the coals in when ready. Charcoal grate is of a very heavy guage and should last for years as well as the cooking grill its self. Some nice accessories to go with this unit:, IE: Heavy Duty Grill cover, Tool Rack, Cutting Board, Bracket for holding lid to name a few. I really enjoy steaks and burgers on this weber! One of the best grills I've ever owned for a evenly grilled and tender sirloin steak! Learning how to use upper and lower vents makes all the difference! Using the direct and indirect methods I grilled/smoked a sirloin tip roast that came out superb with a nice even bark and the mouth watering taste of hickory smoke and a light coating of bbq sauce! Going for ribs next...After reading many reviews on Weber grills, some complain of the ashes clogging the lower vents....duh...clean the thing out after each use! Thats what the ash pan is for...no brainer!!!!
I got this in addition to my Weber Genesis Platinum Grill. I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak, Burgers, Chicken, BBQ Chicken, for a great authentic taste. It heats quickly (Weber Chimney) about 20 minutes. It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and quite stable. Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle. You should never move a hot grill of any kind. It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials. The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors. (I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking). The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent, and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position. I did 2 zone cooking and all worked extremely well.
After owning a couple of those flimsy &#34;bargain&#34; grills, I finally got serious and bought a Weber!  This 18-1/2-inc size is perfect for a few hamburgers or steaks.  The construction is first-rate, and there is no wobbling or flexing when it is moved about.  I suggest making your purchase complete by getting a Weber charcoal starter chimney (go ahead and get the larger size).
