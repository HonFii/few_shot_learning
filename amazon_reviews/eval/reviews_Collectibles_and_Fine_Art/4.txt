This has Giselle with Daisy on an outside basketball course doing the cardio portion. This is mostly old style aerobics. I was very disappointed that there was only 1 cha-cha & samba portion of a larger straight aerobics routines & only for 3 seconds each time done. I got this because I LOVE Giselle from Zumba... she is so young here. She teaches in slow tempo first to show you how a few times, then full tempo.Next is the weights portion on a platform in someone's very expensive backyard pool osasis (Daisy's? The directors?) with hand weights. After is using a chair for some simple leg lifts and working on the mat for basic ab crunches, reverse sit ups, etc. It ends with a nice stretch of the neck, back, etc. with some yoga poses & basic stretches.In  addition, Daisy teaches you about diet tips & takes you on a informative w/humorous trip through the supermarket complete with comedy music.This is great for someone who is new to exercise & like aerobics or for a light day for those who workout regularly wanting to do it all: aerobics/weights/abs/stretch. For those who don't like old school cardio/weights workouts like me, skip it.I gave it maybe too many stars accidentally, but Giselle does have a great personality & good body awareness, and the workout gets straight to the point, no extra talking in between. Compared to other videos, it's pretty good.To get an idea of Giselle Roque de Escobar's personality, check out her  Giselle ABCDs for Total Body Fitness on collagevideo com for a clip since that one has the same style format.
Haven't opened the box yet, better if keep it new.  Seems less cards than when I was a kid, a bit strange since there are more teams now than back in my childhood days.  Still, a good buy.  The value isn't the same as back then, but never know, it could easily go back up.
The fun of collecting is different now than it was back in the 80s when I was young.  Now it's all about the special insert cards that you have no chance of ever getting.  Everything else is a &#34;common.&#34;  Well I buy a set each year for my nephew and have been doing so each year for the last 9... so I'll continue.  Topps is the king... may as well stick with it even though none of this will go up in value.
The Bat Qube, a basic clear case with which to display a bat, is exactly what I was looking for and is consistent with the display cases I have for other bats. The value of the product, not considering its price, is its simplicity. When you display a souvenir, you want the focus to be on the item not the case. That is what you get with this product.
I like the product and the price is great.  Only complaint is that there were no screws or nails provided to hang it on the wall... sort of a bummer but overall great product.  -1 star for packaging not having nails or screws...
PROS: Perfect for stacking or mounting on the wall. Reasonable pricingCONS: Not UV protected. Not very structurally sound (falls apart pretty easily)
I love the way the case showcases the bat, however, I'd give it 5 stars if the ends weren't so easily removed.  If you're not going to display the bat on the wall, the ends have a tendency to fall off and the case comes apart when they do so.
Look good , It would of been better if the design had some type of support in the middle . Great little display cases .
The cards were in great shape. The only issue was having two of the cards already, but I traded those. Great Buy
I recently bough a lot of Michael Jordan Cards and I was surprised because the shipping time was excellent and so the product. There was no Jordan repeted... I'm very happy with it and I recommend it.
Not clearly cheaper than any other deck box, but does exactly what you would want. I would not say that this is a special value or anything, but if you just want a convenient way to transport your cards, this will certainly do the trick.
We purchased this and some other items for him to organize and protect his cards and I don't think he has accomplshed that task yet but he does say he likes this and plans to use it. He is 9 so he may be a bit too young. Not sure.
It is coolmy Oakland A's team set was stolendon't have the money now to get my team set
The overall look of the cards were great and I did get 5 Game Used Jersey cards in the box although they were all semi-superstars.
The cards are older but he got rookie cards for some of his favorite players and cards that are out of print of some of the best players he is in baseball card heaven.
Our son just love them. he said that they are the greatest gift he has gotton. Thank you for taking such care in prepairing this very special collection. I give you a five star rating for quality, and service.
Not a bad selection. The only noncard packs I got this time were pop-ups- & 45 of the 50 packs were wax or foil packs... & they threw in a '89 Bowman Nolan Ryan because I ordered 2 lots! Good job on responding to reviews calling for less sticker/gimmick packs & a nice touch with the bonus Nolan Ryan. Thanks*
He likes baseball cards, and was very excited to get these.  He is 12...and very into baseball...it was a lot of fun going through all of the names and trying to remember the players from my youth.
I was more than satisfied with the assortment of cards.  I pulled several rookies including Donruss Ken Griffey Jr. .  I will order from this seller again.
This Alex Rodriguez rookie card if the most affordable rookie card on the market. It is a good card and in good condition. A great card for the price, but not his best rookie card!
My 12 yr old son loves Topps baseball cards. He will not let me buy any other brand. This will keep him busy for a very long time between organizing, memorizing stats, and drawing all his favorite players.
my husband is an avid baseball card collector. I was pleased that you would have last year as I missed buying them for him last year.
Contains 132 cards, it features 89 First Topps Cards such as2000 Topps Traded Baseball Miguel Cabrera Rookie Cardand2000 Topps Traded Baseball Rocco Baldelli Rookie Cardas well as M. Olivo, Barry Zito, Lyle Overbay, Andrian Gonzalez, and Ben Sheets.Additionally there are some veterans that were traded or signed elsewhere.  Includes one autographed card of one of the players in the set. Fun.
Note - This item is erroneouseoly listed as the Hobby Edition but is really the Retail edition.I purchased this item and much to my surprise it was really 36 packs.  Thats a hell alot of cards.  Every pack has 2 rookies, with some variations or inserts in the rookies cards and I only got 3 repeat rookie cards.  Every Box has at least one autographed or game memorabilia, I got Laurence Maroney's jersey piece.  Additionally every one of the 36 packs has Topps Attax cards which give a code to be used in Topps interactive card collecting experience on the internet (this is mainly geared towards children, which I am not).  But if you are giving this to a child or teenager it adds to the experience giving them 36 Topps Attax cards which will help them in their Topp Attax dominance.  Topps recently added the Topps Gridiron Giveaway program, and I found five cards, which after entering the codes given by the cards on the Gridiron Giveaway website, unlocked five cards from previous years (and when I mean previous, I mean all the way back to the 1970's!).  The possibility of getting one of those Giveaway cards is somewhere in the range of 1:9, so you could average 5-6 cards depending on how lucky you get and these cards are real cards which you could get shipped to you if you so desire, though a majority of the cards are not worth much, their is a chance you could score say a Joe Montana rookie card or some other insert card.  360 cards is really nice, and I only got 4-5 repeats.  For the price, it is a very tempting Box to buy, however you should only expect 1 Autographed or Memorabilia piece but 2 rookie cards in every pack.  Great starter kit for someone, but for those collectors - remember its the retail edition not the hobby edition but even so fellow collectors, it is reasonably priced.
I have opened a total of two boxes of 2010 Topps Chrome baseball this year. Unfortunately, I have only pulled one badly off center (typical for the chrome product) Strasburg base rookie card. You get two rookie autographs per box, which provides some suspense. My rookie autos have all been commons or minor players. I pulled one redemption and the replacement I received was Allen Craig, which is not too shaby. These boxes seem great for breaking under $55, as at that price risk is not too high, but you have the opportunity to pull some real high dollar auto rookies e.g. Strasburg, Heyward, Stanton, et al. My four star rating reflects the solid price point and positive risk / reward ratio.
My son is obsessed with WWE and this tin is his pride and joy! It came with a lot of cards - I think 75. There aren't more that 2 high value silver or gold cards, but the quantity made up for that.The tin itself he loves and has really made his collection special.As usual Amazon delivery was impeccable!
Bought this to pass out to kids on little league team. They were overwhelmed, they just don't make cards like this any more. Some collectors! Well worth the price.
looks like the boxes aren't monitored too closely.  i only got 24 packs, not 25.  that said, it was fun going through and reliving some of my childhood joys.most of the packs are pretty negligible--either being BIG cards, o-pee-chee, or other types that have no potential for any sort of value.i did get a few notable packs: 1 topps stadium club (no good cards, though), 1 upper deck (juan gonzalez rookie--if only it were 15 years ago), a couple leaf packs, an '87 topps (no good cards), and an '86 topps (cecil fielder rookie!...lol).i'd likely do this again for gits 'n shiggles, but would be even more inclined to if I knew there were going to be more packs from '87 or earlier, or premium brands like stadium club or upper deck.
His father assured me that it was perfect for my grandson.  He is at the age where baseball card are a favorite activity.
I love opening packs so any packs a great to me. Unfortunately at this point the random packs don't have a lot for me in my collection needs, but it's fun!!!
Bought these to start our oldest son collecting baseball cards, as they're cheaper then the packs you buy now. We bought two lots, recieved 25 packs per lot. Out of all 50- 22 were from 1987, 1988, or 1989; 28 packs were from 1990 (not the 1990s, but the actual year 1990) There were no card packs for the 90s other then the year 1990 & the 80s before 1987. Unless you get lucky and find any mistake cards you aren't gonna make money on these- but they are great for kids collections.
My 11 year old grandson was really impressed with these cards. There seemed to be many of players that he knew and they had value for him. They were a small addition to his already prettty extensive collection. He decded not to chew the gum.
All packages arrived as stated - unopened and original.  Received mostly Topps (1987, 1989) and Donruss (1989-1991)  One UpperDeck(1991) pack. My son loved opening he packs. Some packs even still came with gum. Yikes! :)  Of course, these are from the late 80's and early 90's, so the cards aren't going to be worth much, as they were over produced.  It is a good starter set.  We got mostly commons with a few rookie cards.
The friend I bought these cards for was very pleased and excited when he opened them--and so was his brother -- they were a huge hit!
Grandsons enjoyed opening-up each and every envelope of these ball cards on Christmas Day.  I purchased plastic sleeves and a binders so they could store the cards for safe keeping.
It seemed like this particular box had fewer &#34;prize&#34; players than other boxes we've given as gifts but it's great gift for boys 8-12 yo
well what would it be like to get someone to cooperate with a simple request to give feedback like this one
I just received this to give as a gift for my boyfriend for my anniversary  Most of the cards contained in the package are from the 90's.  I wish more cards were from the 80s.  It was cool seeing unopened packs of baseball cards with the stick of gum in the package as well.  This will be a great gift!
I was tired of buying packs of cards at the football store hoping to get some players my son recognized...he loved getting the whole team at once!
The item was delivered on time and in the descibed condition. I would definitely shop with them again!  Great card!
Everything was as it was supposed to be..still working on the cards...my grandkids will be here right after Valentine's day.
My 8 year old son loved this gift. He poured over the cards for hours, sorting them, pulling out his favorites, and putting them back in "special spots". Be aware that the box is full - you won't be able to put in any of your other cards you may have. Also the "collector" box is just a plain cardboard box - nothing fancy. This didn't matter to us, and it is a heavy, durable cardboard. The only downside to the gift was that some of the cards were duplicated in the box.
Product was as expected. Packaging could have been better, as they were all just thrown into the box and shipped. Variety of cards as described. Not as many duplicates as others had mentioned in other reviews. However, not many cards of real value. Excellent starter set for a young child, not for experienced collector.
As I stated in the main title, this is the best way ,I know , from Italy, to begin a collection of baseball trading cards! Everytime I purchase it, it is a surprise, mostly a good one and only one or two times I was a little, little disappointed!A must have for the beginner!
The cards I got were pretty well what I expected. All of them were in excellent shape. I loved that there were some cards that came from cereal box specials and others like that. It's a good buy for a kid or someone starting a collection. The only thing I have a problem with is that they didn't actually come in a card box.
This was an average box of average players. Some duplicates and some star players in the box, such as a Reggie Jackson Hologram, Bobby Bonnila, Andy Van Slyke, And a few pre 80's,With a Fred McGriff reprinted auto graph reprint, roberto Clemente Insert all star mvp. I was very impressed with this box!!
I bought these for my husband for Christmas, and they were all in great shape.  I can't wait for him to open this gift on Christmas.  I'm not excited though about putting each card into the pocket protectors lol!
what can it matter if one does not comply with the simple wish that one would fill out a questionaire today
This is actually a very good product for a low buy. I'm an avid collector of baseball cards and have been so I checked out this box. You're guaranteed a good handful of really good cards in each box. I even got an autographed Ozzie Smith Padres card. Mine didn't have the 50's or 60's cards as in the explanation but it's randomized and I'm fine with that. One thing I was concerned with was duplicates being 500 cards and all them being randomized. The only duplicate I had was a David Justice Future Stars card. I'm glad with that and I'd even buy this for myself or anyone looking to start a collection.
These cards really helped me start my collection up. I got some great cards ,but the oldest card I got was from the 70s. I was promised 50s and 60s.Either way I liked the cards and would suggest it to someone trying to start their collection.
Got a lot of good cards. 4 barkys, bird 2 Jordan's, 5 stocktons, magic, Ewing,Julius and many more. Almost 500 cards.
this is a good buy. its cheap and the amount of cards and potebtual value surpasses what you payed here. its very fun to read the packs and see what kind of suprise is inside like a speical card. one word of advice, dont eat the gum lol.
OK, so its all about the rush when you get these and open them up. I got some OK cards but just about everything you get is from sets that really don't have any big value cards in them. So, even the OK cards I got have no value unless it's a player you're really into. I would recommend this for someone getting their younger child into trading cards. It will give them the opportunity to learn how to open and handle cards without the risk of potentially damaging a very high value card.
I thought this was awsome so I ordered some for my 9 and 10 year olds for christmas since they just started collecting. I think they will be up all christmas eve opening football cards. I would have rated a 5 star if they would have been more diverse. They make it sound like your getting cards from all different years. Really all 30 were from 90, 91, and 92. I would have been happier if I could have got a few from earlier and more from 99 or 2000. I think it is gonna be a almost perfect starter pack for my sons.
My 11 year old son was very pleased.  However, I was not pleased that their were a large portion of Canadian League Football cards included.
i ordered this product not expecting that much at all. And although it did not get a wide variety of years (only flaw i have found) there was a wide variety of card packs> I got 2 1992 Pacific Plus, 2 1990 Score Series 1, 2 1990 Score Series 2, 2 Topps 1990 (With Bubble Gum!), 2 1991 Upper Deck, 1 1992 Bowman, 1 1991 Pacific Plus, One 1991 Domino's QB Challenge Promo, 1 1992 Topps Stadium Club, One 1992 NFL Pro Set, One 1990 NFL Pro Set, One 1992 NFL Pro Set Platinum, 2 1990 Fleer Premiere Edition, 1 1991 Fleer Ultra, 1 1991 Pacific Plus Flash Cards (Test Issue, 1 1991 Canadian Football, 1 1992 Limited Edition Draft Picks, 1 1994 Stadium Club, 1 1995 Topps, 1 1994 World League, and 1 1996 NFL Pro MagnetsCard Pack Variety is GreatGoing to Buy Again
I opened the box and was reviewing the cards, making sure I had the complete set and seeing if they were worth anything in Beckett's when I realized I opened a BOXED SET!!  I wish I hadn't of opened it now, as it would be worth more unopened.
Purchased this as a gift for my husband - a huge NY Giants fan.  He will probably place it on his desk at work, so durability is not an issue.  Shipping was timely and product is in excellent condition.  He will love it on Christmas morning!
I bought these for my nephew who loves all kinds of sports cards.  It was an older set which he did not have.  A great purchase that didn't have a bunch of duplicate cards.  He loved the variety of players and teams.
Complete, sealed set of hockey cards.  Almost 20 year old cards.  So many superstars in their youth.  Great for the hockey fanatic or kid that loves to trade and collect cards.
it was worth the money. it showed up quick and was in good shape. i'm happy with my purchase. thanks
Got it about three days after I suibmitted my order. I was very pleased.
Like most sports cards which were (over) produced during this time frame, the 1991 Upper Deck football set has not retained very much value in the collectibles market place.  Yes, it's possible to pull a Brett Favre rookie card from these boxes, and yes, the set is chock full of NFL greats and Hall of Famers.  BUT...that Favre rookie holds a current market value of around $10, and the vast majority of cards your gift recipient can pull from these packs are commons with a value of 5 cents (and they'd be lucky to actually sell them for a penny each).  In other words, while the thought does indeed count, this is NOT a great gift for a serious collector, and certainly not for anyone who would be looking to make a quick profit by breaking this box.This is, however, a wonderful (and affordable) gift for beginning collectors who might like to add some "vintage" cards to their collection, and opening these together would be a spectacular shared father/son (or mother/daughter) activity, as a good way to inject a bit of history into the minds of younger football fans.  The cards themselves are quite attractive (particularly for the era), and you will indeed come across greats like Jerry Rice, Reggie Smith, Michael Irvin, Barry Sanders, Joe Montana, Troy Aikman...the list goes on.  Even as an inexpensive trip down memory lane for 40-something football fans, this could be a hit.One additional tidbit: don't just throw away the box when you're done tearing the packs open.  Upper Deck printed a series of oversized Joe Montana and Joe Namath "cards" on the bottom of each box, which are currently listed at a dollar apiece in Beckett (making them among the most valuable cards in the set).EDIT (before someone nitpicks this in the comments section): Yes, it's theoretically possible to pull a very valuable Joe Montana autographed insert card from this set, but to quote Mean Joe Greene, "Your possibility for success is extremely remote."
These are nice, basic lineup cards.  I like the way the card in organized.  They are a bit on the small side---you have to write small to get a full name in the box.The carbonless copies work very well.  Functionally, a good card---just wish it was a tad bigger.The BEST thing about this set is that the cards come in a plastic box with a clip on the top---like a mini-clipboard.  You can keep your cards and a pen inside the box, which closes tighly enough to keep your cards clean.  AND you have a nice surface on which to write your lineup.  Pretty slick.
Great design. Keeps the unused lineup can r dsl safe from clay, dirt, rain ,coke, and sometimes even me if needed
This is a nice collection of cards, with some stars, mixed with commons. Nice Chipper Jones rookie card, and a couple of Cal Ripken Jr's. for all of us Baltimore fans.  The entire box was in excellent condition.
First of all I love how Topps added the 1984 olympic team. It had M.McGuire, O.McDowle, and C.Snyder first cards in there olympic uniforms. Then has stars like R.Clements, N.Ryan, K.Puckett.
With the set being 792 cards even two boxes might not be enough to build a set.  This is a good way to get all the cards.  The set features 34 Hall of Famers and 10 members of the 3000 Hit club.  Additionally members of Team USA that played in the Olympics are recognized including1985 Topps #401 Mark McGwire USA Olympic rookie nm/mintthat was so popular that it was counterfitted.Good for someone born in 1985 and or a K.C. Royals fan as they won the World Series in 1985.
Sad the market is where it is but still a great box set loaded with memories. Great names out of this box.
I tried to order a fair amount of Micheal Jordans and it seems like you bill shipping for each card, I hope thats an error from amazon, if this can be corrected so I can start to order in a small bulk fashion. Thats near 5 dollars per card via amazon.Thank YouDavid
This coin is decent in a very collectable New Orleans Morgan dollar series.  The patina is okay.  The casing is the very efficient 2&#34;x2&#34; with non-acidic plastic and 3 staples to hold it pretty much airtight, although the rusting indicates either many years of not being handled, or it got wet.
A nice set to complete the 1981 set. The only thing that I did not like was that the back of the cards was the dull cardborad. In latter years topps had the cards made in Irland with the white more glossy back like the tiffany sets.
Here it is, the set with Derek Jeter's most sought after rookie card!!! And while not so much the most scarcest set (some will argue 1993 Score is much scarcer), it is the 1993 SP cards which are the most sought after. They are quite beautiful. Color portraits of baseball players (some with an elegant foil border). The card stock is not the best (easily bent), so be careful with them as a bent corner or other crease greatly diminishes a card's value. And by all means if you get a set keep it in a cool dry place LITERALLY!!! Keep it out of any direct sunlight, and out of any plastic sheets or holders which contain PVC. (pvs discolors cards after a while). If you want the most popular 1993 set of baseball cards, here it is.
Topps Chicago White Sox 2007 Baseball Card Team SetEven though the 2007 White Sox didn't finish up to their potential, the team is still full of talented stars.  Perhaps because of the standings this 2007 team set was selling at a nice discount, so I picked one up.I'm a baseball fan, so I bought a bunch of different team sets. While these sets are somewhat pricey when you consider they only include 13 cards, they are nice for kids or die hard fans like me who may want to collect them as a set.The picures are nice enough, no special graphics to speak of. They do have embossed signatures on them, perhaps useful to compare against autographs if you ever get a real one.The only negative is that they rumble around in the box during shipment. That means the edges of the cardboard backing and even a corner on the plastic front were frayed. So keeping these sealed may not be practical unless you get lucky or buy them retail somewhere you can inspect them. Ironically, out of the first three team sets I bought my White Sox set was in the best shape.Overall, great set.Enjoy!
Topps Boston Red Sox 2007 Baseball Card Team SetThe 2007 Red Sox was loaded with talented players.  And winning the World Series never hurts.  Both of those things make this team set one of the more collectable ones.The pictures are nice, straightforward baseball cards. They also have embossed signatures on them. I think this is standard for these Topps team sets as all three I've gotten so far have signature cards.I'm a huge baseball fan, so I bought a bunch of different team sets. While these sets are somewhat pricey when you consider they only include 13 or 14 cards, they are nice for kids or die hard fans like me who may want to collect them as a set.The only negative is that they rumble around in the box during shipment. That means the edges of the cardboard backing and even a corner on the plastic front were frayed. So keeping these sealed may not be practical unless you get lucky or buy them retail somewhere you can inspect them.My Red Sox set had Matsuzaka's rookie card as the first in the set.  Since it seems that card has been over-printed, it probably won't gain too much value. Still, all the big stars including David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez are here.Overall, great set.  I'm slowly adding to my collection of these sets, and this one is a welcome addition for any hardcore baseball fan.
This is a nice set of 20 different cards from the end of Carl Yastrzemski's career, with many of them from after his induction into the Hall of Fame.  No particularly valuable cards, but a nice set for anyone who really respects Yaz and his career with the Red Sox.
My nephew is 9 and just got interested in basketball. She has become fascinated with Michael Jordan. This set was a nice sampling of all things Jordan was involved in.
I use these cards to give to kids at work and they love it.  Great as a grab bag thing and there are some cool treasures you can find in there.
These cards were so fun for my 9 year old.  Having so many made it quite the adventure as he dove in.  He was able to start a collection of goalie cards just from this.  Many are older players but enough current ones to be fun.
For the price you do get a LOT of cards. However most of them are 15 years old. Was a gift for my 8 yr old nephew so he didn't recognize some of the players. Also contained several duplicates. But did contain a lot of great players/hall of famers cards though. Having said that, he still very much liked his gift (sat for an hour sifting through them all) and this would be great for someone who is starting to collect cards or needs some volume filler. All in all am pleased.
Deliver is quick, got some cards of great players, But most of them was 80,90's, and there is no signature cards.
A lot of people complain, but really its not a bad price for 500 cards. You never know what you are going to get. Everyone keeps saying that the cards are in order. I am a Cardinals fan and I was just happy to get some of them.
Some of the cards in this pack will amaze you. It's an old school way to spend time with your kids, very enjoyable.
I like my purchase. I am a little unhappy woth the fact the collection has several duplicate cards but other than that I really like them. I recommend this item to all card collectors.
The cards come in separate boxes but did get some great cards it's worth the money but might not buy more
I have never been much of a fan for today&#8217;s youth consider as an integral part of American culture. However, I am a collector, and collecting whatever is worth collecting is simply what I do, even of what I&#8217;m collecting doesn&#8217;t make sense to me on a personal level.
From reading some of the reviews on this item, it seems like a few people expect to be pulling Joe Namath rookie cards out of these boxes.  Keeping in mind that exactly what you get will depend largely on which vendor you purchase from, what you should be ~expecting~ to get are a large number of commons and semi-stars from the late 1980s through 1990s, most of them from low-value sets.  That's just fine given the price.I ordered two boxes from A.J.'s Hot Wax.  The shipping was adequate; it seemed like the package hung up for several days between when the shipping label was printed and when it actually arrived at the USPS, but once the postal service got their hands on it, it was delivered promptly.  The cards were delivered in four short boxes.  While I have only fully sorted about 200 of them so far, I can say that I'm pleased overall with the selection, given my reasonable expectations.  There were perhaps half a dozen CFL cards in the shipment which I could have done without, and for some reason the seller tossed in a dozen 1996 Pro Line cards with a large hole punched through them.  Aside from that, the cards were mostly 1991-93 Pro Set and 1991 Upper Deck (low value sets), but a few hundred cards from more desirable issues thrown in as well.  The cards had definitely been sifted through before packaging (understandably), and at some point many had been sorted by team which resulted in my getting an inordinate number of Seattle Seahawks and Philadelphia Eagles cards.  Still, highlights that I've found so far include rookie cards of Warren Sapp and James Stewart.At this point (again, having sorted only about 200 of the 1000 cards) I've already recouped the total cost of both boxes ~and~ shipping, at least in terms of Beckett value, and bulked up my collection with quite a few players who I still appreciate, even if the collecting community as a whole doesn't place much value in them.  I believe that anyone who goes into this purchase with a rational expectation of what they'll receive will be pleased as well.EDIT: Final tally has the contents of both boxes valued at almost $150 according to Beckett's list price, which admittedly is almost always more than you could actually sell them for.  In addition to the cards mentioned above, I wound up finding a Barry Sanders rookie card ($8) and a Dan Hampton variation from the 1990 Pro Set series worth $10, plus several other cards at least theoretically worth folding money.  As it turned out, my two boxes provided an excellent value.
Product was as expected. Packaging was good. Arrived in a timely manner. Variety of cards as described. Not as many duplicates as others had mentioned in other reviews. However, not many cards of real value. Excellent starter set for a young child, not for experienced collector.
I got these for fun a few days after my BIrthday, and they were GREAT. So fun to go through-I found some good cards, like the Drew Blesdoe RC, and a Shannon Sharpe RC, among others. On top of the stack were some strange-shaped cards, including a Shaun Gayle card that was twice the size of a normal one, and a Kevin Greene card that looked like a crown. I am very satisfied with this product, and would willingly get it again. Mine came with 6-7 packs from the 80's-90's. I recommend! :-)
I received my product 4 business days after I ordered it. So I'm satisfied with that. The products does have a good variety of old and new cards. I did get at least 3 doubles though. Over all, a great present for someone who is interested in cards,
This is a great way to introduce your kids and their buddies  to sports-card collecting without spending a great amount of money.
I would recommend this box for the price. I received quite a bit of good rookie cards an some very good older cards of greatplayers..  plus they included two unopened packs of cards in the box. As well i did get a lot of randoms, an some college cards...but all in all well worth the price. !!!!
A good set of cards.  Not big surprise all stars but a nice group to add to my son's collection.
There was not 500 card in the box, maybe 250 cards in the box I received. this was a disappointment.
This box is a decent deal. First box they sent was garbage cards and only 5 different players. A ton of duplicates and no star players at all.  So naturally i complained and asked for a refund. They said it was a mistake and they would send me another so i agreed. The second box had some good cards. Some of the stars were adrian peterson, fitzgerald, ray lewis, peyton manning and a nice andrew luck card. So the second box was solid and worth it. Cavalier cards made good on their error and i would buy from them again.
Great! was a gift for someone else and they liked it! Will order from again at another time. Thanks again!
The reaction from my sons face was so priceless the moment he opened his present from me, I bought him this collector box with over 500 Cards. I've known him to love football ever since he was still in 3rd grade; he watched all the vintage football videos he can lay his hands on and talked about football to his friends all night long. He was thrilled to see his favorite football stars on the cards and I could see that he valued his gift deeply. Indeed, a simple gift put that big smile and inspiration into my young son as he aspires to become one of the best football players someday. Good thing I ordered the brand new one as it comes in a box beautifully wrapped and delivered right to our doorstep the following day.
This was a good box set filled with very good rare cards including a rookie Barry Sanders, Joe Montana, and many other great cards. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that there were many duplicates in it, other than that it was great.
The collection looks interesting. Since I purchased it for a Christmas gift, I do not have an opinion on the contents. Then response was quick and there were no shipping problems.
Arrived within estimated time, but the cards with the gum packaged in it since the 80's left a nasty stain on the back of the a pack.
There were cards from all brands and a lot of them were elaborate-looking -- some companies put a lot into their presentation(s).  Warehouse didn't mean random; it meant blocks of cards were pulled out of a series (like numbers 437-452) and shared, excepting the most valuable cards.  I was pleased nonetheless and would purchase again to pad my existing collection.  The value of the cards exceeded the cost of the product.
It has some of the better cards of 2007. It doesn't include the rookies of that year that I can think of. I don't see Calvin Johnson or Adrain Peterson in this collection, but maybe I missed some other rookies.
This review is from my twelve year old son.There where so many cards to enjoy from this box of cards.It took me several hours to look through these incredible cards. When these cards came there were so many limited editions that stood out, which made this pack wonderful.
Cards were in very good shape. There were many cards I found for my collection. All details of the product were sent as described.Delivery was time was good.
Although a bit pricey at $23.00 plus shipping, I find this product a good gift for a baseball card collector novice.  I especially like the unopened packs of cards.  This will give one a sense of discovery by finding a valuable card.  Although it is doubtful there will be valuable cards in the box, it still will be enjoyable brousing through the different bands of collectable cards.
Nothing for the advanced collector, but some good cards and long-shot current rookies are included. Oldest card was 1983, there were no older cards of any significance, but many current and recent stars are included.
same as my other post great selection and packing was good with again the exception of some were jammed in there making them become dammaged but again good time for shipping and price so im happy overall.
I loved how fast I got the product and loved the packing except they were jammed in the box so a few cards were bent and destroyed and some of them were 2008 or newer so I know it was just because they were misshandled. Aside from that i loved it and would buy from again.
First time getting the 3000 box count &#34;warehouse find&#34;. A lot of what I expected; lots of 89'-92' garbage, 15 unopened packs (more of the same), about 700 or so semi-star to star common cards. probably 80% of case is mint to high-end nr.mt. Some nice surprises; about 200 vintage, ranging from 75'-82', mostly Topps. Riggins, Franco, Dorsett, few others. A Beckett from 93- worth nothing but a blast to flip through. One jersey card (G.Tate), one auto (Dom. Davis). Good box for beginner collectors
I didn't know what to expect for the price, but I was very happy when the cards arrived. Granted, there are no jersey cards or star names such as Elway, Marino, Farve or Smith, but the cards are good for the average collector. There are a lot of repeats in the box, (I got 14 cards of the same player), but considering there are over 3000 cards, I would say this isn't a bad ratio. Most cards are dated between 1990 and 2000 with a few older and newer mixed in. I am a major Steelers and Eagles fan, and did find a good number of cards from both teams. Again, this is a good deal for an average collector, but not for someone who is looking to make a serious profit selling. I am planning on buying one or two more boxes, I'll update once I receive them.
I just got my box a few days ago. I pulled the 1 jersey out of my first pack. I have opened half the box and only pulled 2 rookies. Is this typical? I was hoping for licecum and hamilton RC's when I got the box.
There are some great things about this football set from Topps, but there are a few shortcomings as well.  The overall card design is okay, but there is a heavy black border (exactly like the '07 Baseball set) that eats up a lot of space on the card front, and the silver lettering of the player names, teams, and Topps logo had already flaked off a bit on a few cards before I even opened some of the packs.  This has been a problem I've found with Topps card sets for the last few years now.  Player signatures are also included on the front of the card, which is a nice touch.  The back of the cards features a cropped headshot of the player pic on the front of the card and includes a wealth of statistics and biographical information not found on cards from other companies.  I've always liked this particular aspect of all Topps sets and it is one of their biggest selling points in my opinion.I can live with most of the miscues on these cards.  However, one major flaw that I have never liked is how Topps airbrushes the uniforms of players to match their current team.  If a player was traded in the offseason and there's no current photo of that player in his new team's uniform yet, Topps will simply airbrush the player with a new uniform.  Just glancing at the card, one may not notice this.  However, if you're a stickler for detail like I am, you'll pick up on this instantly.  It cheapens the overall look of the cards in my opinion.  I'd much rather have the player in his old team's uniform and a small "traded to" line somewhere on the card instead of a cheap airbrush job.Other than that major hang-up of mine, this Topps set is pretty good.  I prefer the Upper Deck 2007 Football set, but not so much that I won't buy anymore Topps cards for the '07 season.  Topps has plenty of parallel, signature, relic and subset cards to hunt for that make this set worthy of purchase.  I do recommend it.
If you're looking for the "pretty" in baseball cards, You will want to own this one. It features a pic of Greg in action on the front along with two more photos of the strikeout star pitcher on the back. The front also features printing in gold. On the back it notes his performance stats of 1991, plus more personal info such as his birthplace, home, and height/weight, and which arm he uses to bat and pitch with. The 1992 Ultra cards are not the rarest 1992 cards, but again they are not the most plentiful either. Of course no Maddux collection is complete without the 1992 Ultra, so why not grab one here.
Very nice card set for every Michael Jordan fan. Not spectacular but very nice. This are 23 cards, almost double the size of regular cards.
Good way to complete 1987 base set. But Still Topps made alot of these cards. But still has some good stars of this era.
why not play ball and keep score, and train hard, and play well and do good and show others how you did it
The 1987 Topps complete boxed set of 792 cards is the 25 year anniversary of the popular 1962 Topps 'woody' set so it also has a wood background.  I think that due to that tie-in there are as many of these cards as napkins.Still, it does featureBarry Bonds Rookie 1987 Topps No.320 Baseball Cardand1987 Topps Bo Jackson Rookie Baseball Card #170 - Shipped In Protective Display Case!as they first appear in a regular issue set as well as1987 Topps Baseball Card # 114 Billy Beane Minnesota TwinsofMoneyball.  It features a Turn Back the Clock sub set and All Star players.The set features 29 Hall of Famers and 9 members of the 3000 hit club.  this is nice to have in a collection and a nice gift for someone born in 1987.
I was glad I found this - I have rebuilding my collection after a fire and this set was in great condition.
I like Brett Favre because he is so poised during his games. I have the other Brett Favre rookie card.
The item is of only fair quality. If you want a one time use then it is great. If trying to use more than once the screws will strip easily.
My nephew collects Topps cards and said this would be a great addition to his collection.  I am happy with that.
A childhood dream come true.If I was able to buy this many cards as a child I wouldn't have to buy them now
The 2008 Topps Baseball Series 1 card set is a nice addition to the longtime tradition of baseball card collecting.  Collecting baseball cards is just as much a part of Americana as the game itself.  The standard card for the 2008 edition of Topps Baseball features primarily action shots (just a few posed shots) on the front of the card with each player's signature, team name in team colors, and the Topps logo and players printed name in silver.  The back of the card features the player's complete stats as well as their position and basic info such as birth date, throwing and batting arm, etc.  League leader stats are printed in red and in italics, and there's always a fun tidbit of information on the player if there's room to spare.Inserts included this year are Own The Game, Year In Review, 50th Anniversary All-Rookie Team, two Mickey Mantle subsets, Presidential Stamps, the obligatory relic and autograph cards as well as other insert sets.  Heck, there's even a Campaign 2008 set that some might be in the hunt for.Overall this is a nice set from Topps.  I do think that they went a bit overboard with the Campaign 2008 set, but some folks might just enjoy that.
Features 23 Hall of Famers and nine members of the 3000 hit club.  Simple front design with a picture.  The back features a chart of stats.  Rookies of Frank Thomas and1990 Bowman #312 Sammy Sosa. Get the whole set here rather than going through packs.  Would make for a good gift for someone born in 1990.
If you are looking for hits and do not care much about getting several base cards, this product gives great value for the price.2007 was the last year that Upper Deck produced the Sweet Shot set for hockey, and almost all autograph and memorabilia cards are numbered (not mass produced), so they hold there value over time.The memorabilia card (most likely a Sweet Shot Stitches card numbered out of 299) and the rookie jersey (numbered out of 599) each have three pieces of jersey and usually include at least two different colors.  The memorabilia cards include a strong variety of modern and historically great hockey players and are game used.  All rookie jerseys are from photo shoots.All autographed cards except the autographed pucks are numbered to 100 or less.The card designs are unique, sleek, and so nice that they are sure to add variety to any card collection.Other 2007 rookies besides those in the product description include Nicklas Backstrom (Capitals), David Krejci, Milan Lucic, Tuukka Rask, Jaroslav Halak, Jonathan Bernier, Bobby Ryan, Devin Setogouchi, and Ryan Callahan.The tin case itself is also a nice keepsake to store little treasures, especially if you are a Patrick Roy or Montreal Canadiens fan.Over time I acquired 7 of these tins, and for autographs, I received the following (note:  I don't remember the actual order that I got the cards):Kris Draper auto puckPatrick O'Sullivan auto puckDavid Krejci rookie jersey autoJaroslav Halak rookie jersey autoMike Bossy rink autoSaku Koivu game used stick autoBobby Orr stick auto
My title is a paradox. The Sweet Shot product represents a low end luxury box for hockey cards. I recently bought a box of this from through Quecandistribution. The tin that I opened yielded very good results. I pulled a base of Brendan Shannahan and Wayne Gretzky, a jersey card of Rick Nash numbered to 599, and a rookie of someone on the Blue Jackets. The autograph was a major hit: a Tony Esposito Endorsed Equipment auto numbered out of 15! I paid about $50 for the tin I opened, and would likely open more for that price or less. Once you get above the $70 price point the risk / reward equation skews negative.
Its a nice box of cards. I gave only 4 stars because the box was damaged in shipping. It said that in the discription but it said the cards wouldn't be damaged. Several packs of cards WERE DAMAGED! Thankfully the cards were nothing special.Now onto the actual product. The cards are nice I got 5 beckhams. I got 4 glossy cards: Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard, Gary Neville, and the England Symbol. I got several legend cards: Charlton, beckham, Owen, and some others.I recommend you buy this, but be warned about the shipping.
I bought these for my grandson for Christmas because he's a big baseball fan, and he loves them! Grandma was a hit again.
It's everything I expected. Compact, colorful and convenient, all 660 cards, plus the bonus painted cards by Dick Perez, is a great starting point for the beginning collector, which I am. My only disappointment is the inability by Amazon to deliver to an overseas address, which is quite a shame, considering the shrinking world we live in. But this set is Topps! (Couldn't avoid the pun)
It was a 4 case box set with new and old players. It doesn't exactly come with the people on the pic. Still awsome
This is amazing. Got this for my birthday present and i found alot of good and hll of fame cards. It is worth it for collectors.
The football cards arrived promply in a couple of days.It was a good deal for the cards.I found some good cards in the box.Its hard to find the older cards now.I would recommend this card deal to someone else.Dont forgettt they have a NBA card box also.
The cards were mostly all old and hall of famers.. I would defiantly recommend it. The cards I got were warren sapp, warren moon, troy aikman, ronnie Lott, William perry, and old cards like that.
I like it.  Great for new collectors as it has some very popular cards.  Big variety of cards.  Not as good for experienced collectors.
50 card set arrived as promised, in good condition, grandson enjoyed getting them, only negative to me is there are 25 different cards and the second 25are duplicates.
Would have preferred a football that was inflated, and had to purchase air pump to inflate, and after 2 weeks football was deflated again.  Would have given 5 if not for fact of football leaking air.
i liked this pack of cards, although i didn't receive as good of cards as the two below, i did receive good enough cards to make my money back along with some cards that i hold personally valuable. I would buy again. i think it is a good deal for the product received!
I purchased two boxes of this product from Blowout Cards for $51 each as part of their 12/12/12 sale. In my view, the $51 price point provided extraordinary value. The two boxes were enjoyable to break yielded a few strong inserts of recognizable players, and I liked some of the inserts, all of which were serial numbered. My best pull was a Pablo Sandoval auto, but I most enjoyed the collegiate patches auto inserts. I was pleased with these boxes because even without highly recognizable inserts, I might come close to recouping my costs. The 2008 Donruss Elite Extra product delivers in all of the ways that the 2011 Donruss Elite Extra product does not: (1) better mix of inserts, (2) inserts are serial numbered, and (3) price is reasonable. My four star rating reflects the fact that I enjoyed these cards and that the inserts were pretty cool and serial numbered. I provided a four star rating because the $90 price point is too high given the yield of these boxes, but under $60 they are a steal.
Excellent quality. Would highly recommend.I am using them to display autographed pictures that I don't want toget dirty before I sell them. These toploadersare working out great and the service was great, too.
A quality collection of Hall of Fame players, Upper Deck quality, oh, and Michael Jordan wearing a Chicago White Sox jersey during the brief time he was involved in pusuit of a Major League Baseball career.  But, due to the 1994 strike he was unable to realize his dream and fans were unable to witness what would have been a magical time as one of the best known ball players in the world playing a major sport.It did allow us the chance to seeSpace Jam.
fast shipping, great price, as seen as shown no problems or worries,thank you so much im happy la la la
got a few hits 30-50 dollars cards maybe next time get a big one good value for trying to get good hits
Smaller box than imagined out of the photo, but nicely packaged, it contains high-quality cards.
They're baseball cards.  What can you really say.  2009 NY Yankees team set.  good color.
As a fan of Dan Marino, I am very fortunate to obtain his rookie NFL card.  I am in a position to hand down this priceless item to my love ones.
This item is actually better of what I expected. It is bigger, the material looks durable. I liked it a lot.
It was smaller than I thought it would be. But still ok. I probably didn't visiaulize it whan it listed the size of it.
Bought these for my 7 year old son.  He's a sports fanatic.  He likes all the cards, but treasures those from his favorite team.  Decent collection for the price.
The cards were great, my nephew loved them. The only downside was the free month membership. The site is actually shutting down in March. Would have been nice to know this prior to buying. Other than that, a great purchase.
So far very pleased with the Hall-of-Fame and superstar Cards collection.  It is something my grandson will enjoy and is looking forward to getting. Thank you.
Terminator Salvation cards are out, and they are really nice.Retail doesn't offer movie memorabilia cards nor autographed cards, but hobby does.my only problem is that you cannot get any autographs from any of the major players in Terminator Salvation.The Terminator 3 cards offered autographs from everybody, Arnold, Staal, Daines and even Mostow the director.Salvation offers autos from? exactly. only Michael Ironside is worth it.No Bale, Dallas Howard, Common, Worthington, Asthon Yeltin, McG, nothing.huge disappointment in that factor.
If you are a TOPPS UFC card collector this is a good item to get. You still play the lottery, but there is garunteed autographed cards in the pack.
Overall a very good purchase.  Was a little disappointed that there wasn't a Babe Ruth photo card, but was pleased overall
This product is very good. It is educational and has a lot of interesting information. Especially good for Yankee fans.
Nice cards, but leaves the excitement out like with regular cards. Bought it for a Birthday. Was sent fast and great condition.
We decided when our son was born four years ago to start up a card collection. Every year he gets the complete factory set. Had to go with Topps...they're the best.
We buy this set every year as many do, but this year the set was WAY more expensive than in years past.  We are always pleased with the set however concerned that the price went up so much the month of December (it was in my cart in November & the price went up almost $20 in one month - should have purchased sooner).The set is worth the normal $50-$60 range but now it's upwards of $70 which seems high to me.The product is excellent, no concerns at all with quality.
i bought a full hobby box of 2009 Topps Heritage for $60, and it was without question the best bang for your buck.Hobby box offers 24 packs, 1 stick of taste like rubber bubblegum, with 1 memorabilia or autograph per box and comes loaded with chrome inserts and parallels and rookies.rookies rookies and more rookies.In 1 box, i got 42 rookies in total! Bailey, LaPorta, Zimmerman, Jordan Schafer and Ryan Perry to name a few. (75 rookies in total)each box is loaded with subsets such as Rookie Performers and Then & Now.my jersey card was Tigers 1st baseman Miguel Cabrera, a nice looking card.also, each box comes with a 3 card label "advertising" pack and 1 buy back card.overall, i LOVED 2009 Topps Heritage baseball cards and cannot wait to see what design they come out with next season.the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i don't like the Topps udate cards, it's a complete waste. Yes you can get Hanson and Beckham's rookie cards, but in the end, it wasn't worth inserting.
I bought this item for my nephew.  He loved it.  He's only 6 years old and he recognize each wrestler.  He had his mom read each card to him.
The cards I ordered arrived as advertised.  They were what I expected and arrived in less time than I thought.  Brand new packaging/condition as advertised.
the top of the cardboard on the pack was bent, shipped in time and it came nicely packed. very nice overall
now is the time for all great men to come to the aid of their country now is the time for all great men
mistake in the information part on back of card.  Card was nice, but it seemed like it was scan and pasted together.
This card looks as pictured and was in perfect condition and came cased in hard acrylic.  What you can't see by perspective in the Amazon listing, is that it is small, only 1.5x2.5 inches.  Normally baseball cards are 2.5x3.5 inches.  Maybe this is the standard for minor league cards?
Good card.  Identical to the image shown with a see-through case and screw.The card had a little dent on the court, near his face, but I think I was just unlucky.Nonetheless, one of the cards you'll want when getting an autograph from Blake Griffin.  At the time, he wouldn't sign Major Deck cards due to his contract (game against Houston in early March).
This set is a step toward1993 Topps Baseball Complete Factory Setas the stock is white cardboard.  On the back is a picture of the team's home stadium.Included in this factory set are some gold cards as there were gold cards randomly inserted into packs.  The set consists of 23 Hall of Famers and 8 members of the 3000 hit club.  Subsets include managers, top prospects, record breakers, #1 draft picks, and All Star cards. Good gift for someone born in 1992, the Blue Jays won the World Series.
The product is exactly as described...very fast shipping.Only complaint...the white/silver sharpie marker use for the autographs is fatand it kinda blurs the signatures...a fine point maker would have been a better choice forsignatures.
Topps is officially the only baseball card licensed by Major League Baseball and the Players Association, and the 2010 Topps kicked off in mid-late Janurary 2010.2010 Topps offers a ton of fun inserts, beginning with:- When they were young (current players shown in their young pre-MLB days)- The cards your mom threw away (reprint cards of past baseball cards, including the Yuker RC, Alex Gordon 2006 (never should have been made card) and 1968 Mantle to name a few)- Topps Million card giveaway (1 in 6 packs, they can be redeemed for actual topps baseball cards through Topps' website)in a pack, you get about 12 cards, including the 3-D live cards one per pack. You should get at least 1 rookie card on average in a pack, probably more. The rookie are nothing to get excited about, not at least until we get Stephen Strasburgh and Jason Heyward going.But here's my problem with Topps. I'm glad they are the only dealer of MLB cards....yet they read 2010 Topps, and nothing is updated...NOTHING!Granderson, Beltre, Lackey, Tejada, etc, all shown in their old uniforms. All that time and fuss about "official licensed product of MLB", yet they cannot even take the time to update their cards.now....you've got to wait for Series 2 to get updates that should have been done a long time ago.every year, Topps comes out with 3 Topps baseball sets.Series 1, Series 2 (with updates and new rookies), and Topps Update and Highlights (All-Star cards and last rookies to come out)if that's the case, you can probably do without Topps Series 1, try out Series 2 and hope for Heyward or Strasburg, and go out for Series 3, especially with the possible last rookies such as Carlos Santana from Cleveland.
I purchased these cards primarily for their name.At [...]we open packs of baseball cards and share all the excitement (and the cards) with our viewers.  Some times we go nutty and send entire packs of cards to fans.  And if we are sending fans of Opening Day Cards a pack, its going to be Topps Opening Day Cards 2010.  It just makes sense, right?They arrived quickly (I am an Amazon Prime member...why wouldn't you be?), and in a factory sealed box of 10 packs(I have ordered cards before and the box I got was not factory sealed...sketchy.)  Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies is on the box top, and he is widely known as the second (or third) best 1st baseman in the game behind Prince Fielder (and then maybe Albert Pujols).  Each pack has 7 cards, and this series is usually one of the first released each year, so its fun to get your hands on these early and see all the new rookies and the guys who were brought up late last year and didn't make the Series 2.Overall a fine little box of 70 cards (plus a bonus pack of 2 Topps Attax cards).
I got these cards when my kids were on a Toy Story kick. Don't expect to get a complete set from this box but you'll come pretty close. You will get lots of duplicates which can be good if you have more than one kid to share these with.
This 2007/2008 Upper Deck rookie premiere hobby box is a good buy.  I especially bought it for the Kevin Durant rookie card, but there are some other rookies in this set to look out for.  Definitely would buy from seller again, we have completed several winning transactions before and more to come in the future.
i love Topps Heritage, especially last year's set.2010 Topps Heritage is what 2010 Topps Series 1 should have been....updated.here you've got all the offseason moves (expect Damon because it was too late) in their new unis.Lee, Halladay, Figgins, Melky Cabrera, Rich Harden, etc.the only kill trip is rookies...yep, crappy. Nothing Topps can really do i know, but still. Your best players are Buster Posey (Giants) and Brian Matsuz (Oriels).the real joy is in the High Series, aka Series 2. That's where Topps Heritage goes all out with rookies galore, and if this year turns out to be what i think, expect to see rookies of Braves Phenom Jason Heyward, Nationals stud Stephen Strasburg, and Indians catcher Carlos Santana.boy oh boy...i cannot wait for the High Series to come out. For now, don't delve too much into Series 1, unless you are trying to set build for the beauty that is Topps Heritage.
The 1st NFL set of 2010 is Prestige football and a blaster yields 8 packs with 10 cards and 1 rookie per pack. I don't know if I caught a hot case, but i bought 3 blasters from Toys R' Us all at different times and pulled 3 jersey cards! Later i bought 2 more from Target and got nothing.For the jersey's i've pulled so far are 2010 Rookie Review (from last year's rookie class). My list so far includes Josh Freeman, Jeremy Maclin, and Knowshon Moreno. All very solid and nice, especially the Moreno. I know Crabtree, Mark Sanchez, and Matthew Stafford are also included in the set.Overall, the card design is nice although there are no action photos of the new rookie class. (Upper Deck has the college football license, hence no action shots)There are variant rookies, but i don't believe they are inserted 1 per blaster box like year.Here is my biggest beef with 2010 Prestige. It's loaded with rookies (104 in total), but with 1 every pack...you'll have to through 5-6 full 24 pack boxes to TRY and complete an entire rookie set. Why does Prestige do this? If there is no way in heck that you can ever complete a set with rookies in 1-2 boxes, then what's the point?
A very specific niche product for a specific need.  It is a good item, a little pricey, but cheaper and easier than going to a framers with a ticket, a photo and a request to match the Yankee colors.  The frame seems sturdy and well made.  Bizarrely the instructions with "how to open the frame" are tucked inside the frame, and you need a screwdriver to open, but pretty straight-forward.  The ticket mounting corners look old and fell apart when I tried to use them, so I just used tape.Good product that did what I needed it to do and couldn't fine any other options, so I paid the cost, which was more than I wanted to pay, but the finished product looks good.
Item is not as impressive as I thought it would be, but it is a good item to add to your collection.
not to happy was dusty inside card for a 10 mint card! had a smug on it like a dirty finger print. not a 10 in my book
The stickers have good quality and the seller was on time to deliver the product. I would recommend this seller.
I recently received this box (paid $45) and really enjoyed opening the 24 packs.  When it was all said and done I had a complete set of the the 1-83 common cards, with many duplicates (and triplicates in some cases).  The box says you are guaranteed 1 auto per box, I received 2 (Rick Fox and Joe Quigg).  I also received a total of 30 insert cards, though the box says 1 per pack.  It was nice to see that the information on the box was conservative.The only reason it lost a star was that both of my autos had been scuffed on the edge across from the auto sticker.  I'm not sure if this is part of the process when they were added to a stack or what, but I was disappointed that they didn't arrive in complete mint condition.  Every other card was in great shape, but could you imagine pulling a damaged Mj?The only other thing that might be helpful to someone considering this set would be to look for the checklist online first.  I was surprised that some players were left off (Hansbrough, Sheed, Cota, & Raymond Felton for starters).  Apparently Hansbrough has an exclusive deal with another manufacturer.  Still, it must have been hard to pick who should show up and who didn't make the cut, but it is something that might bother some fans.Overall, any UNC fan would love this set for all the history it provides.  The chance at a super rare auto is a nice bonus for something to chase too.
Very prompt service. Both boys that I gave these to as Christmas presents absolutely loved them. Great array of cards in the boxes. Hours of fun for these young men! Good deal.
I had to buy two boxs of the FIFA World Cup Stickers. I the two boxs the album was almost done.
Really not a whole lot to say, i ordered the box of stickers, and it came exactly when it said it would, and it came in perfect shape. I'm definitely ordering another box. No complaints here.
While I ordered 2 boxes of stickers, I received no boxes, just the loose packets.  Overall not a big deal but truly misrepresented as they were simply loose packs of stickers and should have been represented as such.
liked the set. a great set for a true yankee fan. its always been the yanks in the al for me. good player selection. excellent design.
I would have given this five stars but the container that the sand came in was opened so a lot of the sand had fallen out.
I purchase these playing cards for my Grand son. He Is very big on all sports. He loved them. He made several teams out of the cards and now has a league of his own. We play all the time. We are really enjoying this purchase. Also, there were very few duplicates.
This was the first complete baseball card set I have ever ordered from Amazon so I was not quite sure what to expect.  I at least thought the cards would be in numerical oder.  Wrong.  Or in team sets.  Wrong.  Or protected by plastic or shrink wrap.  Wrong. Or in a box with Topps logo.  Wrong.  Be careful when ordering full sets of cards.  The 2010 set is very nice,though.  I bought my first pack of Topps baseball cards in 1957 when I was eight years old.  It had a Ted Williams plus five more cards and bubble gum.  Well worth a nickle!  I still have the cards.
If there is one NBA player that rocks my world for the past decade, that would be no other than "THE" Michael Jordan himself. I am proud to say that all of these cards in this set are right on my shelf safe and sound where they should belong.I love to look at them every now and then and I am glad that I have come across them on Amazon and been able to finally add another great to my collection.Hey, what can I say, I am just a big big big fan of the great and legendary Michael Jordan.
Hello everyone: I purchased this set of MJ cards for my husband. He liked them. I liked them too, but thought that the small box set would've also provided an autographed card. Thanks and take care.
No need to buy another set as you get the complete 50 card set in one buy.  Hard to hit the "autograph" as you only get one oversized card per pack
I'm satisfied with the purchase, especially with 2 auto and 2 memorabilia cards I got. I read reviews about not getting big name stars so when I got Junior Dos Santos and Michael Bisping for autograph cards, and Lyoto Machida and Chris Tuchscherer for relic cards, I was happy.The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is that cards are not in MINT. Corners are worn out little bit and out of 128 cards from the box, most, if not all, of them has some sort of issue. If you are sensitive about the condition of your cards, this might not be it. But if you are looking for fun, hobby, etc, this is it for you. It's always fun getting a box and pulling cards from each pack with excitement like you're a kid.If you are a moderate UFC fan looking for high-caliber fighters for your auto or relic cards, don't spend your money on this product. If you watch UFC regularly and know most of the fighters, I'd say go get it while it lasts.
Card was what I expected.  I have no complaints about the quality or the time it took to receive.
The card arrived within the time period that was promised. It is in excellent condition, a plastic case was included. I would order more cards through this vendor. The only issue I had with this card is that it didn't hold an autograph very well.
Exactly what I ordered.As far as the cards go, never cared much for Score, but these were okay. Good Deal.
The card was very acceptable.  Just wish it would have been in a sturdier plastic case.Card in excellent condition.
Seems to be authentic.  Big signature by faulk.  The picture itself is just OK.  Patrick pass #35 is falling down.
The cards were delived on time when ordered found nothing wrong, cards were in a nice condtion when they arived.
Album is  pretty much what one would expect in a Dansco album, It has inserts  between the coin pages with pictures of the presidents, This is a feature I find unnecessary, but those pages can easily be removed, or relocated to the back of the album. For the money, I think these albums are the best out there.
Got here in time for Christmas! Only thing a bit odd was many duplicates, but they were dupes of good players so it wasn't a big deal. 4 Star rating because of lack of communication, but they DID do everything they were supposed to do. An email from them just saying "hi thanks for shopping" would have been nice in my opinion. Overall, I am very happy with the transaction.
I have ordered football cards before from topps and they are good. The picture is not as clear as I am use to but it is worth it. The case is a nice screwdown case, thick and clear. The cards I have ordered in the past have always taken the full amount of time to arrive so I expected that. Worth the buy and wait.
You will see a number of complaints for this seller regarding sports cards advertised in screw down cases, but actually shipped in cheap plastic sleeves.  They sell these cards for $4.00 while other sellers are selling the same cards for 83 cents (or less).  The complaints are accurate. I ordered from this seller in hopes of getting the better cases.  I am very disappointed.  Amazon used to be my favorite place to shop online.  Allowing all these third parties is negatively impacting their quality.  I saw several responses from the seller blaming this issue on the buyer as if they were confused by another seller's header.  That is not true.  Read the description of the item I reviewed.  It clearly says,  "in a protective screw down case".  In fact, the sleeves have a label with bar code that identifies them as protective screw down cases.  They are not.  Save yourself $3.17 and buy elsewhere!  I found the real protective cases from a non-Amazon related seller for 50 cents.****UPDATE****About the same time I submitted this review, I fired off an email to the seller as well.  They have already replied and offered to send me the screw down cases for my cards.  I am still unsure of the source of the confusion between amazon and this seller, but the seller responded quickly and courteously and is apparently in the process of resolving my issue at their expense.  I am upgrading the rating from 1 to 4 stars as a result.
