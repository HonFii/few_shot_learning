I never have received this product, which sucks since it is one of my favorite workout video. It works if you can get your hands on it.
i write this because till this day i have yet to receive the movie.
Topps has a lot of nerve selling this junk as vintage. The 4 cards in the case are in awful condition and have no value, you are lucky to have ever heard of the players. The others are Topps archives that are worth 5 cents each. I am done with topps cards after 30 years of loyalty, Upper Deck, Pacific, and Donruss are the companies that will get my business from here on out.
Flimsy, thin plastic that does not seal to protect the bat.  No instructions included so I assume it could be screwed to the wall with the black tabs on the ends.  If not attached to a wall, it would immediately fall apart if anyone touched it.  I am surprised that Amazon would offer such an inferior product.
This bat case is flimsy and unsecure.  Very poor quality - bot not nearly as bad as the company it came from!  Worst company that I have ever dealt with on amazon and I will never, ever purchase from them again.It was shipped to me in a brown shipping box.  When I opened the box, the case was simply shrink-wrapped inside the shipping box.  When I tried to put a bat in the case, it wouldn't stay secure and the edges of the case would not stay shut.  I requested a return, was given a return label, reboxed the case, and then paid $12 to ship the case back.  A few days later, I got an email from this company stating that they wouldn't credit me because the case wasn't returned in it's "original box".  I made several attempts to explain that the case wasn't shipped to me in a box besides the shipping box - it was only shrink-wrapped.  The company wouldn't believe me and insisted that it was in some "manufacturer box" which I can only assume should have looked like the one in the above picture.  The black end-pieces on the bat case had little pieces that stuck out on each side - presumably to attach the case to the wall if you so wish.  So, with these sticking out, I'm not quite sure how the case I received would fit in an "inner box" anyway.  We exchanged several emails back and forth and I finally stated that I was giving up - they can keep my money, but at least send me the crappy case back.  However, they are not responding to my email so I don't expect that I will get the case back.  I see no reason why they should keep my money and the case!Needless to say I am way less than thrilled with the whole experience of dealing with this company.  Never again.
The item I received is not the item pictured. The picture shows a simple clear case with black end caps. The item I received had a large black mounting plate, with gold accents and was not at all what I wanted. Very disappointed. I am still in search of a the bat cube that is actually shown.
I spend a lot on Amazon. I buy lots of things. Most things I buy are between good & excellent. This box is utter crap. To start, I received it broken. There was a crack in the plastic along the side of the lid. As I opened the box, the crack got bigger. The plastic this product is made of is thin & cheap. It feels like you can tear it like paper. To return this junk, it would cost almost as must as the product itself or waste more time than it's worth. Ridiculous. It will make a nice addition to my garbage this week. Time to look for a different card deck box. It definitely will not be Ultra-Pro. They are neither ultra nor pro.
Item was broken when I received, went right in the garbage. Even if not torn i do not recommend. Cheaply made.
lies!!!!!!  these packs are searched.  such crap, don't advertise that they are unopened, if indeed they have been opened.  gimme a break, have some integrity.  if you need scrub cards to maybe finish off a set your trying to put together, by all means order.  if you want to bring yourself back to when you were a kid, and opening packs were fun, because you may find a card worth something, steer clear off this company, which are a bunch of friggin liars
Potential buyers should be aware that these are REPRINTS. There is not even one Mantle card that would sell for this amount of money. Forget 10 in mint condition.Do not waste your money!The seller is being incredibly disingenuous by offering these cards without noting that they are REPRINTS.
It was NOT as described and not even worth 20 dollars!The cards were cheap and most are donruss! DON'T BUY!
This shipment wasn't good enough. Too many packages of the same year (1992). Some from the 80's. Like three of them, from 50.The rest from the 1990's. Too many of the packages were album stamps. Yeah, album stamps. I don't know what to do with them, I gave it to my kids.Probably the 1986 were album stamps. It's fun to open packs, but I prefer to buy them on Kmart. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!
These packs were not unsealed.  They had been opened and an attempt was made to make them appear unopened.  My son said I got ripped off.
&#34;unopened&#34; Hmmmm, i'm not so sure about that
all unopened, what a joke. if you want searched packs w doubles actually in the same pack, this is your company.  shame on you, you liars
They sent me a 1988 topps.  WRONG PRODUCT.  It would cost me more than the product is worth to ship it back.  Guess I will just keep it.
They were all curved and bent.
You said there would be Jeter,Pujols,Ichiro and other stars that is a lie.It was a rip off I will never buy from you again.
this is the worst product i ever bought it not worth the 20.00 i got a conferfited bryce harper autograph cards DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP
Sorry you got effed but thanks for saving me I guess feedback works! I will not but from this vendor and I hope they remove this from the listing
I JUST BOUUGHT THE 1989 AND 1991 TOPPS COMPLETE SET FROM TEAM FANATICS. THEY SHOW THE ITEM IN A PRETTY BOX (CARD COLLECTORS KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT)AND THEY SHIPPED ME THE COMPLETE SET IN A WHITE BOX WITH A PIECE OF TAPE OVER IT.  I TRIED CALLING TEAM FANATICS AND ALL YOU GET IS PLEASE EMAIL US YOUR PROBLEM. I HAVE AND FOR TWO WEEKS NO RESPONSE FROM THEM. I'M VERY DISAPOINTED IN THEM AND WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. I'M STILL TYRYING TO GET A HOLD OF THEM BUT IM NOT HOLDING MY BREATH AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO BUYS FROM THEM GOOD LUCK
I still have not received this set after placing the order over a month ago.  Unfortunatley, my sons 9th birthday was two weeks ago and he continues to check daily.
It's not hockey cards, it's not 500 baseball cards, all you will get is a 2 pack 18 card lot for your 5.99, a simple rip-off by this store with it's false advertising, not telling prospective customers what they are really to get if they purchase this offering is a crime shame.  Change your advertising or change what you send customers who buy from you+
Let's face it, if you are buying a box of 1993 Score Select to bust, you are seeking a Derek Jeter rookie card. The 1993 Score Select Jeter is one of his more affordable rookie cards at $12 per card, which suggests that the card should be an easy pull. I opened one box of this stuff recently and found ZERO Derek Jeter rookie cards. The box was factory sealed so I know it was not searched / tampered with. Instead of Jeter, I got roughly three or four Michael Tucker rookies - Oh Joy! Given my underwhelming box busting experience, I say caveat emptor to those looking to bust a box of this stuff. These boxes sell well over $35 in most instances, luckily I paid around $25 including shipping, so the box is not likely to pay for itself. Bottom line is that I would call this a high risk / low reward box busting opportunity. Save your money for something that actually guarantees a hit.
All of the cards were bent and in terrible condition, the autographs were smudged which makes them worthless, Out of the 65$ I paid for this, I only got around 9$ worth of cards. Very dissapointed with this product.
Bought this hobby pack of football cards for my husband, he did not get any of the specialty cards that the box guarantees upon purchase.  Went to the Topps website to see if there is any customer service to assist you and was given the run around.
I bought 2 packs of these for my son for Hanukkah.  He was so excited to get the signed cards.  BOTH packs had the same signed card from John Skelton.  How can you do that to a child!
I am completely unhappy with this purchase. Very few star cards were in the two boxes purchased and but one rookie of any value. The years and brands (basically four or five types repeated) were from years the market was so flooded that what few star cards that were present are virtually valueless. It was a waste of money and time. I do not ever plan to purchase anything from this company again. The card packs had several packs, for example, from the 1990 Score brand, several from the 1991 Upper Deck, and so on. There was no real randomness to the assortment. Both boxes were virtually identical in pack selection.
I bought from this seller because I thought they were truthful about being "unopened packs". They were obviously opened. There were 6 packs of 1989 Topps packs that were poorly resealed... not even any glue to reseal them. More over all, the packs were labeled for 15 cards, and there were a few that only included 7 cards, 9 cards, etc. Obviously the stars were pulled from the packs and then resealed. As a card collector for about 25 years, I have never had a pack open without having to tear it open, and never received fewer cards than the amount labeled on the pack. The packs were easier to open than a magazine. Not to mention, the only honorable player in the entire 6 packs was Shawon Dunston... and that's pretty sorry right there. I'm not mad that I didn't get any good players in those 6 packs... I'm pi$$ed that I know damn well they were already opened and searched and pulled.
This was a horrible seller! Half of the packs that I was sent were opened and there were no good cards inside. Most &#34;unopened packs&#34; were missing half of the cards. If there was supposed to be 15 there was 7 or 8. Where I come from you don't rip people off. I wish nothing but the worst for this seller as he/she continues to sell on Amazon. It was a criminal sale as far as I am concerned.
Good if you want to get your kids into collecting, they were overproduced and they have no value so beating them up don't matter, otherwise if you buy these, pull out any Griffeys, and destroy the rest.
Have been a baseball card collector since 1972.  I seriously question the description of "vintage" and feel it borders on false advertising.  "Vintage" typically referrs, at best, to pre-1980's cards.
&#34;unopened&#34;  they might be, they might not be too.
How on earth are you supposed to make an informed decision as to whether to purchase this item. There are no photo's, no description. There are 5 cards and one of them is an A-Rod. That's it? What year? What manufacturer? Who are the other four players? Come on, you can do better than that! Oh, BTW, this is not a toy!
I recently purchased a box of this stuff from Blowout Cards for about $55. My hope was to pull a decent autograph to spin into more purchases, but alas no luck. The box contained three autographs and a numbered rookie of someone I have never hear of who played for the Bengals. My sense is that the autos are roughly 1 in 8 packs, so three per box like the one I opened. In my view, the risk / reward pay off is skewed highly negative here, in other words your ability to pull cards worth the box price is pretty bad. Given that the only real value in these boxes are the autos, I would think this product would sell under $50 per box.
I get these at target for $19.99 + tax... listing is WAY too much even though you do pull some good cards out of these.
A hodge podge of cards - after the good ones were taken out - misleading that not current year.  Waste of money.
I got 15 of the same card in this batch. They were in good shape, but there was a lot of repeats.
Dont even bother with this purchase, There are many other promising offers on amazon if you are looking to buy baseball cards. This seller does not stay true to their word and simply could care less about customer satisfaction. Nothing older than 1983 which by the looks of it is sadly an old year for this buy. Lot's of duplicates, share with your friends. The only good thing is that I didnt waste too much money on this garbage.
you get horible cards cheap ones terrible waste of good moneyit is horrible that this company rips people off
DON'T BUY TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.When I bought this it said i would get 500 cards i got less then 400 and you get like 29 of the same card.this doesn't even deserve 1star
its been 3 months and i still havent gotten my cards. whats the prob. i buy from you all the time thanks for nothing idiots
BASEBALL CARDS ARE NOT VERY GOOD, players are of little RENAME, there is nothing CASH TO THIS ARTICLE
If you only want cards dating back to the 80's then this is for you. I wouldn't waste your money though. Go to your local card shop and spend $5 for the same thing. This product promised specifically cards from six (6) decades and stated there were possibilities of cards as late as the 50's.The latest cards were from the mass produced era of the 80's and 90's. Very dissapointed.Description stated there are 500 cards, which there are; however, many of them are repeats. As much as 15-20 of the same card.Again, don't waste your money.
This product was a huge disaapointment. It was purchased for my 12 year old son who is an avid card collector. Not only were there no cards from the 50's, 60's or 70's (which were specifically mentioned in the description) but there were many duplicates. Doubles would be no big deal, but in some cases there were up to 21 of the same card! There was not a single card older than 1992. This was a total waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone other than someone with a 5-10 year old who is looking to bulk up a collection quickly.
I understand and accept that there will be some cards that are going to be repeated, but when you find 8-10 in one 'handful' and a few others that go 4-6 of several other cards, I think this is unforgiveable. Since this gift is going to a 9 y/o as part of his first collection, it doesn't set a very good example.  What really 'set me off' was opening the US Postal box and finding the cards there....no separate container, just the cards laying there, a couple of them bent at the corners.  I took some cards from my own collection and made up the difference, found an old container to put these cards in and he won't know the difference.....but I will and it will be a while before I order anything like this agin.......if at all.
i bought this for the heck of it, enticed by the idea of what the product description said with a card from the 50s and some from the 60s and 70s. the oldest card i got was cal ripken jrs all star 1984 topps card. however, thats not even the biggest disappointment. the thing that made me shake my head in disbelief is that it was shipped in a usps little box, crammed in, no packing, no nothing to protect the cards. about a quarter of them had bends or stresses on them, making anything that could have possibly been decent, destroyed. i dont recommend this at all, give ur 10 bucks to charity instead of being lied to and disappointed.
I ordered this for my grandson for Xmas, ther were alot of doubles @ triples, some had even four of the same card.I needed it for Xmas or I would have sent it back. I'm really disappointed in Amozon.
First thing, the "collector box" is a cardboard box from the post office that barely holds the 500 cards that are in the box, let alone the 550 that it states to hold.Also, there is a statement regarding "cards representing 6 decades"?  Nope, I've got back to the 80's!I understand that you get what you pay for...at least they could be up front and honest about what you get BEFORE you pay for it!  This company doesn't even deserve 1 star!
Before Xmas, I ordered a baseball card collector's box of over 500 cards for my grandson from Amazon. Amazon subcontracted the order to a firm known as " The General Store". My grandson recently opened the box (actually 2 boxes) of 500 cards. Here are some examples of what was in the 2 boxes:--25 Mickey Tettleton cards;--35 Joe Oliver cards;--25 Ken Caminetti cards;--20 Joey Meyer cards;--15 Pat Kelly cards;--15 Tim Naehring cards and so on and so forth.Since I expected 5oo different cards, what I show above is a travesty and, what I consider, false advertising. Please take " The General Store" off your list of subcontractors!!!
Terrible just terrible waste of money do not purchase this, lots of duplicates and not worth the money you pay for it only nets about $4.50 worth of cards
The cards had no value. Most was doubles and triples. I was not satisfy with basketball trading cards at all
Garbage, Garbage, Garbage!!!  Your better off going to your local Wal Mart or Target and buying 5 or 10 packs indiviually.  The packs where of the most common cards and brands.  There was no autograph like in the description. I literally ended up with nothing but common cards that ended up in the trash.
Thought this was a good deal till I received and saw that it was almost completely NBA Hoops packs, 10 cents a pack at my local shop.
Of the 30 packs, most are from 1988 & 1990. You will not receive packs from 1986, 1987, nor from 1996 - 2009 as it states in description. Most of the baseball cards are from off Brands like: Score, Donruss, and Fleer, only a few Topps packs, and NO Upper Deck packs. Your better off buying directly from Topps or Upper Deck store.
Wouldn't recommend this.  Most of the packs will be the cheap dime a dozen pro set, score, etc, from 1990 and 1991.  These sets, in any form, are just not valuable.  You can find boxes of unopened cards for these sets and better ones for a couple of dollars from card dealers at your local flea market, or card show.It is definitely fun to go back and open these old packs, but I would suggest spending the time to shop around first.
This item shipped to me in a timely manner and there were (30) wax packs just as advertised. The huge problem that I have, is with the content. The seller clearly states, "cards from the 80's and 90's." In fact there were NO packs (zero) from the 80's at all! Twenty-nine packs were from 1990, 1991, & 1992. There was one pack from 1994. It is as if the seller took no care or time to have a even distributement of different years. I have collected, sold, and bought sports cards of all types for years and never have I been more disappointed! This is false advertising and if you are looking for something like what the seller states, believe me you want to stay away from this! Incredibly disappointing!
Be smart people. Do you seriously, actually think, these sellers are going to sell any packs, years, card makers, etc. that are of any significant value, or have any chance of getting a card of significant value from? There is absolutely zero chance of you getting any good cards from these packs. The absolute best you might do, is get some insert card worth a $1 - 2 at best. These lots of packs they sell all have the same things in common, 1) They are all from years with no big named rookies, 2) They are cards from manufacturers that never sold when they were released due to either the poor look of the cards, the poor quality of the cards, or the fact that the cards had no real worth as far as inserts & such, 3) The packs are all from boxes of cards you can easily go buy yourself for anywhere from $8 - 20 per box yourself. Typically 36 packs per box.If you just want a bunch of common card packs for your kids or grand kids to have fun opening to get them started on the fun of card collecting, or to give to them as some kind of reward, great. There's a lot of excitement as a kid in opening that new pack & seeing what you get. But, DO NOT expect to see anything more than $.10 & $.25 common cards come from these packs. With the occasional insert card worth $1 or 2. Having been in the card collecting hobby for 30+ years, trust me, you won't get anything worth while as far as monetary value, the most you will get out of these is seeing that kid excited to open another pack. That's it.Best advice, if you want to buy some cheap packs of cards like this, google the year & make of the cards, & buy an entire box of 36 packs for under $20. You can get boxes from the late 70's up to the 2010's, & are then almost guaranteed to get unopened packs, for under $20 - 25.Do some quick research, & stop getting suckered.**I am not accusing any of these sellers in doing this, but keep in mind, that many of these wax packs, are very, very easy to open, go through, & re-seal. Not all of them, but many are very easy to do this with in these older packs. So keep that in mind also when buying older packs like this being sold in bulk.
I received 5 1991 Fleer, 5 1990 Score Series 1, 4 1990 Score Series 2, 5 1989 Pro Set, 5 1991 Score Series 1, 2 1990 Pro Set, 2 2009 Rookies and Stars, 2 2009 Rookie Class.I was expecting some assortment of years, not a bunch from some terrible years.  I Googled the value of wax boxes of these, and most run $10 for 36 packs.  $25 for 5 of each?  That's ridiculous.I suggest going onto eBay or somewhere else for your cards.  I am sure I got ripped off for at least $15 (60% of the value).Enjoy it Mr. Seller.
This was the worst card collection i purchased PERIOD!!! Most of the wax packs were opened, and not resealed correctly. When I got to the last packs, at least 4 Packs, The cards were stuck together. This collection is not worth $25.00
I got a bunch of packs from the Canadian Football league... enough said.  Very unhappy with the assortment of packs.
All of the cards were stuck together.  The odds of getting something good in the box is 1 in 7 backs.  It came on time.
My box did not include the Emmit Smith rookie card, if it is a complete set then it should be in the box but it wasn't
The description is misleading.  &#34;10 Holder(s) per Pack - 10 Packs&#34;  That means you get 100 holders right?  No, only 10.Glad I only paid $1.99 each for them on sale as there is no way I'd ever pay $8.00 each for these.
First I would like to say that when I purchased this item it was advertised as the "Hobby" addition.  When I received it I didn't think it was the hobby set so I called amazon, the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me.  I called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and I have yet to receive a phone call back.. When I gave this item to my husband for Christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the "Hobby" addition.  I was not only upset that I did not get what I was looking for but that no one had returned my call.
How many cards are in this &#34;complete&#34; set? Why do sellers advertise a &#34;complete&#34; set when it only contains Series 1 or 2? And how can you sell a set of cards without even specifying how many cards are in it?
There was no item description available when I ordered this set. The picture is so small, even after enlarging it I still could not see everything. Now that it's here, let me inform you about this product. 1 - These are not 1 Euro coins as I had thought, they are.05 Euro coins. For the price I paid, I thought I was getting 1 Euro coins. 2 - The coins are all in a bag together scraping around on each other. I thought these would be collectible grade or uncirculated coins. 3 - You have to figure out where they go in the book. This took me 30 minutes, and I'm very knowledgable about coins.Very easy to confuse the Germany coin with the Austria coin ect... I am still looking for a complete Euro coin collection.
This product was listed as &#34;new&#34;. If it were a book, it would be anything but &#34;new&#34;.  The cardboard backing is bent and heavily worn.  The plastic front is crushed.  Because it is crushed, the cards are bent on the edges, etc.  If the product was listed as in &#34;Used But Good Condition&#34;, I would still be rating it as a two.  If it said, &#34;Used But Acceptable&#34; it would get a two.  If I wanted bent cards in a bent box I would have purchased that.  When a product is sold as &#34;new&#34; I expect it to be &#34;new&#34;.  Also, blaming any condition on shipping isn't worthwhile: it is the responsibility of the seller to prepare items for sale.  If somebody is purchasing a NEW 2007 Tops Red Sox Team Set they are obviously &#34;collectors&#34;.  As such, it should be prepared to be shipped in such a manner that the postal service can't damage it in the process of shipment.
Do not buy this product! There's nothing but junk cards in this not even one single star player, no Jordan's or any other star player. The best player I got was Derrick Coleman the rest was 10 cent cards I will never by this again and yes the cards has been gin  through by the seller and I'm going try to get my money back
This is literally someone picking out all the great players & giving you 20 Rick Fox's, 15 Isaiah Rider's, & more Harvey Grants that you ever want to see. 500 cards & the best I got was a John Stockton. 499 of these 500 are going in the trash! Can't put Bonzi Wells in a card protector!
Not satisfied with this product. The packaging was great but when going through the cards and you get doubles and triples. There shouldn't be. It was like you just put these cards in there and didn't care.
Okay so i bought the box of cards.So many multiples and also not one single card was from the 80's.Not one good basketball player i liked.
Cards arrived stuck together. Separating them caused major damage!!!! Cards were all commons from 1989 & 1990 Hoops, Fleer 1990, and Skybox 1990. Do not buy!!!!!!!
out of the promised 500 cards at least 100 of them were either wnba cards or duplicates, a lot of the good cards were ruined and in horrible condition. I would buy something else if i were you.
This was a terrible product,  I bought 2 sets of 500 for my anniversary gift to my boyfriend because he is a huge collector, and these cards looked like a bunch of opened packs that someone went through and took all of the &#34;good&#34; cards out.  My boyfriend was very upset that he did not get 1 decent card out of 1000.  And it made me look bad considering that I gave them to him as an anniversary gift.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
This is false advertising. I got all common cards. Unsearched my rear... i got 1 card from 80s the rest were already put together in sets inside box. Contacted the seller never heard back. What a rip off. Some cards were even double and we're back to back in box. Very Un Happy. .....
Most of the cards were out of date.  I do not recommend.  My son has already given most of the cards away.
Item was not what said it was going to be. I got all one year of cards. Some of the cards had 5 or 6 of the same card. There was not a collection of cards through the years like it said. They had to be sorted through because all of my cards didn't come in a box. All were opened and plastic wrapped with tape. There was no box like stated. This was probably for a cheaper sending price and is not what I paid for. I will NEVER order for this guy again. Such a rip off all cards were from 1990 so there was not a mixture. Please don't waste your money like I did.
alot of duplicates .mostly common cards,players that never did hear about.....When they say cards in the 80s or 70s ,yah they were right ,only one card from the 70s and one from 80s....
This pack is bull crap it says NFL cards not NCAA card theres freaking college players and coaches need to change the freaking title. Would never have got it.
Other than one of the pictures, the other pictures lead you to believe you are getting far more than you do.  I had imagined these cards arriving in a wooden crate- similar to the picture, and definitely more than one row of cards in a small box.  I've NEVER been disappointed in ANYTHING I've ordered thru Amazon- first time for everything I suppose!
this was o.k. not as good as they made it out to be, didn't get anything worth saving, and generally speaking, wasted my money. really, don't bother if you think you might find a treasure, they've been gone through, and all that's left is JUNK!!
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!! For 1; I waited almost 3 weeks for junk. 2; I don't know how many ARZ cards are in the set I got but it's astronomical and just stupid!! Just a waste of money. Unreal amount of WORTHLESS duplicates and I think the best card I got is a Christian Okoye rookie. So, dont even bother. It's all crap!!
Please don't lie in your description that the cards are &#34;unsearched&#34;.  That is like selling a found billfold that you didn't look in, and there could be money in it....huh!Anyone who has spent fifteen minutes looking at trading card ads has seen the &#34;unsearched&#34; term used quite frequently and always untrue.  You had plenty of time to put the ad together but didn't have time to look at what you were selling......sure thing.  Buyers are becoming more well versed in these untruthful ads and actually look forward to factual ads.
Not one card of value. Waste of money and the ad was misleading. If you are a real collector, do not waste your time as I did.
worst customer service ever were very rude when I told them I got doubles even triples of some cards and their response was that that couldn't happen and they gave me 600 card instead of 500 but these cards are all awful and when I said something I was told &#34;well I sell to celebrities and they like them&#34; this is just not good customer service lead customer service free huge corporation I can't believe some people think their companies are going to prosper when customer service is everything and they act like this
This was the worst shipment of cards I ever bought and I bought a lot over the years. Great mix my foot as soon as I opened it there 5 cards that were the same. They were just put in a box and shipped I guess they never heard of making sure the cards do not get bent or damaged. I mean come on if you do not know how to properly ship the cards then you do not need to be selling them. This might sound rude but it's getting harder to make a living anymore and if I by something I do not want it damaged by the time it gets to me. I do not recommend anyone to buy from this seller.
Yes there is a lot of rookies but I dont think any made it out of the minor leagues. I have a book on what baseball cards are worth and none of them are worth more than $.25. If you sold all the cards you might make a $1 of it. The descriptions doesn't lie but all the good cards are taken out. The cards go in order for a while until the "Cal Riptken Jr" or "Ken Griffey Jr" card are supposed to be. This it not worth the hassle of purchasing it.
This was the worst display of a box set I have ever purchased. There was no stars and every player I got didnt make it out the ball pin. If you buy this set you are an idiot. This was a throw away box and my suggestion is you BURN IT!!!! I can't believe I was disrespected in this manner. This box set should have been kept away in a CLOSET not sold to the PUBLIC.
the cards arent all that new. some are in fair to poor condition. a lot of doubles of no name players. you get a few good players, but it isnt worth it.
That was the biggest waste of money I've blown in a long time.  Absolutely worthless card.  Every last one of them.  Spend your money on something that's less of a risk.  This purchase was crap.
Be smart people. Do you seriously, actually think, these sellers are going to sell any packs, years, card makers, etc. that are of any significant value, or have any chance of getting a card of significant value from? There is absolutely zero chance of you getting any good cards from these packs. The absolute best you might do, is get some insert card worth a $1 - 2 at best. These lots of packs they sell all have the same things in common, 1) They are all from years with no big named rookies, 2) They are cards from manufacturers that never sold when they were released due to either the poor look of the cards, the poor quality of the cards, or the fact that the cards had no real worth as far as inserts & such, 3) The packs are all from boxes of cards you can easily go buy yourself for anywhere from $8 - 20 per box yourself. Typically 36 packs per box.If you just want a bunch of common card packs for your kids or grand kids to have fun opening to get them started on the fun of card collecting, or to give to them as some kind of reward, great. There's a lot of excitement as a kid in opening that new pack & seeing what you get. But, DO NOT expect to see anything more than $.10 & $.25 common cards come from these packs. With the occasional insert card worth $1 or 2. Having been in the card collecting hobby for 30+ years, trust me, you won't get anything worth while as far as monetary value, the most you will get out of these is seeing that kid excited to open another pack. That's it.Best advice, if you want to buy some cheap packs of cards like this, google the year & make of the cards, & buy an entire box of 36 packs for under $20. You can get boxes from the late 70's up to the 2010's, & are then almost guaranteed to get unopened packs, for under $20 - 25.Do some quick research, & stop getting suckered.**I am not accusing any of these dealers of this practice, but keep in mind also that many of these older wax packs are very easy to open, go through, & re-seal. Again, not accusing anyone, but educate yourself & think before you waste money.
AN ABSOILUTE HORROR SHOW!! 100 DOLLARS ON THE WORST CARDS OF HISTORY!!!! WORTH 10 DOLLARS!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY NOW!! DON'T BUY!!!!!
This item is mainly old damaged cards,has few good one's on it but generally it's no use because it's damaged well.correction on this item this is well searched and sorted by seller not as what it say's in product description.product is definitely waste cards,I would recommend buying new unopened box to buyer's not this product!!!You'll waste money if you buy this!!!
You would think with over 3000 cards that you would get a variety of teams. I got the bears, packers, Bengals, and bills!! Really?. I can't believe I wasted my hard earned money on this. I would have been a regular customer for years to come, but not with this kind of garbage boxes. Sorry for the bad review, but this was horrible!!
75 percent of the cards were sticky and stained. I attempted to call the dealer and got no answer. I attempted to email them, but to no surprise they didn't respond. I found that the cards were mostly commons and crappy inserts. There were tons of duplicate cards. Not worth the money, I feel like I was taken on this transaction
what can I say these players in this deck are some that I have never heard of nothing worth tradeing and a waste of paper and trees in my opinion
Got this for my son thinking he'd have the complete set.  We were disappointed that this box was opened and some were replaced with duplicates!!!!
I would recommend this seller to no one.  The product description clearly indicates that this is a brand new, unopened item when in fact the item had been opened previously which is a big deal in the trading card hobby.
Item I got is not what is pictured. Packaging was beat not worth it. Had I received what was pictured would be a different story. Not the first time I have been duped by AMAZON on the same product line. Will purchase from ebay where item description is detailed
The Item I received had been previously unsealed. Coins had dust and smudges on them. Plastic casing was cracked open too. Photos attached to this seller feedback section clearly show the broken edges of the forced open casing. Item box was flimsy and ripped. I will definitely be returning this item. If item had not been unsealed, it would be worth it.
Well,  here's another screwup by George Bush & Co.  Compare this coin to the old quarter in your pocket.  Not much different, except for the color and reverse side.  And, good ole Geo. Washington with an angry look on the front.  Making it even harder to distinguish from a quarter in your pocket, the thickness is close to the same as the old quarter.Compare this dud to Canada's $1 and $2 coins--and to the Euro 1 & 2.  They have nice, clean, modern designs and are easy to distinguish from other coins in their series.  I don't care whether you don't like either of these countries for political reasons--at least they know how to create nice looking coins!The older U.S. $1 Susan Anthony was better than this new atrocity and--what's up with all the hero worship of old presidents on these coins.  Our other, older coins, except for the penny, were works of art without most of the cult worship.  Look at the older coins from the 1800's and early 1900's for examples of artful designs.Net, I don't believe this coin is going to be accepted any more than the Susan Anthony.
I didn't really like this set, but perhaps it was just the set. A few decent cards/names, but over all not great
this person said that these cards were sighned ohiostate cards and they were pro fottball tops cards so this person was lying about it just to get money
I recently purchased a factory sealed box of the 2008 UpperDeck MarvelMasterpieces series 2. I am very disappointed at what was inside. Outof the 36 packs of 7 cards per pack, I had a total of 45 cards in theset, and after taking out 45 cards for my set and 45 cards for mymother's set (yes that's right my mother also loves marvel) I haveabout 144 duplicate cards; very, very disappointing. After pulling outthe 90 cards (45x2sets) I still had cards that were duplicated 3 and 4times over. I have been collecting marvel cards for the past 15 yearsand I have always been able to make at least one complete set of cardswhen I have purchased a factory sealed box.
yeah, I bet possible Barry Bonds Rookie....i'm sure this dude already cleaned out all the good cards from these boxes.....I wouldn't purchase!!!
these are not unopened as stated. i have no doubt these have been searched through for the rookies in this year.
It is so stupid all that you get is a bunch off tiny ugly dudes that do nothing its stupid why would you buy a bunch of tiny ugly dude for $90.00 yiu would be stupid to buy it
This is NOT the product that arrives when ordered. I ordered this for my husband's birthday and was expecting what was shown in the picture...not so. First, it was a game time picture which would have been okay if there were more Pistons in the picture then there were Pacers. The signatures on the picture were from last year's Detroit team, which is fine. What was not fine was that the picture had players in it who have not been on the team in years - Amir Johnson, Rasheed Wallace, Chauncey Billups - and a coach who not been there for a few years - Michael Curry. Very disappointed and will be returning this item today. Will never order from Highland Mint again!
A few days after placing the order I emailed Dave2880 requesting his confirmation that he had received and shipped the order.  He wrote back saying he had shipped the order and gave me a shipment date.  After waiting an additional 10 days I emailed him again expressing my concern that I had not received anything.  He never responded to this second email and I never received the order.  Fortunately I received a refund through Amazon.
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!! It is not an autographed photo but rather a picture & a signed check below. I did not realize this when I purchased the product, when I opened I contacted the seller to return. The product is still shrink wrapped & it has been less than 30 days. They will not allow me to return. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT OR THE SELLER!!! Any sellor who does not accept a product that a consumer is unhappy with is clearly not reliable, honest or credible. I would rate 0 stars but that is not possible. BE WARE OF THIS SELLER AND THE PRODUCT!
The product description indicates original packaging, but it was obvious that someone had used the product on a prior occasion.
Well, I order this item and i received two tennis balls in a plastic bag with no Authintication numbers niether from Memorabilia not from JSA. I called them and Trenesa from customer service was helpful ( I thought) and she said that she will send me a new set of balls that are legit! however, I received a better packaged balls but one of them does not have the JSA number and it has a Memorabilia P/N number for a different player (this is suppose to be Pete Sampras ball). The Roger Federer ball has the right JSA and Memorabilia number, but after all that im not sure if i trust them!they try to fool you to write a review on a webpage. I did and i regret that! i thought mistakes happen but to happen twice there is something fishy! it Sucks the whole experience sucks!
Let me get right to it.  Looking at the picture, and reading the description, we thought we were getting a case with 16 boxes.  We received 1 box.  Looking at the website of the actual store, a 16 box case would cost over $900 dollars.  You be the judge, look at the picture and description and what do you think would come in the mail.  The tough part is the disappointment on the kid's face and having to make it up.  It also makes me leary of ordering any more from Amazon.
Might want to change the name of the product from penny hardaway to Tim Hardaway so that somebody doesn't spend a bunch of money on a present, only to find out it isn't what they had expected.
Poorly made.  Basketball does not stay in hand and leg does not fit in holder.  Dont buy
I'm a die hard Dallas Cowboys fan, as well as, a Tony Romo fan. I received this item and the leg was already broken off.  Even so, I looked over the item.  It doesn't even look like Tony Romo at all.  The material that this item is made out of is not durable at all.  This item is horrible compared to other figures I have in my collection.  Do not waste your money on this one.  If you do, more than likely, you will be returning it.
Cheap looking. Picture depiction appears exaggerated. Was embarrased to give to my nephew - actually bought him another gift to make up for the lack of this one.
Do not waste your money on this box! It is terrible! The cards were graded commons and basically worthless!
worse baseball ever not i will buy this year again this is garbage missing some good players no rookie cards and no jersey card.
Why would I want a picture with Ditka telling me that, in his mind, HE is #1 (i.e., "Your #1"), rather than him telling me that he thinks *I* am #1 (i.e., "You're #1)?Bad grammar--just say no!
As a Philadelphia resident I thought this would be a good item for Halloween distribution so I ordered 2 packs which should have been 24 total dispensers.  When I received the package I received only two dispensers, not the two packs.  The good news is Amazon's coustomer service was excellent.  Once they realized the error they promptly refunded my purchase price.  I was disappointed about not receiving the full order but recognize mistakes are made.  A prompt and courteous response with an good resolution is a positive for me.
This product is totally misleading for the customer. It was disappointing to receive only 2 individual pez items and not like it is in the picture or described. I agree with the other customer that customer service was great, it just sucked that it wasn't want I thought.
Make sure you ask for a scan before purchasing this item or you might find a dishonest vendor selling raw/ungraded cards on this listing and passing them off as PSA 7.
Purchased this as a gift for my children's father for Fathers Day.  He loves baseball.  The cards were not what I expected.  Cheap and didn't have a lot of real baseball cards.  I would have come out better purchasing a surprise pack of cards from the Dollar Tree.
It says there is a card for A-Rod and he is a future Hall of Famer..How is A-Rod a Hall of Fame player?Hall of Idiots maybe. But no way should he even be mentioned in the same sentence as Jeter and Mo.
This is abosultely NOT a signed Ken Griffey baseball, in fact it looks like it is a Cal Ripken Jr. ball.
I purchased this for my son for Christmas. Very disappointed it looks very &#34;cheap&#34; . Would NOT recommend to anyone.
i purchased this because i wanted it in a PCGS slab and it came in a plastic case which to me is worthless, great seller though, i sent them an email and they said just keep it were sorry for the inconvenience.
The box was damaged & almost half of the cards were too. This must have been deliberately shipped to us like this because the outer box had no sign of damage at all!!! I was very disappointed because these were actually good cards that ended up being damaged! :(
This was to be a birthday gift for my best friend. When I opened the box, I immediately recognized the signature on the ball as FAKE. I looked the company that authenticated the ball (Authentigraph) and found they have been know to sell fake autographs. I originally was sold a ball authenticated by Mounted Memories who are extremely reputable. I was sent the ball authenticated by Authentigraph The seller refunded my $ as soon as they received the ball back. I went to Steiner Sports and got the real deal. The sad part was that I had to wait an extra week to give my friend her gift. Thanks alot for wasting my time Authentigraph.
Been collecting cards with my son for 4-5yrs and this has to be one of the worst sets for a WS fan (basically player shots from base set, with just a few extras from each round) - maybe its just Topps.  A few yrs back, I had Giants Super Bowl sets from both Topps and Upper Deck. The UD set was great, even came with a game use ticket - Topps set just so-so.  If your a Yankees fan you have to get this, but I wish Topps would have done a better job building this set, I would have bought 4 or 5 - not the case here, only will buy one.
Thought they would all be there went though first box 1991 number one card wasn't even in there missing quite a bit. Kinda sucks have all these cards thought they would be full sets but no!!Definitely bummed outDon't buy
Boxes have been picked through.Two of the boxes were football cards, also picked through. Nothing but no name players. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS UNSCRUPULOUS DITRIBUTER! TOTAL RIP OFF!
I thought this was going to be a great gift for my son for Christmas so I got it. When he opened it he screamed at me and said that I was the worst dad ever. I didn't no why until I saw it too. The packs were not sealed and they were opened. It was horrible. DO NOT BUY
I recently bought the supposed unopened factory baseball card set of 1986-1991 topps basebal cards. 500 cards in each. First and foremost boxes were not sealed. They were all torn up and falling apart. Most cards were bent severely. Even had cards in some of the boxes that were folded in half. Quality wise the cards would be rated maybe a 6 on the beckett scale. There was only one decent card out of 3000 total cards. Shipment took 11 days to get here, and after all the anticipation, what a disappointment. I would hope this company would rectify this somehow with some actual unopened factory sealed boxes at there charge. Very bad customer service....I would not recommend this purchase to anyone. Stay away....
This card is only valued at $17.50 and is not a refractor. I have been in the business several years and even if the card is graded you are looking at $50 tops not the $200 people are asking for. Be careful when purchasing any card and check resources to be sure the card actually is what is advertised.
Thought I'd try this, I've been collecting since 80, and while there were numerous &#34;sealed&#34; packs, the player cards are worthless.  Of the 200 cards I got one person worth even keeping and that was a mid career Mark McGwire.  I wasn't expecting a $1000 hidden card, but I would have like something I could have at least collected.  These sadly don't fit that bill unless your collection consists of no names and crusty old veteran cards of the 80s that have no real value.  Won't fool me again.
It was clear that some of the wax packs had been opened and resealed.  I would not trust this vender again.
I ordered 2013, but somehow received 2012.  This disappointed my daughter who was really excited about the winning card possibilities.
tim tebow us army card is aommon card not private issue which is 800 made be careful
Alex Smith did NOT attend Stanford, he was a Utah Ute.The photo might be Levine Toilolo, a significant contributor to the Cardinal 2011 season.At least the jersey color might be confused for the Utes.
My grandson was very disappointed with this photo.  The actual photo he wanted but you were out.  So, the customer service asked me about a different picture I was not sure so I listened to him.  Wrong move.  So don't take any advice.
This picture is a counterfeit. A fake. I bought the exact same item through Amazon Marketplace for less than $200 and it's a reproduction (it's supposed to be "one of a kind" signed original!) The signature is exactly the same as the one I bought. The ink came off of my copy when it got wet because it was written with a fine tip non-waterproof marker (I believe that in those days they used fountain pens). I tore the damn thing up and lost my money. Buyer beware! These folks are frauds. I reported the incident to amazon but they're allowing these crooks to continue to sell their products to the public. Shame on Amazon. Have you no ethical standards to protect buyers from these sharks? This will be my last purchase on Amazon Marketplace.
This is the worst deal on the planet it is five cards placed in a package and priced at seven dollars
I got it and I was not happy it said $75 dollars I paid 7dollard worst deal ever not happy
My son and I were very disappointed when we received just one card pack of 6 cards with the order.  The picture and the price are purposely misleading.  The picture shows an entire box of booster packs AND the list price is $79.01. Seriously?  a pack of 6 cards for $79?  We paid less than the $79 listed, but the high list price leads the prospective consumer to believe that the entire box of cards is for sale.  In the words of my son, "Don't buy this. It's a rip off."  I fully agree.
Item is overpriced. Find a similar frame for cheaper elsewhere. I expect good value from Amazon and it's sellers. 99% of the time I get that, this time I did not.
Top left part of autograph(The letter "C" from Chris) spills over the edge of the puck.This results in the autograph not resting flat on the puck.The picture of the autographed puck on the description did not show this.
I purchased these thinking that they were the exclusive (hard to obtain) 24KT cards. I thought... "Hmm... Maybe the 24KT cards are within the packaging, so I opened it... Nope." Now I cannot return them. These are not them... BEWARE! They are just the basic cards in a collectors set with a mislabeled 24KT Gold Stamped UPC on the back of the white sleeve cover. DO NOT ORDER THESE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF!
this was supposed to be a sealed box but i got a sealed bag of bent packs . the amount of cards per pack is listed wrong (8 cards listed and these only have 3) .DO NOT BUY THESE UNLESS YOU LIKE TO GET RIPPED OFF !!!
Basic math :638 total.$1 for 5 stickersthats like $63.80 + album +tax = more than $85 ( now you have to add all the repetitive that you are going to have) you are going to expend well over $90 on this.The stickers are ok quality they are small and feel cheap.the only thing at a reasonable price is the album ($1)I would rate this higher but for the price and quality this is an overpriced item.It would be smarter for them to drop the price because here in 2 moths when the world cup finishes this will be worthless.
I ordered this item, 2010 Bowman Chrome Stephen Strasburg Rookie Card #BCP1, for my grandson. It never arrived. I finally contacted my credit card firm and had the charges removed. I have always had good results form Amazon, but this reseller should not be part of Amazon. What a waste!
I was not paying close attention to the words that were written, and was expecting several packs (based on the photo).  I also assumed there was an autographed card in each pack.  I was very disappointed when my son got only one pack of 6 cards, none with an autograph.  Definitely a rip off!
My son loves soccer cards so I thought I would splurge on some special ones.  We were both disappointed -- there was nothing special about these cards and they are $12 more than a regular pack.  He had not heard of most of the players he got.  Better to stick with the regular cards!
This item was not a Topps set.  This is a set that someone boxed and put together.  It was missing the Original Topps packaging and two cards in the set.  We have returned it for refund.  I would not purchase from this seller again.
I ordered these trading cards for my 9 year old son.  He specifically wanted FIFA soccer trading cards.  The product title clearly states FIFA within it and the product description is extremely vague.  To our disappointment, these are NOT FIFA soccer trading cards but MLS trading cards.  So, if your child is hoping for a Lionel Messi trading card, they will be extremely disappointed since it only contains trading cards for players within the MLS.  Finding FIFA trading cards is very hard in the USA.
I received item when I was suppose to the packaging and box the product came in was perfect, when I opened the box every pack in the box was bent into half moons horrible for cards and the fact I paid 40 for bent cards is ridiculous I hope to hear something back from someone asap
Not as listed. Big mistake of time and money. I make over 100k a year and will keep buying but not from here!
Again a retail box has more than 50% scrratched cards from ttopps, do they do a quality check in the production process......???????go figure lets see if they will replace the cards it is no longer 2010 season.....
So there was an apparent market for these? And the company doesn't make enough money with the multiple sets it already produces, right??
The card is one of the poorest cards they make and they don't include the "screwdown" case they offer what a croc!!!!!!!! I don't not suggest anyone buying from theses people unless you want to end up unsatisfied.
NOTHING GOOD AT ALL...Vague reference to authentic worn clothes...But when were they worn? Does not say specifically. Autographs are lame who cares about the unknown comic...and zero guaranteed numbered items got no limited anything... seems like someone opened package and threw in some garbage.
I ordered this for a Father's Day gift only to receive a $10.00 off my next purchase coupon.  Was told that my hat was returned to the warehouse because the hat was destroyed in shipping and they have no replacements.  Amazon still shows 10 in stock as well as other sites that Sports Memorabilia sells through.  They did offer me an autographed baseball instead, but he collects hats, not baseballs.  Was very disappointed with this experience.
this product is terrible, its a card game its not actual football trading cards, there are codes in the back of the cards in order to play an online game, no facts about players, and the online game is not operational anymore.... waste of money.... do not buy!!!
The product features section states "This super premium card set features a complete series of 100 cards" so I expected the product to have multiple packs of cards coming to a total of 100, especially considering the MSRP of $120.  Instead, this is just a single pack which has a grand total of seven cards inside it...My rating is based purely on the badly written description and my dissapointment when the package arrived, I have no opinion on the quality of the seven cards themselves as they are meant to be a gift.
I expected to receive a 2010 coin in the case as shown.  Instead i received a 2011 coin with no case.  I ordered from the seller Amazon. I will be reordering this item and hope Amazon sends me the correct item this time.
Please read your own ad copy for this item, purported to be a 2010 Cleveland Indians team set:  "This package is a must for all Cleveland Indians fans.  You'll get a 2010 Official Topps MLB team set featuring 17 of the best Reds."I think I'll wait to order until I know which Ohio MLB team you mean..............One star for your retailing blurb: But I'm sure the product itself is in 5-star mint condition.
Hey Loser,I just got a Hanley Ramirez in a pack I bought for $3. Would you like to buy it from me for $300? You seem to be making a killing here on Amazon. $250 profit sounds like a good deal to me.
I ordered the 24KT coin and received a silver coin.  The coin pictured looks silver, but is clearly labeled as 24KT--which can only be translated as gold, since silver is never measured in KT.
Took this ticket to The World Series this tonight and they did not honor my entry into the stadium. Apparently they have expiration dates and this was not mentioned in the product description. I tried to take my son and we were disappointed. The night ended OK. We went to a bar in the area. I got tanked and then had him drive home. Don't worry he had his learners permit. Also of note, bartenders do not take these tickets as legal tender.
ITS NOT A GOLD PROOF ANYTHING! GOLD PROOF MEANS ITS 99.99% gold with a shine to it! This product SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF OF AMAZON!
This is obviously a replica.  The description isn't as clear.  Shame on you for trying to fool the less knowledgeable.
So the 1933 Double Eagle is not legal to own, its considered contraband by the Government, so buy a replica, that does not say "copy" of an illegal coin and prove to everyone you know that your are in idiot !
This item is listed as:"1933 20 Dollar Gold Proof"ALL FIVE WORDS ARE FALSE!This dreck was not minted in 1933, is not 20 or a dollar or 20 dollars, has no face value, contains no gold and is only proof of "buyer beware."This token of disesteem seems l to
i ordered this card and i waited over 1 month before i had to file a claim and get my money back
Do yourself a favor , buy way better precious metals. They weren't even the items I ordered . They would be ok for a door stop, and that about it. I didn't buy them for me, I bought them for cousin and they hate them, so I'm only going by what they said about these items
All you have to do to decide if this is a good product or not is to compare the cost of the commodity (in this case, copper) to its spot price on the market. Copper is currently going for $3.73/lb.If you still think this is a good price, please send me a message. I have a bridge for sale...
Copper is selling for only $4.00 a pound.  Don't pay over $12.95 for something that only has a resale value of $4.00.  If you want investment grade copper, go to the bank, buy a few rolls of pennies, and keep those minted before 1982.  Except for 1943, $1.75 worth of them has more than a pound's worth of .999 copper, which is why the mint is no longer making them.
I received this and i might as well have gotten a pound bag of pennies. Not worth the price.  This should cost about five bucks
I purchased this set for my grandson and he too reported after opening the set that there were no relic cards in his packs either.  He was very disappointed.  Quite a few customers reported no relic cards either.
For the people complaining that they didn't get a relic/auto out of this, DO NOT buy a box of anything labeled as retail in the discprition. The odds are very low to getting anything out of a retail box. If your looking for hits, go with a hobby box. Sure its around $20 bucks more, but you do get aleast one hit and sometimes more.
i did not like this item at all. it is not realy graded by becket. and the jersy is not officialy game used. very fake piece if you ask me. i see alot of game used pieces and this is one of the worst. not official nba jesey material.
Seems a little scammish. You have a Nike jersey in the photo but Champion made the jerseys back then, and I've seen you do this all over. You take a 1 inch square of a replica jersey (probably not even a jordan replica) and you stamp in on a 1.00 card and try to sell it for 20 bucks, or 50 for the fake Lebron. Ripping people off left and right. If your jersey is fake then your grades are too. No thanks.
I bought this for a newborn and the picture on the Amazon website shows a cellophan wrapped box with images of ball players on it.  However, I used Amazon Marketplace to purchase it and this was my mistake.  The box the cards came in was a plain white box with no wrap and no baseball images.  It looked like I put it together myself to give as a gift. Needless to say I was disappointed.
Your disappointment will be palpable if you buy this less than nothing box of cards.Could have found the same box of cards at mt local Salvations Army.Avoid
This is an outright lie.  This is not a complete set.  There was no Ryan Howard and no Cole Hamels.  These two are long time starters for the Phillies and they were not included in this set.  How can someone claim this is a complete set when two of a teams stars are missing.  I will never by from this vendor again. (Hobby Rewards)  I am afraid to go thru it and see who else is missing.  WOW what a scam.
Do not buy from this company. I've purchased this from another company last year and they were flawless. Sadly, the white backs had brown stains, the fronts had cracks in the colored parts and there was a faint smell of cigarettes. I just opened the package today to separate for Christmas and am probably going to let my 9 year old daughter play with them. I will never buy from this company again. There is no possible way that the staining, cracking and cigarette smell was missed and shipped out. There is a way to do business and there is a way not to. This is not the way. This is truly disappointing since this was the starting of collections of Ravens memorabilia for my 22 year old son whom is in the USMC & has developed an interest in the game of football during his 2 deployments to Afghanistan. It helps to have something to talk about . This is why I am so disappointed receiving such terrible quality cards because he is a very organized person whom doesn't like the smell of cigarette smoke or cracks and stains. I guess I'll have to find another Christmas present for him because I will not give him a present with so many things wrong along with the way the packs look.
My son thought these were trading cards (that is how they are presented) and asked for them.  They are for some sort of game and he is mad.
He can't believe he wasted his money on this.  We got 6 packs and he doesn't recognize any of the players.  Also, there are a bunch of manager and stadium cards.  The best card he got in all 6 packs was a Stamford Bridge stadium card!
I bought this for the soul reason the item shown was a 2013 Mark Martin flag. However upon opening my package I was greeted with the sight of a 2012 flag.
My 12 year old son ordered these cards with the hopes of playing the on line baseball game.  Out of 240 cards there wasn't a single code card for him to use on-line! He was so disappointed.  He already had many cards but needed some new codes to play.  I contacted Topps and their customer service response was terrible. Finally after a month I got a response only to learn that the Topps Attax on line website is down and being phased out so there aren't anymore code cards to play with on a computer only an iPhone which mu son doesn't have.  So don't waste your money buying this booster pack box unless you simply want to trade cards.  We are going to try and sell them at a tag sale to get some money. No more Topps for us.
The product description is incorrect. You do not get 24 packs of hockey cards, rather you get 10 packs. When I notified Amazon they shipped us another box to see what we got because the representative couldn't tell if we were shipped the wrong product or if the description was wrong. We got another box of 10. Amazon was very nice in that they allowed us to keep the second box at no cost to us and sent me a label to send back the other box.
I would think twice about buying anyone who tries to pass off a "MIKE Price" golfball as a "Mark Price" golfball. It clearly says Mike and it says "WSC" below it -- for Washington State Cougars, the team Mike Price used to coach.
Maybe the name is Roger Federer's, but the racquet isn't.  It is some $20.00 racquet from Walmart.  They could at least have had him sign a top of the line professional racquet, like the one he uses or used,  if they expect $700.00.
Unfortunately, I ordered these but didn't open them up for months. I thought, who could mess up cello bags? The seams on these are crooked and none of the first five I pulled out of the bag will hold my 8x10&#34; prints. Don't waste your money.
We were sent the wrong photograph. And then had to jump through hoops for the exchange. Once I did what they requested it took over a month just to get the return label ONLY because the representative just hadn't gotten to it. Ruining what we planned to be a great gift for our father!
Don't be fooled by the picture on the box.  This is the same as the All-Star Game set.  This set shown does not exist, it is a flagrant mistake by Amazon, which represents the retailer.  Beware!!!
Would purchase again. Was able to label many coins and will be able to display them in my upcoming garage sale.
I recently picked up a box of 2011 Bowman retail at the local Walmart. The box was factory sealed and contained 24 packs with 10 cards per pack. What a dud of a box. You certainly get plenty of rookies, but the only real hit in the box was a bowman's best of Bryce Harper (BV $15); I also pulled two Mark Trumbo base rookies (BV $5). I guess this stuff is good for those looking to load up on prospects, but I think retail at $70 and hobby near $100 are way to expensive for this purpose. I for one will not be looking to chase Mr. Harper or Mr. Trout in anymore of this product. Hope those who buy this product have better luck than I, and I hope that my experience at least tempers expectations a bit. Would have been happier if this stuff was cheaper. My one star rating reflects the fact that I feel the box was very poor value for the price, and believe that current prices should probably go for half of current market price.
