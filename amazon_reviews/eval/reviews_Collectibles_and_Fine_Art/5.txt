It's Tango, It's Tango...March it out!!!That's the tagline for this video. I loved it, and it's a lot of fun. It's instructional, and it taught me about basic Latin Dance moves... My sister stole this from my collection, than my other sister abducted it, and still has it! I bought mine from K-Mart in 1996.The tone after-session is wonderful! The video is actually a "Cult Classic" in the Gay Community. They put on arobic shows using this flick! I reccomend this for anyone of any fittness level. It's a lot of fun hating on the sexy Russian co-dancer for being too pretty and fitt.
I think this is a fun video and a fairly easy workout. It's great if you are just starting out. I find it easy to stick to.
Toronto-based Stampeders -- guitarist/singer Rich Dodson, bassist/singer Ronnie King and drummer/singer Kim Berly -- has always been something of a two-headed monster. On one hand the band made its name with such sweet pop songs as Carry Me, Sweet City Woman and Oh My Lady. On the other hand, it can, and often did, turn up the volume with rockers like Wild Eyes and Ramona. Of course, that made it hard to figure out just what kind of band the Stampeders were (and still are, by the way), and that hurt their career. Backstage Pass, recorded in 1974 at the Ontario Place Forum in Toronto (a free venue since replaced by a big, expensive outdoor shed) featured the band at its rocking best. Amidst the sound of screaming female fans, King, Berly and Dodson showed they were capable of surprisingly intricate arrangements. I'm thinking particularly of Marigold, with its stops and starts, and In The Shadows. Balancing that were good-time party songs like Devil You and King's take on Blue Suede Shoes. By the way, this reissue features four bonus tracks, including a 10-minute singalong of Sweet City Woman. It's been a long wait for this fine recording to come out on CD, but definitely worth it.
Ana Maria Lagasca is mesmerizing and compelling, as "Negi," the eldest of ten children, who emigrate from Puerto Rico to New York with their mother.  This TV-film version of Esmeralda Santiago's "Almost A Woman," the sequel to "When I Was Puerto Rican," beautifully encapsulates the essence of the novel.  For starters, Santiago had a first hand part in the production and orchestration of the film version.  She wrote the screenplay, which extracts the most dramatically compelling and engaging scenes from the book.  Secondly, the acting is first class and the actors are nothing short of wonderful.  Wanda De Jesus sparkles, as Negi's strong-willed and resilient mother.  The rest of the cast is of equal first rate calibre.What I appreciate about this film is, although it focuses on the experiences of a young Puerto Rican girl in a foreign place, who, upon arrival, speaks almost no English, the story isn't exclusive to the Latino experience in the United States.  Her feeling of isolation and exclusion is a universal feeling many people have experienced, at some time or another.  What's more, her story of triumph in the face of adversity, going on to shine at the New York Performing High School For the Arts, as an aspiring actress, is nothing short of inspiring.This film mixes warmth with the cool reality of assimilation, and manages to remain compelling to, both, a young audience and a more mature one.  I highly reccomend this.
I teach Spanish at a local University and showed the movie to students who read the book "Cuando era puertorriquena" (When I was Puerto Rican) by Esmeralda Santiago.  The movie is mostly in Spanish with English subtitles.  The storyline follows the end of the novel and part of Santiago's sequel, "Almost a Woman."  I feel the acting was excellent and the setting was very interesting and believable.  The movie held the student's interest and gave a good insite on Puerto Rican-Americans.
Great movie that follows closely Esmeralda Santiago's book.  If you like her books this movie is a must.
This film is a must see for all young people.  It follows a young Hispanic  immigrant who comes to America  and speaks no English.  Her struggle in her  new country shows her trying so hard to adapt to the new culture, and  to fit in at school , and finally gaining the self esteem and confidence through the help of a sympathetic teacher who realizes that the girl has exceptional talent.This  film is based on a true story about the girl who grew up to be a famous author.The movie  has a great cast and won a prestigious Peabody Award.
Weather you're an Esmeralda Santiago fan or not, you've read her biography or not, and you're Puerto Rican or not-  This movie will capture your heart and touch your inner most feelings.  It is brilliantly made- with carefully chosen actors to play the parts, and with beautiful and well chosen images of rural Puerto Rico, including a captivating rhythmic soundtrack of some of our most talented musicians.  Although the movie is based on Puerto Rican Author, Esmeralda Santiago's biography part 2, "Almost a Woman", you do not need to be Puerto Rican to be brought back into memory lane and be reminded of your traditions, your culture, and the strong family ties that prevail against all odds.  The movie is short and sweet. You will not be disappointed with it.
I first read the book Almost A Woman by Esmeralda Santiago over three years ago and loved it.  So when I received a notice from a friend that Lehman College in the Bronx, NY was showing a viewing of the movie I traveled from Philadelphia to New York to see this film.  I was not disappointed!  Almost a Woman was a wonderful representation of the book.  I recommend that all Latinas between the ages of 10 - 45 see this film.  It's a wonderful story of coming of age, of transcultural life, of the struggles and ultimate triumph of one girl who in the mist of adolescents goes against tradition to demand access to a better way of life and education.  Bravo Esmeralda, you've done it again!
We get our son a set of baseball cards each year for Christmas. This came just as expected and he's thrilled to add it to his collection.
If you collect Topps baseball cards but are not interested in all the various insert cards that come in packs, this is the way to go.
i bought his for my nephew in Ohio and he loves baseball, so this is a perfect gift for someone who likes baseball and is a collector of the cards.
Not a specialized set like they are trying to sell at a marked up price (like the Red Sox version).  Just basic set of series 1 & 2 for the entire year.
My son really enjoyed these, since he collects baseball cards, these fit it in well.  The box came sealed and there was no problems
Topps baseball cards have been the most collectible ball cards since the late 50's. There are 32 teams in the MLB and each team has a 40 man "active roster" which comes to 1,280 ball players. This card set includes 661 of the most popular baseball players. If you can find these on sale I recommend getting two sets. One set for opening and enjoying each and every card and another set to keep sealed for the purpose of retaining value.
We have been buying three sets of TOPPS Baseball COMPLETE sets for my sons since the day they were born! Even now at 28, 25 and 21, we still buy them What a great collection they now have!!
Factory sealed, exactly as promised. The cards were delivered at the front end of the delivery range. I won't be opening the cards as they are for collection purposes, but very happy with the ease of purchase
My son collects baseball cards.  He is 12.  This is a great way to get a lot for a good price.  One year I gave him the whole box another year I gave him a few at a time.  This way he really gets to enjoy.  Delivery was quick and box came perfect.
We have a tradition of giving our grandsons a set of these every year.  We looked for them in stores, but could not find them.
I ordered this for my son who has become a collector of baseball cards. He loved them. Looks as though we will be purchasing more.
My son has been collecting Topps brand Baseball Cards since he was a young boy.  He is married now with a son of his own and he still continues to collect Baseball cards.
He was absolutely delighted with this set and I imagine we'll continue to get other sets for birthday gifts, etc.
My son loves Topps Baseball cards set. In fact he has an amazing collection of the Topps set but still crazy about its latest versions. So, when I gifted him MLB 2012 Topps Baseball Retail Card Factory Set, he pleasantly surprised with a tight hug. Sure, why not! The set consist of 661 base and subset cards from 2012 Topps Baseball Series 1 and 2. It also includes exclusive rookie cards of Bryce Harper, Yu Darvish, Yoenis Cespedes, Jesus Montero and more.  Not to forget about the bonus pack. It includes a set of 5 All Star insets. The set is reasonably priced too.
I was very happy with how I was able to order this item on line. I made it very easy for me to be able to order it.
My wife is a baseball card collector.  Every year I give her a gift of Topps Baseball Retail Card Factory Sets. I save over twenty dollars when I purchased it from Amazon.
Delivered perfectly. my 9 yo son loves the set and got many hours of enjoyment. has complete set of 2012 player. What this doesn't have that the more expensive sets have, I don't know.
His look on his face was well worth the online time for the purchase.  He is one heck of a baseball player...
This is my restart my childhood collection again, maybe to regain a youthful feeling. The package arrived in good time and factory sealed. I look forward to getting out my white gloves and placing them in there final home.
Wow is all I can say. Very good cards I love it. Great quality in my opinion and they are fun to collect. Lots and lots of cards. Topps is the way to go.
I ordered what I was expecting to be an upopened, sealed factorcy set of 2012 Topps MLB trading cards , and that is exactly what I recieved. Very appreciative of it.
I have been buying these for my 2 boys every year of their lives for Christmas. Never a problem with product or with shipping in 25 years.
The last time I seen them he was looking at each card I figure 600 cards should take him a good amount of time to look at allof them. He was happy so everything is good.
Great Box Set...
I actually used this for a Friday the 13th (2009) Machete Replica, and it worked perfectly.It's easy to take apart/assemble.
Bought this to display our autgraphed bat. Looks great and priced right. Glad we decided to purchase this one. Highly recommend this case.
this is my 4th one and they work greatas for the price you can't beat it.and pay no freight
my son really loved it he has an autographed bat that has been collecting dust and this will preserve it nicely.
Awesome product, fit my Dustin Pedroia Autographed Bat - Rawlings Big Stick perfectly.  Delivered very fast, cheaper than most other sites I looked out.  Put on a shelf, but also considering hanging it up.
I purchased this Bat Cube for my husband, who recently visited the Baseball Hall of Fame, and am very pleased with it.  It is very sturdy and well-made.  My husband had no problem hanging it on his office wall.  I would definitely recommend this case.
Very nice set of cards.  For the price I paid I expected either lower graded cards or cheaper valued cards.  The seller however sent me a very nice set of valued cards.
I got a tim thomas rookie card in my box that is so cool. Im a die hard bruins fan and been one my whole life. It is an awesome pull. I collect hockey cards and i would have paid 25.99 for that card alone. Buy this and maybe you could get one too.
We have several generations of deck boxes, these are really nice.  The old ones had square, then round velcro, which the guys didn't care for, but these are nice and tight, and close securely without needing a clasp.  Keeps your different colored decks and characters pristine and well cared for.
I've owned this deck box for about a month and it has lived up to every expectation.  When used with Ultra-Pro card sleeves (also available on Amazon, though probably cheaper through your local hobby or comic store) a 60 card deck fits perfectly.  This is a very sturdy product, and I would have no worries about tossing it across the room even when filled with valuable cards.  It's also a very attractive box.  The lettering leaves a little to be desired, but the color is easy on the eyes and much less gaudy than most other deck boxes I've looked at.  A little white strip at the top makes labeling your deck easy.I've only used these products with Magic: The Gathering cards but I believe they would work with any standard sized playing card (provided they are each placed in individual protective card sleeves).
I purchased this deck box to hold one of my yugioh decks.  For the price, it is not a bad purchase.
I bought 2 of these deck-box for my yugioh cards and it's excellent. This holds 80 cards exactly and is great 2 carry around without my cards getting bent. I recommend buying this.
This box has now seen better days, but it was my first deck box. I took it to all my leagues when I was still active, always held my Fire deck. Good for beginners, novice, and professionals. Great product.
Works great for a deck on the go. Did wonderful job for a gift, the receiver couldn't be happier with the deck box.
fast shipping, good product.protecting my deck has never been easier. looks wonderful and keeps cards clean and free of dust. great investment. wold buy again
This product was exactly as described. There is no velcro for the top, but it is a tight fit, so staying closed isn't a problem. It was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition.
Was exactly what my Son wanted for Christmas. I like that it keeps his cards up off the floor :)
these are perfect for my brother who has millionsof magic the gathering cards that he can put in these! :)
I used to play MTG a decade ago and my daughter asked me about it. I showed her my old cards and she wanted to start playing. I bought a few of these so she can have her own decks to play with and these haven't changed since I was playing years ago.
I got this to store one of my Yu-Gi-Oh card decks. It's good to have a different color to diverse each deck.
Sealed in a plastic bag and pretty well protected in the box. I cant imagine what these might be worth in 30-40 years.
Got this for my son for Father's Day.  Not only is he a Yankee fan but 2005 is the year his son (my grandson) was born.  Great inexpensive keepsake.
This was pretty great. The cards are so random, it was pretty exciting to see what was going to be next. I was just going to look at a fewwwwww cards before I went to bed, ended up looking at all of them. Until 3am.The downside is that they have been opened so the integrity of some (surprisingly not very many) cards are compromised.I am probably going to order from this vendor again.
These cards were a birthday gift for my 10-year-old son and true to their word, the cards arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. My son and his dad had a great time exploring the treasures-both old-timers and newer stars that were included in this pack. I would not hesitate to order from this company again.
As described.  Good investment for the future.  I am just hoping that baseball memorabilia rebounds its value by the time my kids are adults.
3000 cards arrived in good condition. This kept my boy busy for days.. had many cards inserted that were of good value and fun to see.
Thank you for sending this order in a timely fashion.  It was received when you said it would.  Thank you again.
My son loved opening this large box of football cards! Christmas morning he spent hours on this gift. Then spent more hours on going through his brother box that I ordered from Amazon too. Will definitely do this again!!!
I got this as a Christmas present for my son and he loved it.  The set came as advertised and got here quickly.
Topps is always a good choice for sports cards, whether you'reabeginner or enthusiast, they have a quality product with differentprice ranges.
121 card extended collection, features 74 rookie cards such as1999 Topps Traded Baseball Josh Hamilton Rookie Card,1999 Topps Traded #T75 Carl Crawford (RC - Rookie), andCarlos Pena Texas Rangers (Baseball Card) 1999 Topps Traded Autographs #T46and veterans that signed with new teams.Of the 74 rookies, about 14 made the MLB, many with another team.  Features an autographed inserted card, one per box. Fun and colorful.
it is awesome i got ken griffy jr cal ripken jr ozzie smith you should by them and i also got a sammy sosa card
In great shape, got people I wanted, and I got a series I wanted.
The cards were very cool. Some of the boxes were even unopened. Cards were in great shape. We were happy with this purchase.
Great buy for the price received 1988 fleer 1989 donrus and 1990 score no cards were missing all cards were in great shape already placed another order may order another.
When I got this set of baseball cards in the mail the packaging was good. When I opened the box all the cards were there, and they looked like they have never been touched.
Who cares if you believe McGwire, Sosa, Bonds, etc. were all juicing.  Probably, and, for some, admittedly, they were.  However, this is a great set blemished by a dark era that in 50 years in no way will cost $10.  Better get it today before it's upped in price 1000%., because, even if Pete Rose didn't make the Hall of Fame, try getting his 1963 Rookie Card for anything less than what you make as a salary, per week. (written in 2011.)Update, 2013: This set has doubled in price, already.  I am telling you now - you are a fool if you're not in on this at $20.  I already predicted, 2 years ago, the price would be upped 1000%.  You already saw Bonds and Clemens get a huge amount of the HOF vote - unexpected by anyone's standards.  THEY ARE GETTING IN THE HOF AND I DO NOT CARE WHAT YOU SAY.  I repeat - if you are not in on this RIGHT NOW, do not blame me when I sell these cards individually in 20 years for more money than you'll ever be able to come up with.  Your warning.  Your choice.  Not in on this, even though the price has doubled in 2 years?  YOU pay the price, not me.  I bought it at $10, 2 years ago.
This was a great set of cards for a nice price.  Also the shipping was very fast.  I had my order two days after placing it.  It shipped the day I ordered.
I find it very interesting that a complete set of 1991 Topps Baseball Cards costs less than the current set.  The reason, ironically enough, is that this is because we do not know how much the current set is worth yet.  After all, you get about 60 cards labeled future stars, prospects, draft picks, and first-year players, and one of them could turn out to be the official rookie card for the next Roger Clemens or Albert Pujouls.  True, the card might come out years before they actually make it to the big leagues (e.g., Mark McGwire's card with the Olympic team), but in the speculation market that is modern baseball card collecting one card that can be worth half the set is the goal.I do not buy into the speculation part because I collect what I must now quantify as the regular Topps baseball cards because they are the set that has been around since before I was born, unlike Upper Deck, Bowman, Fleer, Leaf and whatever else is out there today.  Currently I have complete Topps sets going back to 1968, with 23 cards to go to finish the 1967, so I would then have complete sets back to 1964, plus 1962, 1957, 1956, and four cards to go for the 1953.  Each set is arranged by teams, with the World Series winner first (the Cincinnati Reds in this case) and how each team finished in the standings.  True, this become complicated in a world with three divisions and wild card teams winning the championship, but there are basic rules to all this (league leaders and highlights card up top, etc.).With the 1991 Topps set, which was the 40th anniversary set for the company, there are seven Record Breaker cards (e.g., Bobby Thigpen sets saves record), 22 All-Star cards (left-handed and right-handed starters, and a relief pitcher, to go with the eight fielder players), seven checklist cards (arranged alphabetically by team), and ten #1 Draft Pick cards, including Chipper Jones (#33), which is the high priced rookie card in the set (and the right one to pick to show above).  The second highest priced card is #100A, a Don Mattingly error card, which is not going to be part of the factory set, where the next highest card is Nolan Ryan (#1).  The 1991 Topps Traded set is where the double-digit card is from this year with Jeff Giambi's team USA card; it also has the Topps rookie cards for Jeff Bagwell, Ivan Rodriguez, Phil Nevin, and Luis Gonzales.What is missing are team cards, but you do have managers cards with team leaders listed on the back.  In terms of current members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, in addition to Ryan there is Cal Ripken (#150), Tony Gwynn (#180), Dennis Eckersley (#250), Sparky Anderson (#519), George Brett (#540), and Ryne Sandberg (#740).  As for future Hall of Famers, the controversy overs the likes of McGwire (#270), Barry Bonds (#570), and Sammy Sosa (#414) will continue for some time to come (Rafael Palmeiro appears to be toast at this point), but Greg Maddux (#35), Randy Johnson (#225), Roger Clemens (#530), Eddie Murray (#590), Rickey Henderson (#670), and Ken Griffey, Jr. (#790) are obvious first ballot selectees down the road.  Others would be purely speculation at this point, but that is what the Hot Stove League is for, baseball fans.
I loved this...spent hours going over all the cards. Pulled Bonds, Rookie Ken Griffey Jr., and several other "I hope i pull that" cards. Excellent purchase that I just bought for the third time. Highly Recommend.
My 12 yr old decided to start a baseball card collection and I bought this to get him started. It was absolutely pure joy to see my son opening each and every package for the first time. They were in excellent condition for the most part, except that some of the baseball card packages that contained gum (do not let the kids eat it) the first card got somewhat damaged when we removed it because the gum has been there for so long that it took some of the card finish with it once it's removed. I suggest to used steam first just to lose the gum up prior to removal. This could also be helpful with the gold edition packages because they are really stuck together. Overall however, the cards are in perfect condition and you will find very good baseball players like Tom Seaver, Ricky Henderson, Roger Clemens, Robin Yount among others. It is a great gift for a starting baseball card collector at a great price.
Orderd 2 and got boss cards. There so much for the deal. Every 1 should get this!!! Sweet and thanks again
I gave the package of baseball cards to my nephew for Christmas. He was very excited about the gift.  It was a big hit with him.
He thinks it's the best. Wowed by the idea that there are players from 27 years ago. Also, noted the gum is the same age!
I purchased 2 boxes of these to use as one of the favors to take away when leaving my brother's wedding.  They were a big hit.  The fact that it was all kinds of mixed cards, including things like 3D, puzzles, coins, stickers and cards made it really cool.  The mix of years also made it a great product.  The price absolutely cannot be beat.  After the wedding, I bought a couple of boxes for myself, cause they were so cool!
I ordered these cards January 21 and just got them today only 3 days later! I wasn't supposed to get them until Febuary so I was happy to get them now. I got these cards for my son and he went crazy over them. He hasn't opened them yet but he will surely love them. These cards are a great gift for any card lover.
This product is amazing! You can't get a better value. One of my tips to getting a great deal on unopened packs, is to get a certian number of packs, not a certain number of cards, then you can possibly get a good deal. Again amazing product. I would reccomend it to any baseball fan or any child.
I have no idea about the worth of baseball cards.. BUT my nephew loved this Christmas gift.I liked that it wasn't a game that was on tv, so who knows what the worth of the actual cards are.. He will let me know once he has researched all of them.. Lots of fun for the card collector.
I've gotten this for my step dad a few times. He loves opening the packs to find rookies, and other special cards. He's found 3 of the same $50 card, every time I bought this set for him. Not a bad price for baseball cards. I've seen them at $3 to $5 a pack sold separately..I got him some for Christmas, and it had about 6+ packs of silly &#34;baseball&#34; card packs included. He doesn't like them, and I wouldn't consider them real baseball cards, but he still didn't mind getting them in a lot of 50 packs. But this set I got for his birthday,only had 2 portrait packs included. And they are real cards. Not wacky packs, or whatever. He kept trying to get me to eat the gum, lol. This would be great for any card collector.
To be clear, if you are looking for the first Barry Bonds card with Topps, then that would #11 in the 1986 Topps Trade set.  What you have in this complete set of 1987 Topps Baseball Cards is the first regular Topps card for Bonds (#320), which is usually priced at about 60% of the other card (or a bit more than one-fifth of the price for this entire set).  After that we drop down in price big time to the next card, which would be the rookie card for Rafael Palmiero (#634), although I suspect that will change (and do not think the irony of that is not obvious to everyone).  Other notable rookie cards in the set are for Devon White (#139), Bo Jackson (#184), B.J. Surhoff (#216), Jamie Moyer (#227), Ruben Sierra (#261), Will Clark (#420), Chuck Finley (#445), and Barry Larkin (#648).  Most of them are still around, but besides Bonds the only other serious candidate for Cooperstown will be Larkin, whose chances might actually suffer because since that time to prototype has changed from Ozzie Smith to Cal Ripken.  Compare Larkin to the Wizard of Oz and he looks good; compare him to the likes of Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada.You need a three inch binder to showcase this set because it has 792 cards, which was the standard size from 1982 to 1993, when it jmped to a massive 825 cards, and then started dropping down.  The design of the cards is reminiscent of the 1962 set with a the wood-like borders.  The upper left and lower right frame of the photograph of the player have diagonal cut into them.  The team logo appears in the upper left, with the Topps insignia and the player's name in a box, color-coded by team, on the bottom.  Regular players have their batting records on the back (all of the basic stats), and if room there are trivial points (e.g., Howard Johnson was co-winner of a rib-eating contest aong professional athletes after the 1985 season) and a "On This Date" feature (e.g., May 1, 1966: Sam McDowell pitched 2nd consecutive one-hit game to tie record.  Sam's 1966 Topps card was #470).With 792 cards you can come up with the starting lineups for most of these teams.  For example, with the World Champion New York Mets, you have a Mets Leader card and one for Manager Dave Johnson, and then cards for 27 players.  The Boston Red Sox who lost the World Series have 30 players.  The Topps All-Star Rookies have their signature yellow trophies on the front (e.g., #465 Todd Worrell), and some of the rookies are designated "Future Stars" (e.g., #512 Dave Magadan).  There are also seven '86 Record Breaker cards (e.g., #1 is Roger Clemens for Most Strikeouts, 9-inning Game).  There are eleven All-Star cards for each team (lefty and righty starting pitchers to go with a reliever and eight position papers).  Then there are five "Turn Back the Clock" cards (#311-15) for Rickey Henderson, Reggie Jackson, Roberto Clemente, Carl Yastrzemsnki, and Maury Wills, and six checklist cards.Of course, almost two decades down the road the speculative value of this set is a minor concern.  Gary Carter (#20), Eddie Murray (#120), Sparky Anderson (#218), Reggie Jackson (#300), George Brett (#400), Tom Seaver (#425), Mike Schmit (#430), Bruce Sutter (#435), Kirby Puckett (#450), Tommy Lasorda (#493), Earl Wevaer (#568), Ryne Sandberg (#680), Phil Niekro (#694), Steve Carlton (#718), Paul Molitor (#741), Ozzie Smith (#749), Carlton Fisk (#756), Nolan Ryan (#757), Dave Winfield (#770), and Robin Yount (#773) are already in the Hall of Fame.  That is twenty-two so far, with Clemens (#340), Tony Gwynn (#530), Greg Maddux (#539), Rickey Henderson (#735), and Cal Ripken (#784) are going to make it for sure.  The real oddity might be how many players in this set had their reservations in Cooperstown cancelled, or at least postponed, because of gambling and steroids (no clue as to what Topps set has the most Hall of Famers: for example, the 1969 set has 41 Hall of Famers so far, with at least Joe Torre to be added to the list down the road).
Product in great condition at a reasonable price.My wife loved it, even though I was going to give it to her when the Broncos won the Super Bowl!Lee
Best buy for mein sports card arena in the last year . Perfect in condition and all expectations  . Great find
Excellent item for a Giants fanatic! My daughter loved it when she received it as  a gift for her birthday!
Beautiful, clean card,  Completely met my wants and expectations.  Exceeds the quality of most cards that are being offered for sale in the market.
Whenever I spend the money for a rookie card that I think might increase in value, the player always ends up being a dud or a douche. A-Rod is just the latest example.
The card arrived on time and in great condition. I would buy from them again.
In the wake of the explosion in the number of baseball card sets that are produced each year I have, like Anne's father in  Jane Austen's father, retrenched. The only set I pick up each year is the "basic" set put out by Topps. I do not do this because Topps provides more "First Year" players and prospects in the eternal quest to have the official "rookie" card for some future Hall of Famer, but because I currently have a complete run of Topps baseball card sets going back to 1968 (I also have complete sets for 1956, 1961, 1964-66, with four Hall of Famers to go to finish the 1953 and a couple dozen high numbers to complete the 1967 set). All of these sets are arranged in binders beginning with the Leader Cards, then the Highlights, Post Season and World Series cards. Then all the teams are arranged in they finished, beginning with the World Champion Red Sox, with all of those aforementioned First Year and Prospect cards in the back. So I am here for the history and not for the gum (not that there is gum anymore, but you get the point).The 733 cards in the 2005 Topps set are broken down into 534 veterans, 30 Managers (267-296), 35 First Year Subjects (297-326) and Future Stars (327-331), 17 Season Highlights (332-336) including the postseason (349-55) and World Series (731-34) 12 League Leaders (337-348), 24 Sporting News All-Stars (356-367, 719-730), 30 Team Photos (638-67), 25 Draft Picks (668-87) & Prospects (688-92), 2 Combos (693-94) and 24 Award Winners including Rawlings Gold Gloves (695-712), Cy Young (713-14), MVP (715-716), and Rookie of the Year (717-18). Then you also get 5 cello-wrapped Prospect cards featuring players who are not part of Topps Series 1 or 2. Be aware that you can get the set with those five cards being prospects for a few select teams, namely the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants, Detroit Tigers, and Washington Nationals. I supposed such cards might be considered a key inducement for buying a complete set, but the fact that you get the complete set without having to open dozens of packs from Series 1 and then waiting to do the same for Series 2 should be enough (unless, of course, you like opening a pack to see if you might find the Rocket, A-Rod, or Ichiro).Two things to remember about the 2005 Topps set. First, the reason there are 733 cards but the last card is numbered 734 is because Topps retired card #7 in honor of Mickey Mantle after he passed away. It made sense since Mantle's 1952 Topps rookie card (which was also a high number) is the icon of baseball card collecting. The Honus Wagner T206 is the Holy Grail and just getting to see one would be a thrill but forget about every owning one (whereas you can sell you card and get a 52 Mantle). Second, between the release of Series 1 and Series 2, Barry Bonds made a deal with Topps. That is why he does not appear on front (nor is he mentioned on the back) of the 2004 National League Batting Average Leaders card (343), even though he led the NL in batting (his name does appear on the back of the NL Home Run Leaders card (345)). But you will find that this year he has both a regular card (500) and as the 2004 National League MVP award card (716). He should be in the shot of the Giants team (662), but I would not swear to it. Bonds must have gotten a swear deal since his logo appears below the MLBPA logo on the bottom of the box.
I have been collecting baseball cards for a long time, this was a great value on the 2005 factory set.
this baseball card set is the best got the rookie cards i needed the hall of famers and some future hall of famers.
The baseball Cards were in perfect condition. They were exactly what I had expected them to be. I will be ordering more in the future.
I had a hard time finding this anywhere, but Amazon had it.  I brought it for a Christmas gift for someone who collects cards and they were thrilled because they couldn't find it either.
These are for my son and his collection and they are just what he wanted. They arrived in perfect condition and on time.
Its kinda hard to right a review on this item as its more personel and centered to a select group but every card is here very fast shipping and packaging courtesy of amazon. i am very pleased.
this is a very nice set to have , the only difference between the retail set and the factory set is a 5 card variation and a 10 card variation.
I've been collecting baseball cards for many years and this set is a great set.  There are plenty of cards and they look beautiful.  It a typical high quality product that Topps always produces.
This was the best condition a order was i highly recommend this seller to card or baseball collectors.The delivery came in only 4 days and was packaged well.
It's Topps.  I enjoy their cards.  This complete set makes collecting easy, since those fun days of card collecting are gone.
A complete set of new MLB Baseball cards was received quickly, in pristine condition and packaged exceptionally well. Thank you.
good price
While Topps has essentially become the "only game in town" when it comes to boxed annual sets, they do continue to design their sets well. The cards are glossy and well designed. As usual, Topps includes a very informative set of statistics for each player on the back of the cards. There is a good mix of individual player cards, and cards that highlight other aspects of the teams and past year. Nothing fancy, but a nice set of cards nonetheless.
It is rather interesting to discover that a complete set of 1991 Topps Baseball Cards costs you less than what it woudl cost to pick up last year's set (or this year's set for that matter).  Now, the reasons is that we do not know how much these recent sets will be worth down the road because we do not know if they contain the rookie card for the next Babe Ruth.  When you get about 60 cards labeled future stars, prospects, draft picks, and first-year players, there is always the possibility that one of them could turn out to be the official rookie card for the next Roger Clemens or Albert Pujouls. True, the card might come out years before they actually make it to the big leagues (e.g., Mark McGwire's card with the Olympic team), but in the speculation market that is modern baseball card collecting one card that can be worth half the set is the goal.However, I do not buy into the speculation part because I collect what I must now quantify as the regular Topps baseball cards because they are the set that has been around since before I was born, unlike Upper Deck, Bowman, Fleer, Leaf and whatever else is out there today. Currently I have complete Topps sets going back to 1968, with 23 cards to go to finish the 1967, so I would then have complete sets back to 1964, plus 1962, 1957, 1956, and four cards to go for the 1953. Each set is arranged by teams, with the World Series winner first (the Cincinnati Reds in this case) and how each team finished in the standings. True, this become complicated in a world with three divisions and wild card teams winning the championship, but there are basic rules to all this (league leaders and highlights card up top, etc.).The 1991 Topps set, which was the 40th anniversary set for the company, includes seven Record Breaker cards (e.g., Bobby Thigpen sets saves record), 22 All-Star cards (left-handed and right-handed starters, and a relief pitcher, to go with the eight fielder players), seven checklist cards (arranged alphabetically by team), and ten #1 Draft Pick cards, including Chipper Jones (#33), which is the high priced rookie card in the set (he is pretty good, but you would not say he is a lock for Cooperstown at this point).  The second highest priced card is #100A, a Don Mattingly error card, which is not going to be part of the factory set so forget about it, which makes the next highest card that of Nolan Ryan (#1). The 1991 Topps Traded set is where the double-digit card is from this year with Jeff Giambi's team USA card; it also has the Topps rookie cards for Jeff Bagwell, Ivan Rodriguez, Phil Nevin, and Luis Gonzales.What is missing are team cards, which is a bummer, but you do have managers cards with team leaders listed on the back. In terms of current members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, in addition to Ryan there is Tony Gwynn (#180), Dennis Eckersley (#250), Sparky Anderson (#519), George Brett (#540), and Ryne Sandberg (#740). As for future Hall of Famers, the controversy overs the likes of McGwire (#270), Barry Bonds (#570), and Sammy Sosa (#414) will continue for some time to come (Rafael Palmeiro appears to be toast at this point), but Greg Maddux (#35), Cal Ripken (#150), Randy Johnson (#225), Roger Clemens (#530), Eddie Murray (#590), Rickey Henderson (#670), and Ken Griffey, Jr. (#790) are obvious first ballot selectees down the road (unless "Sports Illustrated" runs book excerpts on them between now and when the BWAA votes on their admission). Others would be purely speculation at this point, but during Spring Training that is just one of the things baseball fans get to argue about.
I have purchased complete sets of baseball cards by topps for years and my grandsons love and enjoy the set.  They are complete have all players and additional players you can't purchase anywhere.  I would recommend these cards to anyone who enjoys baseball and is a collector of baseball cards.
The purchase was very fast and the product was A+.  It's the third time we have purchased TOPP Baseball Cards from Amazon.  It was a very good experience.
Beyond-me to actually judge this product, but hubby loved it.  So that is good-enough for me. : )  Will do it next Christmas too.  Recommend!
The 2011 Topps Complete MLB set came in excellent condition.  I am very pleased with the set and the timely fashion in which it was received.
Baseball cards for my 8 year old grandson.  He had started collecting them earlier this year.  I could watch him, and see myself at the same age.  This is a perfect Christmas gift for him, and it will contain a note to his mother, not to throw away the baseball cards.
I ordered what I was expecting to be an unopened, sealed factory set of 2011 Topps MLB trading cards , and that is exactly what I recieved. Very appreciative of it.
Well packaged and sealed, would recommend to all baseball card collectors.Most valuable card was ken griffey jr card, you can't beat this deal!
Sent to my nephew for his birthday arrived quick complete and good quality!
I have to say I was really impressed with this purchase. It was a gift for someone and he really enjoyed the cards even though he was born well after they were stars. It is a complete set of cards from the 92-93 season so don't expect too many surprises. There are no packs to open it is all just what comes in the box. Lots and lots of cards though and yes, even a Shaq rookie card.
The Cards were in perfect shape and everything was as described.  Made a great Christmas gift for my son.  Quick delivery!!
this is a great box of cards my boy loves it all he wants to do is play with the cards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My son gets these sets for Christmas every year. He loves his baseball cards, and is collecting them for an investment.
Wrapped and exactly what was advertised! Starting a collection for my son and every Christmas I buy him a set.
This is always a highlight of the Christmas presents for my husband to receive. I appreciate the quick service of the sender. There are no hobby shops near where we live, so it's convenient to order it online.
I ordered what I was expecting to be an unopened, sealed factory set of 2010 Topps MLB trading cards , and that is exactly what I recieved. Very appreciative of it
These cards were just as I expected.  They were in excellent condition.  I would recommend them for any collector.  Good job.
I always love opening baseball card packs. The cards arent worth much these days, but they are always fun to collect.
A boxed set of 200 cards in a case that looks like SkyDome in Toronto site of the All-Star Game.  This set featues notable Draft Picks Desi Relaford, Kevin Stocker, Scott Hatteberg ofMoneyballfame, Manny Ramirez, Cliff Floud, Jorge Faberegas,Shawn Green RC (Rookie Card) Toronto Blue Jays (Baseball Card) 1992 Stadium Club Dome #67, and overall #1 pick Brien Taylor.Some team USA members which Topps sponsored includingJason Giambi USA Team USA BB (Baseball Card) 1992 Stadium Club Dome #58.Noteable All Stars include Tony Gwynn,Rickey Henderson AS Oakland Athletics (Baseball Card) 1992 Stadium Club Dome #83, Kirby Puckett, Carlton Fisk, Paul Molitor, Cal Ripken, Jr, and Ken Griffy, Jr.This is a fun nice set to have in a collection. Many of the draft picks look like senior pictures, only a few made it to the Big Leagues.
I love baseball cards. They are not worth much these days, but they are fun to open. I love cards.
I purchased these cards for my husband as a gift. He prefers the Topps Baseball cards  over all the collections that are out there. We both liked the fact that the set comes with extra cards for collecting. For the collector of basball cards these are a must. They have the information of every player on the reverse side, listing all the stats about the player throughout there playing season. I would definately recommend these to the individual collector.
I have just started collecting baseball cards again after a long time of not collecting. I have purchased 3 of these sets ('08-'10) and I love them all. Comes with a lot of rookies and the previous years award winners. These are great cards if u like to have the complete set without buying multiple small packs.
This was a great purchase my brother-in-law founds some cards that he had been wanting. Great purchase for the price, so many cards offered in one package.
you can never go wrong with topps, and this is another great  set. Got a lot of inserts and my one game used card. Gonna buy again
These are exactly like the ones I had when they first came out.  Brought back some good memories looking at them!!!  I love them.
I am a 67 year old grandmom that collects baseball cards in hopes that someday they will be worth something for my grandchildren.  These arrived on time in excellent condition.
What can I say, I Love them.  I'm 67 and love Baseball.  Service was great, arrived on time in excellent shape.  Thanks
This set of cards is perfect as a gift or just collect them...First off let's clear one thing you not going to like these cards if you don't like tennis. So if you like tennis and the people who play you find it nice to know about the competition....
product came a day earlier than expected, and got a great variety although with only 100 cards in the set i got a few duplicates and a nearly completed set, I got 7 foils, and the 8th foil was a duplicate.
I gave this gift to my grandson for Christmas.  It was his favorite gift of all.

Purchasing the hobby edition of any card series is the best way to get autographed cards and the chrome version are by far the top dog!
I have to give enormous credit to Amazon.com's packaging for their hobby boxes. I was extremely impressed with how tightly it was packaged and how it conformed with the BGS grading packaging by applying cardboard to both sides of the box as well as on each outside area.I utilized the free shipping option and not a dent came to this package when it came in.As for my pull, nothing fantastic this time around but they can't all be winners. I pulled the designated Rookie Auto one per box and got enough singles to get my set closer to completion. Unfortunately I only pulled one serial numbered refractor (blue).Hoping the next box has better pulls but can't blame amazon for that :)I love the Chrome set, cards look great, fun to collect, love the parallels.
I pulled a 1/1 Cyan Plate from the one box I bought and of course a rookie auto. Lots of rookies, a Montana rookie reprint and several nice refractors.
This is the second Hobby Box we purchased of the 2010 Topps Chrome Football and must say I got better results with the first box hitting a 1/10 Gold Refracter Auto. Also the combination of inserts, rookie cards was as advertised if not better. I also might add I didn't pull any duplicates which is a big plus!
Jackie DeShannon wonderfully prolific throughout great musical sixties, trailblazing singer/songwriter amassed a phenomenal catalog of great songs plus an impressive array of richly varied hits including timeless sixties anthem "What The World Needs Now Is Love", itself defining the great long-lost era in many ways, leaving sixties produced "To Be Free" a captivating singer/songwriter masterpiece that should have put the legendary lady at the top of the industry plus garnered "Grammy Awards" for a totally amazing accomplishment, highly entertaining collection is a great mix of mostly original gems still sounding compelling & richly illuminating today, now Out Of Print masterwork going for big bucks making one wonder what happened back when originally released, sadly this happened over and over to an trailblazing artist who is one of the greatest ever and still going...After unexplained lack of commercial success for "To Be Free", the great singer/songwriter went off Liberty/Imperial after a decade signing to Capitol Records hoping for greater creative control plus promotion lacking at former label. First off Capitol teamed Jackie with legendary producer Chips Moman, musical genius known for having his own ideas and turned out instead of more creative control, sessions became unreleased for decades album featuring only one of her original songs, have a feeling this may have ultimately caused project to be shelved yet the surprise here upon first issue decades later, these totally amazing tracks showcase Jackie in a brilliant way, looks like this along other great seventies releases could have been the possible blockbuster she was hoping for, strange with all the great recordings this legendary lady produced during this period none were the success they deserved to be. Opener "Stoned Cold Soul" engaging rhythm track perfectly frames strong richly soulful DeShannon vocal, clearly at her peak with legendary background vocalists Vanetta Fields, Clydie King, Shirlie Matthews and it doesn't get better than this. Goffin/King "Child Of Mine" is a hauntingly brilliant vocal backed by inspired stellar musicans & glorious heavenly choir, total effect is magnificent making it a mystery how anything this brilliant remained unreleased for decades. Catchy rhythm hook with fascinating orchestration make "Johnny Joe From California" an engaging backdrop for winning DeShannon vocal that has the sound of a hit as does mesmerizing "Makes You Beautiful" with a soft soul-deep vocal that floats through this unique gem. "Sweet Inspiration" takes it to church with an appealing gospel feel, choral backdrop frame sensual Jackie stellar vocal, those "Memphis cats" play brilliant on organ & guitar making this enjoyable stellar track a remarkable achievement in a collection filled with them! Earthy sensual jam "Sleepin' With Love" another amazing hot track having sound of "hit" all through it...mesmerizing lone DeShannon original blends to perfection with classic Memphis tracks, hypnotic richly soulful vocal beautifully framed by lean brilliant guitar & stellar whistler arrangement is captivating. Funky jam "Live Till You Die" add to the overall feeling this compelling collection would have been "Jackie In Memphis" masterpiece, her seductive soulful voice is perfection in a flawless setting. Having the feel of few years earlier Jackie definitive version of "The Weight", "And It Stoned Me" has a glorious soul-deep stellar vocal once again featuring incredibly inspired musicians.Great artist traditionally save their best for last, hauntingly brilliant Arlo Guthrie "Gabriel's Mother's Highway" lives up to this tradition big time...magnificent inspired vocal tour-de-force has got to be high on the list of all time greatest Jackie DeShannon performances, listening gives chills necessitating repeated play as everything is perfection, arrangement flows with heavenly choir backing a magnificent stunning ethereal vocal, all stops out to the depths of her soul in a riveting way rarely experienced in song, everyone gave their all creating a glorous masterpiece thankfully remastered in all of its original glory, so clear listener feels like they are in the Memphis Studio where once upon a time phenomenal music was created."Songs" lone released Capitol Records album featuring three DeShannon originals being a far cry from "To Be Free" featuring all but two original DeShannon compositions but two more than Moman sessions...must have been frustrating but aside from that "Songs" is another incredible release from the legendary lady who clearly is incapable of making anything but a great album!"Songs" features lean backing compared to monumental production of Chips Moman project, yet throughout has a lush full sound with Jackie once again in rich full voice at her passionate soulful best...opener "Keep Me Warm" a mesmerizing sensual gem and lone 45rpm Capitol release, clearly with radio support this warm quietly but throughly seductive gem would have been a huge hit...always an affinity for Dylan bring definitive "Lay Baby, Lay" with sensual passionate vocal that floats brilliantly through what could have been another huge hit if given single release. Original "West Virginia Mine" gem is another soulful anthem with that hit sound all through it, powerful vocal mixed with engaging stellar keyboard by Randy Edelman, later to become husband of some forty plus years, where does the time go? "Show Me" lone survivor from Moman sessions is a rousing fun track with vintage dance hall arrangement featuring a loose DeShannon engaging vocal...back to church jam "Down By The Riverside" is a wild exhilarating cooker feeling as though it might fly off the track, taking the old spiritual on the exciting ride of a lifetime making a totally infectious anthem out of it...spirituality continues in low key "International", beautiful gem with a timeless message of the importance of inclusion. "Sunny Days" has a sentimental yearning while small town "Salinas" is another engaging DeShannon original with her stellar guitar nicely framing soft and soulful vocal. Tour-de-force "Bad Water" is an infectious DeShannon original, riveting hot rocker should have been choice for "Songs" single release, funky jammin' cooker would have gone to #1 in a flash with any exposure at all, what were they thinking and where at the least was FM radio? Closing brilliant with soaring passionate "Ease Your Pain" in a magnificent epic way, music lovers will wonder how this incredibly great album missed, certainly quality had nothing to do with it as there is not a throw-away track in the entire stellar collection of peerless performances, certain to satisfy lovers of those classic vocal albums that for the most part have become a thing of the past, therefore making this collection worth its weight in gold...don't miss out on this rare Import collection, both "Songs" & phantom album find DeShannon at her soulful best in a period where a magical musical masterpiece was the outcome when she commented to a recorded project, once this phenomenal masterpiece is no longer available price will soar like the legendary singers amazing soul-deep yet soaring voice...Bravo Jackie!
After many years on the Liberty label, Jackie had a brief period on Capitol. During that time, she recorded one album produced by Chips Moman that wasn't released, another album produced by Jackie with Eric Malamud that was released, then a few more tracks that weren't released. The masters for those last few tracks have apparently been lost so this CD is made up of those first two albums. The set begins with the album that was released, Songs, which includes one track from the unreleased album. It seems that Jackie moved to Capitol in the hope of greater artistic freedom, but I suspect that if she got it, she would have stayed longer than she did.The music here is certainly different from Jackie's earlier music, but that music was itself diverse. Jackie made a definite attempt to get back to her roots, which were a mix of rock, country and R+B. I've never noticed much country in Jackie's music, but there is a little. West Virginia mine (a song about the plight of coalminers) is the kind of song that you might expect a country singer to record, but I don't recall hearing any covers of this song. Lay lady lay is a cover of Bob Dylan's classic song from his Nashville skyline album, which was as near as Bob came to recording a country album of his own. Ease your pain is a cover of a Hoyt Axton song. Hoyt had some success as a country singer but, like his mother, is best remembered as a songwriter.Apart from West Virginia mine, Jackie wrote three other songs here (Now that the desert is blooming, Bad water, Salinas), all of a high quality. Johnny Christopher co-wrote three of the others. Pick of the three is the opening track (Keep me warm) but the other two (Johnny Joe from California, Show me) are also well worth hearing. None of them will be as famous as two other songs that Johnny co-wrote (Suspicious minds, Always on my mind) but I don't think Jackie ever recorded either of those two songs. This set does include notable covers of And it stoned me (Van Morrison), Gabriel's mother's highway (Arlo Guthrie), Child of mine (a Goffin-King song) and Sunny days (Randy Edelman).This may not be the most accessible collection of Jackie's music that you'll come across. You really need to play it a few times to appreciate it, but there is much to enjoy if you let it grow on you.
Jackie DeShannon is one of the most underappericated singer songwriters of the 60's and 70's. Best know for "Put a Little Love in Your heart" and writing "Betty Davis Eyes" there was plently more GOLD in the years she bounced around from Label to label (Liberty, Captiol, Atlantic, Columbia, Amherest) trying to find get into the stride of hit records. While there were more commerical "Misses" than hits, that by no means reflects the quality and depth of the material. "Songs" was her only Lp on Captiol, this ressiue includes bonus tracks from the vault as well as the excellent 1971 Lp. Also don't miss "Jackie, Plus" On Atlantic, "New Arrangment" on Columbia.
The cards were great!  My grandson loved them.  I'm sure he will keep this for  his children.
I have been looking for these cards every where. I found some. But, they were asking $20 to $25 for them. He had them for a GREAT price. And, the shipping was FAST and SECURE!!!
I was looking basically for baseball cards which included Jim Thome and Paul Konerko (mainly) as well as the entire 2005 Chicago White Sox World Championship Baseball team.  The cards were in great condition...all brand new, no bent edges or any kind of blemish.  They arrived within only 2-3 days after I ordered them.  I checked several sources, and these cards were much cheaper and more inclusive than any of the other places.I have to admit I'm not an extensive collector like my son and daughter.  I just wanted a more personal memento of the championship team, but I also am a really big fan of Jim Thome who will someday be in baseball's Hall of Fame.So I really have no idea of the real value of these cards, but I can tell you I felt I got a really good deal price wise.  I also am pleased with the entire assortments. I can also recommend this seller for his speed in delivering the items to me and also sending me cards that were described exactly as what was delivered to me.  A buyer will have no trouble dealing with this seller, and I can't recommend them highly enough!!
My grandson LOVES the Yankees and I have ordered many Yankee &#34;Memories&#34; from Amazon..All have arrived perfectly and are proudly displayed in his room. The rookie card is for his birthday, so it is being saved. This Thursday, my daughter is taking my grandson to spring training to see Derek Jeter practice for his last season. Thank you for having these treasures for us.Grandmother in SC
These cards are AMAZING, they have tons of hall of famers with also multiple cards of the same people, every card is in MINT condition, and I even got 2 autographs, it almost completed my basketball card collection, great cards with great value
Despite a frustrating miscommunication about shipping, the product was well-worth the wait!  I use basketball cards to reward my kids for various things and with this collection, I won't have to buy anymore for a very long time!
Super fast service from this vendor, Package arrived undamaged and order was complete. Normally I do not buy trading cards in this manner, but I really recieved alot of good stuff in this bundle. Will shop this vendor again.
I bought these for my son who is 10 and boy was he excited.  He collects baseball cards and loves history as well.  These are not super vintage, being from the 80s and 90s.They were unopened in the package and as pictured.  Some even had gum in them!
My eight year old son had hours of fun opening them.  He said the gum was awful...25 year old trading card gum.  Other than that, great gift for a sports nut child.  I couldn't believe that these would be available.  He wants more for Christmas.
I am very happy with these packs. they were very cheap for how many cards you get (got approximately 330 cards)a couple of topps & upper deck packs but mostly Donruss, Fleer & some brands i've never even heard of.Pros: good amount of cards for the money. Sealed & came with a box that you can hold the cards in.Cons: NONEThanks For reading!
Very cool gift and a great deal too!  As always very, very happy with the customer service and the product!
buy every year for my son. cards are mint and he loves going thru them. has found some valuable cards in the sets
I bought this product two week ago this product can be hit or miss  fortunally i hit the jack pot they gave me a pack of the oringal T206 and i pull a honus wagner card way better than describe wow i won the jack pot sometime when buy this product you will be surprise BUYER GIVE THIS PRODUCT A TRY
Shipping was fast. Cards were exactly as shown, good quality and unopened as stated. My son spent hours opening all the packs and looking at the "old" uniforms...some even had gum in them still!  It was a good purchase
Got 27 packs instead of 25 lol. Well first off these packs did not seem to be opened prior to my purchase but i am not an expert. I was very happy with the cards i received, and the bubble gum was scrumptious! Lol not but it was cool to eat bubblegum that is a few years older than me. But buying these cards did not break my bank and was a cool addition to my many other cards. So all in all 20 bucks for a few hundred cards and stickers is worthwhile to me.
I gave this as a Christmas present to a couple friends that I collected babseballl cards with in the late '80s. They loved it. We probably sat around for 2 hours opening packs and going over long lost names.
arrived quick and in perfect condition.  They are going to be used as stocking stuffers for all the boys the family and to get my 6 month old grandson's collection started.
These are great and a good buy.  We bought them for our kids baseball team and give them away at the end of each game.  Plenty of cards and exactly what you expect.  If you need a lot of cards and look forward to surprises - well, this one if for you!
I bought these unopened packs of baseball cards for stocking stuffers. The packs came as described and I received all 25 packs. Shipping was fast. They will be first cards for some and I'm sure they will enjoy them when opened.
the cards were purchased as a gift and were a great value  shipping was expeditious and my grandson was so exciTed to get the baseball cards
A lot of great cards from famous players from many different teams in both leagues.  I really enjoyed them and added them to my collection.
wonderful, just wonderful.We both had a lot of fun opening these olds packs. I highly recommend this seller, he sent me a large selection of different types of cards, some I'd never even seen before.. Can't say enough, and We did find a few rookie cards too.
I bought these as a gift for a 10 year old who is in love with baseball. We were both so happy, there was a great mix of cards with some really great players included.
My son is just getting into baseball, and he is reading about the players from the 80's , and 90's.These cards are great for him to check out the past players - and the are in great shape - and it brings back memoriesArrived in great shape!
My grandson wanted to give his dad a picture of Derek Jeter.  This was reasonable, easy to purchase and made my grandson happy to be able to give his Yankee fan dad a gift that he would like.
This card is a great collectible card and since it came in mint condition in a case someday it will be worth money
We absolutely are pleased with this standup.  My son LOVES anakin so you can imagine his surprise when we opened this up.  Thanks so much
It comes in two parts. Anakin is part one and the lightsaber with arm is two parts. There are sticky tabs to put them together. Pretty easy. The only thing I did different was put some extra cardboard behind the light saber to stiffen it up. I'm 6' tall and this thing is taller then me and High definition quality. My daughter loves it! I would recommend it to any STAR WARS fan!
This is a really cool item for a Star Wars fan.  This was also the cheapest price on the internet.
I buy the latest Topps card collection every year.  I am never disappointed.  (I'm not sure what to give as an educational and durability rating - I'm fairly certain they are neither of those nor are they meant to be).
I bought this $75 value football tin for my ten-year old grandson for Christmas.  Not only was my grandson thrilled but his uncle, his stepdad and his mom went through all the cards with him.  It transcended all our expectations!  And, as always with Amazon, it was shippped almost immediately; it arrived in 1-2 days; and it was in perfect condition.
They are nice cards for some one's who like baseball you got to be crazy for them.. I got it for my boys they went crazy Ha Ha...
I was in error with my previous rating, because of my lack of knowledge with regard to how boxes of baseball cards are sold.  My apologies to Innovations Unlimited.  I did receive that which was advertised, I just did not understand that what I received was what I had ordered. Further this distributor was quick to respond to my response and offered to send me additional cards at no cost to "make right" a situation that was right!  Hats off to Innovations Unlimited for caring enough to make all sales happy sales!
I bouth this for my sister as she is constantly buying up base ball cards.  The cards were all in great shape, with a great assortment of cards from a variety of years.  It was shipped and recieved very quickly.
Certainly worth every penny, what my grandson had his heart on, and he enjoyed it like it was xmas day.
This was a great product to buy! I recieved Cards such as Marc Mcweier Sammy Sosa George Brett and so on! It had a great price and cards. I also liked that it came so fast. I was looking at cards for hours. It is a great way to boost a  collection in a hurry. It is also a great begginers pack. I would higly reccomend it. The only problem is it had a couple of doubles. But it was a great purchase!
Nephew loves baseball and these cards were a great gift for him. Their were so many cards he did not have. Perfect gift for the baseball fan in your family.
I bought this item for my 12 yr old son's birthday.  He has recently started collecting cards after joining his first youth league and enjoying it immensely.  He now watches baseball constantly on tv and collects cards.  I bought these to help jumpstart his collection and i'm sure he will get years of enjoyment from them.  The cards arrived sooner than expected and in excellent condition.
great product, great addition to any baseball card collection. this product helped me grow my collection alot because i ordered two of this product, I loved the wonder of opening up the box for the first time to see what I have gotten. I recomend this product to any baseball card collector.
I love it because even though it was used it was almost new some scratch cards were scratched . the seller was really nice when i talked to him. It met all my expectations. I would recommend this product for all card collectors of all walks of life. It is a really good product for starters.
My grandson loved this beginners set of 500-plus cards. And what a price. About a penny apiece.
I have not yet received my cards, but I am excited to receive them for myself although I will share with others.Just a note to the person who mentioned having 35 Ken Caminiti cards.Don't forget that Ken Caminiti died of a heart attack several years ago and the Ken Caminiti cards may increase in value over the years because of his death.There may be others also, but my reasons for collecting cards are for the pleasure of reading the cards and separating them by teams.I will enjoy the cards when I receive them in three or four days from Amazon.
A lot of cards. I am giving this as a gift. I hope in all of these cards there will be something of value to him. Thank you!
Trying to have my son start his first baseball card kit he loves them I will be ordering more soon.
The person I sent this to liked it.  I sent 2 boxes because the cost was good.Its for a baseball coach who gives the cards as rewards for school work done before the practices.
I purchased this set of 500 cards for my grandson's 9th birthday. He said it was the best birthday present ever. He loves the stats on baseball players old and new and this collection had some of the great players such as Carl Yastremski, Roger Clements, and a lot of the old favorites. He has only gotten through the first 100 cards so far and even his Dad is excited about them and wants his own box. Guess who is getting what for Christmas!! What a fantastic present for such a reasonable price. I am now going over my birthday/Christmas list to see what boys I might send this collection to since it is the "greatest" gift ever according to my Jimmy!
If your child is just getting started with baseball cards, this is an awesome starter pack deal.  Five hundred is a LOT of cards, even with some duplicates!  Good fun!
grandson was so excited he continues to look up the names and tells me all about them i am so glad i purchased them for him
It was definitely worth the price I paid plus some. Really good deal. I would definitely buy another set in the future
My grandson has been collecting cards for a long time and this was a great choice for him. This was great I ordered it and it was here in no time.  Love shopping on Amazon.
In our home we're a Hatfield-McCoy type family but its the Dallas Cowboys versus Washington Redskins!! My son has his area complete with this beautiful collectable..I was surprised that its a larger version than I thought it would be..worth every cent!!
i love it now i just got to get him to sign it. it came to the house very quickly. will get more if i see my favorite players
It came on time and the price was excellent, I will definitely use these guys in the future.
Shipping was slow..... but the cards were amazing. No autographs or jerseys but at least 3 cards of great players like MJ(2),Scottie Pipen(5), Larry Bird(3),Magic Johnson(2). GREAT DEAL!
Last time I opened basketball card packs I was like 14 years old. And now 17 years later, I felt like a kid again. I remember I loved to open packs, and the sensation of not knowing what you gonna get its really great. Actually I got really cool cards, some of them Michael Jordan's.
Bought this lot for my 7 year old son that plays basketball.  He loved opening the packs and hearing Daddy talk about players he remembers from his youth.  Great price for the not so serious card collector.
It is amazing!!! There is a lot of cool cards, and I agree with you, it is so fun to open packs. My brother just got some, and mine are coming on Friday. I can't wait!!!
collector got card i didnt have very cool loved it thank you very much two thumbs up :) very happy
What a deal!  This should make my great grandson the card King of Costa Mesa.I expect hugs and kisses when I give him this.
