They told me looks like new....bad the box and tape are in really bad conditions ....i will not recommend no one to buy use items..  att. JULIER
This video does not work up to breaking a sweat.  It is for the extreme beginner who wants an introduction to working out.  They go over the steps too slow and do not spend enough time actually working out.  The dance steps are simple and few.  I bought this video because it was recommended as a dance video.  It has your typical workout moves and two very basic latin dance steps.  It is a slow going work out video that does not keep you engaged.
This is a halfway decent product, but those who made it should at least be aware that there was no "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar" at UCLA and make the product and the packaging accordingly.  He still went by Lew Alcindor.  Having a card from his UCLA days with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar emblazoned across it is pretty pathetic.
It has been opened up before, so you don't know if he has taken cards or not. I suggest to not get it from this buyer.
I'm not happy with the product.  I'm thinking of just super glueing it because if not, it just falls apart if touched.
this item was not up to snuff, i returned it for a different display case which is a whole lot more rigid.
I'm giving my father a signed Eddie Mathews baseball bat as a gift for Christmas and needed a way to house it so I could wrap it.  Plus I wanted it to be something he could use to display it so he wouldn't need to buy something else after.Cue this BallQube Display Case.How it works: This case comes as two L-shaped clear acrylic pieces, two end caps, and two clear acrylic size-adjusters for the ends.  It works this way: you take the bat, close the L-shaped acrylic pieces around it, and then fit the end pieces onto the ends of the acrylic.  There's nothing more holding it together, just the black plastic end pieces.  The bat I had couldn't fit with those other clear acrylic end sizers, so I'm not using them.The Bad: Once put together, if you grab the case at the middle, the L-shaped acrylic pieces fold over upon one another because it simply isn't rigid enough to maintain its shape.  The clear acrylic isn't very thick.  I have acrylic ball cubes that I think have thicker clear acrylic than this does.  I'd be afraid to hang this thing horizontally on the wall because I don't foresee it having a great deal of longevity with how fragile it feels.The Good: It's inexpensive.  It's not hard to figure it out.In conclusion, I really don't recommend this case for your valuable signed bat collectibles.  I'm almost embarrassed to be giving my father the Eddie Mathews bat in this awful case.  However, the alternative is to spend another $75+ and get a glass case, and considering that would be around the same price I paid for the bat, it seems a little too pricey.
I was expecting to receive two boxes of MLB 2011 Topps Complete Factory Set baseball cards identical to the one pictured in the above advertisement.  Instead, I received two cardboard boxes with stickers stating &#34;Do Not Open Contents Sold as Package.&#34;  The MLB 2013 sets were exactly as advertised, and I was expecting the 2011 sets to be the same.I have two grandsons for whom I have collected these baseball cards each year since their births.  One grandson will be 18 in March, and I have never received a &#34;Like New&#34; product when I was expecting a &#34;New&#34; product.  All the other boxes through the years have been as those advertised in the above picture.  I fear the value of his collection will have been reduced by this purchase and would like to exchange these two boxes 2011 MLB Topps complete factory sets for two as advertised in the picture above.Please send any return correspondence to llbutcher@wolcottpartners.com as I purchased this merchandise and not my husband.
Simply not much in this box of cards. Not many standout players and there was really nothing compelling about this particular Fleer Series that would make a collector want to invest time, money and space to buy and hold.
I may be generous in giving this item two stars. There is nothing here unless you really, really collect common cards. No stars, no rookies, mostly unheralded players. Most teams, only 4-5 player cards per team. Again, unless you're searching for commons, don't waste your time and money on this.
I&#34;ve purchased Fleer cards before ,but never have i purchased a factory set an it not have a single good card in it ! This certain item didnt even have a rookie card in it, half the case was pitcher cards!!!! I was very disappointed with this certain purchase!!!!
Fun names for some of them.  Not an inclusive pack of all players.  Cards don't even feel coated or professional.  Kinda weird.  Only real value is to see fun names from the past.
The description for these cards says packs from the 1980's-1990's. We did not receive even one pack from the 80s. All pack were from the 90s. Do not expect to get any great cards in these packs.
Cards from the 80' don't expect too many. I just got like three of them. the rest, 1992 and 1993. better than the cmpany I bought before,but still not what I was looking for.
I have purchased unopened packs on EBay in the past. They were opened and searched with very little done to conceal it. DON'T BUY THESE
Too many dupes from too many bad teams (the cards are of no names who were on bad teams). I had at least 20, 7+ duplicates.
The cards are a gift so I am not going to review them as I don't know much about them.  I will say however that the listing is deceiving - it says &#34; Packed in a 550-count storage box&#34; so I assumed that the cards came in some sort of box.  Instead they were just stuffed into USPS shipping box which I would think would not be the best way to handle something that could be collectible.  Seeing the presentation has made me now start to question the quality and &#34;realness&#34; of the cards.  A little disappointed.
I received cards from the 80s and 90s, which of course was when cards were mass produced.  This was expected.  But what made me buy this box was the chance of having older cards from the 50s 60s and 70s which the box is described to have.  I would have settled for a few cards in the 70's but did not receive any card older than 1986.  Very disappointing.  There were a couple of nice bonus cards added based on where I live I'm assuming and its appreciated but they are from 1994 and does not nearly make up for the absence of the promised bonus older cards.  I knew there'd be a chance I wouldn't get any but I was hoping I'd be one of the lucky few who have written previous reviews and seem to have gotten a few of them.  On the bright side it was only around 20 dollars including shipping and handling so I won't make a fuss about returning it for not being given what was offered.  And as I most likely have the cards that were given to me in my collection already I will definitely not order this again and will not recommend it unless you are getting it for a child to start a collection like others have said.  Just don't expect to get any cards older than the 80s.
Barely any of the cards are active MLB players, none of the cards are recent. The newest cards were in 2000
Was very disappointed I did NOT recieve any autograph packs are mostly 90-95 not a single eighties pack at all! It was however here basically the next day packaged very well> I guess the discription fits the sellar has up just the years are a little off and you wont get any rookies from those years of the guys the sellar names!!!  overall kinda stinky honestly autograph says will be there not anywhere I found.Again the sellar did discribe it very close just a few things in the wording that might make you jump on it that didnt happen for me!!!! some of the packs that are in foil wrapper look great the ones in wax packs look like the could have been resealed my advice tread lightly here!!! sorry I m never to complain normally just wanna give others a fair description of what they would recieve!!!!
As a kid growing up in the 80's, the amount of baseball cards you had was often one indicator of your coolness factor and social status.  We collected, traded, and spent every birthday dollar on these things and that stupid piece of gum that was like chewing on a strip of slate.  It was fun, sure, but as kids we were led to believe buying baseball cards was as good as investing in gold.  We all had access to the Becket pricing guide and thought we just needed to hold on to these cards for about 20 years, sell them, then buy a mansion in the hills.It's now 20 years later.  I suppose these cards are one more thing from a vastly optimistic childhood that just seems silly as a logical adult.  My set of these still has the price tag on them.  In 1989, my dad bought me this complete set for $[...].  Today, it's barely worth $[...] depending on where you look.  What a scam.We were sold a dream, but it was a lie told to kids to make a buck.  Do yourself a favor and switch to a different hobby.
Decent mix of sets, some good ones, but unfortunately for the most part it's your typical cheap early 90s stuff, and I'm pretty sure i saw nothing from either the 80s or 00s.  Overwhelmingly common too, don't expect to find Gretzky, Lemieux or Inserts, just some semi-stars and that's about it.  If you're looking to collect some cards, I'd look elsewhere.  You won't be completing sets here anytime soon, and you'll likely just be getting cards that you'll see multiples of down the road if you actually are working on a collection.  A little pricey for what you end up getting in the end IMO.
The cards in the box were bent and water damaged. Very disappointing in the player selection in the box. will not purchase again from this seller
I order a couple boxes before Christmas and they were great! You could tell it was a legit random card box. Now I just received my second lot of 2 boxes and you can tell they have been picked through and organized. Also the boxes are now smaller containing approx 100 less cards. It was nice while it lasted..
As a big sports card collector for many years, very disappointed. You were led to believe you were getting a $400 investment for $27. Not even close. I received maybe $30 (in book value). Alot of commons. Few rookies and the ones I did receive have very little value. About 25% of the cards I received had surface wear. Probally from years of sitting on shelves and sticking together. Not in penny sleeves. Lowers the value even more on cards that are worth pennies on the dollar to begin with. It was fun looking at football cards from the late 80's-early 2000 but I have tons of them already. In fact I could give a better deal than this without trying. Will never buy again.
I was not happy this time. I have ordered this product twice now with no problems. My problem this was that all the card were commons. They were in sequential numbers with the good cards picked out. What a waste. I wish they would have been more forthright about what I was getting. Product description should be as such:Box of football cards. Around 500 pretty much worthless cards from three years, 89,90,91. We have picked the good cards so you dont have to, then we mail you the rest. Have fun while looking at 500 worthless cards. HAHAHAHAHA!!! WE HAVE YOUR MONEY!!!HAHAHAHA!!!With that being said, it was only with one seller. The other seller I bought 2 from was outstanding. Stay away from the cheaper deals on this product.
Not what was advertised, not a good deal for the price.99.9% was common players.Only good card was a natrone means rc.Only of value to someone like me.Do not recommend to anyone looking for hits.
$400 dollars worth of cards for $9.99? Either this is the deal of the century or most likely way off base. I might purchase one so I can total the value of the cards myself. Would be surprisingly nice f it were true though, I would buy as many as possible.
It says they are &#34;unsearched&#34; but that is not the case. Several of our cards had sleeves on them, none were really worth hoping to get, there are many duplicates. The kiddo liked it for xmas though.
Definitely not worth the money i spent on this product. The description says Over 3000 FOOTBALL(NFL) cards but i got hundreds of generic college basketball cards and even some college baseball and college track... Also There were numerous instances where there was over 30 of the same card.
thanks for sending me the 1989 football traded card set.  too bad i ordered the 1989 traded baseball set.  oh well. i guess you can't get them all right.
I ordered this box and after opening every pack I received a few limited cards but when I say limited I mean to 1-2000 limited. I didn't get one autograph or jersey, not worth the price at all.
I purchased a tin of these for my dad as an Xmas gift. While the tin delivers four hits and two base cards, it seems that one is destined to pull mostly commons from most tins. I purchased a separate tin from Blowout Cards and also received the requisite four hits but all commons. The Amazon price was $57.99 my other tin cost roughly $48. I would say that both prices did not deliver the value I was looking for given that this is at least a semi-premium product.
I don't believe this is 1987. The picture shows a box that is not 1987. That logo wasn't used in 1987. The logo on the box in the pic was stopped being used in 1980.
The product itself was satisfactory, but the delivery of it was not.  While it did arrive on Christmas Eve, it was not until after I had placed my order that I was informed the cards may not arrive in time for Christmas.  It would be one thing if there were multiple delivery options, which generally provide time frames for delivery, but there was only one delivery option.  Since purchases made in December are presumptively for Christmas, vendors should alert the customer BEFORE they order and pay that something may not arrive by the time it is needed.  In this case, I believe the seller was intentionally silent on delivery time so that it could make a sale.In sum, if you need something by a date certain, be careful when ordering from this seller.
You know, you make it sound like there are only New York Yankees cards in there. That's not good. It's just like any other complete set!
I just opened a box of 2008 Topps chrome football that I bought at Blowout Cards Fantastic Store. On the whole, the box yielded all of the key rookies: Flacco, Ryan, Forte, Mendenhall. My problem with the box was that the majority of the cards were damaged i.e., soft corners. The pack that contained the auto, Henry Douglas, held five cards, but all were damaged. The auto had the most damage. Additionally, the box claims to contain a box topper, which supposedly includes a numbered refractor of press plate. I got a refractor but it was not numbered. Overall the box was a huge disappointment despite the mix of cards being ok. The inserts are a waste of time unless you get a good player. I think the $50 to $60 price point is fair, but I believe the real value of these boxes is similar to 2006 Bowman Chrome, which typically retails in the $30 to $40 range.
Disappointing with the selections relieved. would not buy again. The autographed card was someone I never heard of.Lots of duplicate cards not a very good selection.
A big baseball family,  we have made it a tradition to buy each new grandchild a factory set of Topps Baseball Cards for the year of their birth.  Had twins this year so bought two sets.  Got them at a very reasonable price and they were delivered very quickly and in perfect condition.  Very pleased with supplier and with Amazon.com.
Pros:The artwork is very solid, an improvement over MM Series 2 for sure, and the chase cards look fantastic!Cons:Even with a full box, I was unable to complete the base set.  Having incomplete chase sets is understandable, but a full box should always give a complete base set.  Furthermore, out of 27 chase cards, I received 10 unique chase cards, and about 5 repeats.  The box was not factory sealed, and none of the packs contained a sketch card, which is incredibly disappointing.  I had the same problem w/ MM Series 2, but at least that box made up for it by having 2 Fantastic Four memorabilia cards.  Also, many of the cards had stuck together, and many of the chase cards had noticeable chipping around the edges.  Finally, the set focuses almost solely on villains, with no dedicated hero cards other than the chases.Overall, I liked the artwork of this set much better than MM Series 2, but the unsealed box and the lack of a complete base set are very disappointing, without mentioning the lack of chase or sketch cards.  I've been collecting trading cards for years and I know there's a lot of luck involved with chase cards, but with 27 different chase cards to collect I think it would be fair to include them at a higher rate, and sketch cards should be guaranteed 1 per box. I don't think I'll be purchasing any more Marvel Masterpiece trading cards while they're still being made by Upper Deck.  For the price of a box, I expected much more than what I got.
I purchased 2 of these, totaling 4 cards.  I didn't get anyone good, and the only good one I did get was an Emmitt Smith 1992 (?) card, but it was in spanish!!  I couldn't even find this card in Beckett's in order to see if it was worth something.  I would buy this product again, as long as I was guaranteed I wouldn't get another spanish card.
I was excited to tear into the box when I received it. About halfway through the cards were really starting to stick together. Some of them were damaged while trying to pull them apart. Not sure if this is anyone's fault, or just a symptom of where they were stored. However, to a collector, the condition of the card is everything. Overall I am not happy with this purchase.
If you compare this signature to the signature on the Upper Deck ball, the handwriting looks COMPLETELY different to me.  I have a Ken Griffey, Jr. autographed ball from his first All-Star Game, and the signature on the ball I have looks exactly like the one on the Upper Deck ball.  And when you read about how Upper Deck authenticates their autographs, it's tough to argue with that.  All this says is that there is a Certificate of Authenticity.I'm not saying this is NOT a genuine signature.  But it sure is different from the others I've seen from Ken Griffey, Jr.
I have bought a box of these not too long ago and got a black bordered parallel out of it. The only thing I'm pointing out is the big sticker on the corner of it that says 25% OFF. was 19.99 now 14.99.  This clearly had to come from Wal-mart or K-mart. Why not just go there and get it to save the extra money.
I just ordered this box of trading cards because I thought it was a good deal. I jumped on this because for the price and amount of cards, it was worth it to me to get an older box set. This is not for "24 packs of 8 cards per box" as stated in the product features. I guess it technically says "12 packs" in the title, but I decided to trust the product features instead. Hopefully the seller updates the product features.
I'm not a big fan.  If you just want to get your kid some baseball cards, this is not the right purchase.  It ties into some kind of annoying game that requires other purchases and is a hassle.  Not the baseball cards that we all grew up with.
I purchased these cards because I thought they were unopened packs of cards that I collected as a kid but they were not.  The box they came in is also not factory sealed.  I have only looked through the 86 and and 91 boxes but the cards seemed to be picked through. I didn't purchase them to try and get valuable cards, I bought them for fun. However, so far there are very noticeable names missing for the amount of cards you get for each year.Also, the positive review is either fake or by someone who knows 0 about baseball.  Not sure how they got a George Brett rookie in the years of 86-91 when Brett started in the 70's.On a positive note, I will say the cards seem to be in very good condition.
In the title it says it includes a game used jersey when it actually says on average, which in my case i didnt get one.
Thought it b fun to open packs and again like when I was younger and find those and find those hits but didn't get any found out u have better odds in buying packs at a hobby store or with the packs that have the H on the packs meaning there better odds in finding the big hits. Don't buy these packs
I purchased this on 11/24/10 and was to receive this by 12/17/10 at the latest.  I did not receive this until I emailed the vendor letting him know that I had not received.  He apologized for the delay (postage issue) and said that they would be sent immediately and would include a bonus card for the inconvience.  I was fine with this, things happen.  Items arrived on 12/24/10.  When I received the cards they were not in the protective screwdown display case as stated in the purchase and I did not receive the bonus card.  Not satified with the service.
I was hoping this would be a more simple version of Strat-o-Matic baseball I remember enjoying as a child. Instead it was a dumbed down card based game that was so poorly developed that my son became board after two games. Maybe a 4 or 5 year old would enjoy it but I would think most kids would lose interest quickly.
Delivery of the autographed baseball was swift, however, the autograph itself was faded .... far too soon.  I bought the &#34;last one&#34; but I see it is available again, but I'm not going to purchase a second ball just to get a satisfactory autograph.  Sorry!I was going to use it as gift for a Tiger fan in the family, but now I don't know.
How will i know its authentic? I'm a big fan and i want to make sure I'm not wasting my money.
The description of this product should clearly indicate that you will only receive one pack of cards, not an entire box as the image suggests.
I was disappointed in the box of cards as the cards were individually packed; and consequently, there were several doubles of the cards.  Years ago I would purchase a box of baseball cards and every card for the season would be included in the box.  I would rather have paid more money for the box of hockey cards and received one copy of each card printed for the hockey season.
I bought this item for a sports-loving nephew. The item itself was as described. The way it was packed for shipping was awful! No care was taken to make sure that this arrived in good condition. This is a piece of sports memorabilia meant for display and it is scratched and one corner is smashed.  I didn't think that this would be a problem, we order frequently from Amazon and usually things arrive in good condition. I had intended to gift-wrap and ship this item with several gifts for different family embers, to arrive in time for Christmas. I thought this would be a fun gift, he can be difficult to buy for. Now I have no gift to send to my nephew.  I will be returning it. You really let me down on this one Amazon!
When you pay over $40 for a box of cards, you kind of expect to get at least two or three decent cards (maybe in the $8.00 to $15.00 range each), but this box fell way short.  I know you can get the occasional bad one sometimes, but the distribution of stars and inserts just doesn't seem to be consistent enough to avoid duds like I got.First, no autograph card.  And they aren't guaranteed, but these boxes were originally over $70.  Can you imagine paying that much and not even getting a memorabilia card?  Even at forty, it's a big disappointment.Next, in the 24 packs, I got a total of two cards that are actually listed in the current Beckett price guide.  One was a Jason Heyward RC (the only card that kept the box from being a complete bust) and a Ken Griffey, Jr.  Aside from that, I got 7 unlisted stars and 12 semi-stars.  There were 6 USA inserts (not the subset with Bryce Harper, and 4 of them commons), 2 purple refractors (both commons), and 4 regular refractors (two semi-stars and two commons).  And that's it.I know in one box I'm not going to land every good card in the set, but this was weak compared to other brands/sets I've bought.  I don't expect to be going for another round of these 2010 Bowman Chrome boxes.
When I started this review, I wanted to give 2010 bowman chrome retail three stars, because I actually enjoy ripping this stuff and like the card design. Nevertheless, the fair review is two stars, as my comments will reflect what other Amazon comments say about this product. The biggest hits in my box were a Starlin Castro and Mike Stanton rookie, and a gold refractor numbered to 50 of a nobody. My estimation is that I turned $40 into about $17 with this box. I previously purchased a retail box for less than $40 directly from the Dave and Adams Card World website, which yielded slightly better results, as the hits were a $20 autograph and a Bubba Starling (BV $12). For me I really enjoy the design of these cards and like that you have a chance to pull one of several hot rookies e.g. Strasburg, Castro, Stanton, Heyward, Middlebrooks, Rizzo, et al. I would describe this as good fun wax to open, but would look to buy closer to the $30 price point. I think one would be crazy to pay more than $40 for these retail boxes, especially since you have no guarantee of an auto.
I purchased this for my son to start his baseball card collection.  The "storage album" is not the standard three-ring binder you would expect, but is a rather small vinyl album (like a small photo album) which only holds 4 cards per page with no possibility of expanding by adding pages.  This is not described in the page anywhere, and since Amazon suggested buying additional three-ring binder pages to accompany the purchase I was led to believe it was a large 3-ring binder.  In my opinion, this purchase is not worth the price.
I was expecting an unopened box of football cards...what I got was a pseudo box...not from the manufacturer. This was a gift...I'm very disappointed...how am I supposed to give this as a gift? It was never indicated that this was an opened product...I could have purchased the same thing at Target...UNOPENED! Oh yes...and there was no packing information so how am I supposed to return this?????
I purchase these every year for my husband and decided to buy them this year from amazon.  What a big mistake, when the package came, the cards were put in a regular white box, not the original Topps box.  Sounds strange, but when you give a gift, you would like it in the original packaging still sealed.
Like other reviews have stated this is just a copy. The heading clearly says "1933 20 Dollar Gold Proof". But you have to scroll down through the actual description to see that it is only a copy of the real thing. But at least they do tell you it is just a replica. They draw you in with the initial misleading description just for you to find out it is nothing more than something to look at. But is very 'pretty' and a good price if you're into this kind of thing.
Dont expect to get what is advertised. Not an actual Mickey Mantle Card and the "vintage" card packs are from the late 90's. You get what you paid for, not what is described. Cheap price for cheap cards.
It is pretty...$12 for $3.75 worth of copper...I should have paid better attention.  The chances of e getting any return on this in my lifetime are slim to none
The finish doesn't last long and the price of copper doesn't even make this worth buying. It's still kinda cool but it doesn't look as good as it first did
This is nothing but a novelty item, for the sellers to represent as a investment is a joke.if anyone is interested in buying these as an investment, I hear the Brooklyn Bridge is for sale
Ordered this for my son. I received only one small bax of cards. (Photo submitted above). The Amazon photo shows two boxes in a retail display case.Thats not what you receive. A little disappointed. Dont let the photo mislead you. Didnt open yet, its for Christmas, but box says 5 packs plus 1 extra pack.
There was a discription of the pennies and how they were made, on the web site, but when the package came it DiD NOT include this information and that was the reason I bought the pennies in the first place.  They are for my nephew who is studying WWII  and I thought the story of how they were made would make them interesting to him.  So, I pulled them up on the web site again but there was no option on the iPad to print out this information.  So, I am very disappointed.  CC.....in Ohio
The cards I received look great and even came in a nice plastic protective case, but...I was promised 26 cards, yet only received 22! They're still worth the money I paid, but I can't help but feel extremely disappointed that the set did not come with:293 Franklin Gutierrez FY299 Sean Pierce FY312 Ruddy Lugo FY672 James Loney DPBuyer beware!
Ordered this product for $13.99 (looks like the price has since dropped to $12.99). When it arrived there was a price printed on the box that said $9.99. I couldn't help feeling ripped off. For those who expect to get a deal by buying through Amazon, beware.
No cards really worth much, way too expensive for a mediocre set of cards with nothing i can get more than a dollar out of
I think the WHA Cincinnati Stingers jersey is very cool (and the home yellow ones are much better, by the way). The problem is, although this was Mark Messier's first team he was terrible as a rookie on this team. He had all of one goal in 47 games played that season before moving to the Edmonton Oilers.So it's autographed. If you're going to get an autographed Messier jersey you want an Oilers, New York Rangers or Team Canada one unless you want people to think you're insane. I mean, buy a Stingers jersey and, if you want an autographed one, get a player that's super obscure (i.e., Reg Thomas, Jamie Hislop, Gene Sobchuk) or one that had a bit of success with the team and had an NHL career as well (i.e., goalie Mike Liut, Michel Dion, Robbie Ftorek or even Mike Gartner).After all if I'm forking over $600 for a Messier autograph, I'd want it on a jersey that makes more sense.
Received this still sealed in plastic but a deep rip into the front of the box takes away from the appeal.  It was a gift so I didnt have time to return it, but if I did have time I would have because it was a gift for a child born in 2011 to put away until they get older and can either choose to keep it sealed in mint condition (minus the gash) or otherwise.
This coin is way to pricey.  Take a look at eBay, GAINESVILLE COINS or ModernCoinMart.  I think a fairer price would be $2150 give or take..
The quality of the poster is not that great. Look for a different vendor to but this poster the link is already faded and I just got in the mail
Items came in great time and was well completed by amazon.What I didn't like was the picture shown was not what was received, one small part of the picture was missing - the price of $14.99.So the box cost more to bring out yet in the description it showed original price of $19.99 and we got the discount price - but when we received the box there was no discount as the price on the box was missing from the price on the photo.Sorry but that is misleading.
I must say this was pretty disappointing,though the price was fair. The Bryce Harper Chrome cards were warped, and the Diamond giveaway expired in 2012 (so not much of a selling point regardless of the title).Personally I would spend a little extra next time and buy a blaster box of 2011 Topps Update or Chrome.
The print was good and it is just what is advertised. However, on the lower right corner, it states in BIG print that is is a reprinted photo. Thanks! I know what I bought, why print it on the front! Looks horrible as it is still easily viewed when framed. Everyone who has seen it asks me about the comment there. awful! I gave it two stars just because it is still a cool shot with autographs
Ordered this set - labeled as "complete team set" for my son.  His favorite player is the team captain, Ryan Callahan.  I don't understand how a "complete team set" can exclude the team captain's card??  Epic fail!!  There are lots of other key players from the 2011/2012 roster missing too - like Brian Boyle, Artem Anisimov, Michael Sauer, Michael Del Zotto and Steve Eminger.  This listing should actually LIST the player cards that are included!
Only one pack.  I thought this was more of a box.  I felt I was lead wrong with this product info.
I got this for my husband for his 40th birthday. I was so excited, since he's a huge Dawg fan. I thought I'd get it framed nicely and such. When I opened the end of the cardboard tubing it came in, I noticed the end of the poster was smashed down and when I pulled it out, there's a bad crease where it had been smashed. The edges are split where it was pushed in on. It could have been in close to excellent shape. Whoever handled it for the shipping didn't take much care to ensure it was pushed down in the tube before closing the end on it and compromising its condition. Very disappointed, I paid that much to receive merchandise damaged because of lack of attention to detail when handling.
I opened a box of these back in March, as I was able to obtain a box on eBay for roughly $95. Currently, these boxes will set you back anywhere from $130 to $150-plus per box. You certainly have the opportunity to pull some nice rookie autos e.g. Hall and Seguin, but they are hard to find. My view is that today's current prices are unfavorably skewed to a collector; collectors must pay too much for a chance to pull something very rare. Were prices to drop back to the sub-$125 range, closer to $100, I would consider opening some more. My box yielded the right number of autos a $40 Bobby Clarke, and two or three rookie autos (all commons). While my box came close to breakeven, I would still be interested in the product at reasonable prices. Like much of the 2010-11 Upper Deck product, prices seem to be out of touch with reality.
The item they shipped does not match the written description or the photo on this page. And, there is no certificate of authenticity. The signature is shakier than the one displayed here, but looks similiar, though it is smaller and not on the same spot on the helmet. The "D" in Don looks a bit more like a "W" too. Further, rather than saying "The Dawgfather" it simply says "dawgfather". Clearly the helmet I received is not the same item that is advertised on this site. I'm not a handwriting expert so I cannot know for sure if it is a fake, but it certainly is suspect. I made the purchase as a lifelong Husky fan, not as a collector, so I suppose it's worth hanging on to, but I definitely will not do business with with Mill Creek Sports again.
For the amount of money this vendor is asking you can get a &#34;Real Signature&#34;, not some computer generated auto-pen that they're trying to pass off as Dale's hand.Give the people a break and sell this item for what it really is... &#34;Hyped Up Marketing&#34;.Sell it for the realistic Value and mark it for the real value...The total cost in materials is approximately $10.00.I like the way they claim that the frame is &#34;Museum Quality&#34;.Ask yourself this? Are you buying a frame or are you buying Dale?If you're buying a frame, then have at it. But if you're buying Dale, you can get these photo's of him off the internet, just copy and paste them to your computer. You don't need a computer generated signature to authenticate it for this price.Save Your Money Folks.I'm A Serious Earnhardt Fan and just want you do get what you deserve to get for this amount of money.But... It's Always Your Choice and What Ever Makes You Happy At The End Of The Day - Right?
These shin pads are pretty cheap but they do the trick... The seller sent them ASAP though so that's good.
Not stamped with stamp needed for high school soccer. Daughter did not like how they fit on her legs. Weird fitted.
Bernie Parent was a great goalie for the...Philadelphia Flyers. Since the Miami Screaming eagles of the WHA signed him and they moved to Philly to become the Blazers before they even played a game in Miami, it's weird to have him annotate the puck with "HOF 84" given Bernie made the Hall based on his play with the Flyers.
The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because the patch itself isn't bad.  However, I felt the shipping was an absolute rip off.  It could have easily been mailed in a smaller envelope without 10 pieces of cardboard/stock (literally).  I understand wanting to protect the patch from damage but this was overkill, and all your money will go to shipping.
The price and variety of cards is good but the condition was not. Almost every card had a bad corner if not 2,3,or even 4. And we all know that makes them practically pointless.
I thought this jersey would be autographed with Thornton's signature but it just has his number, No. 19, had I known this I wouldn't have bought it but I am going to keep the jersey, it still looks nice and not worth the price of sending it back, I am disappointed though.
I purchased two of these , I never know when they may take any pictures when they work the picture quality during daylight is fine but at night not very clear also batter life is very short approx one to two weeks , I am having some of the same problems that others say they are having . I purchased mine from bass pro . they exchanged one but it is not any better
Paid the same price for three cards as I did for a complete team set. It was not clear to me that this wasn't a full team set (probably because it says 'team set' in the description). Very disappointed.
Nicely packaged and protected.  However, the signature was not as defined or clear as shown on the photo on Amazon.  This was disappointing and concerning.  Probably wouldn't buy another product in this category.
2 of the 3 boxes did not have the jersey auto. Lots of doubles. Its getting to the point where I am not going to purchase topps products anymore!
not a good investmentmore fun to collect cards for childrennot for children over 13wrapped well. bad bad investment. overpriced
This looks nothing like John Travolta. Not sure how I never noticed it when watching the film, but if this was what they used for all of his stunts then it makes me question my love of that film.
Head coach Darryl Sutter got cropped out! I remember seeing them on TV posing for this picture. At the far left one can just see Sutter's left hand on, I believe, Simon Gagne. Assistant coach John Stevens is behind Gagne. To leave out the man who came in at a difficult time and got the team to believe in themselves is unfathomable. A five star photo is reduced to two stars.
The black background is conspicuously uneven and the black is disturbing splotchy. It appears these are printed on a transparent flimsy material and the back side is a reverse of the front. I do not know what the printing process is but it does not seem able to lay down a solid, even black which most of this poster is comprised of. Looking into buying the real thing instead.
These cards are bizarre.  There are cards in the pack that have nothing to do with baseball.  Wouldn't buy again.
Thought this was going to be a box set of 2012 all individual cards, it's just a box of several pkgs, didn't even get one RGIII card, boo!
I like it fine.  I didn't know what I was buying and I didn't return it.  I like hockey but am not a big fan and I don't know who Mikko is.  The card, however, is in good shape and I have it up in my den.
I would consider a mint set to be sealed to protect mint condition. This set seemed to be very good condition that was put together from a collector that hd opened packs. It did not mislead, but I was expecting a sealed set.
EVERYBODY knows that George used to --- personally --- burn his Superman costume at the end of each season.I'm not only wondering IF this --- indeed --- is FROM a Reeves' cape... and, why in the heck it was cut up?I'd think it'd be worth it as part of collectors' trading cards, but... hmmm.
I expected perhaps a small amount of wear and tear considering this was a 1960s movie poster, but I certainly didn't expect a noticeable hole, one that can clear be seen with hanging.  I would not in the least qualify this as vg very fine, which is very bold misrepresentation.
Let me start off by saying that this was ordered as a Christmas present for my son who is an avid card collector.  Also being a huge Chargers fan, this was a good fit for him.  I'm sure he would have opened this pack before placing each card in individual sealed plastic cases, but sometimes he doesn't open them, which as most of us know increases the value of the item over time.This pack of cards arrived in a box with two other items, but when I removed this set from the packaging material it was clearly evident that it was previously mishandled and damaged.  The cardboard backing to this pack was bent quite badly at the top, and even had a tear to one side.  The cards themselves appear to be okay inside the plastic bubble pack, but we've not opened them.As far as the experience of this purchase goes, it was ordered only 7 days ago and arrived quickly to my military mailing address overseas only a week before Christmas which is saying a lot.  And like I said, my son may not even mind the package being torn and bent, but the principle of buying a collectible item which is clearly identified as &#34;factory sealed&#34; and &#34;mint&#34; as scored, is to receive it in this quoted condition.  If we want to open it and damage the packaging then that should be our prerogative.Now that I'm only 5 days before Christmas morning I will have to make the hard decision of whether or not to return this item.  I've bought a lot of items over Amazon since I've moved overseas, and have rarely had a bad buy..especially from an Amazon filled order.  I'm surprised this was allowed to leave the shipping facility in this condition and it is obvious that it was in this condition when it was placed in the shipping box as the box was not damaged.Love the set..that's why I ordered it, but overall I'm very disappointed with this purchase.Mike
ALL THE CARDS WERE IN VERY BAD SHAPE, NOT NO WHERE NEAR GOOD OR EXCELLENT LIKE THEY CLAIMED. . . . . .. .
I wish that COMC would pack their cards properly, I bought many cards for a gift and my friend didn't want anyof them. COMC DON'T individually put the cards in hard plastic like MICKEY'S CLUBHOUSE. COMC puts the cards in  sleeve or in a cheap thin cellophane, not plastic to protect each card.
This is not numbered xx/25 as stated in the title.  It is xxx/500...there is some confusion in the Beckett guide as to the descriptions of this card.
Was alright.Nothing to write home about. Would not purchase again. Too bad.My son was excited, but what came was disappointingc
I didn't realize this was a Halloween costume item. I was looking for a prop for a martial arts demonstration. This item was spray painted foam. It didn't even make it 2 minutes in the demo before it broke. For $22 I was expecting something a little atronger like maybe rubber or something. Oh well....
There are not 17 cards -- only 15 cards. Amazon sent a replacement set, and it too had 15 cards. Not a big deal to me, but to an 8-year-old...
All that was sent was 12 cards of the team of my choice. The rest of the bonus packs were assorted teams.  I guess the 'Complete team set' just means they only have 12 pictures of any one team.
Super disappointed by everything about this ball, my son can't play soccer with it! Well that is what I get for not researching it I guess.
I purchased this price guide not only to review current prices of cards in my collection, but also because Derek Jeter is on the cover, which makes the magazine collectible. Because Beckett now uses lighter weight paper for printing and the magazine was shipped in a pretty flimsy plastic envelope, it arrived in pretty poor condition.
The view does not show Justins face well enough. It could be anyone in that uniform. I am sorry I bought it.
I should have expected this because of the cheap price, but this is not like the picture. It is actually a wooden frame, a piece of thin wood all painted one color, not distressed like the picture and the words are printed in a style to look like wood grain. Not what was expected probably cost about $5-$10 to make...WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
I received the ball it was fine.  However, I never received the proof of authenticity that was supposed to come with it.  Very dissapointed.
By looking at the outside of package it seems that inserts are likely.  Well, NONE for me and 24$ down the drain.
This box wasn't anything to write home about. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I just opened a box of this stuff purchased via eBay for $59.99, which is well below the $90 going rate on Amazon.com. These boxes were for sale as low as $40 on Amazon, but obviously no more. What can I say, the biggest pull is the Jonathan Toews Young Guns rookie card, but beyond that you will be hard pressed to come close to the $90 box price. Paying $90 would be the equivalent of paying $30 for a bottle of MD 20/20 at Seven Eleven!!! My two star rating reflects the few guaranteed hits, and the lack of anything of real value beyond the Toews rookie card. The base cards are / were among the ugliest looking base cards I have ever seen. In their own way, they give 1981 Fleer baseball a run for their money!
Too wide at the tops and almost too tight to get over her feet. She was ready to take them off as soon as we put them on. Apparently they are not very comfortable. Had to bend the guard part to conform it too her leg and the tops still rubbed together causing her to walk funny.
The certification was printed on a kodak photo sheet without any sort of signature or notary.  Impossible to know true authenticity.  Also, the ball is from years ago, at a time Earl Thomas did not play on the Seahawks.
After 25-years in this hobby, and fighting hobby fraud for free from 1007-present, all the way up to card companies themselves I think my opinion counts a bit more than others.Once Jim Beckett left Beckett and they became Beckett Media several years ago, Beckett became nothing more than a card company promotion engine. Their price guides are all off (by as much as 100%) as if no one is paying any attention as to what's going on in the hobby whatsoever. Most of the writers are new and people no collector ever heard of and that would matter if they were actually saying something REAL- but sadly they are not.Where's the story about Leaf neglecting to put ANY autograph authenticity statement on Leaf Origins Wrestling autographs?  Then Beckett prices these cards SUPER HIGH as if they had authenticity statements that ALL other Leaf autographs in other products have BTW.Beckett's Price Guide is what SCD Weekly & Tuff Stuff's Price Guides were- completely useless. But at least SCD & Tuff Stuff had some decent stories. Beckett no longer ever has that. You are better off doing an eBay Completed SOLD Listings Search for the card you want to know a value of. What cards sell for on eBay is still the best & most accurate representation of what cards are worth, which is sad. Greed brought down this hobby and almost everyone is to blame.James aka Cardcop
It is not helpful for anyone who needs a price guide on cards that came out before 1980.  No older pricing guide given.  Useless to me.
There was no Damian Lillard RC, very disappointed. The description clearly stated that there would be, they were not at all as advertised.
As a gift for a sports fan friend, I was looking for the funny "mistake" baseball card. You know the one. The official story is that Billy Ripken posed with a random bat he picked up, not realizing it had something not-so-nice legibly written on the bottom of it.Well this isn't it. Not exactly, anyway. It's the same card, with the same picture, but what they don't advertise is that the funny bat graffiti has been marked out with a black square--rendering a gag gift to a generic late-80's baseball card. The seller could have cleared this up by appropriately advertising this as a "black box error card" or something to that effect. Unfortunately, they didn't.
I'm a big Mets fan so i was really looking forward to this but i have to say i'm a little disappointed. I know it was cheap and not pricey but when it says PROTECTIVE DISPLAY CASE it made it sounded better and was one of the reasons why i bought it. And when i opened it, it was in a simple card holder. Not mad about the price but i feel the title was false.
A vampire doomed to gnaw throats or wrists with inadequate teeth.  A vampire is supposed to have enough &#34;bite&#34; to thrill the reader.Twighlight's vamps did not live up to their legendary predecessors at all...
bought it as a christmas present for my mom, who loves rick springfield. was not the picture depicted, but it was christmas so i was out of options and gave it to her anyways.
The photo is actually 5 1/2 inches by 9 1/4 inches with a white border.  The picture isn't centered either.  The white border is uneven on all sides.  I have a friend that wants it... Otherwise I would return it.  Honestly, I think I received a photo copy on film paper(or whatever that paper they use to print photos with a copier is called). Disappointed.
They said it was a 'Master Print&#34; and I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the picture.  I ordered a total of 5 picutes and only 1 was good quality and it was the wrong picture!
I think the picture on Amazon is not from "The Quiet Man".Quiet 60th Anniversary Special EditionThis movie has John Wayne in Ireland, not as a cowboy, but as an X prize fighter.  Great movie, and a nice picture, just not a match.
just saying the print quality is not that great and that i wouldn't have bought it had i seen it in person.  not gift quality.
Since Walt Disney died a number of years before Disney World opened, this can't be a photo of him there.  Rather, it's a photo of him in Disneyland.
You should include in your description that this Dawn is a knock-off of artist Joseph Michael Linsner's original Dawn character.
The item shown in the description is not the one I received. The signature is MUCH smaller and doesn't include &#34;Big Hurt&#34; like shown in the picture. BEWARE.
Card was OK and the shipping was good but the corners were not the best I have ever seen. I will keep this card only because it is Walter Payton.
I bought a ball just like this and IT SUCKS. ITS JUST LIKE A BALL FROM WALMART. WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE, WHO CARES ABOUT AN AUTOGRAPH. But since I atleast have a ball im okay with it.
The card was BCCG graded as it states (graded as 10) as verified by a Beckett serial number search.  However there are flaws on the edges and two corners visible to the naked eye, which leads me to believe that the card has seen some rough handling after it was graded.  If I tried to sell this to a person seeing the card, they would dispute the grade, no question.  I would have too...  NOTE - not saying that the seller misrepresented, as stated previously I verified the card/rating on Beckett.com, but the card is no longer in the condition it was when it was graded.
The product was of poor quality.  Service was great.  I would want a better quality product in the future.  I have had to replace 3 of the cables already.
I chose this rating because I did not like opening bland, &#34;oh I already got that one&#34; pacs smother in flashy foil that makes one dream of the possibilities...only to find nothing as even medium rare...like a nice cut of ribeye; and &#34;ribbed&#34; was I.
my card set was incomplete. not happy about that. i bought these cards for my son to collect and the set was not 100% complete.
This Set kinda Sucks Because i Got Nothing Good Out Of The whole box except for a commemorator patch of felix hernandez
Kinda pricey cards but defiantly not worth it you don't get good cards.Almost pack is a sham. You should find something else to spend your money on.
I knew that a rak pack would not have many rare cards, or much hits to begin with, but I was very disappointed with the sheer amount of base cards that came in this pack. Many cards you get two or three times. Now don't get me wrong, the design is nice on the cards and panini did a great job with the look, but for 70 bucks, please listen and spend your money on a hobby box, you may get fewer cards but you will definitely get more hits!
The description says "autographed....yes" however, the card I received was not. when I questioned why, I was told none of the cards I ordered were advertised as being autographed, yet, here I am, looking at the description again to make sure I'm not losing it! Maybe I just don't understand the description part of the page?!
What I received was NOT what is shown in the images above. Trophy arrived scuffed, the NFL logo was glued on (and crooked no less) and this was shipped from some place in Thailand. I gave 2 stars because I was given a refund.
A NICE ASSORTMENT OF PLAYERS BUT THE CARDS THEMSELVES HAVE MANY FLAWS ON THEM...LOTS OF SCRATCHES, INDENTS, ETC.  TOO BAD BECAUSE IF NOT IT WOULD BE WORTH THE MONEY.
These are italian production holographic dbz cards. There are only 60 in the whole set. 5 cards in each pack. I opened 36 packs and i only have 20 out of the 60. 90% of the packs contain cards that are between 10 and 20. Do not buy these unless you have the extra money to blow. I am hesitant to open the rest of my packs but if i do i will update this review with the results. Same item is being sold by the same vendor on eBay for half of the price. I would suggest ordering this item from there.Btw i opened the rest of my boxes and the new results are, i still have 20 out of the 60. 98% (accurate percentage) of the packs contain cards between #10 and #19. I actually never even saw a # 20.
So it arrived today - quite expeditiously, I'd like to add!  But it's not what I hoped for really, but I was weary of this purchase anyway.  It's kind of cool but not worth the $80 it costs - more like $25 - tops!  Basically it's a wooden plaque, spray painted black with a paper sticker image and a fake platinum record glued to it. It is one of only 500 made - but so what? I can make 500 of something too but it doesn't make it worth anything. So it's a cool thing to hang on the wall but don't get your hopes up that it will ever be worth anything. This company can make 500 gold, then when they run out they can make 500 platinum, etc. Also I bought this because I may have a chance to get Jimmy Buffett sign something for me but I was told that if he didn't sanction this company making these, he won't sign it... So much for it ever being worth anything. But it's a cool enough item to put up in your man-cave.Ben
The display is beautiful. The only problem I had is that the display doesn't show which song the platinum record is for. It's just a random silver record with a biggie picture attached to a plaque. Other than that it's really nice.
Got this card for my collection I did save about 7 bucks with the purchase here than at other places. but this card is not in ball park as a rare card. don't be fooled by that statement from the seller, that too is why I have given the card 2 stars. seller needs to be mor realistic and honest.
Note the dimensions so you are not disappointed too.  It is more like a portrait than a poster. Maybe we missed it in the product description.
I was not happy getting 20 card's nobody wants!The card that makes you want to buy it the special red card will most likely be damaged because of how it is packaged!
This is a very no frills kind of set cards are very plain as are the inserts.  Get what you pay for.
This would be a nice picture if it didn't have a logo from the printing company in the bottom left corner. Get a fat frame or be ready to cut your pic down.Here is an idea PhotoFile.com, put your mark on the BACK!
i am very very dissapointed with the pic i got; it is NOT the one they show on the advertisement but the top of Dillons head is cropped they fit the name and Viacom on the bottom but the top of Dillon's head is cropped it only show a small bit of his bangs and the rest is white NOT the pic advertised!! so you are going to buy this and you will probably get a different picture!!! the seller has offered to refund my  money but since he cannot get another print I will keep the one I got and hang it over to the right but gee I will just wait and see no matter how long it takes: I can only hope to get another pic.
Despite depicting multiple packs of TOPPS in the photos; non are in the actual variety packs.  Purchased for my 11 year old son, he was somewhat ok with it as they were old but I felt a little ripped off.
Bought these sticker books for my kids, pages almost fell out immediately.The numbers on the stickers and the numbers in the book do not even match on one page.
I guess I waited too late to order this item.  As with the last year's set, I ordered both the regular team set and the limited edition team set at the same time (two different prices from the same vendor).  Both times I got two of the limited edition sets.  I guess they ran out of the regular set but wanted to keep my money and thought I wouldn't notice.  In the future I'll look for this on eBay instead of Amazon.
Where are your sizes on this product? I have been searching for this jersey and would have ordered but there is no mention of sizes.
this was explained as a photo but its just cut from some type of newspaper t.v. guide,maybe from sundays t.v. guide.
boston red sox 2013 topps mlb limited edition factory sealed  has been delivered with the corner of the sealed package ripped totally off, hard to give as gift
Lousy graphics on the card, washed out colors.  His colts player card are far superior.  I would not.tell anyone to buy this card, very lowqualty!
I received in my sandwich bag of waxed packs: 2 1991 Pacific packs, 3 1990 Fleer packs, and 2 1991 Fleer Ultra packs.  These packs hold no cards of any value what so ever.  As for it being a great starter kit, you would be better off going to an actual card shop and picking up 5 packs for a dollar (which by the way, my local shop does sell these exact same packs in that bin). Pay the extra dollar and get 10 packs and still pay less than what you did for this &#34;starter kit&#34;.  Save yourself the shipping and support a local business instead.  At least the packs came in good condition and the only reason I gave two stars.
It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It's not a poster it's a picture. Should be advertised as such.
way too small for the amount of the purchase and not made very well loooked cheap, it did not specify the quality
Mine doesn't say Dont mess with Texas, Wish I would have known that prior to buying as I do like to recieve what I order :(
You get a Jersey from 2012, the worst season for the Eagles in recent memory, and want to get 8K for it? I could see selling it for $500 or something, but the pricing is pure insanity on this.
The card is loose in the case, and it leads me to wonder if it is an authentic graded card. Buy at your own risk.
I never understood why "Carol Marcus" appeared in her underwear in the course of the movie andI dont think I would understand someone buying it and put it on their wall either.
I got all regular inserts and common cards with nothing worth over 6$. I expected more and was upset from not finding an autograph or relic. There were annoying cards that were advertisements or a &#34;chance to win&#34; card in almost every pack. Overall, I was dissapointed by this box.
The package was beat up and some of the cards had folded corners. The quality of the cards was disappointing
Was hoping that some of the current ND players (from 2012, 2013) would be in here.  Alas, there are not.
I do not believe this is a real autograph. It's &#34;Certificate of Authenticity&#34; looks like it was simply printed off of Microsoft Word. I dont really care- except it was a hundred bucks :/
When you read the fine print you find out that it is 10 packs of 5 stickers for a total of 50. Not 10 packs of 50!!! I would never have ordered this if it wouldn't have been so misleading. I can buy this set for less than $5 locally. Definitely returning it.
ALL THE CARDS I GOT FROM COMC WERE IN BAD SHAPE, NOT GOOD, NOT VG, NOT EX. NO WAY NEAR GOOD. ALL THE CARDS WERE BENT AND SCRATCHED
I was a little disappointed as they picture this set of 10 Denver Broncos team player cards in a plastic case as shown above, but they come in a single plastic case which holds all 10 cards one on top of the other. Also, they say these cards are LIKE mint condition but I thought they WERE in mint condition.  My grand nephew, though, will be very happy to get them and other NFL items I am giving him for Christmas.
This is really B-grade work. With the impressive artist I expected perfection, not something I could have easily done with the help of a Bob Ross instructional video....
I was utterly dissapointed with this artwork. I mean it's called Wild Forest which led me to believe that it was going to be so wild I could impress people with it. See I went out, bought the painting and organized a party. My intentions were to have the painting under my arm at all times so that people could look and it and say: "Wild..." and start a conversation. Well it doesn't work!! When people look at it they say cool, look at me funny, even walk away, but not even ONCE have they said: "Wild..." and actually struct a conversation with me. I am really dissapointed in Monet to say the least.
I didn't purchase this photo however I have gotten his real signature and that's not it. Don't spend your money.
When I was searching for a autographed picture by the Big Bang Theory cast this item caught my eye.For 12 dollars I had thought I found a steal. But this product is a fake autographed picture of the Big Bang Theory cast. For 12 dollars this is a rip-off it should only cost 50 cents. I strongly recommend not to purchase this product.
This is a &#34;reprint&#34; which means its not real. This product is a photograph of the original signed photograph. And, like others reviewed and commented, VERY poor reprint. Not worth the $12. Junk...
Topps didn't put the positions on the front of the card. Makes it inconvenient for sorting. Kind of dissapointing. Nice set otherwise.
This is a print. I thought this would be on canvas for that price. I bought an 8x10 frame but print is much smaller so a mat will be required.
It should be noted that these production stills are not taken by Gregory Crewdson and are not considered part of the actual series of artwork. They are merely keepsakes from the production process
I found this product to be overpriced by at least $8, possibly more. Plus, the vending machine at work kept spitting it out.
The work is pretty cool in concept but I was really disappointed when I put it up in my bedroom. Knowing how pretty a sunset can be, I thought that two sunsets would be double the beauty-the way seeing a double rainbow is twice as good as seeing a rainbow. Such a shame that a photo of two sunsets is not the same as seeing two sunsets or two rainbows-I was expecting a really nice photograph for so much money but was disappointed, it was even kind of blurry.I gave it two stars though because it was a cool idea, nice try-maybe try a better camera to get something more accuracy next time! Hope that helps!
I saw this print online and loved it. What a disappointment when it arrived and I saw that it was simply printed on a sheet of A4 and not mounted like in the "in room" photo!!
My wife June hasn't had the easiest life, I decided to buy this as an anniversary present, installing it in the window on her side of the caravan as a surprise. She was moaning from the moment she saw it and not in a good way!I've Googled this Hirst fella  and it turns out he's killing all sorts of different animals,  I've a right mind to report him to the services. First for shoddy garish designs that look better on the computer, second for animal cruelty and thirdly for giving my wife a headache!Will try and win her back with something from the Pre Raphelite era...
I think is a pretty good job of painting. However, I must say that I have looked up pictures of the Adirondacks on Bing image search, and most of what I see doesn't look like this. I think maybe the artist mistitled this?
I thought that this was supposed to be a book. It is not. It is a single card with writing on the back. It should have said that.
The value that I got sucked.The only reason I gave this 2 stars and not one. Is because I'm a SAN DIEGOCHARGERS fan.And I recieved two Junior Seau Rookies.Along with a mass amount of commons and duplicated common players from different sets.
I purchased this item for my niece directly from her Amazon Wish List. She REALLY wanted it for Christmas. When the poster arrived, I was disappointed in the quality of the item. I understood from the description that it would be a reproduction of a signed poster, but I still found it lower quality than I would have expected. It looks like someone took a photo of a signed poster and had it printed at Costco in a 12X18 format. The image is not very clear. The one I received looks like it has pink nail polish dripped on the upper left part of the poster. This appears to be a blemish in the printing, not something that was spilled on the print. My niece is 13 years old and will probably still like the poster. I put it in an inexpensive frame and still plan to give it to her for Christmas, but I don't think this &#34;poster&#34; is worth the money.
would have been nice to know the signatures were reprinted as well
I like sharp repartee but I like it when I can understand at a more leisurely pace the gags.  Too much is being said too quickly for me to enjoy most of the humor.  Also, much of the acting seems slightly strained, unconvincing.  No argument about the clever plot though.  In he hands of a more seasoned director and with a stellar ensemble cast (e.g., The Amateurs, The Great Lebowski), this could be a great comedy.None of this is to impugn Ms. Bell.  She is obviously a talented, rising star director-actor-writer.
Received my item in a much bigger box then the tops box itself also the bubble wrap what is just flat plastic they were all pop and the UPS box was damaged and so wasn't the top corner of the top box I got a Geno Smith rookie card signed that has too bad corners my patch card is bent on a corner where the card is 6 cards thick this is a huge disappointment and I feel like I threw my money away
This product description prominently describes this product as &#34;(SEALED)&#34; when in fact these cards appear to have been manually sorted/stacked in a plastic card box, placed in a plastic card slip, and &#34;sealed&#34; with a cheap-looking sticker with the seller's contact information.  I believe that &#34;sealed&#34; language should be reserved for factory-sealed card sets.  Too expensive for a &#34;stack&#34; of cards.  Returning the two sets I ordered.
Not so great quality. Could have printed a better one off the internet.Super dark, dull, and a little grainy.Was hoping for something more of a photo quality.Disappointed. Hopefully it will look better in a frame.
I was very disappointed when I opened my package to discover that it was a map pulled out of the pages of a book. I guess it was my fault for not looking closely to what I was buying. I could have bought a whole atlas at my local thrift store for a lot less than I paid for one page.
