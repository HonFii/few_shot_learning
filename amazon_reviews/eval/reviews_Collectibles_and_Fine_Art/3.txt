This baseball card set was not complete. I am missing one card. I bought these cards for my son's collection and it is incomplete
I don't like how it comes all apart. And you have to have two people to hang up or it falls apart while trying to get hung. I guess you get what you pay for.
I bought this to hold a signed bat my son got for Christmas. The price was reasonable, but it was pretty flimsy. The ends easily come off. I think I will ultimately buy one of better quality.
Bat case looks great once it's up and on display, but very difficult to put together. Not very high quality but you get what you pay for. As long as it's hanging up and no one is touching it, it's fine.
This set was satisfactory.  I've been a longtime collector of MJ cards and while I like any MJ cards I get, I would have preferred some more inserts and stuff.  I'm gonna check out the other options on the site and review those too for MJ card lots.  I'm going to try the "Various Brands Chicago Bulls Michael Jordan 20 Trading Card Set" listing.  One of the merchants even includes a free card album and card pages with the purchase.  Good luck in your pursuit of MJ cards fellow collectors!
I don't have much to say, just a few things about the product.First of all, there are some nice cards included, but most are common cards, of course.  I am OK with that fact.  Likely I got my moneys worth from them, despite many of the cards having been already used and lowered in quality and value.Secondly, a large portion of the cards were duplicates.  That would normally be fine, because it's "random" cards.  The problem, however, is that over 400 of the cards are the exact same bunch, all Donruss 1989, base set, Seattle Mariners team, only.  Basically, about a dozen cards repeated over and over again.  They almost seem like copies, in fact, most of them seem brand new, unfaded and unworn to the point of appearing straight out of the original sealed container box/pack/etc.All in all, albeit very frustrating, I still think it was worth buying.
Perhaps this is trying to look like the 1965 set with the flag.  The pictures and design of this set just seem lame to look upon.  It does contain 28 Hall of Famer and 10 members of the 3000 Hit Club.  #1 Draft Picks are noted, few of which made it to MLB.There are turn Back the Clock cards and All-Star cards.  To get gem mint cards from the box would be a nice experience.  However, other cardmakers were already putting pictures on the backs of cards.  By this point Topps had fallen behind in creativity. Features one Hall of Fame rookie,1989 Topps Baseball Randy Johnson Rookie Card.
This was the year that Upper Deck started to force the old manufacturers to up the quality of their cards.  1989 was the second year that I collected cards, stoked on by my relatively new-found love of the game, and the fact that I could trade, trade, trade with my cousins.  The 1989 Topps set isn't the best set.  There really aren't all that many great cards in it.  I got it for the nostalgia--primarily, I cannot seem to find the sets that I had &#34;nearly completed&#34; out of wax packs from 1988 to 1991 or my 1993 nearly complete set (the 1992 one mysteriously reappeared a month ago in a closet).  There was a lot of fun assembling sets out of packs and trades, but I can't run to the Ames anymore and buy the $0.44 cent 15 card packs with the flesh-ripping gum anymore--Ames is gone, I don't live in Moundsville anymore, and I'm not sure when the last time Topps cards were under a buck a pack...probably the early 90s.I barely remember any of these players except for the mega stars and the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The backs are an unimaginative black on red, and the pictures are not the best quality.  The design is lacking...but again, I bought these for memories.All in all, since I only paid $22 for this set, it's well worth it.  I don't care about future value, since I don't believe these will really have any.  I've opened it up, and I'm sorting the cards to put into binders.  That is the joy I get from these things.
Having the complete set was cool.  My son, 8 years old at the time he got the set, is a big Jim Thome fan.  The two of us sorted through the set one by one in anticipation that Jim Thome could be next.  Unfortunately, Jim Thome never appeared. False advertising? Incomplete set? I don't know the answer. In the end, my son and I spent a lot of time together allowing me to talk about MLB players that bridged the time from my youth to his.  It was worth it for that experience alone.  Still would like the Jim Thome rookie card though!
Was not at all happy with gimmick packs of &#34;Awesome All Stars&#34; stickers &#34;Baseball's Greatest Grossouts&#34; which have NOTHING to do with the kind of card collecting I enjoy doing. Also -- the trading coins were not what I was looking for when I made this purchase. Keep it simple and stick to the traditional baseball cards. Happy with what I did get...just have no need for the gimmick garbage.
Rather disappointed as I had seen a similar box of cards at Target but it had a special card for Mickey Mantle with it, so this product did not meet my expectations....
When I was a kid, baseball cards was a way I kept myself plugged into the sport.  Now that trading cards are largely a very poor investment and baseball stats are readily available for free online... I just don't see the point anymore.  But if you still are hanging in there and want to collect... Topps is really the Ford of the hobby.
Good price and reasonable shipping. These cards for purchased as a guest 4 my stepdad. He spent hours with his cards and has said that there were good cards in the packs.
these cards are good for beginners, just a okay pack. The cards condition is not that good, I still found a few good cards inside. The price is very good, I would recommend for beginners.
The cards look very nice but after opening all the packs; I didn't get a Rookie Auto. I contacted Topps support.
Great item, the only down side is that some of the packs had the gum still inside so a few of the cards were stained.
so great selection, but most of the packs were very obliviously opened. they were taped closed and cards were flipped upside down and backwards. You are getting what you pay for just a heads up. Still fun to go through.
Our 5 year old grandson decided he wanted baseball cards.  These cards were in a box and lots of them but many were sets of the same player.  These are more for an older child who would trade them with friends.  We only gave one of each set in our grandson's stocking.  The gum enclosed was thrown out as if they are as old as indicated, the gum would be too.  It was really not for a 5 year old.  It does show a child how they were packaged back in the day when you bought Fleers gum with the players card.
The packages were described as unopened, but clearly many of them were open and then resealed.  In some instances they didn't even try to make the package look unopened.  While my husband enjoyed the cards, it was obvious the packages had been opened and the good cards had been cleaned out.
I don't have anyway to rate these baseball cards; they were a Christmas gift to our middle-aged son who collects cards.  those questions above not relevant for baseball cards.  He did say these are common cards thus he wasn't interested in them.  They did arrive in a timely manner and packaged as advertised.
There are several hidden gems in this collection. Some are hisoric cards. My set included Derek Jeter, A Rod, and Barry Bonds.
All I got was a flat rate box with the cards laying flat and they were upside down right side up. All signs pointed to someone taking cards from boxes in a warehouse and then slapping them in a flat rate box with no QAing of any kind.  Yes, the cards were in decent shape but there was no attention to detail or the feeling that it was made just for us. I was especially disappointed about the box they came in.  I was hoping to gift my nephew but they ended up being in a make shift flat rate box so I had to buy a decent box to go to my nephew.  Oh well, maybe it was my fault?Cards were in good shape though.
This was the 2nd time I have ordered this box.  Now the 1st time there was no option to write a review.  Despite not recieving the 1 card from the 1950s or 2 from the 1960s as promised in the description and one of the main reasons I purchased this item, the 1st box had a decent amount of rookies and inserts including numbered cards.  Although disapointed from no vintage cards the inserts and rookies I did gain, which were almost a 1/4 of the 1st box I felt made up for it.As a avid collector of baseball cards I felt it was a good buy and I would get a another one.  This time I got one as a birthday gift. Let's just say I am glad this time my money wasn't used to purchase the item, but instead a gift card.  Out of over 500 cards I recieved only 13 were rookies or inserts.  The rest were just mostly complete sets of cards from the late 80s with mostly no names.  I will give credit where it is due, I did recieve my one card from the 50s and 2 from the 60s as promised in the description as long as being shipped in a penny case then a hard case, to which I was very happy about.  However, the 5 cards from the 1970s were not the best condition. The corners showed signs of rounding and wear.  Of those 5 cards from the 70s, one was a checklist. If your not a true collector or want some vintage cards then buy it. Otherwise unless you need a paperweight or some kindle for fires, I'd stay away. This item is a GAMBLE.  Caveat Emptor.
This set has nearly everyone in it. It is shipped in a sturdy platic case which you can use to hold the cards. It's good for kids, not necessarily for collectors.
Interesting assortment of "old" cards.  Did not really know that they were unopened cards from previous years.  There was a variety of card packs from the past 10 years.
I purchased this product and was happy about the number of packs I received, because I think I got more than 30.  But, I was unhappy about the timeframe of the cards.  I received packs from 1989-1994.  It wouldn't be bad if I pulled some superstars, but they were mostly common cards, worth like $0.10 a piece.  I would buy it again if I could get a more wider range in years.
Got what seems to be some decent cards for my son,  unfortunately I only received ONE pack from the 80's(1989)  two packs from 2001  and the rest of the cards were 1990 and 1991.  Not the variety I expected at all.
I liked the card type.  The money value of the cards are not really good so if your in it for the money its definitely not for you.  If you are looking for memories of older ball players iwould buy it the pro visions are really well done too.
As Described, Fast shipping, Price is too high. Not happy at all. Will not purchase again in future. Will not purchase again
As far as the cards themselves, all cards are the same. I do like the box they come in. Keeps cards clean and dry.
the cards are great. no problem there. the packaging was really dirty. they must have been in someones basement for years.
This was the first set i ever ordered through online, when it came the set was missing 15 cards all of the hall of famers and some rookie cards. I complained and recieved the rest a month later i wont buy another set on here again
I'm happy I received the rookies I was looking for the problem is most of them are bowed also received like 50 nba cards ???
Finally a complete set of Euro Coins. They are really collectable. I tried getting them from the countries, but can never get cons that were in collectable condition.
There are way more &#34;who is that?&#34; type of cards in these than the stars you might remember. Still if quantity is what you're after its fine for the price.
this item was delivered quickly to me but i was slightly disapointed due to the quality of &#34;big names&#34; within the package but it did bring back fond memories.i expected a little better.
it was good to come across some old names & faces from the past but it seems as though the cards were picked through!
Like to say great deal but the box had a lot of players my son would know nothing about. This was for my son
There were mostly early 90s common cards, nothing to really span 25 years as it says in the write up. Nothing spectacular by any means. It would be good for a starter but there were a lot more duplicates than they led me to expect. I didn't think I would get an autographed card or something very valuable but I did think I would get at least one really nice card out of it to justify the purchase. I have better luck with the generic 75 card packs at target- got quite a few nice cards out of them, wider variety, and it was a lot cheaper than this set.
I ordered 2 boxes. My wife and I went thru both boxes. We had a decent mix of old and new and most were in fairly good shape. Cards from 82-12. Even a decent amount of 80's cards were in good shape. out of 1000 cards, we received about 8 rookies and ALOT of filler. Several instances of doubles and numericals in a row. I do wish there was maybe 1 autograph or game played per box or a great rookie card. Those ones that make you feel like a kid in a candy store.
No superstart cards or rookies. Most of the cards were from the late 80's and early 90's. I figured for the price this wasnt going to be a great buy but for the money its not bad. Also there were alot of duplicates. Id say about 15 players duplicated which kinda was a drag. overall not that great but if you want to start a collection for cheap this is where you should start.
All the cards are super old and, even though I am a HUGE football fan, I recognized maybe 1/10 of the names. TONS of dupicates and cards aren't in great shape. For someone who likes old cards, sure, get this. It's a terrific deal. But, if, like me, you want modern cards that have great and recognizable cards, I 100% recommend topps. This was written by a 11 year old boy who is addicted to football and football cards.
I purchased this card collection as a gift for my 7 year old grandson.  He was totally thrilled, but I was very disappointed in the ordinary box the cards arrived in.
Nice guy. Seemed to genuinely want to help. Some good cards in the selection. There was a steve Young, warren Sapp and a junior Saeu card in there.
I sent it to my sister who has been collecting cards for a year now. She said there wasn't anything special in there..
decent selection of cards.  more doubles than i would like, but have had worse selections. was upset that there were baseball, basketball, hockey, auto racing cards in the boxes
Decent lot of cards, med-heavy on the duplicates, but some nice surprises as well... in the end, the mystery is part of the game
It was ok, but the mix cards has to much old cards, but it s ok for a begginer, and for teaching some teaching of history s baseball.
To many cards from the 1980's, thought that 1970's would be the majority.Would probably not order again in the future.
The cards are good but they get you buy giving some fake cards. Only a quarter of the cards were by good labels such as Topps and Donruss. My disappointment was that in very small font size at the bottom of the Babe Ruth card it says that the card isn't real. There was one pack that I thought was amazing. The TOPPS STADIUM CLUB PACK. I say spend your money on packs like those, but if your a beginner in collecting cards this is the buy for you.
A lot of repeat cards, nothing really special in there. Good cards picked out already but a lot of fun to look through if you have alot of downtime
For the price you get alot of cards but the packaging was not what i expected.  In the picture it shows the cards in card storage boxes and when it was delivered it was just a bunch of cards in a random box.  Lots of corners were bent in from moving around.  Once i dug deeper in the box the cards were in good shape.  Definatly not random cards.  Alot of cards were in number order which tells me they were sorted and good cards removed before packaging.  All in all not bad for the price.  But not happy with the fact i have another box in the mail now.  In my oppinion the 500 card box was a way better deal.
Its good to buy this boxes a feww years after they come out, they are too expensive when new. Nothing great bout this set!
Took longer than I expected, but still arrived within time frame set by seller. I'd order again
I guess if someone has a collectors shelf full of matchbox cars it would work. Though, I wasnt sure of how big it was because the description wasnt really clear and it isnt really a gift for an adult. It seems more of a kids toy.
I thought it was topps rookies and traded complete sdt but it wasn't wouldnt mind really exept no BRET URGDisappointed young collector
We purchase this set every year for our son as part of Christmas.  He was a little disppointed this year as he said there were cards for people that did not actually make the big leagues and some of the players were left out and their uniforms were not always correct.  He also thought some of the player photos had been doctored.
Drives me nuts to get a missing hit box, exp. of an older product.  But oh well. Buy at own risk.
I already knew what cards I would be getting. I was disappointed when I went into a card store and they had 10 boxes of these and only charged $8. The cards were also not flat, but that is probably due to the age of them.
I like the product overall.  The only reason why it got three stars was because the cards was not in numerical order.
I didn't realize they would be so small. Perhaps baseball cards once were really teeny? I'm not sure. But these are half the size of regular baseball cards which was disappointing. Fun faces and players to remember, though.
While it would be nice to pull gem mint cards from a box, this set and its pictures just seem tired to me.  It appears an attempt has been made to have the cards look a bit like the 1967 set with the team name at the top and the 1966 set with the bar at the bottom at an angle.The set features 25 Hall of Famers and 9 members of the 3000 Hit club. There are All-Star cards and Turn back the Clock cards. Also, team leader cards. Two notable rookie cards are Ken Caminiti (RIP) and Tom Glavin.At this point other card makers were putting photos on the backs of cards, Topps had fallen behind design-wise. Would make a nice gift for someone born in 1988.
The 1988 Topps baseball card set was the first I had collected as a boy; my original collection has long since been lost, but I found this on Amazon and quickly bought it.  This set was before Upper Deck came and changed the game and was printed at the peak of the &#34;junk wax&#34; era.  The card stock is pretty bad and the cards themselves are not all that attractive; there are few action shots and not really any cards to get excited about (I recall Jose Canseco's card and the Al Leiter error to be the most desired the year they came out).  What I did find odd is that one error card made it into this set--the McGwire record breaker card.  Of course, again, I bought this out of nostalgia.  When compared to Topps' more recent offerings, these do not stand up in appeal.That said, the price is right, nobody will be too worried about these getting dinged or taken out of mint condition.  I immediately opened the box and started putting them in a binder--I wanted to look at them.  In that regard, the Topps sets from this era are perfect cards to handle and look at.  Just don't expect beauty.
Like most collectors, my interest 1987 Donruss Baseball can be summed up with the following phrase: Greg Maddux rookie card. In my younger days I was a huge fan of Maddux, especially when he was traded to the Altanta in 1993. Anyways, I got the urge to obtain the card when a co-worker started talking baseball and Maddux with me. Soon afterwards I ordered two boxes in attempt to a few copies of the card - at least one for me and one for him - and in the end I got two. As cut and dry as such a story may seem, there were some unexpected twists.First of all, given that this set is from 1987, don't expect quality of the cards to be up to today's standards as far as centering goes. I was really hoping to pull a Maddux worthy of being graded like my dad did (he pulled a Beckett 9.5 Gem Mint out of a box such as this) but I ended up sorely disappointed. In all honesty, my father lives a charmed life when it comes to pulling great cards and I've always been more-or-less doomed to live in his shadow collection-wise. Given my experience, I'd suggest you forgo looking through packs and just buy the card from a dealer so you can see what you're getting if your concerned over condition like I was.This feeling is further enhanced by some of the other cards that make up the set. When compared to Donruss sets from 1988 into the mid 1990's, a set of 1987 Donruss has a decent book value. Still, the thing that hurts this set is the Barry Bonds rookie. Yeah, it may be worth ten dollars or so but who really wants this thing? I pulled three of these (and figures one of them looks good enough to grade) and don't look forward to sitting on them for the next twenty years. Who wants the rookie card for someone that systematically ruined the game and tarnished one of its most hallowed records?Don't be tricked into taking a bunch of undesirable material just to obtain the Maddux rookie. My friend and I are glad to card in our collections but I'm just as unhappy having three Bonds rookies I'll never do anything with except loathe.
According to the product description, 24 packs of 8 were being purchased.  When I received the product, I only received 12 packs of 8.I contacted customer service and they were confused as well. No decision has been made at this time.
there were 4 card missing 3 in the 300hundreds and 1 in the 400 i cant remember which ones , so i dont know if i will order from amozon
This is a general review for the 2008 MLS soccer card RETAIL box by Upper Deck.So far I have bought only one box of these cards (as of Aug 31st, 2013).It is important to note that there are essentially two types of soccer card boxes: Hobby Boxes, and Retail Boxes. Hobby boxes are sold primarily to card shops, are more expensive, and contain more rare cards per box (greater likelyhood of scoring very special cards). Retail boxes are more common, sold to big box stores and are cheaper to purchase.This review is for the RETAIL BOX variety.I purchased a sealed retail box with thirty six, ten-card packs. Each standard pack contains nine random base set cards (base set of 200 cards) and one insert card (special subsets of cards in addition to the base set) of which there are 100 insert cards total divided among five sets called goal scorers, assist kings, MLS Superdraft, goal keepers, and young guns.In theory you should also get two game-used jersey cards but that is not always true. My box contained only one pack with a game used jersey card and it wasn't even a very good one.However, since there are only 200 cards in the base set and you get more than 300 base set cards I was lucky enough to complete a base set with one box, have a good number of doubles, and only end up with six triplicates.Also, I'm not sure if I'm just lucky or this is normal, but I didn't end up with any duplicate insert cards, so while I'm far away from finishing any of the five insert sets, I'm lucky to have all unique cards from one box with no insert duplicates.I'm particularly curious in regard to how often people end up with only one game-used jersey card or no insert duplicates, or a complete base set out of one retail box.
This box had cards in pretty good condition. Was shocked to see each card in its own individual sleeve. However, the cards did not come in a factory sealed box, and instead were randomly placed in a shipping box. Additionally, it had some random cards and then an almost complete set of cards, minus one, which of course was a Michael Jordan card. Seems as if it were intentionally taken out, which not only leaves it as an incomplete set, but the best card is missing. As the person before stated, there are doubles. Otherwise, cards are in good condition for the most part and is a good starter kit.
Too many duplicates for my liking but, it is also the risk you run when purchasing lots of cards...decent enough
I recently broke a box of this stuff from Atlanta Sports Cards. I paid roughly $69 for the box, which is about $30 below the going rate on Amazon.com. The yield on this product is typically quite horrible, as you get three autos (1 per mini box) per box, but they are typically of non-star players. My box was great because it yielded a Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie rookie auto xfractor numbered 1 of 1. Without the monster pull, the yield would have booked out to maybe $40 or $50 total. My next biggest hit was a Joe Flacco rookie refractor numbered out of 699. The key hits here are 2008 rookies of Joe Flacco, Ray Rice, or Matt Ryan. My three star rating reflects two major isues: (1) yield is typically terrible as you are likely to take a loss on the box, and (2) the box can be obtained cheaper off of Amazon.com.
History the Topps way- reduce people to a few words on cardboard!....Maybe next:  Look 'n' See for the 21st Century?!
my father bought these and was very happy for the price and would certainly recamend these to others as it was great deal for the price
This card box is okay, but seems real heavy on common base cards. The jersey swatch cards look great and Upper Deck always does a nice job on the design end of things.
I recently got back into baseball cards, and found these on a shelf at a local store.  Being naive, I thought first edition was Upper Deck's way of saying "series 1" (though they actually DO have a series 1, it wasn't in stock!)Anyway, "first edition" is essentially Upper Deck's 'cheap' cards.  Its a 300 card set, but there are very few inserts aside from the "star quest" cards which are more desirable in their "colored variations" in Series 1 and 2.  Now, getting started in a collection, this is a great value- but you're not getting the full experience of Series 1 and 2.  Also the cards are matte finish instead of Upper Deck's usual glossy finish (which would make them more friendly to autograph sharpies...)
Its a very short set, only 55 cards. I wished they have included more players. The quality its not very good, the material feels like the late 80s topps cards. I hope Topps does a better job in the future!!
one of these days i'll remember these & stop buying them. lol...over rated & over priced product. no reflection on seller. i will continue to use dealer. am satisfied with seller & service.
I purchased this whole box with hope that there would be some gold foil ledgend and superstar cards in there. Much to my dismay there wasn't a single one. I got ripped off!!!
Its a good set of all the best rookies of 2009,and agood value.The only thing I have against it is the picturscould be alittle more flashy,but other then that its worth the money.
I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend who is a huge yankees fan. He likes them but also said they're really nothing that special.
Received in a timely fashion, but confused as to why there were velcro tabs stuck to the back of the poster.  Poster was two-sided.
I used it as a gift and the kids seemed to like it. I dont care for baseball myself or ever watch the game.
I am glad Topps put something out commemorating the 2009 World Series, but they could have put more effort into it. I would have liked to see game by game highlight cards at least for the World Series.
I did not purchase this baseball and I am not familiar with him.  I have purchased baseballs in the past but not the one pictured.
I am a more experienced user so I got a lot of cards that I already had.  For those years that I had not completed my collection, it was good.
I would like to see a vintage 70's pack with this. Sometimes ya half to give more to sell more.
Seriously, there are sooo many Score cards, it's unreal. Probably because they are the worst brand ever. The Donruss cards aren't as bad, although there are a ton, I appreciate those more than stupid Score.It was so fun going through them. It's worth it for that :)
I have opened too many of these boxes in 2012, as I think I have opened nearly eight boxes in total. My average price point is between $50 and $60. My best box was my first where I pulled a gold auto of Joe Mauer numbered to 35. The typical box yields several USA prospect cards, plus some USA prospect jerseys and some autos. I would say the worst boxes yield the "Impressions" auto cards. You have several chances to pull high dollar inserts of Bryce Harper and several other team USA prospects that are now very hot. I think the $75 price reflects the hype of several of the possible players in the set. The base cards have a nice design and I think that the boxes are great for ripping. My three star rating reflects the current prices, as I would prefer to pay closer to $60 or under. I think if you go to the direct website of most of the dealer's selling this stuff on Amazon.com you will find it closer to that price.
The logo and metal flake are very good. The die cast accuracy not so much. Still a collector's item, especially if Darren McFadden makes the NFL Hall of Fame
I pre-ordered 6 hobby  boxes back in March and received them in the middle part of June, from what I read they were saying at least 3 hits per box.  I received on autograph card (Robinson Cano) and 5 jersey cards and about 24 code cards.  Series 1 seemed to have a lot more inserts then series 2 and the price was also higher for series 2, not sure why, guess it could be the rookie cards they put in series 2, not sure I will purchase anymore of series 2, had better luck with series 1.  Good luck.
My son ordered this product recently and I was shocked at what we actually got. Looking at what the product description says, I understand that we were to get just one pack of cards, but the photo should represent the product that the consumer will receive. The picture had my son thinking he was going to get what the picture showed. It is a very deceiving photo. Then, I was apalled at the business card that came with the product. It read "We are proud to be a Christian-owned company", followed by a quotation from the Bible. I understand and respect that this is freedom of speech and religion, but the business owners should be more sensitive to their costumers and their personal beliefs. It'd be different if this was a Bible company, but the last time I was notified, baseball cards are not part of any organized religion. I hope you take my comments and concerns into concideration.
Disappointed that the card set with display case didn't include the oversized white Mets team binder that is pictured next to the set. I should have been more diligent, as a careful read of the item description doesn't mention it all. Yet it's always pictured side by side with the card set in these ads. Why?
When I first received the autographed ball from the seller it did not have " The shot heard around the world" inscription on it. They said send the ball back and we'll send you the right ball. I decided to hang onto the original ball until the new ball arrived. Well in about a week I received the correct ball but Branca's autograph was into the threads of the ball. So I called the seller and they said that happens sometimes. So I decided to buy the original ball along with the badly autographed one. A rather expensive purchase.
I bought this set of NHL player cards for my grandson and I do not have his feedback yet to give an accurate feedback on this product.However, the order placement and shipment were as I expected.  On time and well packaged.
This is a great started set of 10 different packages of soccar cards.  It will be a nice gift for our grandsons.
Had a return problem that was resolved. Cards are great but dated and my son was not too exited once this year was done.
I bought it for a birthday gift and now I'm not even sure whose birthday it was.  You need away to say at the beginning that item was purchased as a gift.
I was a little dissapointed because this set didn't have Boesch in it, and I have been looking for his card everywhere. At first I thought that maybe it was because he is a rookie and they just haven't put his card in, but then I saw Jackson in there so I'm not sure what the deal is. =[
I purchase the cards for my brother's birthday.  He has been collecting cards since he was a little boy.  Every year he asks for the Topps complete set of baseball cards.  I looked for the best price with no shipping.  I found that at Amazon.  Received the product in a sealed plastic wrapping.  When the cards when opened missing was the Kansas City Royals Manager card.  I know it is not Amazon's fault but that of the manufacturer.  Just letting you know that there wasn't 666 cards like it says, but 665. Amazon had the best price and no shipping.  Even with the mistake I would still use Amazon.
over two and half weeks to ship a set of baseball cards?  No that I need them but something seems a miss for that long a time estimate.
I purchased this football card as a stocking stuffer for my 8 year old son whose favorite player is Tim Hightower.  The description says it comes in a "screwdown case".  What it came in was an apparently used scratched up plastic cover held together at the top with dirty scotch tape, no screw holes, and a bar code sticker slapped on the back.  I was not impressed with the packaging.  However, the card was in good condition as promised, so I'm happy with that.  I'm really glad I didn't pay for shipping because if I had, it would've been WAY overpriced.
I received the card in a plastic sleeve but did not get the screw down case that it was suppose to come with.  It sure would have been nice to get what I ordered!
here is what i love about Score football, 99 cents a pack or $10 for a blaster box of 11 packs.here is what i hate about 2010 Score football...it's TOUGH to pull elite rookie cards. Last year, i bought probably 4 total blaster boxes and pulled all the top rookies. Sanchez, Crabs, Stafford, Harvin, Freeman, etc.This year, through 4 blaster boxes, no Tebow, Bradford, Clausen, or Dez Bryant. The rookies are beyond tough to pull, it's amazing.What i also don't like is the "1 rookie per pack" because then if you get what you don't want, the pack is a bust.Also, there aren't any cool inserts like last year's 1989 Score reprint rookie set.Overall, 2010 Score is nice, but honestly, just wait for the boxed set to come out. Why bother going through retail packs?
I opened a box of 2010 Bowman Platinum back in April for my birthday. I was not overwhelmed by the contents of the box, but the yield was pretty strong and the cards are good looking. Some of my highlights were pulling the Trout, Strasburg, Heyward, et al. The jersey auto I pulled was of Jackie Bradley. The price I paid was roughly $80, so compared to current pricing of $125-plus, I got a steal. The pricing on these boxes went crazy because of some of the solid Trout inserts to be had. I would recommend chasing the Trout cards if you can pick these boxes up somewhere below $110. You should get close to the $80 to $100 mark in what you pull from the box. My three stars reflects that I really like the product, but prices are currently way too high given the popularity of rookie Mike Trout.
I got this coin for my boyfriend because he is a Bengals fanatic and he loved the coin...however, the packaging was crap. It was terrible presentation. I debated taking it out of the package and giving it to him, that's how bad it was. It was completely opened and closed back up with 2 single pieces of tape. It was nice and dirty too. I guess you really DO get what you pay for...
We ordered this card as a stocking stuffer - the card itself is great - it was advertised to come in a protective screwdown case, but instead arrived in a card sleeve with an inventory sticker across the bottom of it, blocking some of the cards details.  We will need to work hard to remove the sticker as it seems to be superglued on - or toss the sleeve entirely and buy the hard case that we originally thought we would get.  Again - card is great, but we've got more work to do with it.
I collect silent film star signed photos.  And Ive seen this Richard Dix on Amazon for the past year or two years.  I considered adding it to my collection.  It was listed at $200, and now I see the idiot seller raised the price to $900.  Really?????  $900???  it was listed for $200.  Why would I jump on it for $900?  ....Hes Richard dix.  He's not chaplin!!!!
Nice board with TH sig and COA. However, Signature is sharpie on clear coated bottom of board and wipes off if touched. Don't know how to protect autograph except extremely careful handling.
There were actually red marks on the flag, that are not in the pic. The flag is not as crisp as the pic shows, meaning it has those marks on it, that I was not expecting at all. I was expecting a perfect flag like the one shown
Is a nice Item , looks good in my room , pretty nice but, too expensive. nice article for decoration.
Arrived quick. The seller delivered as promised. Obama could take a lesson here and deliver on his promise of balancing the budget and cutting government spending. Not likely as he makes a science of buying votes from lazy people with working people money.
Good Item. Just as expected. No surprises. I hate surprises with items purchased online. Metals make a good investment for the future.SriVin, Minneapolis
I bought this box it is because of relic cards is what I was looking for...the box said pack with a relic card contain 10 cards. turn out there is no relic cards in it and only got 2 diamond giveaway cards out of 24 packs. Kinda little ripoff and hopeless.
I know it doesnt say its a factory sealed set, and some may get theirs that way but the one I received wasnt. I didnt think anything of it till I relaized it didnt have the autographed rookie card it was suppose to have inside. I double checked the set and nothing, I dont know if this company took it out or what since it wasnt sealed. I know its just a rookie card and it was probably signed by some guy Ive never heard of, but the box does say "One rookie autograph per box!" Its a nice set of cards no doubt about that, which is why Im still giving it a 3.
I love the cards but I saw last years 2012 Heat set for only 4.99 at Target and now I feel I paid too much.
Buying a pack has that mystery of not knowing what to get.  With this one, you get what you pay for but not everyone in the line up is collectible.
I was introducing something new to my grandson and he loves baseball cards!  He was looking for a certain kind and we found these!  Delivery was quick and product was what we were looking for!  Thanks for being dependable!!
Hopefully it's real! There wasn't a number to show it was authentic. It was a gift for my dad because he's a collector and a huge Cleveland fan. He likes it!
The Luxury Suite cards are a nice mid-level card.  Each box does contain some nice veteran hits and even a couple decent rookies.  The biggest drawback is the price.  $129.00 a box is really over-priced.  With some hunting around,  you can find them below $100.00 a box.  That is a much better price for what you get.
Was advertised that package contained 9 packs of 5 cards, mine only contained 8 packs...but everything else was presented as described, lots of good rookie cards
These have the potential to be great cards and a true collectible. However, cards were cut unevenly so that the left side contains as much as 1/8th of an inch of the right edge from the card cut next to it. Some of the cards look torn as opposed to cut. Too bad, as Panini struggles to maintain consistent quality in their hockey products.
Ball was as expected.  Images are misleading, it doesn't come with case and description doesn't mention it.  Would have been nice to know since it was a gift.
This set is nice to start out with. It is 26 years old but back in the mid to late 80's Topps up there production and made alot of these cards so the price is low. But don't get me wrong there is alot of stars and HOF in this set. At the time Topps had to compete with Donruss and Fleer that had a monopoly on baseball cards from 1955 to 1981. Now Topps is the only card company that has MLB rights again.
The topps cards are nice , but there was nothing special in the box. The luck of the draw was not on my side.
Hands down the Chicago Blackhawks are my favorite NHL team and me and my dad are huge fans, i was saddened to see that when i opened the pack, first off, i already had a bunch of them, being the brand that they were, so i had about 60% of them already, but when i saw Patrick Sharp, i knew i didn't have him and i knew i didn't have Patrick Kane, but instead of the Patrick Kane i knew i didn't have, i was given two (2) Patrick Sharp cards, and no Patrick Kane card, so be careful when you get this, you could have the same luck i had, but other than that, well worth it
The cards are good and new as expected but the blister pack they came in, the backing was half torn ff of the plastic.
Not bad but not great. Ticket replicas could be better quality. Good frame tho. It's a gift so hopefully he will like it.
Only reason why i bought the card is because this guy is my math teacher. This isn't him but these are his stats.
I like the MJ Tribute Collection, its a very complete set of highlights in his career, but really upset with the condition of the cards, most of them have dented corners, they are packaged in a see through plastic, which does not protect the cards at all. There also lost some of its color, dont know if it is because of heat exposure or because they've been piled for a while now, some where sticked together.
The autographed pic didnt come with a numbered certificate and seems dissimilar to other Walter Payton autographs I have viewed and the other autographs were substantially more.Im still unsure of the authenticity.
I ordered this item thinking that It was a pennant and it was not, but when I contacted the seller I  got a full refund and there was no problem. I would not have bought this Item if I knew that it was a baseball card type.
Found a better price at a card show after purchasing this item. thought it was the world series set iI was purchasing.
This is a cool set, but it's missing Bryce Harper.  I understand that timing of a call up can play a roll in that, but still it could've been noted in the description.
GOOD QUALITY JERSEY AND DETAIL.  UNFORTUNATELY THEY PUT THE HOLOGRAPH STICKER AND THE REGISTRATION NUMBER STICKER ON THE WHITE NUMBER OF THE JERSEY NEAR THE SIGNATURE.  WHEN I TRIED TO REMOVE THESE STICKERS IT LEFT A BIG SPOT WHICH RUINED THE JERSEY.  DISAPPOINTING!  DAVE
The card only indicates the rookie year and has a big gold star over Corey Walker's face.  I would have liked to be able to have Corey Walker's entire career printed on the card as well as a clear unobstructed view of his image.
For anyone who was as confused as I was; this is a baseball card [of sorts]. You'd think Amazon could at least write that at the top of the page :-O)O(
Not a good class of rookies. The price is ok but not the year. You will not profit off these rookies and the design isn't unique
I busted two boxes of 2011 Donruss Elite Football recently. I bought the product for the guaranteed four hits per box. The first box did not yield anything of real value. The best pull from the second box was a Tom Brady patch card numbered to 50. Like most boxes today, you pay up for an opportunity to get something good. I would have liked to pull one of the booklet cards, but no luck. The base cards are pretty ugly, so I am highly unlikely to bust any more of this product. The two boxes I purchased seem to follow the common theme lately, the boxes I open never come close to paying for themselves, which is unfortunate given the price of boxes these days.
I opened a box of this product on 6/28 at Collectors Corner in Sterling, VA. The box was on discount for roughly $80; note that these boxes can be had for closer to $68 to $70 if you search the Web. The box consists of 24 packs 5 cards per pack and roughly 4 hits. The box I opened yielded four rookie ticket on card autos. The biggest hit of the box was an unnumbered Taylor Hall signed rookie ticket card number 135. The other inserts were of little value all ranging from $5 to $15 (common autos). The set design is pretty nice, but the problem is that unless you get a really big hit, you probably won't pay for the box. I have noticed that often times the Panini products I open yield pretty low value inserts and cards in general. I give the product three stars because I like the cards, but find the value / reward ratio skewed toward boxes yielding poor results. I think the fact that prices have come down from the $90 range generally supports my neutral view.
I got a bunch of duplicates of good cards but 2 autographs.....but get this the autographs were both the same crappy player, Marcus Camby. overall get something else unless your just starting out and you need a big amount of star players
2011-20012 is a thin year for cards.  This set is not too colorful and the cards are not glossy.  There is a glossy parallel insert set.  I got 2 glossy cards in my box, a Chris Bosh and a Marcus Thornton.  The artist proof parallel set simply has "artist's proofs" in silver foil written on the card.  I got a Ekpe Odoh.  This set does not contain any 2011 rookies.  The insert cards are basic in design.  The main insert in the set is finding 2 autograph cards per box.  I got a Jodie Meeks and a Grant Hill..  You could get a star but there are a lot of regular joes in the set.  I did not see a lot of "wow" in the set.  I don't know if this set was planned out this way or if the strike prevented Panini from doing more with it.  Maybe the price will come down after the season and you can pick it up cheaper.
The velcro strap that is on the top of the guard isn't actually really attached to the guard to keep it from staying in place.. that means if the strap moves up, the guard isn't actually held against your shin anymore.. meaning the guard is useless because it's not protecting your shin anymore. The strap should be attached to the guard and attached somehow so it doesn't move at all.The base of the guard that goes around the ankle is very nice. It fits well and is thick enough to act as a type of brace but flexible. It keeps the bottom portion of the guard in place very well (with the top of the guard... not so well attached)
Card is cool. The signature is by Kyle Rudolph, but the printed card, I question if that is Kyle. Having seen him a lot and living in Cinti, can someone else look at the face??? It isn't Kyle
The patch quality is OK but when I ordered it, there was no references about the size of the patch. I came out that this is NOT the size of the real patch wore by the players in that XLII SB. Take that into account. If you want the patch just as a SB souvenir, it's cool.
the cards were received, they were real.  please help me out:  when you say "team set" what kind of baseball team has only 3 memebers?  2 were standard stars, 1 was a joke.
Not often we find sports card other than football and basketball.Too bad, the big names are not in the list, only some athletes from less popular sports.
I was disappointed that here were no cards of the Basketball &#34;Dream Team&#34;. I guess they are not part of the Olympic Team. If you are going to create these cards please include all Olympic athletes. I enjoyed that the swimming team was included.
This pack has the players mention in the description which is fine, but it's missing a lot of the players on the team! I also bought an A's team pack from a different online site and I got twice as many cards and for a couple bucks less! But for some reason it was missing Josh Reddick, but I'm glad this smaller pack (17) includes him.
I bought this about 2 weeks ago. U took it out to my land just have to get back out there,now to get it. Will update the stars when I get the SD card from it.
I had to request the authenticity certificate(I have to trust) ; the autograph is unreadable(sports celebrities don't take time to write?); the paint on the stick was so fresh that the smell of paint was strong.
One corner of this painting was just blank as though they forgot to paint it. However, it was pretty cheap, so I don't necessarily feel I was entitled to much more. It does add some color to the room, which was my main purpose. If you are any sort of perfectionist, I'd pass on this.
I bought this as a gift for my father, a long time Tigers fan.  The picture shows the ball in a glass case on a wood pedestal.  When the package arrived it only contained the ball, there was no case or pedestal.  I would classify that as false advertising and caution others before purchasing.
If there was a ball holder as shown would be 5 star.How can I get one?  I watched Juan Marichal pitch for the SF Giants many times
I just recently started collecting signed baseballs from players that play/ or have played for the Minnesota Twins. I just wish this ball would have been shipped in a baseball display cube.
I mean yeah it's well good that, that samuel jackson bloke used and all, but like, it's still only a knife like innit? Cuts nice enough like but didn't come with a free samuel so it's a bit s***e really.
I wanted a Shea Salinas earthquakes card, and not being a sports fan, I didn't know the uniforms. The card had has stats from when he was on one team, and the photo is from when he was on yet another team, neither one the Earthquakes. I did get him to sign it for me to send to a penpal.
many years ago when I was 8 (now 73) Bowman/Topps put out a set and word came out that there would more cards including JoeDi Maggio. In the early 1950's they short printed cards that turned out to be Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle rookies. Now they are short printing Bryce Harper because they think he will be the next super star. Yes, they did say they short printed it but why....whyStill cheating the kids and us old guys who are still kids at heart. At least I got a couple of Mike Trout.  I guess I will be short willingmy cards to my three grandchildren. Going back to my fantasy leagues and leave my sports habit to that.
didn't pull anything special. yu darvish rookie card. topps could of done a little better with there product. Other than that there are great rookies to pull.
It's important to note this is a bridge sized deck (2.25&#34; wide vs poker 2.5&#34; wide) which is disappointing.  Other than that they are acceptable quality cards, but they are not Bicycle (USPCC) quality.  I expect they will get worn out a little faster, but the design is pretty nice and if it's a rarely used deck as mine will be it fits the look for a sports/game room for Badger fans.
This poster's title references "Gandalf" at its end. The poster actually shows Sauroman standing atop the tower of Orthanc, overlooking Isengard, his Uruk army and the Misty Mountains. Sauroman (and Grima), at least their ends, were sadly and severely shortchanged in Peter Jackson's movies. Let this not continue in poster form. I like the poster otherwise, although it would have been nice to tie in the Rhohirrim, Grima, a more clear representation of the Uruk-hai, and perhaps the Ents somehow.The Two Towers is kind of "The Empire Strikes Back" of the LOTR trilogy - the best of the bunch - in my opinion anyway. A better poster would have been nice. I would buy it.
The poster was folded in the package and when opened split along folding which made it very difficult to frame.
This is a nice piece of history to have if you follow the Boy Scouts of America.  The one negative is that there was no size listed on this card.  it is very small and i thought it was more of a standard baseball card size card
I am very happy I found this to order since I am a big fan but I was a little disappointed in the condition of the photo.  The signature is legible but the photo has many many creases in it.  Not from the shipping because it was well packaged.  I will keep it.  Otherwise ordering online worked really well.
This reminded me of a funny story which I witnessed when I was on a plane years ago cross country to LA. I had to use the bathroom real bad, and stood in the back for what seemed like an eternity waiting for whoever was in there to get done. Finally, about to whiz in my pants, I knocked on the door. I heard "Just a minute" and some ruffling around and bumping and what I thought was some soft moaning. I thought to myself, "Jeez, this dude is having one good crap in there". Finally, just as I was about to wet myself, the door opens and out comes a disheveled small framed man who looked very familiar. I did a double take as he exited and realized--it was Barney Fife!, Don Knotts himself! Just as I was about to enter the restroom after Knotts exited, much to my shock I bumped right into 2 other people walking out hurriedly. One was a big dude who was zipping up his pants as he tried to squeeze past me. Lo and behold, the big guy was none other than John Wayne, the DUKE! The other was this huge gawky looking sailor boy who look all mussed up. I couldn't believe they all fit in there! My head was spinning as I entered the now vacant restroom which just seconds ago had been occupied by both Barney Fife and the DUKE (and the sailor geek), together, at the same time! Wow--both on my flight! What are the odds of that???!!!!
found the item for less on other websites but it was a gift so i didnt have to pay for it.
This was only one photo, which was fine, but it was autographed to someone named Mary.  It was not just his signature.  So not worth giving as a gift as intended, since the recipient was not Mary.  The picture on Amazon didn't expand to show Mary's name clearly.  The photo of him was the only saving grace.
Haha. So, I'm a perfectionist, I will admit that to begin with.And, yes, I'm a huge Pauly Shore fan. I was super excited to get this in the mail, and for the price, I'm not that angry about it. But, be warned, if you do decide to get this, it's just a slightly blown-up photocopy of a scan of the cover art. Yes, the signature is still there and it does have a certificate of authenticity. But, the picture itself has been stretched and is grainy.It's just not as good as I think it should have been. But, I'll still hang it on my wall.
If you ever wanted to be a Jedi now is the time.With the DNA included in this photograph (They tested to make sure it was still good) you can harvest Midi-chlorians and become a Jedi!Stop getting ripped off by Luke photos that dont have Midi-chlorians, instead get the real deal with Obi-Wan DNA.I bought one of the regular photos not realizing it didnt have Obi-wan's DNA in it. I broke that sucker down and injected myself with it. The Force was with me... for olnly about 5 minutes. It was a great feeling but a serious let down at the end. Make sure you only get photos with Obi-Wan DNA in them like this one.Obi-Wan DNA for all your Force power needs.
Why like it? It's Mars Attacks- and the sketches are sometimes pretty coolWhy dislike it? High price and &#34;sketchy&#34; collation.
These cards were OK, but we also ordered other cards from Topps that were so much nicer and even came in a container. The latter seem much more like collector cards, while Panini's were just ... well ... cheaper. But my son was happy to get the Broncos cards, regardless, as the beginning of a collection.
These were good cards except they are not as nice as Topps cards, which seem more like collector cards. My son was happy with these, though, as he starts his collection of NFL trading cards.
Step daughter loved these also but was also very disappointed when the Bubble gum was indented on the trading cards..
Where are the exclusive Cards that you say are included.  You didn't say you get a chance to get them if they are in the pack. You say that they ARE INCLUDED>>>> FALSE ADVERTISING>
Nothing really special in this box unless you just want some rookies. I didn't get any patches or signitures.I got nothing better than "glossy" cards which you cant even tell are glossy
They are less expensive, but there is a reason why.  Images, stock of paper used, images, information, etc. all a little lower quality than I expected.
I have two signed Mickey Mantle baseballs with pictures of him signing them. He attended MANY events usually with Whitey Ford and other Greats. This is not by any stretch of the imagination a rare autograph.
This case filled the need I have to display a valuable baseball that I own. Disappointed in the way the cube locks together.
A good signature on a ok ball. it did not come with a coa contacted tristar and they told me to go to their website to print out the coa. that is ok it is nice to get a coa like psa/dna puts out.
I expected a factory sealed set of cards... missing Bryce Harper rookie so I guess seller took what he wanted out.  Nice! I should have bought a sealed set like the 2013 set I bought for my other son.  I just wanted them to have different cards to show and share.  I guess I trusted a selfish dealer... lesson learned. Mislead.
Good condition yet cards weren't in order which makes me wonder if I bought a full set or not. Going to have to sit down and sort them out. Sucks.
the bobble head is fine, but it doesn't look like Kerry Wood to me.  Larger then I thought it would be.
I, the Jury (1953), the first flick to feature Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, is a substandard Film Noir, but it has a Lot of Heart with Great Dialogue, an Engrossing Plot and requisite Bevy of Beautiful Dames.Having Biff Elliot in the starring role of Mike Hammer is its most obvious flaw.  You're immediate alarmed by the character's appearance, akin to a battered punch-drunk ex-boxer.  One wonders if his appearance is due to post-traumatic stress, a victim of `Shell Shock' from exposure to the horrors & brutality of war in the South Pacific.  We get an idea of the savagery when he laments at the passing of his friend Jack Williams, a guy who literally gave his right arm for a friend when he caught a Japanese Bayonet that was meant for Hammer.The blind loyalty displayed by Margaret Sheridan's characterization of Hammer's Assistant `Velda' can be reasoned again by what happened to him in the South Pacific, feeling indebted to him for his sacrifice.Is it the private hell he went through the reason the chemistry between Hammer and femme fatale Psychoanalyst Charlotte Manning (Peggie Castle) doesn't ever feel right?  Whatever the reason, whenever she appears on screen Hammer isn't the only one being mesmerized by her!There's a truckload of great moments from character actors practicing their craft.  While each scene is not without random flaws, it's not the fault of the actors as they endeavor to showcase their performance range.This is particularly true of Alan Reed.  As his second entry into the Noir World, he performs the role of George Kalecki aka `Mister Big'.  In his case, direction of the camera never seems to be framed properly.  However, Mr. Big's Emotional Relationship with his mobster lieutenant Hal Kines (Robert Cunningham) is decades ahead of its time!  Previously in 1946, Reed got the tar beaten out of him by John Garfield in The Postman Always Rings Twice.  He would return to the Noir Genre again with Humphrey Bogart in 1955's Desperate Hours.Other notable character performances include:  Preston Foster - Captain Pat Chambers, Elisha Cook, Jr.  - Bobo, Nestor Paiva - Bartender Manuel and John Qualen - Veterinary Doctor R.H. Vickers.The film's Cinematographer, John Alton, worked on a dozen Noir Films of varying quality during 1947 to 1955, the most celebrated are those made with acclaimed Director Anthony Mann:  T-Men (1947), Raw Deal (1948), He Walked by Night (1948) & Border Incident (1949).There's a showdown of fisticuffs where Hammer is out-numbered and out-gunned, while Velda's life is held in the balance.  The scene is set on a marble staircase of the interior court inside the legendary Bradbury Building containing Hammer's Office.  Renowned for its unique architecture, the Bradbury has been featured for decades in motion pictures, television and music videos from as early as 1944.  Its most famous use includes the films D.O.A (1950), Marlowe (1969), Chinatown (1974), as well as the Television Series 77 Sunset Strip, City of Angels and Banyon.Those critical of this film should keep in mind that judging by the high quality of the promotional posters accompanying the film, it was being made for the lucrative Drive-In Market.  It bears the similar qualities and short cuts utilized by Roger Corman during his turn at making movies for Drive-Ins during the 1950's.To his credit, Biff Elliot does a good job at portraying the Private Investigator as brawny, physically tough with his fists and never shying away from violence.  His performance displays the traits fans associate with Mickey Spillane's anti-hero: machismo, misogynist, sexist, unapologetic and politically incorrect.  He's a solitary hard-boiled sleuth, who's impatient with the legal system and willing to avenge victims as Judge, Jury and Executioner.The visual finale baring the physicality of Peggie Castle doesn't disappoint!  But if you're expecting the suave sophistication of Sam Spade, you'll be sadly disappointed; instead you'll get a metaphor of a brutal garbage man who's come to take out the trash!!!
Well, I am confused.  The descriptions says that this is a "stratocaster " guitar.  I have heard of (and own) "Stratocaster" guitars.  That is alot of money for a "stratocaster " guitar, whatever that may be.
I just wanted to clarify that Armen is not misspelled.  Armon Gilliam; after years of being called Arr-Mon decided to change his name so that people would pronounce it properly to Armen.  Do not let the &#34;misspelling&#34; deter you.
This box of baseball cards did not have the same number of cards in it that it advertised that it had. :(
I was not sure it was authentic. When I received the package it was missing the stand,poster, baseball card. I called the company and they apologised and send me the stand [ which was a different finish then the one shown in the advertisement and no poster. It was a gift for my grandson. I did not call back for the poster. I felt the item was mass produced, cheesy and defintely not worth the money. I did not have time to return it and get something else as I had to give it to him immediately and was only concerned I could not get the item on time.Disappointed.
Not much to this movie. The acting was OK. The script was fine. If you want to watch this don't buy wait for it to come out on cable.
I bought these to donate for a silent auction, thinking they would bring in some money for the charity.  However, no one has ever heard of them.
Signature identical to the one shown hereUnsure of authenticity signatures vary  & 1 I bought has no  variationsToo exactPossibly a photo of a photo.
I Was really happy with this card its very high quality, but the case not only did not hold the grade card in place but also came apart .
I had to glue the end due to the crack which was present on delivery.  We use this in Firearms training classes.  I ordered another one from &#34;Blue Guns&#34; which I believe will be much more substantial.
When I purchase an autograph, it troubles me when it looks so completely different from all the other R. Howard autographs I've seen, on the ones available on Amazon and elsewhere. I only gave it 3 stars because in my research I came across 1 autograph from Ryan Howard that had some of the same attributes as the one pictured. Also, when the ball comes with the hologram, I expect that hologram to be numbered, and it wasn't as almost all others are. I plan to send the ball off to get it re-authenticated due to my concerns and cross my fingers I wasn't duped. When it comes to autographs via Amazon (or in this case Hollywood Collectibles) I have had no problems to date, but unfortunately I have many with this particular one.
Not what I was expecting, its okay.  Doesn't have the clarity I was hoping for in the image.  Not sending it back.
Quick delivery. My only complaint is that I ordered an XL jersey, which the tag states, but the jersey was gigantic. My boyfriend definitely can't wear it, it is at least twice a standard XL size.
Nice cards, and  nice display pages for my grand sons to sort through and place in slots.  i i i
It's okay, with me, that someone decided to sell their autograph of one of the Presidents of The United States, BUT... Ithink that the PRICE is outragious! I have autographed photographs of a few Presidents... back to Nixon, but, honestly,if you can get a signature of Lincoln [fer Cri-sakes!] for slightly more, HOW c-a-n you justify T=H=I=S price for a [living]one [President/celebrity]?
I was a little disappointed not to see the face of Matt Duchene a little more clearly.  Otherwise it is a nice card.  I gave it to my Grandson who is a great Duchene fan.
Babe Ruth autograph baseballs are expensive, but not this much. The problem I have is the title says it is graded a "7", but the picture shows it is a "6". If I were the seller, I would maybe correct whichever part is incorrect.
I actually love slow-moving films that allow one to take in the entire film without rushing to the next scene, to quietly observe the landscape, and closely examine the facial and physical expressions of the characters.  I appreciated the slow pace of this film, but the story just didn't connect with me.  I got it when the "moment" happened that "changed" everything, but I didn't get why the woman never talked about it.  There was an awareness on the part of all three that something went wrong, but no real acknowledgement or questioning. In real life, this woman would have confronted her fiancee immediately and asked him what the hell he was thinking.  For all the talking, socializing, and interaction that went on before the "event" that changed everything, it didn't make a bit of sense that there was no argument or conversation about what actually happened...just a guy acting scared and cowardly and a woman acting pissed and confused. The guide was with his own internal demons, but very much aware of the severity and potential consequences of the "misstep" that happened about half way through the film. I do think this film would have been more relevant and interesting as a short film, but fell short as a full feature.
Got the cards but cheap looking Got a couple ok cards. I would not buy again. I was disappointed and my son.
Fun product but you can get it for around $29 other places. It pays to shop around 'cause this is overpriced.
