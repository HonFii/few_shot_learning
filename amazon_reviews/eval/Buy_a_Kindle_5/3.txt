Well, since many of these reviews are from people who don't even appear to own a Kindle, I'll preface this by saying I have one in my hands, and have been using for a day or so now. I also have a Bookeen Cybook Gen3, so it should be fairly easy to make a nice comparison between the two.Setup was almost non-existent. The device was set up at the factory with all my details, and was even pre-charged. When you open the package, the Kindle is wrapped in a plastic wrapper which explains that you just plug it in and turn it on. I did plug it in, to charge, but in a very short while, the charging light went out, indicating full charge. When I powered it up, after an initial boot sequence, the Kindle owners manual opened. I read thru it, casually skimming the more obvious entries, and paid attention to some of the Kindle unique features.The most striking feature is the scroll bar and cursor wheel. The scroll bar lets you quickly scroll up and down, selecting menus or choosing a position within the book. When you have the menu item selected, you press the cursor wheel, just like a mouse. Navigation was a breeze and took only about 10 minutes to really become proficient.The screen is as expected. E-ink devices are superior displays for these kind of applications. For the nay-sayers who mock lack of backlight or color, I suspect they haven't even tried any e-ink device. Very readable. I haven't tried fonts or anything, because I'm happy with the default fonts for now. There's no eye-strain to speak of. After reading for about an hour, my eyes were no less or more tired than if I were reading a print book. For me, that's not possible on any computer (or PDA) device. The refresh is just too stressful for long periods of reading.The page buttons, on the side of the unit, are interestingly placed. It is easy to mistakenly press a button. While lying in bed (where I do most of my leisure reading), it can be a little awkward to hold the unit without pressing buttons. Coupled with the keyboard and all the buttons, the interface looks more busy than it really is. I hope that this is just part of the learning curve.Ordering a book was fairly easy. If anything, this is where Amazon will win the war. Over-the-air delivery in fast time. I searched for Steven Lawhead's "Merlin" (book 2 of the Pendragon cycle), ordered it, and within a very short time (less than a minute), I was reading my new book. When I was tired of reading, I set it in sleep mode. Sleep mode puts a nice image on the screen, but I wish it would just turn the whole screen off. It never seems to go from sleep to just plain shutdown.I won't go into the DRM issue much. But I do wonder if Amazon will reconsider their relationship with Mobi, or reconsider their decision to support their own DRM'ed format. It's been determined that the AZW format is basically DRM'ed Mobi, but at the moment, there's no way to get one to read the other.There is a USB port, so I tried to download a free (non-DRM) Mobi books. That went fine: download Treasure Island, and just copied to the Kindle. Disconnect the USB port (you can't use the Kindle while the USB is connected), and the book showed up in my content, and I was able to start reading it.The cover is almost useless. It seems to be made for storage, not for usage. The power switch of the Kindle is on the back, so you'd need to remove it from the cover to turn it off and on. There's also a strange plastic shim that appears to attempt to hold the Kindle in the cover. I figure that there will be after-market covers soon.Overall I think I am happy and won't have any bouts of buyers regret. I'll just have to keep careful on which and how many books I buy! This could easily be very costly.
I purchased the Kindle3G electronic book as a Christmas present to myself. I wanted to be done with bookshelves and all the paper books once and for all. When I received it, it pretty much was ready to go! You can add free books and games to the unit and also music! How cool is that? Well the only thing negative I can say about it is, the battery runs down quick if you keep wireless on. Also, kind of hard to manuever around the web sites and normal email programs. Also, I have had to reset the unit twice as it froze up on me and also lost internet capability. All in all, I do really and truly like it. Amazon customer service is very good, the people are professional and answer your questions efficiently and expertly.
I love the price, the 3G + Wifi, and didn't even mind the ads.  They don't interrupt reading at all, not a problem.  The screen, however, is not easy on the eye.  There needs to be a bit more contrast between the words and the background.  There isn't even a brightness adjustment.  I sent it back.  That was a dealbreaker for me as I read in low light a lot and have middle-aged eyes.  But otherwise it's a great reader.  Amazon, please add a brightness adjustment.
it is ok but not worth the extra money ea requires.  Solitaire Buddy is more windows like and intuitive to be a EA game this is disappoinitng
It is okay. I am a great fan of solitaire. I find playing this on my Kindle is slow. But when I am sitting waiting for a doctors appointment or something, I find it is a great distraction.
I don't play this much on my Kindle, it's too hard to see and black and white on the older Kindle.
I was excited about getting this game.  Breezed through the instructions.  On my kindle I cannot &#34;play against the computer.&#34;  So, played both player 1 and player 2.  As something to take my mind off of things this is just OK.  I enjoy my Thread Words game much better.
I normally like scrabble the actual board game, but I think I'd rather not play it on my kindle. Of course I have the average kindle, with the five way, and playing this game on it is very annoying just to put into words and everything.
It is great to have a way to play Scrabble by yourself. Problem is that the computer allows certain rules for itself and not for the player. This is very frustrating. Also, there is no dictionary available to check their word use except 1 word contest which takes your turn. If you have a dictionary handy it is probably more fun to play. This is a conditional recommendation.
Good version of scrabble even on the Kindle. It's harder for me to use since my keyboard is limited. The commands for moving your word around are difficult but otherwise it reflects the classic game just fine. I do like the &#34;best word&#34; feature for when you know you've got a great word but you just can't seem to unscramble it. Careful, you only get three per game, though!
This is a good game. I like it but the game is confusing. When I do newspaper mode like soon when  can put tnat number in it just does not let me. That is all I wanted to say. So buy it. You might like it.
At first, the game was kind of fun and I would play it every so often. But I eventually simply stopped playing this game because it didn't hold any great interest to me. I would recommend it, though, to elementary students as an exercise in reading and language arts.
This game was okay but I didn't love it.  I didn't find it challenging enough so I have't played it very often.
Every Word is a good, fun game. I came across Every Word: Crossings before Every Word, and having got used to Every Word: Crossings I had no idea what Every Word would be like.Every Word's first level was harder for me. Maybe it wasn't that it was hard, but the game got tiring after a few moments. And I was not much a fan of this game. But the reason I gave it four stars is because it wasn't one of those terrible games I've come across and really disliked. But the game was certainly too simple.There had been some times in this game where you think you might just give up, and I think it may be common because what helps you? If you have no idea what one word is, you become frustrated. Sooner or later you might come back to the came thinking, "I've got an idea if what that word may be." and so you type it in, and wait another few moments or so trying to come up with more words. Where do you finnally get to say you've finished a level?Games like this have some promlems, but I wouldn't say they're amateurs. This game was actually a good game, but it is definitely not flawless. There was some times where I thought that this game wasn't good at all, but I think it is actually a fine game.There were some things I am concerned about. First off, a goid thing for all guessing games or so is hints that are helpful, yet don't give away the whole answer. Hints were not used in this game, and that's why I believe it should've  had clues.I think I couldn't  have complained too much about this game since it is free and therefore is not a terrible terrible game. But it can really be improved. A lot of things in this game can easily be improved. But I do think this game is fun and ok to download. After all, it's  free!Gina B. Age 10
Every once in a while I play this, but I  have other games that I prefer to play to kill time.
Another of those I enjoy because they stretch my &#34;wording&#34; abilities.  Obviously, I am a word person and not a number person.  I enjoy the &#34;Relaxed&#34; setting and do this one often at different levels.  Good work.
I chose this game because I love word games and had never played this one before.  It was OK, but just failed to keep my interest and attention for very long.
It is hard to beat the computer but lots of fun on a raining day or in the car.I have only gotten to the 10th level once but I keep trying
I down loaded every word because my husband was bored with his search a word books and he had never used my kindle.  He thought he was too old to use electronic things and didn't want to learn.  Now I think we will have to buy him his own so that I can use mine. It starts easy and then makes you think a little more.  It is a great game to relax for a while.
Every Word is an okay game but much like Shuffled Row making words out scrambled letters gets old quickly. The law of diminishing returns comes into play quickly in Every Word. The objective is to find the longest word on each level. Doing so unlocks the next level.  Scoring is determined by how long a word is. A 3 letter word is worth 60 points,a 4 letter word is worth 90 points,a 5 letter word is worth 140 points,a 6 letter word is worth 220 points,and a 7 letter word is worth 340 points. There are bonuses for finding every word on any given level. These bonuses are: 1000 points on levels 1 and 2,1500 points on levels 3,4,and 5,2000 points on levels 6,7,and 8,and 2500 points on levels 9 and 10. The shortest word on levels 1-4 will be 3 letters and this increase to 4 on levels 5-8 and 5 on levels 9-10. the longest word can be 5-7 letters on any level. No proper nouns such as July,profanities such as s***,or abbreviations such as DVD will appear on the board. Sometimes obscure words will be included and words that you think should be on the board won't be although the game is relatively fair. Overall Every Word starts out pretty fun and then gets old quickly. For a fun word game through and through try Thread Words.
when I had my kindle this game was fun to pass the time away, I would reccomend downloading it good for passing the time away
this game was good to play for a while then I got bored with it and put it aside and didn't play it anymore
this game is more suitable for teenagers and above due to the fact that some words are difficult to come up with. younger children would have no interest with a game like this. The best part is that it was free!
I am not a fan of this game, and I rarely play it.  I downloaded it because it was free.
I really hate timed games and this game was not my favorite. I can't relax when I am recing the clock. I finally deleted it from my Kindle.
It gets a bit boring after a while, and very quickly moved to the bottom of my &#34;recently used&#34; game apps list.Worth a try, since it's cheap (read: FREE), but I don't know if you'll be writing home to the folks about this amazing gaming find, because in the end it's just fun enough, and not totally fun.
Find that it is a lot like scrabble but in a timed format. Can get frustrating with the letters that disappear.
Fun game until you've played it a few times and then it gets a little boring after playing it a few times.
It is an okay game but I feel like it is not challenging enough and in sometimes it is, but there doesn't seem to help with the random words are actually shuffled there is no difference when you randomize and it doesn't help you get more clues.
I downloaded this yesterday along with Every Word.I have to say that I liked Every Word much more than this one.  With that said, it is a neat kind of game although not nearly as relaxed as Every Word.  You have to be really moving your brain to make words out of the given letters before they drop.I guess what I'm happiest about is that both of these games have given me (yet another) excuse to bring my Kindle with me wherever I go.Hey, it's a free download.  So get it for your Kindle and give it a try.
but it is clear to see and easy to work with on Basic Kindle. I play it now and then.  Would buy it again just for the difference in having the game on my Kindle.
This downloaded to my Kindle and Amazon-Kindle without any difficulties. It runs without any faults and the instructions are clear an understandable.
This is a bit more challenging. Takes some time to figure out and its not the easiest game I have ever played.
Shuffled Row is a lightning paced game that is fun to play but that the law of diminishing returns applies to quickly. When the game starts the game row board will show you two letters. Then,1 at a time more letters will present themselves until there are 9. You can choose to speed up this process by tapping a square as it appears. Once the whole row is filled then there can never be more than 9 on the screen. This means that letters will fall off the board without being used if you aren't quick enough. When you submit a word the letters you use come off the board. For example if there are 9 letters on the board and you submit a 5 letter word those 5 letters are removed from the game board and 4 will be left. To get points you make words from 2 to 9 words. Some letters are worth as few as 1 point when used in a qualifying word and others are worth as many as 10. More commonly used letters are worth less points whereas less commonly used letters are worth more points. A multiplier also kicks in if your qualifying word is at least 4 letters. If a qualifying word is at least 4 letters long then your score for that word is multiplied by the number of letters in the word minus 2. Below the game board is your word submitter and below that is a row showing your current score,your highest scoring word and your highest scoring game. The challenge is to submit words that qualify while still going fast enough to use all the letters. There are 60 letters total. If you have no leftover letters at the end of the game and your final word qualifies you get a 10 point "empty rack bonus".  This game is really fun the 1st few times but the law of diminishing returns kicks in quickly. (As opposed to Thread Words,to which the law of diminishing returns doesn't seem to apply at all.) This is a fun game to play a few times every once in awhile but not every day. 3 out of of 5 stars.
I didn't really like this game that much. It was just ok. I think this would be hard for children.
I like it however the letters have no rhyme or reason and ususally when the letter you really need arrives the rest of the letters have timed out.
So you're waiting for your mother at the doctor's office and the appointment is droaning on, but you have your Kindle.  This will keep you occupied better than will the 1969 issues of &#34;National Geographic&#34;, &#34;Fortune&#34;, and &#34;Gold Investors&#34; magazines.Not a particularly fun puzzle game in my estiation, but it is something to do.
My child love it, and to see the smile on her face as she play it, is good enough for me.
Not having a touch-screen or a mouse makes this game a bit more labor intensive than the original game but the creators of this game seem to have come up with a pretty good work-around for that problem.
... pretty much as you remember it from your pc. However, the gameplay is easier and better with a mouse. Play it on your pc or your cellphone.
I don't quite understand how you play it yet, but it's free, so if I decide that I don't want it anymore, then when I delete it I won't be wasting money.written by Andrew Donofrio
i like it but when i first tried it i kept getting bombs after my first move you could make it easyer cause i am nine and it was hard for me. : (
Okay folks.  If you like playing Minesweeper on your PC, you will recognize this game when you get it for your Kindle.  The operations are the same and it can be just as challenging.If you have any hopes of besting your PC times at any of the levels, you will be disappointed.  Using the dreaded cursor on the Kindle, it takes a bit to move around.  Of course, an added element of excitement comes into play because you never know when the Kindle is going to interpret a cursor "move" as a cursor "push" blasting you out of existance.Not as much fun as EveryWord but it is a free download so you can't beat that.
What more can be said about a classic game that has been around since Windows 3.1 or 3.11? (Can't remember) Anyways you click on a blank grid space to see if you get blown up. Rinse and repeat. Can you beat my best time on Hard of 3 minutes and 12 seconds? Good luck.
Entertaining when I have to wait in line or have time to waste.  It keeps my mind engaged and my kids like it also if I need to occupy their time!  My dad is addicted!
While I always found this game really easy to play on the computer and loved it growing up, it is slightly more difficult to play on your Kindle and can become rather frustrating.
Certainly exactly the minesweeper of decades gone by. Just not my cup of tea so I wouldn't say too much more.
It is as mine sweeper usually is- addictive, mind-numbing, time killing uselessness that you cannot stop playing.  It works well and does what you expect it to do, which is great.  No thrills here, though.
It's mine sweeper, just the way you remember it.  This platform works fine.  It's fairly mind numbing, if that's what you're going for.
This game was ok. Kind of hard to play on my kindle, but it was good. Especially cause it was free.
It's just not as much fun as I thought it would be.  I use games to veg out.  So it probably isn't the game, just me.
I hate this game. Maybe I am dumb for not getting it, but I don't think so. I love a challenge but this is awful.
When I first did a review of the original Kindle 1 (without buying it), it was as a skeptical, non-believing e-book cynic who doubted much about the concept. As the reviews poured in and people raved, when the Kindle 2 came out, and I was scheduled to travel (I hate carrying heavy books), I bit and purchased the K2-3G before going overseas. Since then, I've been a Kindle Believer/Fanatic and think it's one of the greatest electronic products ever designed in history. Amazon actually was able to IMPROVE upon the book, one of the most basic and important inventions of all time, and Amazon made it better! Amazing. Plus, Amazon actually makes products and services that offer value and don't try to bankrupt you, like Apple Corporation does.So, my K2-3G was awesome, and the international coverage worked like a charm when I was overseas in Asia. I was so happy with the K2, I didn't feel an urgent need to upgrade to Kindle Keyboard/K3 last year. My mom got a K3 Kindle Keyboard 3G, so I was able to play around with it a bit and thought it was awesome -- but I still didn't need to upgrade yet.I have been eagerly awiting Amazon's introduction of the new Kindle lineups and Kindle Tablet. When the announcement was made with the press conference/presentation, I excitedly watched the presentation and wow! The new Kindles and Kindle Fire are awesome! Jeff Bezos was so great/awesome at the presentation, he was about 100 times better than the sad sack overcharging carnival barker Steve Jobs. Watching Bezos deliver the announcements and introduction is something you should Google if you haven't seen it. It's fun.Bezos-awesomeness aside, however, the new Kindles do apparently have some problems, and that's what I am addressing in my Kindle reviews. Or rather, how to improve upon the new Kindles.I chose to buy the new Kindle Touch 3G, which will arrive in the next two days. However I was sorely tempted to order this Kindle 4 Basic instead, just based of its ultralight/ultrasmall sub-6 oz. coolness factor. Ultimately though, I wanted to be able to 'Touch' for word definitions, use the X-Ray feature, and download internationally when overseas through the excellent 100-country 3G. Kindle Touch 3G also has problems of its own, which I will address in that upcoming review.As far as the Kindle 4 Basic, I find the following faults and solutions:1. No 'Touch' for word defintion. Amazon should come out with a 5.98 oz Kindle with Touch for convenience, except ALSO keep the 4 separate Page-Forward/Back buttons that many of us love so much.2. No X-Ray. X-Ray is going to be an awesome feature when fully integrated into Kindle books. The fact that you can't get X-Ray on the Kindle 4 Basic is a big problem for prospective buyers like me who lust for X-Ray.3. No 3G. Obviously. But, really, why the heck can't Amazon offer a 6.2 oz. Kindle 4 Basic with 3G? Some of us really need it and want it.4. Bad keyboard functionality. The Kindle 4 Basic is really slow for text input. Again, if they came out with a Kindle 6.2 oz with Touch, but kept the Page Turn buttons, then we could use the Touch for the keyboard input. Obviously Amazon will continue to make the future Kindles smaller and lighter and better, but this would have been nice. Ah, the frustrations of technology! :)I will be updating this review as I think of more ideas and information and fully test drive my Kindle Touch 3G. There's a good chance I will also buy one of these Kindle 4 Basic's, but I wanted to share my ideas about Kindle Basic because I was so close to ordering it and I still really think its 5.98 oz lightness and smallness is so cool.Anyway, Kindle is really an awesome line of products. As I said, the fact that Amazon actually improved upon the physical book -- and in a significant, dramatic way -- is pretty incredible! Kindles are actually several times better than reading ordinary physical books -- Amazing!Personally imo Jeff Bezos deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, much more than Obama. LOL. (warmongers get Nobel Peace Prizes??) LOL. Anyway, I'll continue to buy Kindles, and I have no plans to make any donations to the Nobel committee. Later! :))***Update: I lowered my Amazon Review Rating here to 3 Stars, based on advice and the fact that obviously the whole Kindle line still needs many improvements and adjustments, no matter how awesome they are already. Also, please see my review of the Kindle Touch 3G which is the model I ended up buying. Thanks.
I received mine this morning... I have a K3 (Kindle Keyboard), and LOVE it!  Best feature:  fabulous screen.  I wear glasses and can read on it for hours.  I also enjoy a number of the games available on the K3.  I ordered this Kindle owing to the weight, and the fact that I was told that it was the same screen and same clarity as my K3.  My intent was to use the new device simply when I'm running around, since the K3 is somewhat cumbersome for that.Here's what I see on the new one:SCREEN AND SCREEN CLARITY:The screen appears to be more reflective, and "glare-y".  This surprised me.  I was in my office earlier today, and unless I positioned the device correctly, the overhead lights obliterated the screen (as in it couldn't be read at all in that position).  I've never had this issue with my K3.The contrast between the letters and background is not as sharp to me as the K3.  I'm not sure I'm going to be able to live with this.  Many reviewers have commented on the infrequent "screen refresh" which appears to speed up the page turns.  I also think the letters appear to fade with each page turn prior to the refresh.  ** Update: I just spent some time looking at this... the background of the screen on the K3 appears lighter than the new screen, so the contrast is not as crisp on the new screen. I often read the K3 at night in a dark room with an MEdge booklight.  I don't think I can do so on the new one. ***** Update 10/3/11:  After a few days of use, I've noticed lots of "ghosting" on the screen. When certain screensavers come on, you can see the letters on the screen from the page you just read through the screensaver image.  I've shown this to two people who stated that it looked like the letters were burned into the screen.  Also, within a page of a book, there are lines of text which appear lighter than the others (in one case, three lines in the middle of the page appeared faded...I believe this to also be a ghosting effect).  In addition, some of the text appears to have faded tops, and "pixelated" images, appearing to be dotty.  All in all, there is no comparison to the K3 screen.... the K3 is far superior. (By the way, this is after the software update which enabled screen refresh on each page).***Also, font size has been changed in places where you cannot fix it (home page), and in some cases it is really tiny (like percent of the book read when you are reading).If vision is an issue to you, heads up.GAMES:I called and asked before I purchased.  I was told they would all transfer.  NOT TRUE. In fact, the ONLY games which work are the ones provided by Amazon.  Here's what you should do if this is an issue to you:Look at your account through your Manage Your Kindle screen.  Scroll down and see how many of your games are labeled "Amazon Digital Services". IF NOT, they will not download to this Kindle.  Only 2 of my 15 games would download.KEYBOARD / 5 WAY:The keyboard is well designed and quick, however, it is a pain if you have to type anything, regardless of how short.  Too cumbersome, and too many keystrokes involved.The 5 way in my opinion is in the wrong place.  Without a keyboard, this is "the key" for many functions.  I have large hands, and have to stretch my thumb to reach it.  After just sitting in Starbucks for 15 minutes registering my Kindle, my thumb was literally hurting from the reach and the constant pressing.  You now need it for simple things like bookmarks: to bookmark, you have to press the menu key, scroll with the 5 way, press to add a bookmark.WEIGHT:Great.  I throw this in my purse in a neoprene sleeve, and you don't feel the weight.STORAGE:I didn't care, since my intent was only to use this device for running around.  However, I only downloaded 25 items (of approx 300 on my device), and I noticed that I only have 1,295M remaining on the device (so .7G is already gone... not sure where!)SPECIAL OFFERS:Wasn't sure I'd like them.  I'm OK with it on the screen saver.... not so much on the home page.  I do find it distracting, and it did increase the length of my list (The device moved 2 entries per page to the next page to make room for the banner).BUT:  I just used my first offer and got a $9.00 mystery from an author I like for $1.00.  Guess I'm going to live with the special offers.The new screen savers were beautiful, though.  I hated to lose them in favor of the special offers! (it would be nice to be able to rotate both!.... just a thought!)BOTTOM LINE:I purchased this simply for running around, and the weight/size is great.  The screen and the position of the 5 way will be the two deciding issues.  If I find that I fatigue reading it, then it will have to go back.  I'm also disappointed by the game issue.  This should be disclosed, and I specifically called and asked before I purchased the device and was given incorrect information.Kindle Light?  Yes, very.Kindle Lite?  Yes, very, particularly with the game issue!
The game is fun to play.  You can feel good to purchase the game as it is exciting and okay for a purchased game.
It is a good game, but it is more fun to slay zombies and play poker! But it is good for just poker.
I have trouble understanding this game. Hard to get through the levels. But it is a challenge and I like that
The game might be more fun if I were playing on something other than Kindle's base model.  It's fiddly, and that gets old quick.
Not the most exciting game after playing it a few times but it is not bad.  I do go back to it every once in awhile.
I am not used to poker much but it was a good experience and I sometimes still play it. I would recommend it to a person who loves poker!!
Bought this to entertain myself on long trip with my new Kindle.  Enjoyed the games, sometimes it gives you the wrong advise on how to play your hand but I've started doing what I thought best and not what it suggested....Fun game....
Hardly play this one.  got it because it was free, but other than solitaire, I am not a fan of electronic card games.
It is a good game for your kindle, I like the way it keep the score for you. Thank you
I don't really enjoy this app that well.  I think it could have been set up a little differently.  But others might enjoys this.
Enjoy playing when there is nothing else availabe.  The game would probably be more enjoyable if I had the Kindle Fire, which would show the game in color.
The game is ok, but not near as fun as real poker. I'm afraid I find it boring after awhile.
It was okay however kind of frustrating because you can't change what kind of poker you playI don't know if I would recommend this to anyone
Another one of those games that is what it is.  If you love slots and casino games, this one is great.
Selected this game because it's one of my favorite to play when I go to the casino.  However, it just didn't turn out to be what I expected.  Reaction time of the game was too slow and I just didn't enjoy playing it as much as I thought I would.
This game is very slow and boring for me.  My mind goes much faster then the game.  I don't play it very much
If I could learn to play this game well, I would like it more. But for the beginners, here are some tips I picked up:On the bottom of the screen there is a row of things that look like buttons. They tell you what Kindle keyboard button(s) to press to hold the card directly above them. (Hope this helps anyone who had problems with that, see other reviews)Look at the tips if you're just learning. They tell you what cards are good to hold, and I guess the Kindle doesn't go wrong!I really can't think of more, and I'll edit if I remember more.
Overall, the game does what it is supposed to do: replicates one of the video poker bandits with the standard Jacks or better to win, etc.  If that kind of game is your cup of tea, you'll probably like it especially considering the free price vs. paying something for it.The main drawback is the game is pretty slow - you select the cards you want to keep and press the button, and nothing happens.  You press it again, then you get your draw cards - all with a noticable delay that is kind of annoying.  However, it didn't seem to bother my third grader who played many hands before finally putting the Kindle down.
This is just another version of poker.  I like to play for awhile and then I am tired to the game.
I don't really know how to play poker and I thought this may be a good way to learn. Besides, I just love wasting time on my kindle. This game is not very interactive, however. You are not playing against the machine, as I had expected. I understand that it is difficult to make complex games for kindle readers, though. The most useful feature is a list of what hands give the most points, but I've still come away from this game without a clear understanding of it.
Not a game for those who like to be challenged.  But something to pass the time.  I'll play it sometime.
A good way to pass the time and enjoy yourself.A good way to play digital poker and have some fun
this is a great game. although the screen flashes with every deal and gets annoying, but i feel like the in-game advice is to help the game not the player! i lose more money by following the advice.
Works well. This is a card matching game. It has ten different layouts. It is a good game for the end of a day to aid in slowing your brain down before bed.
I think I would have liked this game a lot better it I had the Kindle Fire so it would be in color.  Tiles are small.  This isn't to discourage someone from getting the game.  I'm going to keep playing the game - maybe I'll get more used to no color and the small tiles.
Got time to waste, can't sleep? This is a good option. Simple game with enough options to keep it interesting. The only downside is the tiny tile sets you end up with on a Kindle.
This is an interesting game that could still use some improvements.  Specifically, (1) the screen image moves slower than the controller inputs, so it's easy to overshoot your target and select the wrong tile; (2) Occasionally with some of the formats, a section of tiles becomes unreachable, at least for a period of time, so that you cannot complete the moves you would like to make; (3) Sometimes, the controller reacts oddly -- if you overshoot to the left, for example, by one tile, correcting to the right by one tile doesn't always fix the problem, but instead sends the cursor in a different direction; (4) The game includes a "Record time" screen for each of the 10 game layouts.  For reasons unknown, two of the ten now show that a game was completed in 1 second, and another in 9 seconds -- obviously impossible -- but there doesn't seem to be any way to cancel out the time log and start over with new record times.  (Average time to complete a game is 13-16 minutes, depending upon the tile layout.)Later update: The scorekeeping is weird.  Occasionally a fast time that's been recorded just disappears from the list and is replaced by a different time.  In addition, most of the game scores are now shown as just a couple of seconds - and these erroneous phantom scores never seem to disappear or get replaced by real numbers.  There doesn't appear to be any way to reset the score times and start over.Other than these issues, the game has variety and interest, and can be a great and addictive time waster --
I usually love to play mahjong solitaire, but when downloaded to a black & white screen device with a keypad (rather than touch screen), playing was difficult at best.  I will try again when I upgrade my device to a color touch screen.
The screens are hard to see and the tiles are way to small for the size of the Kindle screen.  Some of the games have glitches, the screen says you have 10 matches when there are only 4 tiles left on the screen to play, for example.  The hint button is useless most of the time, the tiles don't match the hint.
It's just not my kind of fun game. Maybe those that gamble would like this better. The price is right.
Easy to play game but it is very dull and not interesting for the player.  Good thing it was free as I would be disappointed if I had to pay for it.
In addition to reading, I enjoy playing games like this on my Kindle.  This one is both challenging and satisfying.
this is your average blackjack game.  its nice if you are bored and have nothing else to do.  If you are into black jack then you should enjoy this.
On kindle fire -  Fun to play as always. App seems to work well. This is a good time passing game.
I like blackjack and I guess this is an ok game, but I just don't find it interesting enough to keep my attention.
It's Blackjack.... You get the higher card numbers without going above 21 you win, the dealer gets the higher card numbers without going above 21 you lose.
If you own a Kindle, you know it is a great device for reading books.  It also displays some diversity in terms of some of the word games and such that have become available in the recent months.  See my review for EveryWord.While it is a little fun to do something on the Kindle other than just plain ol' reading, the bottom line is that in these early versions, the Kindle is not the best device in the world to play these kinds of games.The 2nd generation's 5 way controller is just too finicky for these games.  Also, every "deal" is accompanied by several flashes as parts of the screen refresh.  Distracting at first, annoying after 20 minutes or so of play.As a free download it is an okay thing to have on my Kindle.  I wouldn't pay to download it though.
This game is okay when you have nothing to do and do not want to get really into a game as you are waiting or what ever. It isn't my favorite to do though.
I'm not really sure why I got this one.  It is OK I guess.  My husband probably likes it more than me.
Had it for my paperwhite kindle that I just sold. It was a great time killer and I learned a lot about B.J. and now the next person who bought it from me asked that it be installed.
I like black jack and this fits the bill.  Easy to use.  If you like games of chance this is a good game.
Again, this game is too slow for me.  I don't play it very miuch.  I fimd it boring.  My mind is faster then the game.
I guess black jack just isn't as much fun without betting.  I didn't really like this game, it was boring.  I deleted it from my devise already.
This is a great free Kindle game both for people who enjoy playing blackjack and for people who have never played before.  The game offers many helpful hints and explanations to help you learn the ways of the game.  A few times on this, and you'll be a pro in Vegas!
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY MUCH FUN AS I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE. IT DOESN'T KEEP ME THAT MUCH INTERESTED IN IT.
I have played this game several times.  It is just boring to me.  Its a card game ...some times they are just boring.
Blackjack for the Kindle is a much better game then the Video Poker that is also offered.  It is just like the classic casino game and the play moves pretty quickly.  Nothing special or exciting about the game, just straight up betting like the real game. If you love to play Blackjack, this free game is a lot of fun.
Never played this one. It was a mis-delivery. I'm sure though that since I've played at the table before, that the concept is still the same and that the game is good. Surely recommended for someone with some time to kill.
This game is ok. I don't see it as a highly played game in my list but it is fun to beat the house occassionally.
I am not much of a gambler but I do like to play just for fun.  I loose a lot but it is the fun that matters.  I don't play very often because I am more of a reader that games.
Not as good as the one on facebook.  Has some things not quite sure what they are.  Still fun to play.
There's a small amount of strategy you can involve - primarily in where you place the jokers, which can replace any card on your board.  Mostly, you're at the mercy of the game's selection of new numbers for the final results.  The more jokers that turn up, the higher your final score is probably going to be.So if I just have to waste 10-15 minutes I may turn to Slingo as an alternative to Mah Jong, which I rated one star higher.
Because it's a little young for me, and after awhile it gets boring....Can I send it to someone else that has a Kindle?
This is an okay game to play, but there is not anything exciting about it.  The games are all basically the same game, just with different numbers.  It is very much like bingo; the game does not have much nuance.  But, within those limits, it is fun.
Bought for an older black & white Kindle with keyboard (no touch screen).  Would probably work better on a newer color touch screen device.
It's ok, not good but not bad. It's very short, and the writing is pretty amateurish with very limited choices. I got it for a buck and played with it for an hour or two.
It is a decent game but very hard to see what properties are what on the Kindle.  I think it would be better if they didn't try to show the whole gameboard at once.
Fun but a bit slow and hard to figure out the trading. It was okay for the price I paid.
This game is just like the board game and all the fun that comeswith it.  However it seems a bit slow at times.  But I enjoy itall the same.
Three stars is probably harsh since I can't quit playing the stupid thing.  I'm amazed when the AI's will trade a standalone utility for my third railroad..even up!  Pick up one of the Green lots and trade for a cyan and orange, plus cash. Even when it gives me a Monopoly!  I've won 70% of games going against 3 "Hard" AI's each round. Slow response on Kindle DX (original)causing me to occasionally give an extra five-way push or two.So why have I played 113 games in 4 weeks?  I just can't stop!!  The most addictive game I've played since Civ II.  That may be the real reason I only give it 3 stars.  What a time-waster.
Playing a familiar game on Kindle seems like a lot of fun.  The multi-functionality of an e-reader makes it that much more valuable. Having variety in reading as well as games is a great idea.  That said, here are Monopoly's strong and weak points.Pros* The game is already familiar to you.* It can be played alone or with a partner(s)-- a bit awkward due to its size* The graphics are sharp and clear* Its size and weight make it ideal to take along in a briefcase or purseCons* Despite knowing the concept of the game, it is not quite the same as when played on a board* The lack of color is bothersome--and this has not been an issue for anything else I've read/played on Kindle* Using the tiny 5-way button slows down the game* Buying properties cannot be done in multiples as in board-played Monopoly* There are not large sums of cash involved as when playing on the boardIf my Kindle's capacity were an issue and if I needed to delete something to create more storage space, this would definitely be the first item to be dumped.Should future generations of Kindle introduce color (not the one currently sold and used to read textbooks), offer increased speed of play, and a different way to make transactions, I would seriously reconsider owning it.
review is for kindle keyboard.  ai trade offers annoying.  one railroad for me and a monopoly for the ai.  i do not think so.  and it makes the same offer over and over.  in regular play it must not be too smart as i have beat it eight games out of nine so far at ai hard.  auctions and managing properties clunky.  visuals ok.  i must like it pretty well though.  i played nine games and bothered to write a review.....
Unlike "Every Word" or "Thread Word" which gives you an unlimited set of games "Word Search" doesn't provide that capability. Once you have solved the limited number of boards it's over. To continue I must buy volumes 2, 3, ... For a $1 I can buy a book of these puzzles and there are more puzzles in the book than in the game. My choice is to buy the book at my local drugstore or grocery store. I won't buy the next volume of the game.Disappointed.
It's the 2nd word search app I've played on Kindle Touch. There are 50 puzzles, all have 13x13 girds, 17--24 words per puzzle. Works quite well, but needs improvements in UI.What I like:1. Plays quite well on Kindle Touch.2. Puzzle screen is clear and simple.3. There is timer with pause option.4. Playing on Kindle Touch is intuitive - you can touch-n-drag or press-n-press.5. Good short instructions.What I would like to see improved:1. There are only 50 puzzles, without categories. I'd like to play more challenges in paid app.2. No hints - they would be very useful for such puzzles.3. Have find bug in one puzzle and do not know how app is buggy in fact... In "Barman" puzzle have find "GIN" word in very top-left corner on the grid, but it's not possible to highlight this word, because in solution it's placed in other place in the grid. App should be tested more carefully, maybe with the help of script...4. There are only 13x13 grids - would like to play another sizes, especially smaller ones.5. App does not remembers my last played puzzle. I.e. after I close app on some puzzle and launch app again - there is list screen instead of last viewed puzzle. It takes time to find last played puzzle or even it's not possible to remember what puzzle you have solved.6. There is timer on each puzzle, but there is no time identification (how much time I've spent for each puzzle) in the list of puzzles.7. List of puzzles looks like standard Kindle list, but to scroll it you need to swipe left/right, but not up/down - quite confusing.Note: you can play app on Kindle, Kindle Touch, Kindle Keyboard, Kindle DX and Kindle (2nd Generation) devices.In overall - good app if you are a BIG fun of word search puzzles, otherwise - you can be confused by some elements of the app.
I really don't like it.  It takes too much time.  I don't enjoy it in a printed book that much
I do enjoy the game.  Sometimes it will not accept what I have put in and takes several tries.  This is okay unless you are trying to increase you time in finding words and completing the puzzle.
The amount of puzzles is not big enough before you have blasted through them all and you are finished with this volume
Fun for a young person who you want to distract while you drive them to the dentist loolAll in all its ok but short shelf life
OK, the accusations of this game "cheating" have gone WAY BEYOND COMPLETELY ABSURD AND RIDICULOUS!!!!!NINE OF YOU that are apparently unwilling or incapable of reading instructions or accepting the fact that a simple 5 minute procedure COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY proves this game does NOT CHEAT.This is NOT A MATTER OF OPINION.IT IS A FACT!!!!!!Would a single ONE of you NINE PEOPLE (over a QUARTER of the reviewers!!!!!!!!!!) please answer just ONE of these 4 questions for me:1. Do you have ANY understanding (however small) of the laws of probability? (BTW so-called "laws" because there is no "law" that dice have to do anything) Do they absolutely forbid an opponent (real or Kindle) from getting a lucky series of rolls???? Throwing more doubles then you? Going first in 7 or 8 straight games? (Funny how the people who have been blessed with luck "over" the Kindle aren't here complaining that the dice aren't random, isn't it? )2. HOW IN THE WORLD is the Kindle "setting the roll to what it wants" if you can see ALL the rolls ahead of time before the game is being played??????3. What reason or motivation does the programmer for this game have to make it cheat????? (As a professional programmer myself, I can assure you it would make his job HARDER, not EASIER.)4. Why is it that I, who have played backgammon for over 30 years have won over 80% of the matches against a Kindle program that "so blatantly" cheats?There you have it. NINE of you. FOUR QUESTIONS for you to chew on and digest. Let's see if I get any response from any of you. I somehow doubt it.And now for those of you that are actually capable of understanding FACTS and are contemplating buying this:First the good: The graphics and ease of use are probably as good as you're going to get on a Kindle.You can set the number of points you want a match to be, and you *can* use the doubling cube.The game always makes proper legal moves (sadly, I once had a handheld game that about 25% of the times you rolled doubles got totally confused about the board position and who had what pieces from that point on).But.....The AI, even at "expert" level leaves a LOT to be desired. It plays very uninspiring, mostly stacking pieces on already made points, and continually putting checkers out of play. It very rarely doubles and usually by then it should be playing on for a gammon. Even worse, it takes a lot of doubles it should be dropping. It HAS won a match here and there against me, but not many.I don't see any advantage it has over the many computer programs available or internet play. But then again to be fair the Kindle doesn't have the processing power of a computer either and if you're reading this it's because you want something that DOES run on the Kindle. Well presently it's your only option for backgammon and despite an AI that needs some work it does what it purports to do. I'd go for it.Now, a special message to the 7 people who have accused this game of cheating as well as anyone else who believes that or will post said nonsense in the future:For starters if the Kindle is "cheating" why can't it seem to actually win matches against me? And what is it's motivation for doing so? Are you people playing against it for money?But more importantly here is a FACT which I fail to understand why so many of you simply cannot wrap your head around:If you look at the instructions that are included WITH THE GAME it will give you a sequence of steps. Follow that sequence and you can see ALL the dice rolls the Kindle will use before the game begins.Yes, you are reading that correctly. Let's say it again.YOU CAN SEE ALL AND I MEAN ALL THE ROLLS THE GAME WILL USE BEFORE THE GAME BEGINS. ALL OF THEM. I REALLY MEAN ALL OF THEM. THAT'S RIGHT, EVERY SINGLE ONE.Yes, ALL OF THEM.Opening Rolls. Doubles. Rolls the Kindle will have. Rolls you will have.ALL OF THEM.I don't know what part of ALL OF THEM you seven people are not getting.ALL THE ROLLS.Now, imagine this:A new car comes out. There are 23 reviews for it. SEVEN of the reviews give it ONE STAR saying "You can't start the car. I tried starting it with the round key and it won't start. Since the car won't start, don't buy it."We remind them you need to use the SQUARE key, not the ROUND one. And it CLEARLY SAYS THAT in the owner's manual.One person replies to our comments with: "I read the owner's manual. I still couldn't start the car with the round key. I doubt I'll try to start the car again. The only way you can convince me a key will start the car is if you take the lock apart and show it to me".Another says: "Since when do I have to read the owner's manual to know that the car won't start with the round key? I'm returning the car. My recommendation to the car's manufacturer is to install a lock that is connected to the ignition and I will buy it again".Still another says: "I'm a new driver and I DID have trouble starting the car with the round key. I haven't tried other cars yet to see if the ignition has a lock which you can insert a round key into to start it".And even out of the non-critical reviews a few say: "I had no issues starting the car. I can't say for sure which key I used though, it may well not have been the round one. Probably though, the one star reviews are a case of people who can't tell the difference between square and round".Do you see now why I have turned this review into a soapbox? It's not 1 or 2 people spouting this nonsense. IT'S ALMOST A FULL ONE THIRD OF THE REVIEWERS.Now please fellow reviewers, if you're too lazy to read instructions and follow a 10 minute series of steps which is IRREFUTABLE PROOF that this game DOES NOT CHEAT then  at least have the courtesy of letting someone who is contemplating buying the game do so BASED ON ITS ACTUAL MERITS not nonsense that you post because you don't have the SLIGHTEST clue about the laws of probability and/or how the game obtains the dice rolls.I cannot explain it any better than this and yet I am sure someone else will still accuse the game of cheating. I feel bad for the game's creator(s). Sure, criticize a product based on what it actually does or doesn't do (and I seem to recall I did exactly that above before I threw a temper tantrum). But when so many people slam it based on totally inaccurate information SOMEBODY has to say something....
you can play either one or two player games set to the degree of difficulty you want.  Freezes up/sticks in places, it also doesn't always acknowledge the piece you are touching or where you want it to go.
It is OK.  I suppose if I play it more I will learn the game and like it more.  But, it confuses me, I just don't get it.  REad the instructions maybe?  Were they available?  Not always and maybe that is why I haven't read them.
It took me all of 10 minutes to finish the puzzles. I will just continue working the ones in the paper and online.
I loved the puzzles and the Kindle implementation, but my Kindle went haywire after using this application (trouble awakening, screening fading to black dots, frozen up, etc.).  Not sure if this was the culprit, but I haven't had the problem before using these puzzles, nor since deleting the puzzles.Update as of 12/31/10:  Still haven't had problems since I stopped using the puzzles.  After reading some of the Solitaire reviews, it appears people had exactly the same issues with that game.Happy New Year to all!and one more update... 6/15/11: Still haven't replcated the problem since I deinstalled these puzzles.  Not once.  FYI.
did not realize it was only three puzzles, but it did prompt me to get more.  a good way to wet a user's appetite.
Didn't do much for me--just like the ones I do in the newspaper.  Of course it was free and that was good.
Not enough puzzles yes there's three but they could be longer then they are. I beat all three within one hour.
I didn't order more puzzles.  I loved working these puzzles in the newspapers years ago.  I wish this had more to it than it does.  I think you have to buy more to get more out of it.  But I did enjoy working the puzzles that are included.
Not sure why I felt the need to yell. But this is a set of jumbles. If you like the game you will probably like them as the interface is pretty simple and standard. But yeah its just really only three and hardly seems worth the price of admission (I know its free but still you have to click and download, time is money people!)
It doesn't have the most amazing look and feel, but it's fun and there are enough options to keep you challenged. It's a good game to keep on your Kindle for those times when you're just looking for something to help you pass a few minutes.
decent game for a bit of fun but overall it has a short shelf life and quickly loses its base enjoyment
OK. The crosswords are fun and easy. But the tiny reader screen is a poor format for them. Too small. Fingers too large. You make lots of errors simply because you hit the wrong square by accident. Then you have to delete, delete, delete... Or you go up when you want to down. And forget about speed. What takes you 10 minutes with pen and paper might take three times as long on the Kindle. Somewhat of a pain. What should be fun becomes irritating.
This is fun to play and keeps my mind busy. I really enjoy this game and the chllenge . .
Would have been a five star review, if not for the speed.  There are things I like about the puzzles:  having the current clue and number of letters at the top, for example.  I found the navigation to be extremely slow... I was continually waiting for the cursor to "jump" to the next square before I could continue (and then I noticed that there is a timer running... seems like a waste of Kindle memory and since their delays are lengthening the time, why include a timer?).Note that if you are a crossword enthusiast, the puzzles in this particular collection are extremely easy.  They are OK if you just want to fill in an easy puzzle, but not what I would have expected from a New York Times puzzle collection.  (This collection is a set of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday puzzles, so they are the earliest/easiest in the week's collection.)Even at $1.99, I will wait for a more interesting collection of puzzles before investing the time in light of the navigation delays.Update:  1/1/11:  Happy New Year!  I haven't opened the app since I wrote this review, owing to the speed, and will not purchase others unless performance can be improved.
I have not been able to complete even one of these crossword puzzles.  They are a little beyond my knowledge.
I am just about finished with this volume of NY Times Crossword puzzles. First of all, these are some dated puzzles. The knowledge clues might stump some younger players. But, the puzzles are easy, so you can work around that problem. Actually, I would describe the puzzles as "too easy." And, with this level of ease, I either want to rip through a puzzle or move on to another one without completing the first... you know, out of boredom. But, forget speed. Speed does not exist in the Kindle universe - at least, not in the Kindle Touch universe. I love my Kindle Touch for reading books. Just tap, and your book sort of drifts from one page to the next. But drifting doesn't work for crossword puzzles. Sometimes, too, the Kindle gets slower and slower and eventually freezes altogether. Then you have to perform the whole restart thing. Also, there's the constant changing back and forth from horizontal to vertical. And with the Touch, the keyboard is on the same page as the puzzle, which makes the puzzle very small and you strain your eyes trying to see the words. This smallness makes a stylus an absolute necessity. I don't own a stylus, so I used a pencil eraser that I rounded off with a kitchen grater. Sometimes you are typing a word... for example, BIRD. You hit the letter "I" and it prints three "I"s. So then you have to delete. The multiple-letter-in-one square thing is also a bit unclear. I, for example, completed a puzzle in which the theme was "in or out." I put the words "IN/OUT" into all the correct squares. But the kindle told me there were multiple errors in those squares. Turns out I should have written "IO," not "IN/OUT." Not earth shattering maybe, but irritating. So I had to delete delete delete and replace the words with "IO" in order to score 100%. And don't bother to look at your completion times. What might take you ten minutes in the newspaper might take fifty minutes on your Kindle, what with all the deletions, changing directions, restarts, etc. OK, having written all that, the NY Times puzzles are still the most fun and I'm looking forward to Thursday, Friday and Saturday - and maybe to getting a Kindle Fire when I can afford one. Hopefully, that will speed things up.
It's OK is the definition of a 3-star review. For the price, of course, you can't beat it, and It will be a while before I run out of puzzles. Presumably, they increase in difficulty, with the easiest being Monday to Sunday being the hardest. The squares and the print for the clues are quite small, no adjusting the size as far as I can tell, so if you like to adjust your reading font size to medium or large, this game is not for you. But that is not why I deducted two stars from my rating.The problem is that it acts funny, and I don't mean funny ha ha. When you first open a puzzle, you see all the clues but when you select the keyboard icon to start typing in answers, you are given only a narrow range in either down or across clues, depending on where you are in the grid. OK, so far ... but now it gets tricky. For some reason, when the clues I am reading are &#34;down&#34; the direction the puzzle wants to go is across, and vice versa. Yes, you can switch direction, so I choose to go down, the clues now are &#34;across.&#34; This makes it hard, but not impossible, to fill in answers. Either you select one square at a time for the word you are typing or, if the puzzle is going one way and you remember the clue or know the answer, you can just go ahead and type, and the cursor will advance itself to the next blank space.As I said, it is not impossible to play this way, only more convoluted than it should be - which is not a problem for me, since I use my Kindle games as time wasters anyway ... I suppose this complication makes this puzzle function more effectively, then, wouldn't it.Another thing that puzzles me (no pun intended) is that, when I opened the game for the very first time, it showed the instructions for how to navigate the grid, but instructions do not mean anything to me until I have an idea of what I am dealing with, so I went directly to the puzzles to first see how intuitive the process was. Now that I would like to refine my knowledge of how the game works, I am unable to get back to the instructions. I guess they want to tell you only once and, if you miss it, that's just too bad.If someone can tell me where to find what I need to push to get back to the instructions it would be appreciated. Either that or tell me what to do to get the clues and the direction of the puzzle back in sync. Otherwise, I will keep on playing; it just means that the puzzle is a bigger waste of time than I had bargained for - which, ultimately, might actually be a good thing.
The text and replies are a little snarky, not at all the kind of CYOA that I like. It still ended up being entertaining, but the entire thing seemed very rushed.If you bought it while it was at 99c...you get what you pay for.
It's okay - calculations don't flow easily but could just need to use it more and practice the steps suggested.
I like tic tac toe and playing it with my grandchildren. It's a challenge for them and fun when they beat grandma.
Grand daughter enjoys playing this and she can play with me or by herself.  It is good for little ones.
My review is going to be similar to what I said about the Backgammon game (and I was somewhat disappointed with that and went and bought this anyway :-(  )It's a playable chess game for the Kindle. It's easy to move pieces, you just select the piece and then the square you want to put it on. And the "kindle" opponent makes somewhat decent moves without a long computational delay. And unlike the backgammon game it does allow you to play another "human", handy for when you don't have a set with you.And that is about all it has going for it.I had the level as high as possible and it seemed to like to move it's queen around without developing other pieces. Yes, it DID win, but I'm a moron at chess. I doubt anybody with any tournament experience would have much trouble with this.As another reviewer mentioned, it does not vary it's opening play AT ALL (unless you change the level). If you're going to write the AI like this, then there should at least be an option to make the first few moves for both sides then let the kindle take over.I say the same thing I said about the backgammon: while it's nice to have something for the Kindle that is it's only real value. If you're looking for an opponent anywhere near the challenge your handheld chess game or computer software gives you, you're out of luck.
It's not the real chess game but it is fun and provides a mental challenge for anyone who likes chess.
Not Half bad..It simple enough just to have it in the Kindle Paperwhite. Play while on lunch or break or just waiting for anything.
I liked this puzzle game but wish the print and squares were larger so it would be easier to read.  Puzzles are not so easy/
Well I thought level&#34;1&#34;was pretty hard.My friends little sister tryed it it was more like level&#34;5&#34;.And if you dont want to jump go to the menu while your playing and it weill say turn off force jump.
i m really good at checkers but like the titel i cant beat the kindle  and will skip ever chance it gets i don't play it alot .
I admit this is a great game but I was playing a match and the tides were turning for me and i was winning after a bad strek and then,it would let me move i had forced jumps off but it just said&#34;Well too bad i wanna win so you cant move!Ha!&#34;and i was like ur full of BS i can start a new round!Ha!&#34;and then he was like &#34;wuteva u cant beat me!&#34;So i started a new round.and i was doin pretty good then it froze again and i wus like&#34; Well Firetruck u mr computer!&#34; and he was like &#34;Well im a full blow fireman!&#34; &#34;computers cant be fireman.&#34; &#34;......You dont know that!&#34; &#34;Yeah um..first of all you dont have arms.second,if you got wet you would short out ,third-&#34;&#34;Shut up.&#34;So i just left and wrote this review. Now he screaming at me from my Games folder to come back.
I have this program on my kindle 3 and I love  it but.... I'm about to upgrade to a kindle fire and give my K3 to my mother. Now I will lose ALL active content I've ever purchased. I think it would be great of the designers to give us a free pass when they come out with a FIRE version so we don't feel like we lost money when we switched over. :-)
As I have mentioned elsewhere, the Kindle Touch is a pretty good book reader, but at best a mediocre hand held computer. That limits the utility and usability of any app.One gripe I have with this thing is that it hides the text files it creates in a folder that is named like a random series of numbers and characters, so it is not especially easy to find the files to xfer them to a PC.I only paid 99 cents for it so I am not real offended. It does what it does OK, if kind of clunky. But, most of that is just the way a Kindle Touch is.
got the updated version, so never really had a chance to use this. just assuming it's fine. had this in my cart and purchased before I saw the newer version...can't say good or bad...never used it.
Just as the name says,Notepadis a note-taking app, no more and no less. It's not a substitute for Word as it's not a word processor, by any stretch of the imagination. Think of the 'notepad' application in Windows, and you'll be close.As the product description says, you can view or create notes with six different font sizes, and they can be sorted alphabetically or by date or by title. You can use its copy/paste feature, and the 'persistent shift' feature allows you to type an uppercase letter by pressing Shift and the letter in sequence as opposed to simultaneously, which does make typing and editing easier on your fingertips. It also offers text navigation shortcuts.Have used this on my Kindle 2, and generally speaking, it's pretty good... if you don't ask too much from it. From my experience with my Kindle 2, notes will have a size limit of roughly under 3000 characters including spaces (about 2/3 of standard page of text), but if you use a little creativity with filenames (mydoc01, mydoc02, etc.), you can work around this. It can also choke up from time to time; if that happens, be patient, save your work and shut down. Reboot your Kindle and it will be there.Be aware, however (and please don't shoot the messenger), that this app does not work on the Kindle Fire, and only works on the following devices as per the specs on the product page:* Kindle* Kindle Touch* Kindle Keyboard* Kindle DX* Kindle (2nd Generation)There are other-note taking apps here on Amazon such asNotepad Plus,TakeNoteandSticky Notes. If you explore these, check the reviews and also be sure that you check the 'Available on these devices' section on the product pages to ensure that they will work on your own kindle.For the price, this is a decent app, not outstanding, that seems to do what is expected.7/25/2012
I get it, you can now write notes on your Kindle. Fine. Having used the program for a few weeks I can say that yes I enjoy having the ability to write something down if not anything else is close to me other than my Kindle. But seriously, I'm not about to write the next great American novel with it. Let me be specific and point out that this [application] isn't reinventing the wheel, it's notetaking in it's simplest electronic form.From a programminng asspect this program isn't going to win any awards. Don't get me wrong, I like the thing and it works nicely. Unfortunetly I feel that people giving it 5 stars are like Apple fan boys who don't know what they're talking about but hey it's the latest and greatest thing.Yes yes, it's shiny and you want it...
I have a Kindle Touch and I find applications such as these tend to fall in the &#34;okay&#34; category.  It is better than nothing, but seems cumbersome and not a tool I would grab to use often.
Maybe I had the wrong purpose in mind for this app but I really found it to be clunky and fairly useless.  I guess you could write yourself a note or a grocery list?Don't get me wrong, I actually purchased the Calendar from these guys and it works quite nicely.  For 99 cents, I guess it does what you would expect.  I just hoped it would be more well thought out with the Graphical Interface.Full Disclosure:  I have done my share of programming but obviously not enough for Amazon to give me a shot at creating my own active content.  So, yes, I might be a bit frustrated by that fact also!
i like numbers so this is awesome love to play this game . . . . . . . .
I remember this game from way back and thought it would be fun.  Certainly not my favorite but is okay.
Not a big fan of this one.  Got it because it was free. Probably wouldn't have paid for it, tho.
Its reminded me of a plastic game I used have as a child, my kids like it and enjoy it just the same.
If you get how to win it, it gets old really fast. Other versions (like one in Zelda Wind Waker) use a broken image rather than just numbers, which also makes it a bit harder. It's ok, but you'll get bored soon.
this was got for my kids.  i tried it and it frustrated me, but it is fun for my kids. would like more things like this for them.
An old game, but the game is fun the first time through.  I would recommend this game for younger children,
Probably the reason I wasn't thrilled with it is because my brain doesn't work good enough to plan the strategy ahead.  Sometimes I could complete it but usually I could not.  I'd be close but no cigar.
OK it is lame because it is a lame game to start with.  Not challenging for adults, most likely great for kids.
Good fun but after a while it doesn't keep my interest and then I forget this is in my Kindle.
This game way fun! Not as fun as some of the games but it was a way to pass the time!
If you enjoyed the slide toys as a kid where you needed to rearrange tiles into a picture, you'll like this.If you found it as frustrating as I did back then, don't expect anything different now. I had flashbacks of frustration, and quickly uninstalled.Disclaimer: I'm disappointingly bad at this type of puzzle, but learning to do it right (I'm sure there's a &#34;right&#34; way to go about solving these) doesn't seem worth the effort.
As soon as I started playing this I remembered back to when I was a kid having a little plastic game just like this. It was fun for about 30 mins. then I wanted more, perhaps you could make a version that uses letters so little kids can learn their A,B,C's you could call it letter slide. :)
I have always had problems with this game, I just can not get it done, so now, I can practice and frustrate myself endlessly.
Give you something to do, but can get really frustraighting at time. It did make for some fun times in pre calculus class though, watching the teacher tring to solve the puzzle. Ha!
Nothing wrong with the game itself, just ended up not being the type of game that I enjoy.  I'll stick with the word type of games that I normally play.
It seemed like this would be a pretty easy game to play, but it really wasn't for me. It is exactly as described and a good adition to your kindle, especially since there aren't many games compatable with the lower-end kindles. I'm sure some people will think this game is simple, but I struggle with it. Still, it keeps me busy.
Wasn't what I was looking for. I found it difficult, but others with a knack for these type of puzzles would love it.
this game keep my attention but not for very long, it got boring working it so I took it off my device, I did not play it very much just no challenge to it
This is a more relaxed challenge but you still have to think.  A game to do when I don't have a lot of time.
didn't really care for it. so I don't play it much. I do like to play games. don't get me wrong I will play it when I get the chane. thank you
The best thing is that you are able to challenge yourself to see if you can beat your record time.
Entertaining for the kids.  It is good if I need to occupy their time on the fly!  They play this regularly.  I always carry my Kindle.
I was starting to enjoys it benefits when swithching to my new Kindle whitepaper killed it. It isnot fair that some of my purchased items like this have no continuity on the paperwhite.
I actually love this Calendar Pro on my kindle and use it regularly.  It's great for me as I've hit the age of doctor visits, follow-ups, physical therapy, etc.  Since I brng my kindle to all of these to keep me sane during the waiting all the former require, it's a great way to instantly note my next visit/appointment or when I'm supposed to start/stop doing/notdoing something.  In fact, since I take my kindle almost everywhere, this calendar ap is very handy.  I find my kindle easier to use with arthritic fingers than my iphone - plus the battery life is way, way better! Have to give it 3 stars though cause if I press Go To Today - it always takes me to tomorrow's date! Except on the month view, then it shows the correct today in brackets - go figure?  This review does answer a question I had about reviews though - lol; I always wondered how someone could give a book/product 3 stars and then start writing a glowing review - and now I know.
it is a good book but icanteven tell what the heck my gender is and you get confused in the end if that does not work it totaly leaves you hanging in the end
This game is fun but I found it to be a little bit to easy. Not quite challenging enough. I do love word searches though.
It is what it is.  Word search and nothing more.  But if you do these, you will love it because it is what it is, word searches!
I would recommend this game for anyone. It is very entertaining and keeps the mind &#34;working&#34; as well as the eyes.
Great game to add to your kindle for no charge, kindle beats me everytime, have to get a person to play with me
this is a very simple and easy game to play. its good to have while on a road trip with children.
Math and logic workout.  Free game, so worth the money.  Kids and adults can play, hard level is too easy for most adults.
An electronic take on a game I played with my kids when they were young and we went out to eat at places with paper place mats whether there were dots already on it or we turned it over and made our own.  A great distraction for hungry little ones waiting on their food to arrive.
Reminds me of the game we played as kids, which isn't a bad thing just not very much of a challenge.
this was a game that was bought to pass the time away and it definitely challenges you.  my husband and kids love it
Just not my type of game, but it's okay.  I have only played it a few times.  The first few times were very frustrating, then I did better.  It's just not as much fun as some other games I have on my Kindle.
Well done,....fun.  Not much more I can say about it, except that if you carry one to the next appointment you have, it will keep you busy and save the battery on your iPhone.
Does it's job. Doesn't help it be less boring. Can't complain too much, since it was free. It's fine, I guess.
Dots and boxes...  wow, this was always a fun game as a child, but this for the Kindle is less than fun.  When playing against the computer I never win!!!  So VERY dissapointing!!  But I keep playing and have changed to the 2-player version.
Not very challenging for adults.  Most likely a super kids game. No game is fun after you win it over and over.
I am perhaps being too critical for the price of free, but I do wish that the size of the grid was changed with the difficulty, or that it was an option when playing against a person. The small 4x4 grid get's stale very quickly, and it makes the game too easy.It doesn't have much replay value but then again, it's free.
This is just like the game that you used to play with your friends when you were younger. However, the computer always plays at a high level even if you have it set at easy or medium. This is the one negative I have regarding the game. It downloaded to my Kindle and Amazon-Kindle without issue.
