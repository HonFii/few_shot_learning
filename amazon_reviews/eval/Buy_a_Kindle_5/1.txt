There is no way I would buy the Kindle DX or any other Kindle! Amazon has cut corners all over the place in designing these units. They've compromised the functionality of the Kindles with their DRM protections and lack of full PDF-functionality. And they're fleecing loyal Amazon customers by overcharging for digital content that doesn't cost much to deliver and should be priced lower. Add to that the fact that Amazon failed to incorporate a backlight in the new DX, it has no memory card slots, it is poorly-ergonomically designed, and there is no international-wireless version, and it is simply a non-starter. The e-book industry is just beginning to emerge. Amazon is making a disastrous mistake by trying to strong-arm us customers into having to buy and use all our content through Amazon and shutting us out from using our pre-owned pdf and other format media. Google is probably going to make an open-source e-book reader that is easy for developers to make applications for and the Amazon Kindle is going to go the way of the Sony Betamax; except in this instance, the Kindle is in fact NOT the best product--far from it. Amazon deserves to lose the e-book war because it is being greedy, stupid, and truculent. I would hate to see Google or Apple conquer yet another new technology frontier, yet it appears that is what's going to happen. I can only hope that either Microsoft, Sony, the other Japanese electronic companies or some startup comes out with the right e-book solution with all the features we want. It should be wireless, internationally-functional (with the same prices for everyone everywhere!), backlit, accept memory cards, be ergonomic and attractive, waterproof, easily cleanable, durable and fairly unbreakable, come in 8 1/2 x 11 or compact screen sizes, accept standard battery sizes so you can choose between recharegeable or disposeable batteries (let the free market decide!), it should be able to download pay content (books, papers, magazines, blogs) from different merchants (Amazon, B&N, etc., wherever,...) plus free content from anywhere, have full pdf-functionality, have all e-book format-compatibility, a comfortable keyboard, a comfortable joystick, protective covers available in leather, vinyl, and cloth, a wide range of font sizes for people who need large-format print, full text-to-speech capability, a good file system for categorizing documents/articles/titles, a good multi-feature search function, ability to share text/articles/books wirelessly between multiple units within 20 feet, ability to use it continuously while on an airplane, a built-in full-function web browser, wikipedia access, dictionary, simple email functionality to forward articles/quotes/links, permanent lifetime title data backup even if you switch reader brands, and a Sleep function that turns it off if you fall asleep reading. Of course I am also waiting for them to develop color E-Ink so we can have access to all textbooks ever published, but I realize they're still working on that. Once Google Books is greenlighted and other digital book libraries are also formed, imagine getting access to every book and every article and scholarly paper ever published in history on your e-book reader! That's the future, and it will happen. But Amazon has simply failed with the Kindle. They have succeeded in trailblazing a new industry but absolutely and horrendously failed in implementing it. I am waiting for the company with the vision to do the e-reader the right way while not gouging their customers at the same time. For now I am sticking with my $399 laptop pc that can do everything and anything I need. In fact I might always stick with a laptop and forget about e-readers. But I will probably buy an e-reader in a few years when a company comes out with a version that has additional features, however I am really waiting for the e-reader that has everything I have just described for you above. That will take about five to ten years in my estimation, when the e-book industry will begin to approach its teen age years. Right now, the e-book industry is only in its infancy, and boy does it show.
When you have read thousands of books you come across common words that scrabble does know.  This make you wonder is scrabble game worth it?  Not if you have a mind that is above a first grader level.
I like the game but way too small for my Kindal.  Probably great for people with better eyesight than I have  So it is not the game it's self just that I hve trouble seeing it.
what the shoot. i paid full price for this and it cheats. he used the words:jgh ftg yuop topr and hyuiopt. do u recognize any of these words. on top of it the screen is to small. people need to think things out. they didnt care about quality,just money,which means that they were going to get bad reviews, which means they will actually going to lose money. and by im a ten your old girl who is in seventh when im supposed to be in fifth so i know those words are not in  the dictionary.
blah blah blah blah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; okay lets akip to the good part, this game would be got or found out at the first grade spelling bee the only reason why i got it was because i thought it would be easy and it actually is not once when i was playing this game and i found a word..... naked then submitted it and it said that it was not on the board so i was like this gme is screwed up or what some people call (qoute) rigged so i was like the people that made this game they should make another game like this but put every single word possible to make then maybe i might change this game review you game makers better read this review or kiss that changing review. sianara makers
boring boring boring, deleted, forgotten hope to never be reminded, wouldn't waste my time or space with this.if I can't play a game for 15 minutes at least twice in 2 weeks... boring..
THIS GAME IS BORING AND RETADED. it deves -100,000,000 stars. I would NOT recommed this game for anyone.  all you do is make the longest word you can with some letters  :-PPROS: it is freeCONS:1 it is boring2 it has poor graphics3 thare are game 10,000x better than this4 ITS JUST PLAIN RETARTED
don't know what it is
I found that unless you're on the olympic spelling bee team or you're actually an electronic dictionary posing as a human, you will not find this game fun. The letters move too fast so your only able to put together words that a 3rd grader would use.I REALLY dislike that when you spell a word wrong you loose all the letters that you were trying to use. So forget trying to make any words with what you're left with, like letters K,W,Q and V. I became so frustrated with this game that I wanted to use my Kindle as a disk to see how far it would fly through the air, and I love my Kindle.So if you see someone in the future throwing their Kindle like a disk, you'll know why.
I had a difficut time with this.  I don't like to take my time with it.  Didn't bother with it.
If you like to have words turned down that are real words, then you would like this game.  On the other hand, if you have half a brain, do not waste your money or time on it.
didn't care for it much at all, deleted from account after a couple weeks, actually played it maybe 15 minutes.
so reaturded i want to throw up if you want to waste money bye this game for goodness sake my butt is more interresting
i havent play this yet i just know its on my kindle i think my sister has played it so yea
I really do not like this game my daughter downloaded it anf it will be for her to play on my kindle.
Got this for my kindle, wont start up, doesn't give me any notification that it wont work, failed comepletely. Other apps are like this too. It may be my older kindle, but then why is it on my kindle store?
This was a hard game to play and was not worth my time to try to understand the rules.  Glad I didn't have to pay money for it or would have wanted a refund.
This game is hard, frustrating, complicated, it just flat out SUCKS.I would give it zero stars if I could.I do not recomend this to anyone.
oh my goodnes so dumb i cant even figure out whats going on these barbarians and other retarded stuff that do nothing but be stupid you make flowers worthles
When it works it is great! Twice it shuts down and this time it failed to go on. Got a message COLLECTING Information...may take a minute...will restart when done.. Please Wait..  Well 24 hours later the same message is up on the screen. Quality not that great! I am ready to toss this in the garbage..............ech!
I love Kindle-based puzzle games and have bought every single one of them as soon they appeared on the market. Unfortunately, NEXT is pretty much my least favorite of them all. Graphically, it is quite primitive, especially in comparison with a lot more sophisticatedSCRABBLEorPanda Poet.Moving the pieces around with Kindle's five-way pointer is quite tedious. You solve the puzzle in your head first and then spend the next 15 minutes trying to move all the pieces around in a very repetitive and boring set of movements. I also have a feeling that playing this game on a regular basis might end up damaging or wearing out the pointer. This primitive game is definitely not worth damaging the Kindle.The game has 65 levels but they all look so much the same that the game become very boring after the first couple of levels. There are so many games of the same type that are a lot more sophisticated available online that it makes no sense to buy such a basic version on Kindle. If the game cost $0.99, it might make sense to buy it and see if you like it. However, at the current price of $2.99, the game is mostly a waste of money. I can't imagine playing it more than a couple of times because it gets too monotonous.
I am sorry I deleted this from my Kindle after the first time I played it.  Can't even remember it.
It never work for my kindle. Maybe it was me or my kindle but it never worked. I wish I didn't have to keep writing in order to submit this.
worst game ever. it is a waiste of time i did what i was suppose to and i kept losing money don`t get it. p.s. i am 9.
This game is not fun or entertaining at all. I'm glad it was free. I would have been very disappointed if I paid for it.
I do not very like this game. It does not even tell you ow to play it. Aybe that is why the game is free!  just don't get it. Who would play a game that does not even tell you how to play it. And  don't who wins the game. Nd  do not know who is the cards. He cards look like there nothing. And one more thing is  really want to delete this game at my three g kindle home because I have a three g kindle. So  I do not get it. Okay, That is all I want to say. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee For Ow. Because  do not like this game.
I have never really liked this game and my daughter actually downloaded thinking I might since I like other card games.  Oh well back to the drawing board.
don't work on Kindle PaperWhite, BUUU I want my money back, NOW~!!! why is it not posted before you buy the games?
Really boring and not a lot of fun to play. Not worth the money. Nothing exciting about this game on my kindle.
The program flashes as it deal the card. Annoying flashes if you ask me...Nevertheless it was but free probably why it was freeware...poor quality.
This game is okay, but it gets boring quickly. I purchased it, and I want a full refund. Only dummies would buy this game.
ok i am nine and i hate this the directions didnt really expain a thing they didnt say what buttons i had to use. this is the first game on a kindle i have ever hated puzux if that is your real name.
Number one:&#34;3 free puzzles&#34; Really? Hot dang, hold on, we're going on the fun train  kids! Get out your 3 free puzzles!I initally thought it was a puzzle as in &#34;puzzle pieces&#34; but in fact it's cheapo kids-menu grade failure. What a thrill.
As stated in the title, it is only three puzzles. I would rather it be more because these are not high quality games. Overall this was a major disappointment.
Don't waste your time or money downloading this.  Bad puzzles.  Takes longer to get rid of them completely from your Kindle.
This app is so terribly slow. Lost count of how many times it has locked up my Kindle. The puzzles are ok but the response time needed is irritating as the very least. Ended up uninstalling after having to restart Kindle one last time.
This initially appeared that it would be a challenging and enjoyable game.I did not find it to be so.  It bores me and I am going to delete it from my Kindle.
Use 7 Dragons. It is so muck better. It lets you acess your notes from your computer. It lets you undo. It lets you do alot of stuff this doesnt let you do. THIS is a piece of a turd.
There is no challenge with this game The easy level seems to be as challenging as the hardest level which is NO CHALLENGE!!!!!!!!!!
chess is lame checkers is awesome do not get it get checkers ok please follow my advice i rate 1 stars oh ya
This game is programed for nothing no one is going to pay 3 dollars for junK like this 0 stars.
I can't get the first puzzle done and cannot get it to clear and go to another puzzle...so I am stuck on the one crossword puzzle and cannot find any hints or move on to another puzzle or go to solutions...only will show up page of that puzzle...WHAT A WASTE!!!
The first NY Times puzzles I solved were on my old Kindle Touch. When it died, it was replaced by a Paperwhite, which I am now using. I don't know if this book's problems stem from the device itself or from the new puzzle format, but I am deleting it. First of all is the terrible time lag. I wouldn't call it &#34;slight,&#34; as did another reviewer. Molasses-like is nearer the truth. Second is the new format, which doesn't show the keyboard, all the clues and the puzzle together on one page. You have to flip back and forth and back and forth and it's so slow. Let's say you want to skip from 4-Across to 34-Down. You can't just do it, like in the old version. It's a big mishegas. I can't stand it.
rediculous
This is a horrible app. I bought it, but I didn't get it on my Kindle. I think that maybe it is not for my Kindle Touch, but that should have been included in the description. If you have a Kindle Touch, I would advise you not to buy this. Hope you find this helpful!
impossible to figure out or work
idk what to say about this havent tried it out yet i just know it on my kindle so sorry
I believe I deleted this game after trying to play it once. It didn't interest me and I wouldn't download it again.
This game is as impossible and frustrating for me as it was when I played it w/ the real cube when I was a kid, however, it was not as satisfying as the game I played as a kid.
This game is sure to interest/ frustrate anyone who has the original Kindle as it is so difficult to move the pieces around with the 5 point selector. Probably recommended for someone with a touch screen, not so good for anybody else.
cannot understand the menu or workings
this game sucks I CAN NOT BEAT THE KINDLE !!!!! and it is just plane old boring i wouuld rate 0 stars but it won't let me
This was a free game and one that is not worth the time, that is if you are an adult.  Good for a child but this one bores me to death!
not very challengong once again, mor for younger generation, not really for adults, i think my grandkids would this one too
When my friend first told me about this game, I was really excited.  My friends and I play this while waiting at restaurants, and I thought, "Hey, why not get it for my kindle touch?"  I wasn't impressed.  You need to have more boxes that you can get and make the game more challenging when you're playing the computer.  I'm 13 and was able to get all of the boxes for myself when playing the computer on 'hard'.  If you are looking to get this game for a kid between the ages of 5 and 9, go ahead.  They'll love it because the characters are lions and elephants, and the game is just the right difficulty level for them.  If you are older than 9, don't bother wasting your time on this product.
I think I ended up deleting it. I didn't care for the game. Kind of boring or maybe I'm just not good at it.
Too confusing for me.  May be a great game for kids, but I was not impressed.  I have already deleted it from my kindle.
Cheap and no fun to play. Sorry I brought. I quess ok for a little kid. But I did not like and dont play.
i can see why this game is free no one would pay for it you can play it on a piece of paper
Dots and Boxes is a fun game when you are playing with a friend in a car trip, to pass the time. but it is a easy game to master. Once you do, it becomes pointless. Similar to tic-tac-toe.
This game tells you which way you can move and does not let you figure it for yourself. It is not the orignal version as we all know and played on wood. I give it one star nothing like the original.... Save your .99$
Cannot get  game to play next level.  Some weird monkeys but nothing to tell you what to do.  No instructions or hints available.
i..shouldnt...have...bought...it....super...mad....not..worth...the...five...bucks...i...payed...for...the@#$%^&*...thing....do...not...buy..save..your...money...this...game..was..horrible. okay i really do not like this game. i was up all night trying to find this object and im officially super tired.
just OK
I have brought this up several times and it tells me, &#34;Thanks for playing.  There are no ads to vote on.&#34;  Whoo.p..e....e...  ..  ..
all you do is vote for ads that you can't even get, and plus you have to us wi-fi. this is so boring.
Although it is something different to do, it is probly the dumbist thing I have ordered from Amizon it thr three years I have been ordering
Something happened when I was downloading and I can't get the game to open. Tried to re-load and that didn't work either.
Thread Words is one of the few word games that I did not like. For some reason I could not match any letters to make a word. I finally gave up and deleted it from my Kindle.
This is an incredibly frustrating game.  Once you get past matching shapes so you can move to the next level, you get to find all the other "words" that can be made.That sounds simple enough until you make a word that is in the dictionary and the game denies it. I can accept that the game dictionary isn't complete.  That's aggravating, but okay.The problem is when the game requires you to use non-words to fill the spaces to complete a level.  Maybe the game's name should be Thread Words and Non-words.A total waste of time.
didn't care for it much at all, if you got too stumped in it you can actually beat it through brute force tactics, boring..
this game sucks the name dosent make any sense i mean i have found more enterrtainment in my butt i mean at least it does something
i am glad it was a free game. if you cant complete a puzzle you get to start at the very begining with the same puzzle. &#34;every word&#34; is far superior... not a fan
Kids can't follow it well, adults will find it boring. Overall games on less expensive Kindles tend to be boring. Save playing games for the newer Kindle versions.
I didn't like this game, too complicated.  I would not recommend this game to anyone.  That is all that I have to say.
I played this once and decided it was not my kind of game.  i hated it and will not be recommending it to others to play.  sorry.
is too boring needs some spicing up and better graphics and as i said before it is too boring do not get!
Amazon's attempt at the tablet market was an abysmal failure with this device. Clearly this was rushed to marked with no forth sight of the customer in mind. Visually the device is just a block, only one button so if your device becomes unrecoverable, don't count on getting it to respond again or even get content back. The system is very lagy and additionally the ability to personalize this device to what you would like it to be will be no chance. This is not an Android tablet, that is the first thing you should accept.The biggest issue I had personally that can add to what others have shared is I had to have my device replaced 3 times within the period of one week of receiving it. Why? Each device had excessive and unfix-able image burn in, more can be read on this Amazon Forum http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/kindleqna/ref=cm_cd_pg_pg1?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx1GLDPZMNR1X53&cdPage;=1&cdThread;=Tx2P4BLPCCAZRGG. Each time the CSA claimed they had never heard of this issue, however this is a BIG MAJOR issue with this product. Ultimately, I gave up and just returned the device for good. The thing that gets me is just admit there is a problem, stop trying to think you are saving face by blatantly lying to your customers. Amazon without question has serious quality control issues with not just the Kindle Fire but all Kindle devices and refuses to acknowledge these or even attempt to correct them long term. Your only recourse is to get a replacement and lets just hope you are under warranty when this happens. Buy at your own risk is all that can be said.
Wheres your common sense people! Use your cell phone for your contacts. This is a waste of time and the hard earned green bucks from your pocket. Dont buy it, dont get ripped off.
This didn't work the way I thought it would. I have my contacts on V-card and it would not transfer them as advertized.
Ah, the simple game so many of us played in our youth.  Now the digital version comes to Kindle and somehow it is the most complicated piece of nonsense I've encountered.It all started with the pages and pages of instructions that were nearly impossible to navigate through.Then, it appears, there is no way to turn off the constant "help" or "hints" pop up.  It's kind of irritating when trying for a 'full house' to be reminded that you might lose 15 points in the Fives category.Amazon's no fool either.  By the time I figured I hated this game (about 30 minutes) there was no option to RETURN it for the $3.00...just DELETE it.Which I did.Immediately and with a vengeance.
don't have it and don't know what it is
i dont get it, i dont under stand what im supposed to do, it sucks... rules would be nice or directions of some type
It is too difficult to work for me.  i also don't get SUDOKU either.  i am assuming it is a skill that i lack to play these particular games.
Maybe it's just that my kindle is the keyboard, so it's in black and white, but this was a lackluster game for me. I'm glad it was free, though.
i hated this and all of the other pixel perfect puzzle games i had a friend who told me that she njoyed them (l8r to find out that she was jokein) and so i got the game and it stunk so i would say not to buy it!!!!
I tried to play it, but it didn't give me any hints how to make the picture. How am i supposed to do it if i have to guess the whole time on how to do it?
Sorry...  this is not something I would ever order again if I had the option.  I was not at all impressed with the calendar and planner.
never worked
broke too soon upgrade was not cheap.. got it repaired and it just broke again... would not buy the touch again
Clues provided are not helpful and some of the words in the crossword does not make sense. Who came up with this some PHD out of work?
This game was very boring. I couldnt get into it at all. Not the best game but it was free so you get what you pay for
used for maybe 15 minutes and then deleted, not my style of game.word games aren't really entertaining to me.
When I try to downnload this set of games (EXACTLY the games I was looking for darn it!) it says it can't find a registered device for this game. Double checking the "for these devices" on the product page, apparently it's NOT yet available for Kindle Paperwhites. RIDICULOUS-catch up slow pokes!
does not work and cannot understand the workings
could not see it  too light in color
i reaset my kindle and was not able to download this again! the game is good though please please make games you can redownload for free!
I thought this would be a good game to play but didn't realize what it was.  I just don't care for it at all.
Worst game EVER for Kindle....unless you want the Trivial Pursuit Movie Star edition.....the questions are all about movie and TV stars....what trash!!!
i do not like this game at all it is very hard and complacated to play sorry i bought it
i dont get this game at all for the clue i could get but the rest stupid my cousin tryed and almost finished it but got some answers wrong come on give us freakin HINTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
unless you are more of a deep thinker type. do not &#34;buy&#34; this game. luckily it was free. this is a technical thinkers game and the instructions are not layman freindly. maybe i will get the hang of it sometime but just dont get too excited over this till you try it.
This is just not for me....I am trying to figure how to get it off my Kindle....Sometimes we win when we download a game and sometimes we lose..for me this was one of those losing times...I cannot say don't download it...you may love it, but I can't recommend it on my experience.
I didn't enjoy this game at all and eventually deleted it from my Kindle after trying it 3 or 4 times.
Okay, but rather boring to play. Once you figure out how to do it, the games all seem to run the same.
This game was hard for me to play and didn't feel it was worth my time to learn the rules.
I just tried Anywhere Spreadsheet, and I am very disappointed.  There is no sorting of rows.  You can't format for time.  If you put in dates in a column and then insert a row, it changes all the dates you have entered.  To top off this bad experience, once a spreadsheet is saved, there is no way to delete it!  I had to delete the complete application to delete the spreadsheet.
the spreadsheet never did work.  the help was no good either.  did not allow to enter funtions.  would not even give it 1 star, should be a minus 10 star because it is so bad!
The character is extreemly hard to move and there aren't enough instructions. When you touch on the icon for help that you are instructed to , it goes over the entire speil that it does at the beginning of the game. &#34;Not helpful!!&#34;Sorry I bought it!
waste of money you run around and be stupid collect skulls that are practicly worthless i mean why would i waste money on somthing so retarded oh my goodness 2 bucks more like 2 cents
i got this game because one of my friends said that we should try it (she has a kindle too) so we did  i dont no what she thought of it but all i no is that it didnt work like at all and what did work made like NO SENCE  at all so ya thats why i rated it 1 star and titled this thing hated it!!!
This is the dumbest game....ever!!  I cant figure it oit and, quite frankley....is a waste of time and paper!  Dumb!!!!
have word search  but don't know what Holiday Word Search is
It is very hard to find the cursor on this game.  Also, the 5 way controller is not responsive enough, it seems to freeze up, and not move. I know the problem is not with my Kindle, as I have bought other games, and had no problem with the controller.  These problems make it very difficult to get a fast time on the game.
There is no clear instructions on how to play or score. I've had this game for over a month and I have not been able to beat it. Player is suppose to pop matching, consecutive bubble, however, there is never equal about of matching bubbles to there is no way of winning. Worst game ever.
This game seems to be pointless.  In a couple of attempts to &#34;play&#34; it I never found a strategy or tactic that make a difference in scoring.  When you &#34;pop&#34; some bubbles, they are replaced by others -- and so are some of the ones you didn't pop, so you can't break a small group hoping to create a larger one.  There doesn't seem to be a strategy that will let you mass bubbles into larger groups and score more points.  Eventually there are no more groups to pop, and the game ends.  Whoopee.I'll probably never open the game again - almost anything else on the Kindle would be more interesting.
The weather comes and goes all of the time. I just want to keep the nice weather, but bad weather keeps coming even though I put in for good weather. I was told by the weather person one day it would be good so I drove to the Golf Course and when I got there the weather turned bad. I waited an hour and the Bad weather lingered so I drove home. Got home the weather was Good.
this app wouldnt work on my Irulu tablet I tryed installing it three times and it still wouldnt work so each time I uninstalled it and after the thrid try I had enough
is this on a kindle if it is only wifi.  on a wifi connection i would use my computer.  only conceivable advantage is handier acess to kindle three g than experimental.  which it does not have.
the christmas cocoa is the stupidest game i have ever played in my life. and by the way, only retards play that game. who ever made this game needs a life
first, if you see the other reviews some say the game sucks. i totally agree. come on money wasters! one of the worst games to be on the kindle store.
Lag, Lag and more lag..unplayable in my experience.not worth the time nor money.you will probably not enjoy this.
This game was a little hard to figure at first and then when I figured it out it was kind of redundant.
Very stupid juvenile game.  Satisfactory for a two year old maybe.  I deleted it from my system immediately after trying it.
I was super bored one day and decided to get some free games. This one didn't even start and killed my kindle. Crap game.
I could not figure out how to play this game or it kept locking up on me. I was not to happy with this game.
dont waste your time on this boring stupid dum game it is such a waste of valueable time that you lose of your life. all you do is move this stupid thing around oh never mind just dont waste presious time on a stupid game like this it sucks
It's a cute game.  It probably even works on a Kindle with buttons.  But for me on a Touch Kindle, this is a miserable game to try to play.  You are supposed to "flick" the screen the direction you want the parts to go.  Yeah, right.  I'm not a very good "flicker" and it's not a very good system, takes all the fun out of the game.  That is, the frustration of trying to get the "flick" to work right takes all the possible fun out of the game.  Actually, I don't know, I've never had a bit of fun trying to play this game, and will no longer try.  Would not recommend this game to any Touch Kindle owners.
Thought I would like this, but it doesn't work well on kindle and is rather monotonous.  Have not played in months.
Can't get the tunnels to stay where they were put and can't get next tunnel to stay in place.  I may just be doing something wrong but I read the directions a couple of times.
Something is wrong with the game cause I have tried several times to play but can't get the hamster to move in multiple directions after the first puzzle.  Good thing I got it free so I didn't feel so bad deleting it.
could not figure out how to make it work.  On my Kindle Keyboard, I could never get things to work right.  So I deleted it.
Just hate it, makes no sense to me and can't get the tubes to the right place, don't know what I am doing wrong, but it is not a game I would recommend, but each to his own.  Not worth my time playing.
this i game was confusing . it made little or no sense to me. it wasn't that fun either. at least it was free :(
maybe its just me but this game was overly complicated to get started. especially since the instructions really don't tell you how to play the game. I gave up trying to figure any of it out.
I had a hard time getting the tubes to move around.  To be honest, I didn't think this was the type of game I would enjoy very much, but any enjoyment I got out of it was ruined by how hard it was to actually play in on my kindle.
I did not like this game at all.  Not sure if it was just me, but I had a hard time manipulating the pieces, and finally just gave up and deleted the game.
It was free, so I can't complain. But it isn't as challenging as I was hoping for. Still, it was free...
I pride myself to being able to play puzzles well. There is never a puzzle that can stump me. This game however, doesn't make logical sense. The best you can do is just click around and hope for the best.
this puzzle is extremely limited. imagine going to a gym that has only an excercise bike, stair climber and a treadmill. this puzzle is several puzzles over and over again. some puzzles make no sense at all, even when it reveals the answer, some answers go w/out explaination. example: &#34;paper clips&#34; 4 sets of 3 intertwined clips, 3 sets are intertwined exactly the same, one set the clips are interwined differently, (one clip is over instead of under like all other sets) but the different set is the wrong answer... and offers no explaination as to why! &#62;:( Some puzzles ARE actually kinda good. but puzzle quizzes is still not worth getting.. even if it were free.. I AM NOT A FAN!!!!!!
the first time that i bought this game istarted playing and didnt get it at all then it started making sense but what i noticed was that it kept on repeating the same questions after the end of the end of the game
I tried and tried but for some reason this game was not for me.  I am not saying you should not try it - to each their own
i bought this game saying 'hey look! Yes! this game is like tetris! it's only 99! boo yah. heck yah!' then, after it had downloaded, i played it and it was boring. i do not recommend buying it. those who do will find themselves thinking ' oh my gosh! This is a ripoff! i should write a complaint!' later, you find yourself upset. ' if only i payed attention to that review, i wish i hadn't bought it.' and you become miserable. it is not worth the buy. it is not advertised correctly. it sound great, but it isn't. DO NOT BUY! you will regret it.
in this lame... er. i mean game, if you are not very perspective to identifying one repeating pattern in a given shape, DO NOT BUY!!! example: any shape made of even number of blocks, now divide them into 2 of the same shape. not as easy as it sounds. i've always had trouble with symmetrics. but after playing for 30 mins. and hitting &#34;hint&#34; countless times i'm still stuck on basic puzzle #2. maybe i just unreasonably suck at this. (i tend to spot patterns rather well) but i can nail sudoku, riddles and word searches like a master. and it does not help matters that theres a timer ticking away while i'm trying to be patient. so if yo are good at finding symmetrical type patterns this game may suit you.. all others, save your money!
this app was not compatiable with my tablet the irulu. So if you have an Irulu tablet this app wont work for you
This game has been out for six months, yet there is still no update for the multitude of problems within the program.Just as one example, "Canfield" always states you have ten more cards in your tableau than you actually have.  And to make it worse, the ten missing cards are unavailable during the game, thus rendering it unwinable.  So it's basically a 42-card exercise in futility.  I've got a deck here at home that's missing a few cards, and if I wanted to play an unbeatable game of solitaire I'd use it and save the money I've obviously wasted on this game.Other game companies have had problems with their games that are usually addressed.  Nickel Buddy has had six months, and where is a corrected version update?I will NOT be purchasing any more of their products.
Extremely disappointed with this game--It's boring--not fun at all.  I find that I start trying to play it and just am not motivated to continue.
this game is nonesense. litterally.. you get 1 free answer, then you try to figure out the answer to the clue, easy huh? well here are a couple clues with answers #1 sport usually played on ice, hockey, right? wrong.. the answer is field.. #2 standing open account, WTF does that mean?!?! apparently &#34;blanket&#34;.. #3 a light bench, lamp... just a few clues and answers.. i wasted my money on something that even the instructions make no sense.  purchase at your own risk!!!!
not sure what it is
do not buy cuz i want to BUY THIS GAME FOR FIVE DOLLARS I AM TELLING YOU DO NOT BUY THIS IS ONLY 1.1 mb most games are 1 to 2 dollars 5 seriously
Terrible terrible game. Maybe they can make a good version for the Kindle Fire. Too hard to see the board, trading is abysmal, can't tell what the resources are.Play the board game.
I thought this might be handy to have, but I discovered that it is too difficult to use on my basic Kindle.  I have to open my keyboard and add words like a text.  It's quicker and easier to write them down.  I also dislike the fact that you couldn't erase one item from your list.  You erase all or nothing.  Not the best for a grocery list to multiple stores.
I thought there would be more to this, but it's just a simple list maker with no bells and whistles.  Because I have a basic Kindle that doesn't have a keyboard, it would take forever to actually make a good list with this...will not be using it!
I have played Bookworm before and expected to really enjoy having this on my kindle. However, the game does not play through at all. After one round the &#34;fires&#34; start and it is not possible to get it fixed, I have tried several times. It is a waste of money, unfortunately.
wow, i guess everyone likes the horrible BOOKWORM. what a fail. i'm just being honest because most people lie on a review
Did not like, had to return to Amazon...not what I was expecting and seemed difficult for me to use....don't get me wrong I love my Kindle I read on but this one is too smart...so I'll wait and see if anyothers come around more user friendly.
I was going to give this two stars but after seeing that the price has dropped 30 dollars just three months after my purchase I was infuriated. I had a kindle fire original model and my son used it more than I so I bought this device and gave him my old one which was then stolen by someone who claimed to be a friend and was in our home. My son is autistic so this devastated him. After finding out that the "insurance" we carried didn't cover theft he began using this device and I've gone back to using it when I get a few minutes to myself. Well, since getting my iPhone I've discovered that Amazon App Store is SEVERELY lacking in apps and I now wish that I had gone a different direction. Unfortunately it's been too long to return the device and buy something much more suited to my needs. I will never again buy a kindle fire as long as app purchasing is restricted to Amazon exclusively while they keep their app choices below par. Most disappointing purchase ever made on this site.
just ok
This was a stupid game I didn't even understand it I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. My daughter is in second grade so I thought that this would be good practice but it sucks!
I should have known better than to download anything with the word math in it. I am awful with numbers.
based on my past experience play gray is the the worst company ever the .lemonade stand they programed is bad  have seen better though this game is okay does not satisfy me
This game is fun, I have always loved 'tetra', but this games jumps around half of the blocks don't show and parts disappear as they are falling. it is difficult to paly and hard on the eyes.
If you like Tetris here it is.....I prefer Dr. Mario. This game in my opinion is BORING !!! I felt like I wasted .99$. If your like me save your money it is repetitive gameplay!!! Total boredoom !!
I really did not like this game at all. I felt that it never challanged me in any way in order to get my scores higher than what they were.
I play real Uno all the time with my family. However, this version has the cards so small and the patterns on the cards are SO hard to read (yes, even with my reading glasses on...LOL) that I find it hard to play the game. After a few times, I just gave up with it. A waste of a purchase!
It is kind of confusing as the game moves so quickly against the computer players.  I cannot see the different designs too well. When I try to place my card, sometimes it places a different one.
look, before you buy any game read my reviews first. the game sucks! cant access to it, costant freezing, and a money/life waster with no refund.
should have listened to the other reviewer.  does not work on my kindle keyboard.  will be requesting refund.  who cares if it is on sale if it does not work.Edited to add that Amazon's refund policy on active content is that there are no refunds.  I asked them for a refund on this anyway.  They want you to "troubleshoot" the problem.  I've spent quite enough time troubleshooting the buggy Kindle and I'm not going to waste more time on it.  This may well be my last Kindle purchase - maybe I'll try a Nook.Edited to add that Amazon did give me a refund when I emailed them.  And that, according to a comment to this review, Nooks are apparently even worse.Oh, and - I found a comment on another review that says if you right-click it (Uno) and choose "open" from its menu (as opposed to opening it by mashing the middle button) it will work on a keyboard.  I'm tempted to buy it again and try it, but I've become very leery of doing anything at all on my Kindle other than just reading/playing what's already there.
bad game hard to play confusing boring bad in black and white too many shadows is just confusing and annoying
lame i love pool but after this i want a better game to much lag bad angles looks bad could be a lot better if they improved this. If this was free i would not by im so Cooldude if you dont buy you are like cooldude.
dont read just any review, you need to read mine. ok. the starts out with this retarded card. telling the player what their aiming fr. uh.... this is a life waster. whoever likes this game...
If I recall right, Play Gray said to look for upcoming updates with more fish and upgrades.Well, after almost a year, still on version 1.0.The game is fun, (up to level seven, where fish and upgrades dissapear.) but it would be nice if they said a little bit about who dropped the carnavore fish in the tank.A person who loved his fish (the carnivore) but missplaced him in the wrong tank? (your tank)A nobody?The school bully?
I bought this and only played it for a few minutes.  I am extremely disappointed in it.  You are not allowed to sell all your fish and start over.  When you get to one fish, you can sell it over and over and over.  A game where it is easy to cheat is not my idea of fun, especially if you don't even realize you are cheating.It seemed like the parent fish just disappeared.  They had a baby and were gone.The only thing that earns this game a star is that the graphics are good.
Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.. Maybe there is more to come, for a price.
there is no hell to me for ONE star as someone else would say.[ look through the other reviews and you would understand ] overall the game is stupid and childish.
boo this game is so unfair i never want to play it in my life again i hate it pool and solitare are  better
don't know what it is  don't think I have it
This is a terrible game and not even worth 99 cents.  It has no relationship whatsoever to the game of Mahjongg
I did not  like this game.  After trying several times to figure out how it works, I still couldn't get it to work.
do not have it  don't know what it is
Very confuseingDont recamend it,unless your good at figuring things out. Plan on going back and re-trying it again. Thank-you
Nice games? You must mean lame games. Honestly, the game is too easy and doesn't have much in variety. DON'T BUY!!!
its so boring its a huge waste of mony i mean it its plane stupid i dont like it at all i mean it just a bunch of dumb math puzzels and stuff
also does not work
amazon tells me that I bought it but it never appeared on my kindle.  I cannot get it to download & I normally love text twist - that's why I bought it......
game does not have standard words in it.  keys jump from letters to enter most of the time causing words to be misspelt.  just a waste of space on the kindle and of money.  even for free would be too high!
Screen does not show what items to look for, at least I haven't been able to find it.  No instructions that art understandable, a big waste of my money & I wish you would take it back or send instructions on how to play.
Too slow for online...takes litterally 30 seconds after you tap a move for the system to move the card. DISGUSTING...a waste of $!!
i dont wanna pay money for something i dont like. i dont even like this game!!!signed by:SwordstarSmartstarMistystarMaplestarfrostpeltmorningfur
It didn't work AT ALL on my Paperwhite.  The only icon you could touch that would do ANYTHING was the icon that sent you to the webpage where you could buy more of the same junk.  They should tell you the software won't work on your Paperwhite BEFORE they ask you for the money.  I know it was only 99 cents, but it wasn't worth even that!
I think the format is unattractive and confusing.  i don't play them. Maybe you can come up with/devise a better format.
Although l enjoy a relaxing no-brainer gamme now and then, like Gordon says, once you win, you cannot see the word. l especially like the hardest anatomy and animal sections, even they are a bit too easy. It would be great for kids learning to read and problem solve, but blocking the end result will just prove frustrating for children ever more.Want a good word game? Try Every Word or Bookworm.
I know Hangman isn't the most 'engaging' game, but seriously, you'd think Gameblend Studios could at least make the game into exactly that...a game. Not a cheap imitation of it. When I bought this, I thought there was no way you could possibly screw up a game like hangman. But they found a way. It's not that it doesn't load anything, it's the setup that is horrible. You choose to play, choose a category and difficulty, and start the game. One of the worst things about the game is that when you get the last letter in a word, it doesn't show the completed puzzle. It just starts the next one. You would be better off getting a piece of paper and playing with someone.
When I purchased this game, I did not know I would need to be on line to be able to use this game.  Have not even been able to use the game.
I guess I just don't like hangman. I originally bought this game because I like The Wheel of Fortune and the description of wheel of fortune is that it is like hangman. This is not close enough though. But if you like hangman this is a great game. Haha.
uh hello this game sucks! dont ever buy this game, unless your a loser who wants to waste money. there is a failing future for this game.
I thought this was one of the worst games I have downloaded.  I tried to play but finally deleted it off my Kindle
UGH! TRYING TO GET these pieces to cooperate is like trying to herd cats! They have a definite mind of their own. I requested a refund. Please, don't waste your money on this, you may chuck your Kindle across the room and break it!
I like to do word games while in waiting rooms, and this game is great, UNTIL you want to get to the 2nd page and beyond. I managed to nearly accidentally "turn to next page", but can't figure out how I did it. Looks silly, me tapping my stylus (and finger) all over the darned screen to figure it out. At bottom of page it says 1 of 4...but instead of the trigger point for moving pages being there, it's somewhere up top, but not identified....GRRRRR....glad it was only $1.00! Someone on the production end of this product REALLY messed up...lousy user interface!
soo small  cannot see and does not work
