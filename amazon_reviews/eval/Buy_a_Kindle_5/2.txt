I've read all the 1-star and 2-star reviews of Kindle 2 plus the most popular positive reviews. This review is to go over the problems that Kindle 2 has that other reviewers have pointed out and list them all in one review. The large number of problems with Kindle 2 is why I'm waiting to buy Kindle until Amazon comes out with a new version that solves these problems.Problems:1. High price of Kindle reader plus high price of Kindle e-books.Kindle costs $359.00 which is too high an entry point for most people. If there's only one factory in China that manufactures e-ink screens, then why not just build another factory in Vietnam, Malaysia or even in the U.S. with a state tax-break? Amazon could easily afford to build a new e-ink factory under license, they are a multi-billion dollar company. The entry point of $359.00 is too high especially when you factor in that new books cost $5.00-9.99 and sometimes more. (Lowering the price would broaden the base of Kindle owners and ultimately Amazon would make more money from more e-book downloads. The profits over the medium and long term are really in downloads, not the hardware.)And that's the second point, Kindle e-books are too expensive. Due to the electronic downloading, Kindle books should cost much less because there's no printing and transportation costs for Amazon and the publishers. Downloading e-books, you don't waste any packaging or fuel or labor. But who wants thosae advantages if you have to pay almost as much as for a real book? True, there are Kindle classic titles for free or $0.99 each, but a true breakthrough would be real savings when buying all Kindle e-books, maybe $2.99-3.99 for each title is reasonable, but not $9.99. A reviewer pointed out that you could easily buy 1,000 used high-quality books for less money than just the Kindle reader alone, and that's even before you've bought any downloads for the Kindle. These Kindle prices are unreasonable and only designed for people for whom price is never an object.2. No Backlight for reading in the dark.You'd think that Amazon designers would have figured this out. The Kindle needs a backlight, even if that means making it a bit thicker and a few ounces heavier. What do you do if you're on a bus or a plane and the overhead reading light is hard to aim at your Kindle? Who wants to attach a clumsy clip light to the Kindle, when a built-in backlight would be so much more efficient, ergonomic and unobtrusive? The Kindle needs a backlight because it is less disturbing to people around you trying to sleep, and only a backlight will efficiently and directly light up the Kindle pages, unlike clumsy clip lights or overhead lights which throw light everywhere and can't aim directly at the text. Sony Reader has a backlight and the Kindle really HAS to have a backlight to make sense. After all, it's going to be on planes, buses and subways and in bed that you're going to be using Kindle the most. How often are you going to be going to the beach??3. No SD card slotIt's really surprising that the designers didn't include this. SD cards are the industry standard. They should be included on most portable devices. What do you do if you want to save audiobooks and music on the Kindle? SD card slots take up such little room that there's no reason why Amazon couldn't have included an SD card slot. It wouldn't make the Kindle any bigger at all. Plus everyone wants an SD card slot. You will soon be able to buy a 16GB SD card for a very low price, so an SD card slot is an efficient, compact way to have extra storage for large files that is detachable and portable.4. The Kindle has to be water-resistant or water-proof and more solidly built.When I get the new improved Kindle I want to be able to throw it in my briefcase and not worry about breaking it. Many Kindle owners complain that the unit is not solidly built. Also, most of the time people who read are reading they are drinking at the same time, or around food and beverages. What if you spill water or even worse coffee with cream and sugar on the Kindle? The Kindle should be designed so these spills wash off easily with a cloth and the unit and screen will not be damaged by liquid.5. The notation and bookmarking features of Kindle are not developed yet. As a reviewer pointed out, you should have advanced note-taking features which can be transferred electronically to other members of your academic class or book club so you can share important passages and quotations and highlights over the internet without delay. (In fact, you are not able to highlight with the current Kindle, only make tabs.) This would be an important advance and would encourage more schools and colleges to adopt Kindles as their replacement for textbooks. Think of how much money and resources could be saved on textbooks if Kindle had features that were transferable to the academic environment. Although textbooks will not be replaced soon, Kindle could take steps that would bring that closer, and that would open up free education to increasing segments of the population.6. Not available internationallyConsidering that most of the world has a more advanced wireless network than we do in the U.S., why isn't Amazon offering Kindle service in its overseas markets? Not being able to use Kindle in overseas territories is a big negative for travelers, who are a large segment of Kindle customers. It would be more useful and intuitive if U.S. customers could download content while traveling overseas, and it's only fair that Amazon's international customers should also be able to buy a Kindle and use it. We are moving towards a global community, where overseas travel and living overseas is normal and frequent, so Kindle MUST be usable and available internationally. Also, that is why Wi-Fi is necessary for Kindle. Many locations domestically and internationally do not have local 3G coverage areas. What do you do to get content if you're out of 3G service range?? Kindle MUST be usable over Wi-Fi and also over a standard internet connection or with a cellular phone connection.7. No color screen, problems with current screenThe new Kindle screen is apparently too small, and the border is too big with too big an unused area. Amazon should keep the surface size the same but increase the usable screen size.Also, the Kindle needs to be color-capable. If you have textbooks and technical books, or children's books or books with illustrations, you need to have color display available. If they haven't perfected color e-ink screens yet, Amazon should put more money into research to perfect them. The return on investment is worth ramping up the color screen manufacturing schedule.8. Kindle needs more free contentAmazon should make it easy for literary groups and amateur or small publishers to make free content available. There should be a lot of public-domain and classic literature and classics and reference books that Kindle owners should be able to download for free or for very low prices, like $0.49 cents or less (or the price of the bandwidth). Not only is there a lot of public domain material available, but more people should read the classics to learn the eternal truths and wisdom that our forebears imparted through their writing. We as civilizations should be studying the Greek and Roman classics and Asian philosophy and literature. The Kindle could be a platform for enhanced educational outreach and could perform a public service and public benefit by vastly increasing the amount of learning available while still making a large profit on current bestsellers, new books and periodicals.9. Amazon charges for blogsApparently Amazon charges for reading blogs on Kindle. While I don't resent Amazon making a big profit and being rewarded handsomely for creating a revolutionary product, many people don't believe they should be charged for reading blogs, and many bloggers want their blogs to remain free to read. If a bloger wants his blog to be free, then there should be a way to read it for fre on the Kindle. If bloggers want to charge a fee to read, then Amazon can charge for those blogs, but not all of them.10. No removeable batteryAs with the backlight, if it means making the Kindle a bit thicker and heavier, it would be worth it if we had a removeable battery. You shouldn't have to mail your Kindle back to Amazon to replace the battery. You should be able to buy extra batteries to have in case you're travelling in the outback or camping and won't have access to electricity. If it had a slot for AAA batteries, that might be even better, because people could use removeable rechargeable batteries or else buy disposable batteries to use when they don't have electricity. The rechargeable AAA batteries would be rechargeable without removing them from the unit, so recharging would still be convenient for rechargeable owners. This would be a practical and open-source free market solution to Kindle battery use.In summary, Kindle 2 is apparently too expensive and too un-developed for me to buy Kindle now. The lack of a backlight in particular, a terrible design mistake, and the prohibitive entry cost for the hardware and the high and unreasonable continuing cost of downloads means I will continue buying standard books, both new and used, until Kindle is perfected and Amazon brings the prices down to make their e-book system more cost-sensible.
I was very disappointed by this game. First of all, it's a little confusing with a black and white screen to tell the difference between the suits. Then, a lot of the games are strange versions of Solitaire. Specifically, my favorite game is Spider Solitaire, and the version this game has is completely different, all for the worse. It sucks.
This only works on the newer Kindles. I have a first generation, and got an error message when I tried to buy the game. I did give it two stars rather than one (or none, which is probably not an option) because I am addicted to Freecell and really would love to play it on my reader. I DOUBT very seriously if this review will ever see the light of day but, if you have a gen1 you will find out soon enough for yourself. Thanks, Amazon.
There are too many glitches in this for me to really enjoy playing it on my Kindle.I am just about ready to delete it.
I couldn't get into this game. It is a decent word search game with typical features, but not one that I would normally play.
This game for the kindle is not fun at all. I think it was a booring game and not intresting.
Not as much fun as I thought it would be.  Would not recommend this game.  Sorry I got the game.
Was not impressed with this game.  Reminds me of something I played as a kid in when in the sixth grade.
I bought this by mistake and only tried to play it once or twice. Not my kind of game, especially on the Kindle.
If I could give this one back I would.  this is just not for me at all.  I would rather have something more challenging than this.
This was my first kindle game. It's ok, and it keeps one occupied for a time if one does not want to read. However, the game itself is confusing. What is the object? How is it scored? If I erase or allow to be erased a "more advanced structure", do I still get the points for making that structure or did I lose them when I erased them? Often you cannot use your skills because the desired spot is not open. What is the purpose of the moving devils? What's the best strategy? It's fun to see the items appear and the animation when you compete a triplet or whatever. But I found that when the game ended, I had no idea how well I had scored or why...
i didnt realy get ths but i wish they made a free trial for this game like they did for ea sudoku.
This game has cute graphics as you "play along." However, it is similar to this company's other game, triple town or whatever it was. Ultimately, it is pointless. What is the goal of the game? What is your strategy? Obviously you want to create as long a word as possible from the letters displayed, but then what? How is the game scored? Does it matter where the letters are chosen from in terms of how big a panda you make? What does your score mean? Ultimately, you play a few times and then lose interest. There's no point to it. You have no choice in the letters displayed, and the game will tell you when there are no more words to be made. Did you get a good score? Was it because of the way you played or because of dumb luck in the letters that were displayed? It's like drinking a totally flavorless beverage. After a few sips, you put it down and move on. I bought this game, quickly got bored, and returned it. This company has cute graphics, but it just cannot seem to make a game that has any challenge to it. You cannot use your brains, you cannot improve your playing skills, you really don't even know why the score is what it is....Sorry Charlie, this just strikes out. I gave it two stars 'cause its panda graphics were so cute....
just don't like it.Maybe I haven't really figued how to win yet but it is frustrating.  It's so easy to lose!
This i have not played because it wont work on my kindle. I like poker though so i hope i find one that works
This game started out okay, but when l got to my highesr score, 4720, kindle rebooted itself & l lost 500 points. OUCH!Then noticed a pattern. Cards are either on a repeat basis, or don't shuffle.It's slow, and unheld card stay. This and the same pairs ALWAYS show up. If you have four of one suit, you'd think you'd have a 25% chance, right? WRONG! More like 1 in 30 of hitting the flush.Like the old game show, Press Your Luck, this game's become too ptedictable. The advice is bad and not all the functions are explained.They need to rework it & maybe add more than just Jacks or Better.
Pretty boring.  Not thought provoking game. The game is confusing at first and continued to be less than expected. I would not recommend the game.
e-ink Kindle games are limited for a reason. The game lacks animations and anything else, wich makes it quite boring. I didn't play it for long. It's free, but there's better free stuff.
it's only Jacks or better and is very slow in moving from one step to the next.
so I won't do it..I downloaded it just to see what the heck it would do on my old paper white thing but it didn't work so I keep wondering what it is doing on here.
I don't like the interface on this one bit, it's too slow. also, I had difficulty with selecting the correct card(s) that I wanted to hold. Using the directional pad would make playing this much more enjoyable rather than hunting around for the right button to press. Nice first try, but the interface needs work and I don't know if it's becuase of a technical issue with the Kindle or the way that it was programmed.
Video Poker for the Kindle is a version of the machine that one would play in casinos.  The game is very slow moving and doesn't offer the quick exciting play of other Kindle games.  The fact that it is free save this from being one star.
No color contrasts - just B&W .... makes it hard to see for me.  I have another computer game of Mahjong and prefer to play it in color on a larger surface.
I enjoy playing this game on my home computer, but it the symbols are soo small on the Kindle. This game is active in my Cloud, can you explain that?  Jewels is also active in the Cloud!
The concept of the game might be fun, but the difficulty of navigating around the cards is terrible.  The controls are quite stiff, which cause a lot of problems of matching the cards.  The contrast on a black and white Kindle is also not good, and for people who have poorer vision, I would not advise them to purchase this game.  I am sorry I did.
This is very similar to Mahjongg Titans which I play on the compluter but this version is very difficult on the Kindle due to visibility.
I love Mahjong on my computer, so when this Kindle version was offered for $.99 I jumped on it.  I'm not as happy with the layouts as they aren't as exciting as the ones on my computer, but still I like playing the game, especially when killing time on the train.  I'm disappointed at a slight annoyance that has been occurring lately... whenever I have one or more tiles off to the side separated by a blank space from the "main pile of tiles," I cannot access them.  No matter which Kindle "arrow" I use, my "cursor" just won't go over there! Because I can't get there, I can't match them with tiles in my main pile, so I have to forfeit the game.  I play only for pleasure, and will keep on playing this game, but it is certainly annoying!  Glad I only paid $.99... I don't think the game is worth any more than that.
I don't play this on my older Kindle. The tiles are black and white and too small to make it fun.
You can't really play cause it keeps telling you what to do. It's about teaching you what to do in a real setting. Boring.
I purchased Blackjack on my Kindle.  Normally, this is a fun, low-key game that is relatively easy to play.  However, the rules for this particular game are difficult to understand.  My husband did not enjoy it, either.  The only good thing is that it was a freebie.
I didn't enjoy this game as much as the other games I play. This  game is more  for people who needs to brush up their skills
This game is like playing slots in vegas with a twist. The board is bigger and it incorperates bingo into it also.This game is ok but atleast the first 30 times i played it i could not cover the bored and its not as if it was my fault because its simply chance there is no skill to it. When i did finally start covering the board it got old very quickly. I was no longer intrigued anymore because its either you clear the board or you dont. There was no more thrill of the game. Sorry if i am dissin your game or somthing but it is my opinion so...yeah.PS any of those looking for a microsized helpful hint if you only have one free spin use it on the twentyth spin because it is the most expensive and will save you a few points
Slingo is a kindle game that combines both slots and bingo to make slingo. I first got this game on my standard kindle,and it worked good. After receiving my Kindle Paperwhite and downloading the game on that as well, it didn't work. It takes a long time to load and, after lots of tries, it can't seem to work. It still works on kindle but it's a waste of money for those people who bought it on the paperwhite. Though it is a decent game, it's a shame it doesn't seem to load on kindle. It flashes and the screen turns white. Hopefully amazon will be able to fix this error. Other than that, the games actually quite fun. I would recommend it to anyone who has the standard kindle. I don't know if it works on kindle touch, but I read a lot of reviews saying that slingo doesn't work on their paperwhite and experience the same technical difficulties. A game I recommend isGrid Detective.If it worked on the paperwhite then I'd definitely say that this game is great, and it's a great way to have some fun.Gina Bertaina, age eleven
There are many games which are very well suited to the Kindle... Check the screen shots before you purchase this. IMHO, this is not well suited to Kindle at all.It's very difficult to see the board squares.  The "trades" are displayed in a very confusing fashion, and it's difficult to figure out which properties you are trading.I paid $.99 for it, but do not play it.  Too much work!  (Not a knock on the publisher, there's simply too much "information" for this to fit well on a Kindle sized screen.)
Not a real fan of this one. Sorry I paid for it. Can't see who owns what, can't tell where I am on the board, never could fig out how to do a trade. Sorry love the game for real but not any good on the small screen.
thought there would be more puzzles then thy were fun to do but not much of  a challange think I'll stick to the newspaper
I really didn't check into this one enough before I got it.  It is the word jumble puzzles like a lot of newspapers run where you unscramble several words, then take the selected letters to make a new word to unscramble so you get the answer to a really lame joke.  OK if you enjoy that kind of puzzle.  I don't.
You get the three word jumbles, you solve them, that's about it. I'm just really glad that it was free, otherwise I would have felt ripped off. If there were more, and for free, then I'd get them. Otherwise nope, there are many more options for games.
I bought this for my old Kindle and because it's in black and white it's just not that much fun.
Hard to control and deliver to desired opening. You tend to keep over-shooting where you want to stop and turn unless there happens to be a wall there.
I didnt like it because it froze up my kindle.I had to wait for my mom to delete it of my kindle to make my kindle work again.I wouldnt recommend this for anybody.Only if you want to go threw lots of trouble.
This game works as predicted but I was personnaly disappointed in the game maker's penchant for violence. I guess that should not surprise me given the time period of the setting but I lost interest when I realized that my character got ahead by punishing other characters.
ok
just ok  not much of a contest
I never realized that Tic Tac Toe can be boring but it seems to be when your the only one playing.
I really like playing chess but this app has alot of downsides.It doesn't do the standard opening of a game, it lags a lot, and it automatically gives you a queen for a pawn when you make it to the other side. Not that I wouldn't have normally chosen one, I just think you should be able to choose. And the thing is is that I'm pretty sure it lets the kindle choose.A cool feature this could have in the next version is an option for a custom board set up like they have in checkers. That would be cool. I'm glad I got it on sale though.
This doesn't much of anything other than just add another wimpy add on. Just another product that's a must have. Not!
Quite frankly I was hoping for more options that the simple number slide game this turned out to be. I'm just glad this one was free.
I don't like this game and it is really too bad I have to keep writing in order to submit this...
this type of game does not hold my interest.  I got it for my granddaughter, but she didn't like it either.  I guess we don't have the patience for it.
I used to love this game as a child.  Maybe my age has something to do with it, but I found it to be a bit tedious to use.  I didn't find the tiles too easy to move around on the board.  Honestly, I'm glad it was a "freebie", and that I didn't spend money on it.
I get the function of this game, but it's just not my style. Couldnt get into playing this game, deleted it after 1 week.
Good game for those who like playing number games, but I like word games. But still entertaining if you like numbers.
This game is pretty frustrating and easy to give up on quickly.  With so many other fun free kindle games to play, this one takes a back seat and I often forget that I even own it.  It's one of those games that will eventually get deleted to make room for something more exciting in the future.
I can definitely understand the appeal of this game, and I think most people would enjoy it.  However, if you are like me, and numbers are not your thing, I would recommend passing on it.  I know, I should have realized in advance that I wouldn't enjoy it, but hey, you live and you learn.
I fond this difficult to negotiate. not like the ones we used to have as a kid, where the slider worked so well.I got really frustrated with the thing.
Number slide is a good game. I recommend this to teens and adults who like challenges. It didn't turn out the way i thought it would, but still a great game.
I find this a rather cumbersome game on Kindle.  I was hoping it would be easier but more mentally challenging.  In my opinion the board game is better.  Sometimes it is better to stick to the old ways.
I do nor think it is user friendly. It does not keep my interest like other games that I have acquired.
I played a part of it but didn't like it much. It was a bit boring for me and a bit too sluggish and too much for me!! I would recommend this to only those people who love vampire's and not to those who just like &#34;Choice of Games&#34;!!
Thinking this was an actual game, I grabbed it when the price dropped.  It seems like nothing more than a "story" and not like a game at all.  Others have rated it much higher, but I'm just not personally enjoying this "game".  I'll try it a little more before I abandon it, just glad it was on sale.
My husband likes word searches and was happy to find some.  They were exactly what we expected, but then we realized that there is only fifty puzzles in it. That didn't take very long to finish. You can clear the board and do it again, but after awhile you can memorize them.
I know this game is popular with some people, but I just can't get into it. It seems pretty simple, but it's not.
i have played this game on other divice against the computer and on many times i try to play this game and other mind games because as a teenager i need it but anyway i play this all the time and have won the game once i mean i understand this is a stupid reason but its fun to win and if your a major gamer with any kind of game you get angry so i would suggest some other game but if all you want is a free game go right ahead this is just my oppinion:)
The lion always wins no matter what!  It will always win, so it must be rigged.  You should try to make this game fair for everyone, not just Amazon.
Not sure why I got this one.  Guess it brings me back to when I was a kid.  My grandkids enjoy it.
I couldn't seem to &#34;get&#34; this one.  Maybe will try later but I enjoy word games more than this. Thanks.
I have yet to win this game I have had it for a while but the kindle keeps beating me.
It's kind of a tic tac toe with more graphics, not much fun.  the game is decided in one or two moves only, once you start winning or losing, not much more you can do.
It can be won or not but it is rather simple minded and I have not found it thought provoking enough to attempt to build a strategy to win.
The grids are too small and the game is just boring. I remember playing "dots" on the computer as a kid but the grids were much bigger. There are a lot of potential improvements I wish they would make.
This is a good way to kill time while waiting in the doctor's office, or during lunch, or whenever. Is not my favorite game in the word, but simple.
this game should be a classic, but sadly the digital version falls short of my expectations. I would not recommend
If you're looking for a somewhat mindless game to kill some time, this would be it.  My sister and I would play this game often when we were little, so it brought back some memories, but I definitely find that there are some far better games for my Kindle.
On the dots and boxes game. I was very hard to win and I didn't enjoy it. This game is also harder for kids to do.
I HAVE SO MANY HIDDEN ITEMS IN A PUZZLE......ON MY COMPUTER........BUT IN BLACK AND WHITE ON THE KINDLE THE ITEMS ARE TOOOOO SMALL FOR MY OLD EYES.....SO I DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS THAT MUCH...AND THE OTHER THING IT IS IN BLACK AND WHITE.......I DO NOT HAVE FIRE........but wish i did.......OVER ALL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENJOYABLE GAME......IF I HAD IT IN COLOR.....BUT BLACK AND WHITE ON A KINDLE DOESN'T WORK TOO WELL.....
I wasn't happen with this game because it is so small and dark on my Kindle, it is very hard to see anything.  It is really hard to find the items you are looking for even with making portions of the game bigger.  I am a fan of Hidden Expedition on my computer and was bummed out that this game didn't work so good on a black and white kindle.  It would work much better in color and a light.
At the end of the game, it's just another game about finding words. Most will be extremely rare to actually know them. There's also not really a goal to the game, you rack up points and then...nothing. That's it. Keep playing if you like.
Kind of like a word search. Kind of like word train. Mix em together and you have thread words. Ok for passing time but nothing I could get into for too long
I did not enjoy this game at all. It was tedious and boring. Glad it was offered free...would not waste cash on it.
I really didn't like it, I guess it was overly complicated for what it needed to be or else it was too easy and they complicated it unnecessarily.
The game is played by selecting adjacent letters from rows of random letters, to create a word.  This game may have been produced in England - I recognized a few words that might be used there, but probably never in the U.S.  The chief knock against the game is that many of the &#34;words&#34; that it accepts will never be found in a North American dictionary -- and possibly in an English dictionary from any locale.  As a result, when the game indicates there are still words left that haven't been selected, you resort to organized &#34;random&#34; selections until you find one that the game accepts -- like trying to open a safe by holding one number constant and trying all possible permutations that include that one number.So to complete the game, the eventual tactic is not to search for a word, it's to try all the combinations until the game accepts one of your choices.  Then you look at it and mumble to yourself -- &#34;THAT's no word -- why waste my time trying to locate nonsense syllables.&#34;  Soon you lose interest and move on to something else.A game in which you searched and found real words could be educational, and useful for someone for whom English is a second language.  This is not that game.
Just another takeoff on the find hidden word game where you circle the word. In this one you draw a line between the letters. If that is your cup of tea you will enjoy it.
Not my kind of game.
I really didn't understand this game at first. An even when i did figure it out I didn't get the point.
i do notlike this game at all but daught in law loves playing it on my kindle this is not my type of game
This game is just one of those STUPIEDLY BORING games.  At least its BETTER than every word which IS the dumest game on the kindle.(but this is not a reviw for every word so Iill go back to tauking about thead words.)  I WOULD NOT GET THIS GAME EVEN IF IT IS  FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.o did i say it is free? THAT BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A SUIPED GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-[
This game will bore you to tears. That's if your tears will stay to watch you play this game. repetitive
This game was ok it was kind of hard to play on the older kindle! But fun to pass the time!
okThis really sucks now. I was finally able to purchase a Galaxy Note From Samsung Have they fixed the woes of the world no of course not but they are doing things that help.I do wish the Galaxy Note were a bit bigger. Still it does have a voice phone built in to it. Two Cameras.I will do almost everything a Samsung will do that the Fire will do. Yes it is that good. Dang it to is that much better than before. The same price as a kindle Fire and it has GPS a Phone it Can read books Listen to radio and TV watch Movies. Hey now if Amazon will bring their price down Obama will give up on reelection. Let us hope for all of it right.I am seeing a pattern here. It started with Billy G and now it is going overboard. We even have presidents who think they are Arnold Palmer. I do hope you have all heard the joke about JC thinking he was Arnold. What my big gripe is that kindle bought Audible .com now they can sell books with speech. so after them going through a big deal in the courts to be able to use Text to Speech they put out a piece of equipment that does not have that perk in it. I think that sucks. Now after they did such a biggie of using a device with android in it and getting the whole thing in a big circle of wagons now they do the pooch like I said not the way to be going. let us get it back together ladies.dray
Sadly, I will be returning the fire.  There were a few problems with my Fire.  The touch screen was not very responsive.  Streaming Netflix was not smooth and the picture would stutter every few seconds.  Magazine selection for Fire is still very limited.  The browser for the Internet is slow and Google as the search engine is not used in the Fire.  I am inclined to try the Nook Tablet instead.
Game works well but it is quite boring after the first few tries. The main goal is to get your score over 300. Good for playing at the end of a day because it doesn't require much thought.
i played it once or twice but wasn't interested too much in it.  i probably would not recommend it to others. not my favorite game for sure.
this was a slightly confusing game for me and it may be very confusing for younger children. the controls are much to advanced and the screen is TO organized. its organized so much that its deorganized. does anybody know what the point of the hat is? i am very dissappointed and if you are looking for some real text adventures, try choice of the vampire,choice of broadsides,choice of the dragon,dusk world,and affairs of the court. these are quite simple,but provide a smalll challenge:trying not to die.
I tried this puzzle.  Had never tried this type before.  Didn't really interest me much, but that's just me.  Opinion is neutral, neither liked or disliked.  Decided to try it to see what it was as it was different than what I usually play.
For me this was not a fun game and I do love puzzles, but I did not get any enjoyment and it has been deleted from my kindle library.
This is a free game offered to amazon kindle owners. It may be a fun game and may be easy to figure out how to do so. But I spent five minutes trying to figure out what the goal is and how to attain it, without success.
I tried but just couldn't get interested in this game/puzzle.  I might look it up again and see if I do better. It's a bit more labor intensive than  want a game I'm playing to pass time in a doctor's office to be.
I do not like this game.  It is too complicated to play.  I would not recommend this game to anyone.
It's interesting to try to place the tiles in the right rowand column, but it takes time, and many of the picturesyou end up with bear little resemblance to the real thing,especially if you have a black and white e-reader.
I have bought all the generations of kindles so I am well aware of their shortcomings and strengths.  This is the first Kindle that does not live up to it's expectations.  The touch screen is unresponsive at times and I find I have to tap multiple times.  Sometimes it is slow to respond and I end up overtapping and jumping pages.  It is not a smooth reading experience. I am returning it and keeping the Kindle Keyboard.
finance manager is not very useful. It is time consuming to enter things and hard to remove data. I will likely never use this app.
After enjoying the FREE game Pixel Perfect, I thought that the modest $0.99 investment for this game would at least reward me with more puzzles of the same variety. Instead I was disappointed with how simplistic the puzzles were and how bad a lot of the finished pictures turned out to be. I'm not expecting modern art or anything, but it looks like the developers of this game rushed the development and put out the bare minimum to earn some quick money.The level of difficulty is rather insulting and don't expect to feel at all challenged in the long run. It scratches the Pixel Perfect puzzle itch, but not in a satisfying way. At the very least what it lacked in terms of puzzle quality it made up for things in terms of sheer number of puzzles. Ranging from the basic 8x8 grid all the way to a 25x25 grid, this game will still keep you preoccupied.
I enjoyed pixel perfect puzzles so I though picture cross would be similar. Layout is way different and overall frustrating to use. Found myself not enjoying this game at all.
I've never been a fan of crossword puzzles and this game reinforces that. You like scrabble or the daily crossword puzzles in newspapers you'll like this.
There are just better things to do with my time. It takes too long to finish or get stuck. i hate unsolved puzzles. but  people who like crossword puzzles might go for it.
The concept was pretty good, but I got very frustrated after very few levels.  The hints are awful, so once you get stuck, you're done.  Also, there were some words I consider offensive.
Something I downloaded for free to see what it was like. I couldn't get into it. Not my type of game
Not fun!
I find it very difficult to do in black and white.
In my opinion, it's hard to play this game on a regular Kindle because some of the jewels are too close in shape.  I think it is probably better on a kindle Fire so that it would be in color.
I tried to remove Jewels from my Kindle and was not successful!  Can you explain that to me?  Thank you.
Confusing to understand and that makes it undesirable. I would not recommend it unless you are very smart. Do not get.
This is an okay game for the kindle not my favorite.  Could be better.  It isn't very clear or concise.
i tried this game but it is a very logical game and unless this is something that you definitely have to have skills of deduction to succeed in this game.
I found this game boring and dull. It may be good for some but definitely not for me. It was free...so that's ok.
I do not understand this one.  I get too frustrated to try for very long.  I need a game that will hold my interest, this one, only confuses me.  I am definitely doing something wrong.
I bought this to play some thing different but I did not like this game at all. Would not rec this to anyone.
This was fun to play. The size leaves much to be desired.  It's just too small!!!!I liked it but it was difficult to see.
it's been the hardest one for us to figure out and I've had help .Haven't given up yet may change my mind.
Did not much care for this book. There is alot of moving back and forth with the arrows to get where I wanted to go.
Sorry this 63 year old lady couldn't figure it out so i could never play it and learned how to play
Takes to must to get the pieces to move!the first game I played went o. but after that, I couldn't get the inventory to move. and when it did move it was usually the wrong one.
Not my favorite--I did not care for this game but others may.  It just isn't something that holds my interest.
this game could be fun for people who like this types.  But this just isn't something i enjoyed.  word games or crosswords are more my thing.
I downloaded this but couldn't get it to work. So honestly I don't know if I like it or not. Figured I'd post this as a review in case others had similar problem.
Not what I was expecting when I downloaded it.  The instructions are very unclear and without them it makes the game difficult to play.
I don't understand this game!  I don't know if it is me or if the instructions are confusing but I couldn't get the conceptof this game and couldn't play it!  It was frustrating!  I couldn't get the parts to go how I wanted them to, heck I couldn'teven get started!
For me this game was boring and not worth putting on my kindle. I did not get any enjoyment and it has been deleted from my kindle library
I am not a dumb person but this game sure made me feel that way. I had trouble with the easy level and kept looking at the solutions. This game was not fun for me.
and it seemed hard to navigate on the basic Kindle that I have.  I still have it and perhaps I'll look at it another day.
This game is really lame.  Perhaps a child would like it but I was bored very quickly.  It was not what I expected.
Not quite as fun  more difficult for myself and grandchildren.  I will keep trying to get this game.  It is a changle
Probably a pretty good game but guess I didnt have the patience to figure it out and couldn't really get in to it
Not very interesting and downright boring after a few times of playing.  Not a fun or challenging game in any way.
I just didn't like this game.  I gave it a few tries and it didn't grow on me.  I quess its just not for me.
Nice game .only it could of been easier to play .I mean ...what if the person (on a KINDLE Touch )had weak fingers and could not play this game?
Could't figure it out . Taking it to my Granson to see if he can figure it out for me.
I just don't think a game like this is suited for the black and white Kindle.  I had a trial copy and deleted it.
I cana't seem to get the hang of this one. Its graphics ae alos a bit small for repeated use. I might delete it.
I found the rules and navigation through this product to be difficult at first. It was easier on the game show network
I Just haven't liked the way this game works.  It's not played the same way as the TV game show.
Gem Falls isn't a very challenging game for one of my age but I still enjoy it occasionally.  It's not very colorful.
buy JEWELS instead. already have jewels? save your money. jewel drop is the cheap k-mart style knock off version of tetris. w/out the rotating. basically trying to match too many shapes w/little room to spare. NOT the worst game i've bought tho.
I keep losing my notes....so I gave this two stars....This should come with better instructions and explanations on how to use it. I definitely would not recommend this to my friends.
As yet I have not used it.  I glanced at it but I don't think would be of much help to me.
I HAVE TO USE IT MORE TO REALLY BE ABLE TO RATE IT. AS WITH ALL NEW THINGS IT TAKES TIME AND USE GETTING TO KNOW WHAT IT WILL REALLY DO.
I bought this because it had the best of both worlds... a calendar and a notepad, but I find the calendar to be a little convoluted to use.  Just too many steps to enter an appt. or note on a calendar date.  When the date was past, I tried going in to delete the appt. which I could do, but the * still remained on that date.  Maybe I just haven't used it enough to figure out how to edit... perhaps... but it's still not as "clean" a process as I would have liked.  Tried to return it, but apparently it cannot be returned for a refund... oh well... I've learned my lesson.... that being... you get what you pay for.
I have a bit of knowledge of the bible, (preachers kid) and I simply study it because I am Christian, and it definitely has some hard questions. It isn't all easy cheesy which is good. But this quiz game is very basic and gets old answering questions in my opinion.
Calculator is not user friendly, not intuitive and may be better for higher end Kindles, but for $79 version, just not great. The instructions are not clear, so help was pretty much useless. Sorry...was hoping to love this...not.
I have not had a chance to view all the games of the Solitare Buddy Gold so I really cannot give a review of the games.
Not happy with this product at all so far...I just wanted a standard solitaire game and instead this is a collection of odd varieties of the game.  Someone will like it I'm sure, but for me it is a big YUCK!
DONT BUY this is CHEEPLY programed software there are better faster more advanced carefully programed version online. If you are interested in trying the online version follow the directions below 1. Go to this link[...]  2. click on math games. 3. search for lemonade stand or a another version coffee stand. 4. Decide to write a review like mine. THANK YOU
Weather completely unpredictable, even if you buy the Weather Channel app - from nearly freezing when you set up to over 100 degrees when you sell?  Give me a break.I learned not to spend down to zero in case the IRS raids.  Oh, and - to have a lot of cups (I mean tens of thousands) in case a parade goes by or a summer camp buys you out.  And not to price your lemonade at $4 a cup because you won't sell anything at all.  Having learned that, I routinely made tens of thousands of dollars (edited to add:  "make that hundreds of thousands of dollars" - and don't ask me why I played it again.  Just to prove I could do it, I guess.), but I can't say it was enjoyable.A kid might like it, but I would not have even when I was a kid.  I certainly don't think it teaches you much about business.  Well, maybe, but I doubt it is the lessons the writers of the game intended.I'll take my games either a bit more mindless or a bit more realistic.
Lemonade Stand pros:entertans you for like 15 min.(that might just be a con)CONS:TOTALY WRONG WEATHER PREDICIONSNO SPECAL EVENTSNO ACHIVMENTSNOT VERY MANY AND POOR UPGRADESBAD GRAPHICSBOREINGGGGG..............TOO SIMPLEJungle Juice is wwwwwwaaaaaaaayyyyyyy betterOpps,I mean Jungle Juice is way betteri am serrprised that the Average Customer Review is so high?????????????????????????????????Two stars @@OOOHEY DONT BUY THIS GAME BUY JUNGLE JUI...well by now you SOULD have gotten the pointbut if you have not, dont say i didnt warn you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have 2 versions of Catan and this Kindle version was not fun for all. Between me and my kids none of us found it user friendly and for $5 it was a disappointment. At some point maybe I will really spend some time on it and figure it out.
Way too basic for any real value.  But you can make some simple lists as advertised but again I would not use it expecting it to be anything to use real seriously.
Do not reach the quality of an EverNote for mobile phone. I used it a couple of day and then erased it from my kindle ebook.
Typing a "checklist" into my Kindle is just too cumbersome to use regularly. Why go to the bother of getting my Kindle out to scribble a list when pens/paper are readily available?  And how likely am I to use a list I typed into my Kindle?  That would only happen if I had my Kindle with me when I needed my list and, even then, I think I'd rather rely on my memory.  It's just not likely nor convenient for regular use.  &lt;shrug> I give this a *blah* rating.  My first (and only) list is still in there.  I never used it.
My Checklist has No auto fill or suggestions, typing on kindle is not great. I don't think I will use much.
I thought this was going to be a great way to keep list, but I don't really use it all that much. It's design is okay, but i think it could be better.
Every time I try to play it I get to the exact same 'age' and it freezes. I cannot go on or back or even just exit the game. It was interesting until it froze but after three or four tries I just had to remove it.
okay to play but a bit boring. you can only use the letters in a linked sequence. not as fun as the original bookworm game.
I have the game for my computer and know the difference between the two.  It is cumbersome to manipulate the blocks.  Not a game I play on Kindle.
This game makes one think, and the instructions are not easy to understand.  Not fun to play unless you enjoy math.
I thought I would enjoy this game for my Kindle but it is too much for my brain - definitely discovered I much prefer word games.
This game makes you think, and is slow.  My friend would use it to quiz me and others before quizzes or tests, and it kind of worked.  Lots of problems, but not entertaining enough.  I'm glad it was free!
After you catch on to how it works all puzzles seem to be the same. Kids can learn a lot from it, but a bit boring for the adults.
Not a fan yet, but not because game is bad, because I don't get it.  I will keep at it though!
I thought this would be a fun little game for me beings that it was free. I really didnt like it but I have never been a fan of math so its just my opinion. If you love math and like free games then this is the game for you
I am like math but for some reason, this game didn't gel with me.  Maybe after I play with it for a while it will get better, but I doubt it.  It may be okay for someone else.  I choose game because it was math.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE GAME IS TO BE PLAYED. THE EXAMPLES DO NOT MAKE IT EXPLICIT ENOUGH  SO THAT I CAN PLAY THE GAME THE WAY IT SHOULD BE PLAYED.
I was looking for a challenge outside the word puzzle &#34;world.&#34;  The description of this game should have stated that it was geared for the middle school age group, which it is.  So if you are a pre-high schooler, this would be a fantastic game for you.
I don't enjoy math so this was a bit too much work for me.  I really needed a help with this one.  LOL
I was disappointed in this game.  It is very slow acting.  It doesn't react correctly.  I lke to play these type of games online and this was not at all the same.
entertaining yet boring  at the same time.it is good for waiting for your apointment but not goood when your trying to find something to do.
Falling Blocks is so not cool. it gets boring and difficult before five minutes. don't waste your time; buy Fish Tank or something else.
For some reason, I can't seem to get into this game.  I really just don't like it at all.  I can't really say why, I just don't.
I have an iPod Touch 4 and that version is way better! This is totally not worth even a dollar. I think that this active content should be free and not even at least cost a penny!
Too hard to follow.  Even the kids didn't get it.  Not exactly like the card game and you really need to bang the kindle to get the card to move.
I've always heard what a good game Uno is, and it's supposed to be popular. I've never played it, and thought that this would be a good way to learn the game since the Kindle edition would have a tutorial, and I'd be playing against the computer. Apart from bridge, which made my head spin when my mother tried to teach me how to play it, this is the most complicated card game with the most arcane rules that I've ever seen. I am just completely lost. I can't even complete a full game, so this rating is a bit unfair. I can't tell you how it compares to playing it with actual cards and people, or how well the game works-it didn't come up at all the first time I clicked on  Uno, and took a while to load on the second attempt, and I don't know if that's normal for it. It's somewhat possible that I might learn it over time, but I do think this is a game for people who already know how to play Uno, and not for those who don't. I think I'll stick to Cribbage, although sadly, there isn't a Kindle version of Cribbage.
unfair. when I have 1 card or a few it changes and I have 5 cards.I want a refund.Who ever invented uno doesn't know how you play it.Oh how bought those Redskins.
This game is two hard to descern the suits in black an white.  I may figure it out in time. But it is not apparently esay
No one ever seems to play uno the right way. Everyone has their own home rules. I wish this game allowed for customizing the game play.
not really good! TRUST ME! 2 play modes, quick and tournament. quick is worst of both! 4 player, classic rules. NO other options! tournament is kinda good, with the full diversity of 2-4 player numbers and game modes. but their is just no way to change number of players, game modes or rules in quick play... and the button reactions are fairly slow. i wish a little more thought would have gone into this game for player friendly-ness and options! P.s. no pass and play style or playing with friends in anyway!
i guess i am the sacrificial lamb, since their were no other comments. there is only 1 way to win. and that is to match your card to a pre-patterned card. no 5 in a row bingo win. waste of money even if it were free! btw way you play 4 computer players, no less no more.. only 2 play options: number call speed and number of cards... not worth it!!!!!!!!
Was excited about this game at first thinking had found a new word game . However, after playing it many times, I find that it is disappointing because it does not allow some words to be completed, showing message that &#34;this word is not in our dictionary&#34; PUHLEEZE! We are talking simple words with 9 letters or so.  The message comes up before the word has been fully completed, which does not allow the full word to be entered in.  Seems to work best with words of three four or five letters only.  If you're a Mahjong addict, look elsewhere.
to understand for a newbie.  i whomped my ai opponents but i do not know why.  what is fun about that.  i could understand what i needed to do for each level as far as laying out cards but not how points were scored.  what is the fun of winning if you do not know how you did it.  help not helpful.
the options are boring, the categories are for kids, no challenge whatsoever...i have tried brain games and this is definitely not one that will help your memory...disappointed
I am afraid that Gramma  describes me too well. I find that I cannot move fast enough on the Kindle to play this game. I had almost the same game on my computer and with the mouse I could play it and last a long time. With this I wipe out VERY fast. No fun so I don't play it anymore.
I bought this game hoping for a challenge but it turned out to be very silly and boring for me.  I guess I was expecting something else; perhaps a word game that is more challenging.
I have played this on line for years, but do not enjoy it on the kindle keyboard.  It may be easier on one of the touch versions.
I bought this game hoping to brush up on my cribbage to play with my grandmother.  Unfortunately, I don't really remember how to play and this game does not offer any directions, instruction or tutorials.  So I am lost and I lose every time :(  I guess I'll have to look the rules up online...
the font is adjustable on the puzzle but it does not help the words at the bottom get any easier to see. they are very small and difficult to see.. nice idea but a disappointment
Boring and hard to find anything. I haven't tried more than a couple of times. No big loss, it was cheap anyway
was more interested in regular solitair games.  I will probably learn to play some of them and possibily emjpy them
It has a good collection of various types of solitaire. However, it is too slow. As you click on the cards to move it take a very, very long time to move. It takes the fun out of playing.
i don't know these games and can't get into it. I have a black and white kindle and find it hard to enjoy the cards with the red missing
THIS ONE HAS A FEW GAMES I HAVE NOT SEEN LPLAYED SO I AM HAVING TO LEARN TO PLAY THEM......OTHERWISE IT WILL BE A GOOD GAME TO HAVE......HOWEVER......IT WOUJLD BE MORE FUN ON KINDLE FIRE.
I am still not sure how to play the different collections..when I get bored I try again..I would not recommend to anyone to buy it.
