I'm had my Kindle for a week and just love everything about it!  I am a quick reader and have had a shelf space problem for years.  More importantly, I'm a road warrior and on flights, I had to haul around a lot of books and magazine and newspapers.  Now, I can get them ALL on the kindle...for a size of basically a paperback book, I can have LOTS and LOTS of reading materials.  I also take the bus to work and it's always a pain to deal with the size of newspapers in a tight space.  Problem now solved!All the books I want are available on kindle and it's so easy to buy books.  Books get delivered to me in less than 1 minute!  It really works and I can shop on my PC or via the kindle.The other great thing is that I am able to send my own documents (word etc) thru amazon kindle application and read it on my kindle device.  Amazon charges $0.10 per document to convert my files to kindle readable format, that's inexpensive enough to be a no brainer.  TXT files can be read without conversion and therefore no charge if you copy it from PC to kindle via USB cable (kindle shows up like an external hard drive).Battery life is great.  I've been reading may 3-4 hours a day and it's been 4 days and battery is at 50% still.My complaints/Areas for improvement:1) Kindle sorting function can be better with a lot of books (folder concept would be great)2) Would love to the the iphone/ipod on screen "flip page" function.  That would make this feel even more like reading on paper and more natural.3) The page turning tab on the right is too long and sometimes, when I'm holding the device, I hit that by mistake and have to page back4) Kindle Store needs improvement:a) On PC, after I buy a book, kindle store returns me to the "main page", not where I was browsing before.  So I have to go through ALL the lead in tabs againb) On the kindle, Kindle Store doesn't have all the book search sort functions available.  For example, I can't sort by newest published date on my kindle but can do this on my PC.But overall, this is worth every penny.  Every avid reader or frequent traveler needs one!
Order Date: 12/16 Delivered on: 1/28 to SF Bay Area.Initial very general impressions/thoughts are:WEB BROWSER- Web browser is very basic so keep your expectations low for general web usage. It's very hit or miss as to whether a specific site can function with this browser. Today's web really needs either a touch screen or a mouse. But I still am glad it's there. Hope Kindle 2.0 retains it but better implemented. This will require a hardware & software change. That said, this is really a side-issue as Internet usage is better served on a real PC anyway; buy another product like a 10" screen sized mini laptop if you want satisfactory portable Internet.E-BOOK READER- LOVE it for it's real use as a text e-book reader. It feels very personal and intimate as an overall product very quickly. For this it's a definite two thumbs up. Screen is excellent for readability with black letters on a light grey background.  Readability is enhanced by quick font changes (6 sizes). The flash when you change pages is quick and no worse than the pause to change a real book's page. The screen does not show fingerprints. I haven't tested it in direct sunlight yet.PHYSICALITY- Very lightweight so not tiring to hold for long periods. However I just ordered a small toss pillow so I can prop it up on my lap or in bed so I can free up both arms and just need to change the pages as I read.HANDLING/PAGE TURNING ISSUE- I can agree that it is hard to freely handle without changing pages. Hitting ALT + aA (font changing key) allows you to pull up one of the "screen savers" which locks up all buttons and keys except the same ALT + aA which you hit to unlock it. Amazon is calling this a sleep mode which it automatically adopts after 10 minutes of no key usage. The "screen savers" are random; a selection of what I would call "bookplate"-type pictures like what people put in physical books so they can write their name on a label and put it in physical books. I'm using this feature when not actively reading as a way to deal with this ergonomic issue. It's hard to understand Amazon's thinking over this product design feature. The page turning buttons absolutely could be smaller.INCLUDED COVERCASE- The included cover case is a disaster in my opinion because it too easily allows the Kindle to fall out of it on the right side. But read the product manual on how to correctly attach it such as it is and make do until a third party comes out with a better design. It does add product protection for now and gives a good way to hold the Kindle on the left side when you fold back the cover. It also adds worthwhile protection when closed and does stay secured when you use the attached elastic strap over the right side to hold the cover down.RECHARGING- It does recharge within 2 hours but plan on doing recharging frequently. I obviously haven't had it long enough to report much on the battery life but it did need recharging after modest usage within 2 days since I played a lot with the web features. The use of Whispernet drains the battery pretty fast. I'd be curious to know if adding a solar panel could supply enough power for simple reading alone of already downloaded material.WHISPERNET- Whispernet is FAST! I had preordered I think 6-7 books and Amazon Daily(a general topic blog). Kindle was packaged in the power turned off mode but Whispernet turned on. I first turned Kindle on after plugging it in to start the charging up process. It had already downloaded all the books and Amazon Daily by the time it had initialized and pulled up Amazon's Welcome to the Kindle memo!NAVIGATING AROUND- Navigating/bouncing around amongst my various types of reading material (books/newspapers/blogs) is taking me some time to understand how best to do. It's hard to describe this succinctly as I haven't fully mastered it yet. I get to where I want to eventually but I can feel lost during the process. I'm sure this will improve with practice. I don't want to unduly praise or damn this aspect just now as a consequence. Part of this is because the overall feature set is so rich and Amazon is giving you a lot of bang for the buck.PRICINGI don't think it's that overpriced as a first generation especially given that Whispernet is included, some Internet ability, a sizable feature set, includes 2nd day delivery costs, a cover case of some sort,etc. A $200 price tag is what it needs so as to sell like hotcakes is all.MUSIC/SPEAKER- I haven't tried the MP3 or Audible book feature yet so I can't comment. I also haven't seen much feedback on this aspect of Kindle from other users either. The speaker is on the top back of Kindle which would be covered by the included covercase so I'm quite curious as to how loud the mono speaker is.NEWSPAPERS- Newspapers - I have started the trial subscription to both The NY Times and The Wall St Journal - both papers I don't normally read anyway so this is just to see if a downloaded version is worth the cost. As others have noted, it is a once daily download and doesn't include all of what you get in either the physical or web versions. Kindle does store each daily copy in folders so when I go to the main Menu right now and choose NY Times, I see yesterday and today's copies stored there. I'm not sure at what point the older editions will disappear on their own. Longer Kindle users have implied I believe about 7 issues before the older ones drop off.DISPLAYING TIME- A cool keyboard tip is ALT +T will show the current time for a few seconds. I don't recall seeing this noted in the formal docs but you can see a picture if you look at the user-supplied photos of Kindle on Amazon's web site; same place for user tips on how to secure Kindle better in its case using velcro, etc.WHAT MADE ME BUY A KINDLE??- I live in a one bedroom apartment which is starting to seriously run out of room for more books.- I own some cockatiel birds who love to destroy the more exposed of my books slowly over time by little nibbling sessions. I have to throw towels over piled up books on tables or hide them under stacks of magazines or sacrifice already read paperbacks to them in order to protect the books underneath I want to keep.- I can read just released hardbacks cheaper as an e-book. Plus there's tons of free books for e-readers.- I can carry lots of books around in a slim portable container.- I wear reading glasses so I have to position items just so in order to read anything. I like to read in bed and due to time constraints I often have to do this more often now to get any reading done. A few chapters before I go to sleep on worknights for instance. Having to just get one page in just the right position rather than keep repositioning for two is a big help. Plus I don't have to struggle to hold Kindle open like you do with a paperback.WHY THE KINDLE AND NOT THE SONY?- The backing of Amazon which I've bought from for over 10 years now. I feel they are big guns enough to have the potential to drive Kindle into a more mainstream product which will cause it to really take off. Out of the gate they offer over 4 times more copyrighted e-books than Sony does. I'm hoping this is the next Palm Pilot or iPod.STEVE JOBS' COMMENT- I definitely don't agree with Steve Jobs comment that less people read books now so why concentrate on a new eReader. Someone I once worked with in the mid-90's dished the Internet which was just taking off because she felt it would stop people from general reading of books. That hasn't happened. Kindle will actually have me reading more as it solved a plethora of issues I've noted above. I love to read and I always will. Kindle makes it easier and cheaper to read and read and read....my problem now is I don't want to buy books unless they are e-books!NON-TEXT ISSUESColor and Graphics, etc.- Lack of color is an issue but it's just a technology one and I've every confidence someone will R&D; this into reality eventually.- Charts, graphics, etc. Kindle/eInk can show pictures, drawings, charts. For those who have seen the Teeth and The Body chart at the end of Sage-ing While Age-ing, this is in the eBook version as well. It's correctly shown and just like in the book, it's hard to read just because it is meant to be in a bigger format than either a Kindle or a normal sized hardback book.- Photos. Kindle can show photos but they are not high quality. But it's enough to give you some visual feedback. I've got plenty of hardbacks that don't show photos that well; particularly biographies showing photos from family albums, ie non-professional photos taken on lower capable cameras. That's the same quality you'll get on Kindle.OVERALL OPINIONIf you do or want to read a lot of text-based books, Kindle is a ready-for-primetime product in my opinion. Just be aware of how easy it is to buy books on impulse. If that's already your issue, Kindle will only exasperate it!Hope the above has added something to the already @1600 other posts at this point. It really has generated a lot of "buzz" so far!And I never even touched on the NOW NOW feature, email, native MobiPocket format, reading magazines, ability to self-publish via Amazon, adding additional storage, automatic software updates, one touch global search (of all your stored material, the Internet via Google, Wikipedia, etc.), an included dictionary (you can download another version and pick it as your default instead by the way), back-up storage of your Amazon purchases by Amazon, downloading the whole first chapter of a book to preview whether you want to buy it or not, adding up to 6 people who can have a copy of the same Amazon purchased book if they share the same Amazon account - it's hard to stop thinking of all the different things it can do today now.Happy reading!
My first complaint is about the screen. I knew it was not backlit and was not daunted by that, but the print is dark gray against a lighter gray background. OK in decent light, but the poorer the light you are reading in, the poorer the contrast. The gray background just gets darker. I can read a paper page better in poor light than I can the Kindle screen.My first plus is the variable-size text. In really good light I can read smaller print, thus getting more text per page. In less than optimum light conditions, I can bump up the font size, and I like that. Many books I have picked up in a store, I have put right down if the type is too small. Either on the Kindle or on paper, I can read small print only in very good light.Second complaint is the about the Kindle store. Not all the books I would like are available, and not all of my favorite authors are represented here. I can get Nevada Barr, but not Dana Stabenow. Also, with over a hundred thousand titles, Amazon needs to provide a better navigation system through the store. Scrolling through ten thousand pages is really tiresome, and the only help they give you is a "Sort by"Sfunction that is not all that helpful. There really should be at least a "Jump to" function if you suspect that something you are looking for is lurking somewhere beyond the first few hundred pages.Second plus is the Whispernet connectivity and the speed and simplicity of ordering and receiving the books that you order.Some of the extras that are part of the Kindle world promise to be fun to play with, but I never expected them in a reading device and would not have been disappointed to "just" be able to read books on it. The email function will never take the place of my regular email, but I suppose it might be useful in a pinch. Also, being of an older generation, I never understood the need to carry music with me absolutely everywhere I go. When I first noticed a volume control on the bottom of the Kindle, I thought it was totally redundant. Nevertheless, I do have one mp3 uploaded to my Kindle, and may enjoy having some background music playing softly while I read under a tree or on a park bench somewhere. In order to get a couple more songs on the machine, however, I have to figure out how to convert the m4p files in my iTunes library to mp3 format.Amazon, if you are going to give us hundreds of thousands of titles to choose from and a nifty, wireless way to receive books, and if you have a wide variety of music in a Kindle-acceptable format already online, why not offer the Kindle community the capability of ordering and uploading music selections via Whispernet, just like we get the books. Having to hook up to my computer to upload music is not a real hardship, except for the fact that all my music is in the wrong format and I can't use it on my Kindle.I am sure that future iterations of the Kindle will have backlit screens and more bells and whistles that we may or may not need, but I am glad that I got mine when I did. I have been waiting for a hand-held electronic reading device for 35 years -- I kid you not -- and I did not want to wait a moment longer to get this one.It is expensive, yes, but considering the wireless connectivity that comes with it, it's a bargain, and you may even save enough on the books you order (average $10, versus $25-30 for hardback) that it might even pay for itself eventually -- although, personally, I've been in the habit of waiting for a new book to go into paperback before I bought it. Now I don't have to (at least for SOME of my favorite authors).Oh, and for those who say it is homely, I say phooey. I think it looks elegant. If you want fancy, buy some stick-on rhinestones to decorate it with. I went to a craft store and bought an embroidered, iron-on applique  and glued it onto the front of the plain black book cover that the Kindle comes with, not just to dress it up a little, but so I can tell mine at a glance from anybody else's Kindle, on the chance that I run into someone else who has one, which I haven't done so far. But I've only had it two days.Finally, I would like to thank whoever it was who posted a tip somewhere about securing the Kindle into the cover with a little velcro on the back in the bottom corner. The "clip" that is supposed to keep the thing in its cover doesn't work that well.
I bought the Kindle 1 (K1) when it first came out and have owned the Kindle 2 (K2)since Feb 2009 (when it first came out).  So I've had lots of time to use both and here's my take if you're considering an upgrade that's beyond the obvious:1) I'm a fast reader and K2 renders pages faster than K1.  This was big plus for me.  For slower readers, this may not matter.2) K2 renders photos and pictures much more clearly than K1.  This was not that useful for me as I mostly read books on it.3) I notice that the gray text on K2 looks slightly fainter or "lighter gray" than on K1 (not sure why).  Looks like there's less contrast and makes text harder to read in lower light.4) K2 actually weighs more than K1 (due to the metal back.  K2 is thinner than K1 but heavier in weight) a negative for me when I hold it a long time in one hand.  But the thinner profile fits in my purse easier.5) K2 has rounded edges, which is very nice for me as I hold it in one hand and K1 corner always dug into my palm.  But K2 "next page" keys are stiffer than K1, so for those with arthiritis, this maybe a negative as you have to press noticibly harder to turn the page and can be a little annoying if you read fast and want to flip pages quickly.  I do notice that my thumb gets tired turning pages on K2, which I didn't have that problem with K1.6) K2 has more memory but doesn't accept SD cards like K1.  But I have had no issues with memory so far and I have a LOT of books on it.7) K2 2-part charger with built in USB is a huge improvement over K1 and sleeker as well.8) K2 boots up much faster than K1.  Nice if you just don't like waiting.9) Finally, the biggest plus is that kindle books can be shared on multiple kindle devices as long as the devices are owned by the same kindle account owner.My husband is using the K1 and loves it.  He's not as avid or as fast a reader so he's very happy with K1.  As for me, I'm happy that I upgraded, mostly because I don't have to wait for the page rendering to keep pace with my reading.
I own a Kindle 2 but don't use it as much as I thought I would. I have a very good library about two miles from my house and already own about 500 books that I haven't read yet so I am tending to use the Kindle in special instances. I would like to get most of the 500 TBR books done before we decided to downsize to a smaller house and that's going to take me a while ! I also really like the feel of a book in my hands and miss that somewhat when reading on the Kindle. I did loan it to a friend recently when she was travelling to Florida for a week and she loved it.Here are the things that are really good:1) The ability to have many, many books on a single device. Largely comes in handy to me when travelling.2) The ability to download books for free. Many of the classics are available for download and there are usually three or four more current books that are offered for free at any one time that interest me. I just check the Kindle bestseller list frequently and have snagged some really good books free that way.3) Weight and size of the device is great. I've also used an iPad and it's significantly heavier and I can't put it in my purse for easy transport4) Can change the font size, making it larger as needed (not a problem yet, but I can see this being important as I age).Downside:1) Most books still cost money and I can get them from the library for free2) No backlighting which means you need to have some sort of light if you are reading in the dark. I found a reading light for about $13 on Amazon that I really, really like and can use it for regular books as well, so not a huge problem.3) The size of the screen is small so I feel like I am constantly flipping pages4) Because it is an expensive device, I am always a bit nervous about taking to the pool or beach and leaving it on my chair. When it's a paperback book that cost $5 - $9 (or $1 at a used book store) people aren't going to steal it and I just leave it on the chair. With the Kindle, I tend to carry it with me which I am not crazy about.I really think how much you like the Kindle will largely depend on your particular circumstances -- I know several people who absolutely love it !Edited 10/5/2010:  I an actually using the Kindle more than I did originally.  I have done more browsing around and discovered how to find many great books (not just classics) for about $3 or less.  I have also discovered that I like owning these books without taking up room in my home.  Have ordered a Kindle 3 - will report on that soon.
I have had my 1st generation Kindle about a year and a half now, and have been madly in love with it since the day it arrived -- or even before, actually. I waited for it for 35 years, ever since reading an article about the development of a hand-held electronic reading device, back in the seventies. Even though the machine pictured in the article was ugly, black, and about the size of a cigar box, I knew then that I wanted one. When Sony came out with its reader, it did not strike a chord with me, because I did not want to have to cable anything to my computer to download books ... for one thing, I have always had a Mac and, as far as I can tell, the Sony reader is yet another thing to discriminate against us die-hard mac-heads. If I am wrong, sue me; it's my opinion and I am entitled to it.After such a long wait, when the Kindle came along, I was a bit financially strapped, so by the time I got around to ordering mine, the first lot had been snatched up and I got put on a waiting list. When it finally came, it was just in time to take advantage of a fifty-dollar rebate, so yayy for me. I have taken umpteen boxes of paper and hard-backed books to the library or goodwill to clear clutter out of my house (tho special books will stay, there will always be a place for SOME books), and I have dozens of books on my Kindle that I have read and hundreds of samples just waiting to be browsed through, like Forest Gump's box of chocolates.It should have deserved five stars, as much as I looked forward to it and as much as I love it -- yeah, I know all the complaints about the clumsy controls and the screen size and resolution, but I don't care about any of that .. it is every book I could ever want to read, any time, anywhere, in one hand. The email function is unreliable, and I could have done without the music or the picture storage, but I have to admit those are nice touches. No, what prevented the fifth star is that MY KINDLE FAILED ME. After a year and a half of devoted service, it died. Not permaneltly, understand -- I put in a call for Kindle help, and a very nice man told me how to take off the back and reboot with a paper clip, and it worked. I ordered a new battery, thinking that the machine would never die on me again, that the old battery had been at fault, but sadly this is not the case.I cannot say how dismayed I am to pick up my Kindle on occasion and be greeted with a frozen screen or, worse, a dead white one. I know what to do now, and I carry a paperclip in the pocket of the red leather cover that I bought for my favorite toy (BEFORE I knew it was going to let me down one day), and I can get it going again. What I thought was near perfection turns out to be only one more thing to disappoint. I intend to keep this one going for as long as I can. Meanwhile, I picked up an adorable little HP Mini 210 that was preloaded with Kindle software. The nice thing about that is it syncs with my Kindle library, and I can access all of my books ... not the samples, just the books, but I can take it out with me and read anywhere, just like with the Kindle. And I can read it in bed at night without the lights on, unlike the Kindle. Another reason for four stars instead of five.
I am a previous owner of the original K1 followed by the K2 (6 inch screen).  I decided to upgrade to the graphite KDX after selling my K2.  I have to say that reading is a pleasure on the KDX.  The screen is awesome and the pictures are clear!  I enjoy reading pdfs of journal articles, newspaper and magazine articles on the DX.  Reading books is also a much better experience on the new KDX than on K2.  However, I miss the portability and lightness of the K2 which is why I give the DX 4 stars. I carry a mid-size purse and the DX just does not fit in it.  It is also a bit heavy to hold when reading.  I would love to own both the K2 and the DX but that is not an option right now.  At some point, I do plan to purchase the smaller 6 inch screen Kindle when the next new version comes out. I could use the small Kindle while I am out and about and the DX for reading at home or work-related stuff.  Either way, the Kindle is a wonderful product for serious readers.UPDATE:  Although, I really liked the Graphite Kindle DX, I ended up returning it upon the release of the smaller 6 inch Kindle 3.  I ended up placing an order for the small K3.  I do prefer the small Kindle because of the cost and portability.  If my finances were in better shape, I would not hesitate to reorder the Kindle DX.
I got my Kindle DX for Father's Day, and had 70 copyright-free works in a day.  (I highly recommend US Grant's Memoirs, if you've never tried.)  Mark Twain, Dickens, Conan-Doyle, Burroughs, HG Wells...I'm having a blast.  The only purchase I've actually made so far is a navigable KJV Bible.  Still a bit cumbersome, but getting easier to get around.  I've got 47-year-old eyes, but find the DX screen easier to read in dim light than most print.  I do wish there was a way to cut and paste, but more practice with the highlighting feature could cure me of that desire.  I would also like a more obvious explanation of the web-use fee.  I haven't tried that yet, though, since I'm usually near my computer. The built-in dictionary is cool, and the wikipedia uplink has been helpful for a couple of terms not in the Oxford A.E. It's expensive, but it's nice to have the "latest" device for once..and such a great wife.  Only knocks, the price, the web fee, and the late nights reading from my new toy.
I love the Kindle. I've owned one since the first generation was released, and owned each subsequent generation (save for the DX, which I consider generation 2), and as such, I've owned three Kindles so far. I guess you could say I obviously think "they're" doing something right.That is not to say the device is perfect, or without its flaws. But as far as the e-book market goes, it wouldn't take much for Amazon to have the be-all-end-all device, but I doubt they'll ever reach that stride.This device is seriously light-weight and thin. I don't know how much it weighs, but it is extremely comfortable to hold. I like to lay in bed reading before I sleep, and this is perfect for doing so. The battery life, even with wifi and 3G turned on, is pretty fantastic, I seem to get about two weeks on a full charge, and that is with reading on average one hour per evening.The 3rd generation buttons are in a similar layout to the 2nd generation, but there are some things which I miss. They removed the top row of number buttons on the keyboard, altho there appears to be enough space. You may not need numbers very often, but when you do, the awkwardness is becomes apparent.The page next/page back buttons are beveled, and while holding the Kindle, makes it less likely that you'll accidentally press the page forward button. It also tends to make it less likely that you'll page forward when you want to page forward, as it becomes a conscious effort. On the 2nd generation, these buttons were wide enough so that you could rest your fingers on the buttons, and they were firm enough to prevent accidental clicks. With the smaller form of the 3rd generation, my fingers tend to rest of the bezel itself rather than the buttons. Since the buttons feel like they're the same firmness as the 2nd generation, the beveling doesn't feel natural.While reading a book, the title bar (with the battery indicator, etc) will disappear. This is ostensibly to create more reading room, but in practice, the text takes up the same space whether the title bar is there or not. This could be fixed with a firmware update, to make it optional to hide.The social features are minimally useful. What I would like to see is a feature where I can post to my facebook or twitter that I've either just purchased a new book, or just started to read a new book. The current social features simply post or tweet highlights.I don't care about lack of color. After all, even while reading paperback books, I am reading books that are printed in black and white, so lack of color is simply a non-issue to me. A low power backlight might be nice, but not a necessity, since I read my Kindle in the same light level as I would read a printed book, and have no difficulties either way.Content seems to be great, as there are many thousands of books available on Amazon, and there are plenty of free book sites that will convert Gutenberg text into Kindle format, and to say nothing of indi authors who self-publish. But, like with the music industry, fear is the driving factor, which prevents certain materiel from being more widely accessible. There are popular books which have yet to appear in any e-book format because the publisher has an 18th century mentality regarding new-fangled technologies; then there are books which are not available on Amazon, yet which are available on other e-book formats, because an author signed an exclusive contract with that publisher. Suffice to say, there are unfortunately authors who will not receive their royalties from me, because I have made the switch to 100% e-book format, both via Amazon and free material, and their materials are not available on Amazon. Luckily, the goal of self-publishing is becoming more widely accepted.All my criticism aside, I will certainly keep with the Kindle, and when the 4th generation gets released, I'll be one of those who will click on "add to cart" the day of general availability. When it comes down to it, my likes for the device and platform far outweigh the dislikes.
This was a replacement kindle.  My first one developed cracks after about a year of use.  I could not part with it so I ended up putting off using the warrenty to get a replacement.  That was stupid because the warrenty will run out in October and if this one develops the same cracks, it will not be replaced.  You cannot get a warrenty on a replaced Kindle.  My biggest disappointment is not with the product, but with the cost of the e-books.  It seems crazy that a physical hardback book is the same price as a e-book.  We like reading new books, but at $15 a piece, it gets too expensive.  We are limited on what we can afford to buy.
I love my kindle....easy to read....small size and easy to carry.  I can read outside in the sunshine as advertised...I also bought the kindle case with light...fantastic..I can read in bed comfortably.  I do hope to be able to download library books to the kindle soon....that is my only regret that I cannot download library books to the kindle. The ads are not distracting are only on the opening page....no ads on the page you are reading in your books...
This is good for anyone who likes card games.  There are a number of games that one can play, and you can play against the clock too!
I love solitaire, & this is a nice little game that works well on my el cheapo Kindle (which I would not trade).  It's easy to use & has nice tutorials if you aren't familiar with the games.
I enjoy playing this game.  It keeps me busy while I'm watching TV.  I often play it on the computer
Love playing Solitaire when I just want to unwind after a busy day.  This does the job.  Easy instructions to playing this game.
Has several different versions of Solitaire.  Bought for my husband who likes to play cards.  He is on the Kindle all the time.
I like this app, it works fairly well, with a Kindle Touch I do not have the color contrasts and a little more RAM and faster Processor would all help. Overall an enjoyable APP.
I like scrabble but it is very touchy and sometimes it doesnt move when i want it to. I like it though
I play this game each day.  It is challenging and adaptable to play with the AI or with an opponent that is human.  GREAT GAME!
I like most all word games and scrabble is one of my favorites. The Kindle version is good, but it took awhile (for me anyway)to get the different maneuvers with the 5 way button down pat.
I really enjoy word games on my Kindle and this one does not disappoint.  It is as easy or challenging as you want it to be.
I love Scrabble, and this edition would be great except that it locks up my Kindle, forcing me to restart it.  Without this hic-cup, I'd rate it 5 out of 5.Update:  This only happens if you go across two triple word spaces.
it's fun, it keeps the mind busy, can play by yourself or with the computer, use to play with the grandparents when i was younger
Scrabble (the board game) has been a favorite game of mine since I was a kid a half-century ago. I've played the board game version for most of my life. Now that it's available as a Kindle Active Content game, I find the game is as enjoyable as ever.Scrabble was one of my first purchases for the Kindle when I got it a few months ago. Though I primarily use my Kindle for reading books, this game is nice to take out if I need "a break" from reading, and it is especially great in places, like busy waiting rooms, where there is too much going on around me to concentrate and read.I highly recommend this game.
Works fine, it seems to be a faithful implementation of the game. I haven't used it that much but it is a nice addition to round out my portfolion of games and amusements.
This is a really fun game just like the real version the only difference is you can not cheat.  I love how it will make suggestions for the best word available.  I score pretty well.
Bought this game back during the holidays when it was half off.  Honestly, it's an ok game for playing on an E-ink Kindle.  The game gives you options for changing length of game and various other aspects.  For a quick game before a doctor appointment or getting on a plane, this apps ok.  For the intense Scrabbler, I'd suggest passing on this 'active content' game.  As others have suggested it can be cumbersome navigating and the game sometimes does not recognize words approved by the game board maker.  If you can catch it on sale, it's worth having.
This game is so worth it as each game is very different. I play against the AI which has the unfair advantage of having access to the official Scrabble dictionary which contains words few people would know. There's words here that our onboard Oxford dictionaries don't have but would be in a Merriam-Webster one. That said, you can still win if you put in the effort.Through the options, you can play fast or long games based on if you are playing for maximum points (Classic version) or to reach smaller points or fewer turns.The game is very visual so DX owners will fair the best from that perspective but us 6" Kindlers, through experience, can come to benefit from the visual information with repetitiveness.It took me awhile to notice that the game shows the point value in a little circle near where you or the AI inserted your last word. You can see what your choice would bring in pointwise before hitting the enter key as well.It also took me awhile to realize that the blank squares the game sometimes put on my available letters board were "wild card" letters that I could use as I pleased although they granted no points themselves.  But they could allow me to get extra points by creating words to reach to the special squares that grant overall more points.I should mention that I have not been a Scrabble board player previously although I probably played sometime in my childhood but not very much.Time will fly by when you really get into the game as you have to play just "one more" time!  Very highly recommended.
I play this game everynight and love it. Sometimes when I can't sleep I will play it for many hours. sometimes not sure about oppents words but and still havn't beat him.
I like this a lot and play it often.  The interface is easy, and the game can be played alone or with another player.  You can set your computer opponent's skill to Easy, Medium, or Hard.  FWIW I have a Kindle Keyboard.
Who doesn't love Scrabble. The only thing is I've had two Kindles that froze up during a Scrabble game. I'm thinking there is a connection. I honestly feel bad that I am on my 3rd Kindle, all replaced by Amazon. I still play it sometimes but then take it off the Kindle. I really don't want to waste another Kindle, have to think twice about playing often.
Admittedly I'm horrible at Scrabble. Even on Easy, I still get smoked.I have a Gen3 Kindle and the game is quick and responsive. You can set the AI for Easy, Medium or Hard (for me, it's how quickly I want to get beat.) The interface is easy to play, and the combination of Alt+letter helps you out to play words or even to play for best word possible (for people like me who can't form more than 4 letter words.)I'm not sure how well if the official Scrabble dictionary is integrated for the purists who play Scrabble (which was one of the questions one of my friends asked.) There are words I've never heard of being played by the AI, which means I should probably pick up a copy of the dictionary.It's a fun game overall, even though I totally suck at it. Worth the $2.50 since it was half off, but I'd probably have skipped it if it was $5.
I have a Kindle touch and the only thing I don't like is selecting letters....they always seem to want togo to the incorrect square.  My Kindle is really sensitive.
This is a good game, well thought out and executed.  However, playing it on the small Kindle screen drives me up the wall sometimes!  The letter boxes are so small that half the time my fingertips press the wrong square, and then it's the devil trying to correct it.  Also, there is a little white box that appears in letter squares sometimes, seemingly for no reason, and I still haven't figured out why.  It's hard to get rid of sometimes, and it seems to jump all over the board before I can get rid of it.  All in all, though, it's a great game and I play it almost every day.  Now, if you could just offer the old-fashioned Scrabble for the tablet, I'd have it made!
OK. I love Scrabble, but around my house, nobody has much time to play. So I thought playing against an AI might be fun. And it sort-of is. First off, the AI has one huge advantage: It knows every, single word in the dictionary. However, it doesn't play strategically. It just seems to place words anywhere it can find space on the board. It gives you every triple word, doesn't try to block you, etc. It is nearly impossible to lose a game to the AI, particularly at the Easy level. Boring. At the Difficult level, the AI has beaten me a few times, by virtue of its word knowledge and its ability to analyze the board instantly. One weird thing - it's constantly exchanging its letters. One thing I don't like is that if you put a wrong word down, you don't get challenged and you don't lose your turn, as you would with a human player. You just put down another word. And I don't like that two-letter word list either. That wouldn't be allowed in a real game. So, the electronic version of Scrabble is an adequate substitute for a game against people, but somehow the fun is lacking.
This is the same old, reliable Scrabble we all know and love.  My kids and I play together on my Kindle.
I honestly am not a huge scrabble fan and it took this purchase to realize that;[Decent for what it is though and a fair price
too busy being addicted i guess.  i have to use all of my best words strategically to beat even the easiest ai.  but that is ok.  looks good and works as it should.  i wish it had the ability to look up the definition of the words the ai plays.  refuses to open sometimes but at least it does not hang up the buggy kindle.
this is a great game. it does have a drawback though, like putting the last score played in the game field covering part of a word. but other than that it is my goto game..
I like this game, although it is far too easy to obtain help on a puzzle. It would be nice if EA would update this game so that if any of the various ways of cheating are used, (i.e. using hints, auto-fill, error checking), then the game can still be completed but will not be entered into the Statistics section of the game. It's very easy to cheat and complete a game unnaturally quickly which will then still be counted as a new fast time record, which seems to be a little strange.I suppose it's no different from doing a Sudoku in a puzzle book and looking at the answers in the back though :) I wish this game didn't rely on self-control so much and that the cheating features weren't so prominent.The layout, graphics and interface of the game are very well designed. The grid is clear and the navigation is spot on. The puzzles are very good and the difference between the various levels is noticeable.For the price it represents great value for money. I'm sure I'll get many, many hours of entertainment from this game. My wife and I like to sometimes compete to see who can get the fastest time on the same puzzle, so it would be nice if the game results indicated whether the in-game help was used or not.(P.S. Please EA, make a Chess game next!)
This is a good electronic version of the classic puzzle game - it was great to play while on th eplane and sitting on the airport for a few hours shortly after I downloaded it.Pros: different skill levels - including an incredibly "killer" difficulty level, hints, and instant gratification of playing when you want to play on the kindle vs. lugging around a dedicated electronic version of Sudoku.Cons - only two: (1) I still like the paper version and the ability to use my pencil as a pointer as I am going through the possibilities in my head, and (2) my Kindle's letters are starting to fade between this and Scrabble!
This is the first game I have played on my Kindle 3.  It's easy, it's fun, an it's free !  What more could anyone ask for,  but it's also very addictive ! It is hard to stop playing  sometimes.
Good game that gets your mind working!  There are words that should be included and are not.  They include some slang and abbreviated words, but no names...like a State name.  I am hooked though!
I have two different types of this word game on my Kindle and enjoy both of them.  Plus they were free.
I like the game.  It is challenging and fun to play.  It has words I've never heard of so I never get them all.
I like free.  I liked this game.  Until I downloaded Every Word: Crossings.  So this game barely gets a look in these days.  Still, it's a nice game.
this is a fun game to play. i would recommend this for your kindle or nook. hope to find more.
I find it very therapeutic and challenging .....especially the final word.
it was a good game it had its diversement value to it. I had fun and moved on once it was over. Didn't play it again.
Ever go to an appointment and just sit,......and wait,...and wait,...with nothing to do?  I'm not inclined to sit and send text messages, or yap on the phone like so many people like to do today.  I prefer to use my brain, even just a bit, during the wait times, and this book of word 'puzzles' is just the ticket.
I love the challenge of this game.  It makes me think and it is something I like to practice on.
It is a good product, but in fact I am not so good at playing this game, so finally I quit.
I really like this game.  It makes you think, analyze and ponder what your next word is going to be.
This game is not a bad one to play, I enjoy playing it though it is one that for me I have to have time to play it without interruptions.
This is a challenging game. You get a string of letters to use. I've never counted them, but I think there are about 7 letters. You have maybe 20 spaces (it varies) on your board. Using the 7 or so letters, you make up words, which fill in the mentioned spaces. There is one word that uses all of the letters. When you get that word, you are free to go to the next level at any time, but you will get more points if you make as many words as possible first. I really enjoy this game, but it is one where I have to concentrate. I have come close, but I have never filled in all of the spaces on a board. The game will show you what you missed when you go to the next level (so you can kick yourself!).
This is a very easy to learn game that I liked alot.  It seems to go from easy difficulty and goes up in difficulty as you solve more puzzles.
I enjoy playing word games and always looking for something different.  This one is pretty good.  I go back and forth to it.
This game works well on my Kindle Paperwhite.  The playing letters are large enough to manipulate easily.  The rules are pretty simple, it gives options and the consequences.  Pretty well thought out game.
Fun game, but i prefer thread words to this. Just personal prefference but same idea for both games. Good vocabulary builder
This game is good for when you're bored. It's fun and many people can get involved. One time in my eleventh grade english class we had no classwork for that day so the teacher let us talk. I pulled out my kindle to play this game and soon the majority of the class was involved with figuring out all of the answers.
I just couldn't get wrapped up in this game.  I would just get frustrated and want to quit.  It may be a good game just not for me.
Transferred to my Kindle and my Amazon-Kindle account without issue or problem. There are different levels from easy to very hard. Challenging.
WHEN LOOKING FOR A NEAT WORD SEARCH RELAXATION - HERE IT IS.  NO MORE MESSY CROSSOUTS AND SMUDGED PAGES FOR YOUR RELAXATION TIMES.  THE KINDLE KEEPS NEAT RECORDS WITH EACH FOUND WORD.
I like having a few games on my Kindle for those times I'm sitting in my car waiting for the kids to come out of where ever they are, and this one is pretty good for that.  And, unlike it's title, I like that they don't beat me up if I can't find EVERY WORD in the puzzle-- If I get most of them, they let me move on without feeling too badly about myself.  That's all I want in life.  (Ha ha)
I don't even know how this got on  my Kindle, but I do like it and I do quite well with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.
It's a very challenging game. Was hard to get used to at first but then I found I could do pretty good on it, even going to level 10 with a perfect game a couple of times. But it's addicting too. I have to remove it from my Kindle to stop playing it and then I put it back!
This game is very addictive my kids enjoy playing it, too. While certainly not as addictive as the Scrabble game, don't say you weren't warned. besides, with the price being free where can you go wrong?
I like the game on the timed version.  Sometimes it is a real challenge to find the longest word but it is fun.
Every Word is one of my favorite game downloads.  It's a little like Scrabble.  The player must make words out of the lettered tiles presented.  There are two options for play.TIMED GAMEIn the timed game, the goal is to form the longest word possible from the scrambled tiles.  That actually means using up all the tiles.  If the player finds the longest word before the time runs out, s/he can move on to the next level.UNTIMED GAMEIn the untimed game, the pace is more relaxed.  However, in order to advance, the player must find all the words listed on the page.  I have a difficult time coming up with all the words, so I prefer the timed game.CONCLUSIONThe only problem I've found with this game is that some words are obviously British in origin, so the spelling is not always what I'm used to.  Other than that, this is a great download.  I'm glad there are only ten levels, because I just keep playing until I'm done.__________________________UPDATE:  It's been brought to my attention that I can move up in the untimed version when the longest word has been solved.  It feels unnatural for me to go out to the menu and tell it to show me answers and skip a level; but I thought about it and it's not really cheating, since it's only allowed after finding the longest word and part of the rules of the game.  The untimed version is still frustrating to me, because I feel I've just got to solve it all.  Something obsessive about that, I know.
Great word game that can keep you thinking.  All of the letters you need to solve are given to you, but it can still be challenging at times to come up with each word required.
This is basically machine boggle and I'm not as good at it as I thought I would be. The game challenges you to think, so I like it in that respect, but it is slow going and not terribly exciting. Overall, I think it is a good game and a fun thing to have on your kindle.
I love word games, and this one is a ton of fun. Not only that, it's free, so it's hard to disagree with.
I am becoming addicted to word games on my Kindle.  Every Word is an interesting challenge that I feel exercises my brain.
Let's start with the negatives first.  This multilevel game is not really for those of us who like to unscramble words.  (I'll explain shortly.)  It's not tremendously challenging, either, if you excel in games of word skills.Every Word presents a group of scrambled letters.  The goal is to create as many words of these letter combinations as possible.  By using every letter, one advances to the next game within that level, or proceeds to a subsequently more difficult one.  If creating words does not excite you, this isn't your game.  Of course, it's possible to skip all that and just find that one word, proceeding to a more challenging level.That being stated, here are the positives.  Using your Kindle as a game tool is a pleasant diversion.  For example, in public places there can be distractions that make it difficult to concentrate on reading.  Switching from book to game mode is an easy click to 'Home' and play begins.  Perhaps having a Kindle that provides many books in a small and lightweight unit is what attracts you.  If so, then expanding your options of entertainment without having to carry anything else is a plus.Knowing Every Word's limitations, I would still buy it.  To paraphrase an American expression, it's not the greatest invention since sliced bread, but it'll do.
This has been a fun and addictive game, and as a 'freebie' I think a wonderful bargain.  I play the 'relaxed' game and have made it to the highest level three times. I am impressed with the fact that I've only had one 'duplicate' game within the levels so far. It does use some odd words, and I've found myself grabbing a dictionary more than once to see if it really did exist.  A nice addition to the games on Kindle.
A never ending series of puzzles that keep me coming back to play them over and over.  Love to play in timed and casual mode.
I like this games ... make you think on how many word you can make out with given letters. But the game in my opinion is poorly design...
Every Word is a fantastic game for those who enjoy word games and puzzles. It will have you playing for many happy hours. It's very addictive and a good brain teaser!
Free download, great for killing time. really rushes your thinking along! Its a little too fast paced for me. I tend to get interrupted frequently so i prefer the games that offer u the choice of timed or relaxed.
I like this game, no instructions needed, just open and play. It is addictive though as others have said. I wish  I could slow it down a bit but maybe with practice I will get faster and get longer  words in before the letters fall off the board.
Great game for the kindle when you are waiting for an appointment.  Will make you think.  Keeps you guessing. and stimulates those neurons.
The dropping tile in this game reminds me of the burning tiles in the "BookWorm" game from Popcap games. I wish there was a way to slow the game down a bit to strategize and create longer words--or even a relaxed game option like the Every Word game includes.
Really makes you think FAST, it's like a timed mini version of Scrabble you play against yourself and the clock.  For anyone who likes a &#34;timed challenge&#34; with words this is the game for you.
not sure i will ever win this one but it is fun. One letter at a time and make a word worth bunches of points. Fun and exciting.
This app is useful for if you are bored and makes for a fun game. The only thing I would improve is if it gave you hints. Hope you find this helpful!
I like it, but not as well as other word games.  But, I keep on trying, so to keep my mind on top of things.  It is worth having.
I haven't played this game much.  I don't like it as much as some word games I've played, but it isn't a bad game
This is a fast paced and fast response game.  Can be kinda tough, but fun.  Only play it when you really want to think.
Kind of like scrabble against the clock. Keying letters is a little challenging when you are rushing. Will try with the stylus.
I love word games so I readily downloaded this game to my kindle.  It was a good game to play.
This game is the perfect balance between having to think and just having fun.  Some games aren't fun to me since I have to "work" at them.  For example, I tried chess and didn't find it relaxing at all.  Other games are so mindless that they drive me crazy and aren't any fun either!  This found that happy middle place for me.  It's pretty intuitive so I was able to pick it up and start playing within minutes.It is also a great length. I can sit and complete an entire game in about 5 minutes so I can pick it up, play the game, and put it down when I only have a few minutes and don't want to get started into reading a book.It is a lot of fun if you enjoy word games.  I would love to see more games of this nature developed for the Kindle.
Decent game, I have to make sure I have time though as this game is timed and I do not have any interruptions.
This game puts a row of letters across the top of the screen, and you try to make words of them.  As your time goes on, some of the letters drop off the top and new ones come up.  You have to try to make words fast before the letters go away!This can keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's not relaxing (for me)due to the time element, but it is fun to play.Recommend for those who like to make words and fast play.
This is an interesting word game.  I really enjoy word games and play this one quite often.  It is pretty good.
I play this one often.  It has enogh games to keep it different and not playing hte same ones over and over.
This game is very fun.  It's a quick word scramble it brings up letters that you have to make into words, but when you don't use a letter it quickly time it out.
A great game.......... on the right apparatus. I played this game on a Kindle deluxe, the one with the keyboard, and had a ball. But my Kindle is the basic and it was too hard to manipulate the letters with a cursor and no keyboard. Recommended if you can type easily on your device.
Next to Scrabble, this is the game I play the most on my Kindle.  Some of the commands are odd (I keep entering the word rather than backspacing a letter out) but after a game or two you get used to it. The games are quick. It's challenging and always a fresh game no matter how many games you've played.  I think games like this keep your mind working at an efficient level.
When I got this, I wasn't expecting much. This turned out to be a fast-paced word game that involves quick thinking, good spelling and knowledge of the more uncommon words. Though not one myself I would recommend this to Scrabble players or anyone that likes words! The reason it got four stars is because it is nothing compared to Every Word.
Each game is a short timed play so can do when just have a little bit of time. No variations on game, just one option. But fun and challenging to try to use up all 60 letters in a single game which is harder than you think!
I play this game quite often, Sometimes when I can't sleep I will play it for many hours. Like most word games it is sometimes frustrating,
I do like it but it's kind of addicting even though oftentimes I can't beat the speed in which the letters fall into the void of not being able to use them. It's really a frustrating game and I will have to take it off my Kindle yet again!
Shuffled Rpw is an okay word game. It seems like the letter combos recur pretty quickly though. A fun game though.
This game is very addictive my kids enjoy playing it, too.  While certainly not as addictive as the Scrabble game, don't say you weren't warned.  besides, with the price being free where can you go wrong?
This is actually a very good game once you get the hang of it.  It is very enjoyable and addictive once you start playing.
i only played one time but really enjoyed it.  i am still learning how to play this one.  it is exciting and challenging.
This game is sort of boring after you play it for a while.  The number of letters make the score low for the most part.
Like playing the game.  Would buy it again.  My husband also enjoys playing the game.  Delivery to my Kindle was fast.
I love to play games. This is an interesting one to play. Great distraction when you are waiting for an appointment or just want a respite from your day.
Try to make words from random letters as they pop up on one end before they time out at the other.  Good practice with words and thinking fast.  I think it has already improved my thinking speed, at least for words, as I am a better competitor for the friend I play word games with.  Sometimes rejects perfectly good words.
I like this game because it keeps my brain and thinking active. I get frustrated with it sometimes because the letter I need to make larger words doesn't pop up. Or I accidently press the wrong button to erase a letter and end up submitting junk. Reminds me of a fast version of playing scrabble.
Just started playing Shuffled Row.  Still a novice, but I found the game intriguing and fun.  Kept me hopping and searching for words that would give me a better score.
This is fun and challenging, but it would be nice to challenge another player.I also wish they kept record of all your highscores and not just the highest.
These types of games are my favorite.  I like making words and trying to figure them out.  I would recommend this to any child to help with spelling
Holds the attention, math and logic workout.  Free game, so worth the money.  Classic game for kids and adults, no custom level (that I saw).
I liked this on my computer so much that I got it for my Kindle.  A nice game that makes you think strategies.
"Mine Sweeper" for the Kindle is a fairly good, playable version and the price is right (free as of this writing). This plays like the PC version, where you move the cursor around a grid with the Kindle joystick (which can be cumbersome) and clicking to reveal open spaces around mines. The object is to flag the mines without detonating the mines by clicking on them, there are hints provided with the number of mines shown around any adjacent cell. The easy level is very easy, assuming you don't click on mine the first time. There are three difficulty settings and the high scores (fastest times) are retained.This is not a very exciting game and there are certainly better ones on other handheld systems but this one is on the Kindle (which I usually have with me) and it is free, which makes it very convenient and a very good value.Recommended!CFH
What can I say, it's minesweeper... I love the game, always have. Now I have it on my Kindle :)
Its simple basic, no frills. But if you're waiting in a doctors office etc. You will be happy you have it.
Love minesweep and this game is a nice addition to the kindle for traveling on just to take time to play a calming game of minesweep.
I downloaded this game on my kindle because I remember that it was a game that would come on a computer when you would buy a new computer.  It does make you think.
If you like Mine Sweeper, this is a good game. Only minor complaint is sometimes in my play I forget which button to push to flag a position and which to clear it-- BOOM! But that's my carelessness, not a real problem with the game or Kindle. Recommend it to you.
This is the Kindle version of a favorite game - similar to the board game Battleship.  It's fun to try your skill of deduction from the numbered squares..  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a game break from their reading time.
This is a game for children as well as adults.  Its fun to play. Would recommend for any one to play
This is the old Minesweeper I know and love. There are options for easy, medium and hard. The top time scores are posted on the opening screen. The only problem with it is the little toggle button on the Kindle makes moving around the board a little difficult. Still, it's a fun time killer.(Played on a Kindle 3G 2nd generation with keyboard.)
This game is pretty darn fun. I like it a lot. My only thing is that it was a little confusing on how to flag and unflag and all that. Besides those things it is worth it and (correct me if I'm wrong) but it's free so it's definitely worth it!
I didn't buy my Kindle in order to play games, but the games make the Kindle even more valuable to tote around with me when going to a doctor visit, or other place where I might have a really long wait time.Certainly, due to the way Kindle operates, the game control functions are not quite as easy as on a computer.  However, it is not so unwieldy as to detract from enjoying the game.  You will find the full array of game functions, such as Quick Reveal - the game functions are not truncated, which is really nice.If you like Mine Sweeper, this is worth getting.
If you have an IBM-compatible computer (not sure if it's on a Mac, too), it's likely you've played this game. Doing it without a mouse is a whole different ball game...that adds another layer of challenge.
First of all, if you have Kindle 2 you can safely purchase the game because it works great on this device. It even loads a bit faster than the other Kindle 2 games I have purchased. Kindle 2 is the device I have, so I don't know whether the game will work on the other types of Kindle.Triple Town is a pretty fun puzzle game. You get a board subdivided in to squares, in which different kinds of objects appear. You need to create groups of similar objects, which will turn them into more valuable things (grass turns into a flower, which, in turn, transforms into a bush after you have accumulated three or more of them.) There are also wild cards (crystals), which can be substituted for any object. Sometimes, marauding barbarians appear and prevent you from placing objects in the cells where you want to place them. They can also move randomly, so make sure you place the barbarian in a space where even if it moves, your entire game will not be too compromised by that. The best thing is that you don't have to remember all these things because you will keep getting hints as to each object's value and function throughout the game.Overall, the game is a bit basic, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. However, the graphics are quite nice, the tutorial is very clear and detailed. The game is fun and relaxing and works great on Kindle.
I bought the K2 when it came out and then the K3 (now known as the Kindle Keyboard). I was excited to see there was a new device. I knew the difference would be small. I've also ordered a Fire and a Touch. So, that's where I'm coming from with this review. I bought the Basic Kindle with ads just so I could check it out and see if I wanted to upgrade my Kindle Keyboard. The answer is... I don't know. So, I'll talk a little about the differences in this review.The page refresh and time to turn on/off is much improved. It appears to only do a full "anti-ghosting" (for lack of a better term) refresh every 6 or 7 screens. This is allowing it to put up a new e-ink screen faster. Kinda nifty. This is, by far, my favorite improvement over the previous versions.The on/off button is slightly different. There's no slide. You push it in. It's a little annoying at first, but I can see that at least it won't get snagged on things in my purse like it does now. Of course, it will probably still get bumped around and turn on. So, this is kind of a draw for me. I must have bigger thumbs than the average person ;)There's also no hinge. From looking at the photos of the covers coming for theKindle Touchit looks like it sits in a frame of sorts now, so I'm guessing the contacts on the back is how it will charge from the device if you buy a lighted cover. The cover is a sore spot for me. I like to read in bed. I need a light and I really like having my kindle in a cover. I really want to use this one to see if I like it over my keyboard version, but this will be a tough one. I'll suck it up and get over it, a cover should be out soon-ish, right?As I mentioned, I bought the ad-supported version. The ads aren't obtrusive, they show up as screen savers and also as a little block at the bottom of the menu. They are NOT in the books at all.I don't have a library card/overdrive so I wasn't able to test that out. It does have less internal space than theKindle Keyboard, but that's only a consideration if you're using a lot of books. This kindle also doesn't have speakers or a headset jack (remember, very basic, entry level!) so it doesn't have the need for audio files. I think the space is fine unless you must have more than 1400 books on it for some reason. Obviously, no text-to-speech on this one either.The virtual keyboard is much easier to use than I anticipated, it's pretty zippy and I was able to type up a note easily and quickly, maybe slightly slower than I can on my keyboard version. The highlighting is slightly different with two other steps put in there from what I'm used to. Most people might not notice this, but I do make notes, so I noticed it right away.The look is basically the same, same screen resolution. It is a lighter black color around the screen like a shimmery silvery black almost.Bottom line for me? I'm not sure yet what I will do with this kindle. I LOVE the faster page turns. LOVE. But the lack of a lighted cover right now (not taking off stars for that as I'm assuming that will be remedied pretty quickly). For now, I'll play with both and decide. Then decide again when my Touch gets here in November.I'll update the review when I do decide, but my gut reaction is that, page turns aside, I'll end up sticking with my keyboard version for a little while longer.-----Update: I found the covers. I couldn't find them before, but someone pointed them out. So yay! I'll pre-order one for it (wish they were available now, but at least I'll have a lighted cover!). However, after mulling it over, I think I'm going to pass this one to my daughter. ONLY because I've ordered a Touch though and I don't see the point and setting up this one with all my books and collections, etc just to have to do it again in six weeks. Otherwise, I might make the switch. I think I'll stick with the ads on the Touch as well. I don't mind them and it's a change up from the same old screen savers.
At first glance, an irresistible purchase--$79 for a reader with enough storage space to hold 1400 books.  But now I regret the purchase.  The previous Kindle (with the minuscule keyboard) was indeed a trifle larger and heavier but not enough to matter.  I could carry it (without cover) in my rear pants pocket and not even know it was there.  Plus, the keyboard allowed for a few more convenient maneuvers than does the present lowest-priced Kindle, which comes with fewer controls and without "touch" technology. But the biggest down-side for some of us is the absence of speakers and audio playback, a feature I frequently used to make the book read itself back to me.For an extra $20 for the Kindle Touch you get not only Touch technology but twice the memory (space for almost 3000 books) as well as audio playback for many of those stored texts and tunes. Plus you get twice the playing time from a single battery charge.  In short, that's simply a lot for a just a few extra dollars. By my calculations, this latest Kindle would need to be priced closer to $59 to be a comparable value.  And make no mistake about it: the Kindle Touch is a reader--no Facebook intrusions--and "practically-speaking" it's no larger or heavier than this lowest priced Kindle.After looking at the revised six-Kindle line-up with a cool head, I have little doubt the Kindle Touch represents the best value while the Kindle Fire promises to be a serious iPad challenger.  Not only will the latter provide 4 times the memory and storage space, but you'll get a color screen along with access to Amazon Prime movies.  It's unlikely the Fire will prove as useful for social connectivity as an iPad, but it's bound to offer many adults all they would use at a price less than half that of an Apple tablet.  In fact, I plan to purchase it as a "dedicated" free movie machine.  After viewing "Rocky" on an iPod, I'm sure the 7" screen will seem ample.)Of course, with the Fire you're getting a tablet that comes without E-ink and is twice the weight of the aforementioned Kindles. Moreover, it can be hard for readers to keep their minds on a screen that offers Technicolor movies and sound.  So for avid, committed readers, the Kindle Touch would still seem to represent the best value.[Forget the advantages of the Fire's greater storage space. Since the backlit tablet doesn't use e-ink, it won't be able to handle nearly as many books (or last for as many hours) as any of the Kindle readers.]
I HAVE NOT rec'd this item yet, but I love my 1st gen Kindle so much I could not resist this one for $79. I dinged it one star for amazon's misleading info up front ... when I saw that a power adapter was not included, of course I thought I would NEED one to use this thing ... come to find out I did not need to do that, as (had I read the entire presentation) I could have learned that a USB connector to a computer DOES come with, and that would have been more than adequate. I know you guys have to get every ten dollars you can from folks out here, but come on. I will probably keep the adapter so I can plug this into a convenient wall socket, but it was not really necessary.Having said that, I didn't really need a new Kindle, I just love the one I have -- but it is first generation and does have some limitations, even though it is 3G and my new one is only wi-fi. This new one that is on the way (hoping it will arrive tomorrow) can borrow library books, so all I have to do is borrow at least nine books (factoring in the cost of the unnecessary power adapter) and it will have paid for itself. I belong to a book club and I don't need to clutter up my Kindle or deplete my bank account by buying every book on our reading list.It feels almost decadent to be the owner of two Kindles, but each one does something that the other does not, so I will use both for as long as they last. My old 1st gen Kindle is having a harder time holding on to a charge these days, but then I can get it a new battery, which I can't do with the new one, can I?Some improvements that I would like to see on the new one have to do with content management. The process (on the 1st gen) of transferring items from the Kindle memory to the SD card is laborious at best -- but that won't be a problem with the wi-fi. But something that ANY Kindle could use is better navigation of the Home page content: I have over 60 pages of books and samples to scroll through when I want something -- typing into the SEARCH function requires precise spelling and exact phrasing, or it won't pick up anything -- and the List By either author or title is also unreliable, as the alphabetizing of author names is not consistent (sometimes by first name, sometimes by last) as is listing by title, because the first word may be A or The and could be alphabetized by either the leading article or the first word after. It sucks. Add to that the fact you can scroll only forward or back from one end to the other -- it would be SO NICE if, when you reached the last page of your content, if it would cycle forward to the first page again -- conversely, it would be nice to be able to hit the Back button from page one to jump to the end of your content.ANOTHER very helpful thing that should be available under content management would be the ability to call up BOOKS only or SAMPLES only and to be able to establish a folder on screen in which to stash books already read or samples to put on hold for a while -- I see online that there may be an archive function with the content manager function on the computer, but on the device itself would be good.Suffice it to say I am a big fan of Kindle, and I could barely stand to wait to order my first one. I will never again be without an electronic reader.
What can I say?  If you like the online game, handheld game, cell phone game, or computer game of Texas Hold'em, you'll like the one for Kindle.  It's easy and it keeps your best games.  You have PLAY CAREER, PASS AND PLAY, PRACTICE, GAME STATS, AWARDS, OPTIONS, AND HELP.  You can leave a game and resume it the next time you go into the game or start a new game.  There are 5 players total.  The game is fun and easy.  The game fills the Kindle screen so it's much easier to play than a handheld game or cell phone game of Texas Hold'em.
I like this implementation of Texas Hold'em, it is nice to be able to either turn on the helpers and learn, or turn them off so you can try your skill on your own.
Never was much of a gambler, but I can't play this enough. I forgo a lot of my kindle reading cause I'm addicted. Friends say playing against a computer is easier than against people, but its raising my confidence. Is that a good thing?
This is a pretty good version of the game.  You can play in the tourney mode and progress upward to larger levels and competition.  i do like the "skip" button so you can hurry the system up, for example, if you fold early-on and don't have to wait through the subsequent betting between the AI's.It has a nice feature to play in multi-plaer mode, where the person playing can make his or her bet, then push a button prior to handing over to their opponent - and therefore hiding the first person's cards from view.There is a "help" feature if you feel so inclined and aren't sure with what to do.  I haven't really used it, but my elementary-aged son has and has been able to figure it out.  In other words, this game is not just for adults.The only drawback I can see is it is slow at times as you get into it after a few rounds, but this is not to imply it is a bad game.Bottom line is I like this game, and it is well worth the price.  While not as addictive to me as the Scrabble game for your Kindle, this one has some good entertainment value.
The Texas Hold 'Em game for the Kindle is a fun poker game that allows you to play individual matches or go into career mode.  The game is a typical Texas hold 'em format and doesn't offer anything out of the ordinary, but for .99 cents you get a fun game that is more than worth the price.
the first several levels are very easy ... sort of more a tutorial as to how it works ... after about level 20 the difficulty seems varied rather than steadily increasing ... then you hit a real poser at 26 or 28 but right after that they get a bit easier again ... so the progression is not steady and if you get stuck you can skip it and come back later ... i also found a tough nut in the mid 40s and a couple in the 50s ... if you revisit a solved level you can replay it so more than one person can try a hand ... overall an interesting and absorbing logic and spatial exercise ... i have been playing intermittently for a week and have not completed the first set of 64 yet ... one level can take 5 minutes or an hour depending on insight
Okay, it's not a word game, and it doesn't take a genius to play it.  You don't have to come up with long words, and the game is pretty simplistic in design.  And it doesn't have cute pandas.  And those are just some of the reasons to like this game!If you like a change from the usual word-type games, this is a perfect game for your Kindle.  Sure, we've all seen this type of game for years, but that was on our computers.  This is a Kindle, and as such it cannot handle the really complicated games (yet).  When you consider what type of game COULD be played on a Kindle, this logic/puzzle game fits the bill perfectly.Yes, you have to think out your moves ahead of making them.  Most puzzle games are like that.  You COULD just make moves without thinking, but then you'd have to re-start the level you are on if you make a bad mistake.  As far as this game wearing out your 4-way pointer, as one reviewer mentioned, I doubt that will happen any more than playing word games will wear out your letter buttons.The idea of this game is to place identical squares next to each other to make them disappear.  When all squares are gone, you have won the level.  When multiple identical squares exist, you must be careful not to match them in a way that you end up with only ONE of that square left, as this will lose the level for you.  Some of the later levels get pretty complicated and require much thinking to solve them.There are 128 levels in this game, separated into blocks of 64 each.  One cool plus to this game is the fact that you can see a list of all 128 levels on one page.  It shows you, with check marks, which levels you have solved, and allows you to pick ANY level to play.  You do not have to slowly work your way to the hardest level.  If you feel like an easy level, you can choose one.  If you are in the mood for more of a challenge, you can pick a higher-numbered level.I don't see any problem with there only being 128 levels.  I doubt most people could remember exactly how to solve all the tougher games, so they should be a challenge if you ever return to solve them again.The graphics are nice, and they are right for this type of game.  I didn't notice any unusual overuse of the battery to run this game.  Since nothing is flashing or moving while you are thinking about your strategy for your next move, no battery power is being used in this game until you are actually making a move.If you enjoy puzzle games, I don't think you'll mind spending 2.99 for this one.  When you consider what the Kindle is capable of when it comes to games, this is a very nice addition to previous games that were put out by Amazon and Electronic Arts.  Mobigloo is a game-maker I had never heard of before, but I hope they continue to make games this well, so that we have a nice wide selection to choose from for our Kindles.
It is OK, just another mindless game, but I play now it and then.  What more can I say about it?
Next Puzzle Game is fun and challenging pattern recognition game that really makes you think and plan on most levels. On each level you are shown a select number of square blocks that have shapes in them. Then you have a number of square blocks with no shape in them that make up walls. Then the rest of the board is plain white. Your goal on each level is to clear the board of shapes. You achieve this by moving each set of blocks with the same shapes in them so they make up a group of 2 or 3 of blocks with the same shapes in them touching each other. Once a set of 2 or 3 of blocks with the same shapes in them touching each other,they are removed from the board. There are some limits on the movements of the shaped blocks. The shaped blocks can always be moved right,left,or down,but they can never be moved up. And the walls are solid. The walls can never be moved and the shaped blocks can never be moved into a space with a wall in it. The shaped blocks also cannot "float" in the white space and must always touch either a wall or another shaped block (same or different shape). That means if you move a shaped block down and the 2 "spaces" below are white space it will continue to fall until it reaches a wall or shaped block to rest on top of. The challenge of the game is this: All the blocks must be cleared without leaving any singles behind. This means that if on a level any of the shapes have an odd number of blocks with that shape in them you will have to plan your move to make sure you get a match of 3 on that shapes. The structure of each game in terms of the amount and position of wall also adds your challenge on a number of levels. The 1st 6 levels or so are pretty easy the challenge picks up after that. Once you win a level the game automatically advances you to the next level but you can also manually select to play any puzzle at any time via menu options. There are 128 puzzles broken down into 2 packs of 64 levels each.  Next Puzzle Game is a fun puzzle game that also makes the player think. I enjoy Next Puzzle Game and appreciate the variation of difficulties. I give Next Puzzle Game 4 out of 5 stars. I don't go to 5 stars because a few of the easy levels,mainly levels 1,2,,and 3 are TOO easy. And a few of the hard levels,mainly the damn level 56 that I still can't figure out are a bit TOO hard. (This is all based on pack 1. I haven't played pack 2 yet.) But overall Next Puzzle Game is a fun puzzle game that is worth playing. 4 out of 5 stars.
a thinking puzzle game. have had to skip a few because I just couldn't figure them out. doesn't show solutions which would be helpful
This game is exactly like the little hand-held 5 card draw poker games. Very simple and fun. The game starts you off with money and then adds or subtracts from that total as you play.
It's new to me but so far I really enjoy playing it .I got it for my brother who is coming to visit it is his favorite game. Thanks again amazon!
This game reminds me why I shouldn't go to the many casinos in and around Phoenix - I can't win against the house!!  Love the game because it helps keep my money in my pocket - not the casino!!
In just ONE DAY, I've already made a few hundred dollars by playing this game!  That's how much I would have lost if I had gone to Vegas and played, so I'm already way ahead!!!Why not see how much you can keep from losing by playing this game on your Kindle instead of at a casino.......
This is a great way to pass the time when you are having to wait somewhere. Like it a lot.
This is a free for kindle owners. It is a fun game for people who know how to play poker. Those who do not know the game, can use it to learn because the game is introduced by pages of instruction. There are two ways that the game can be played: with and without advice. If one selects advice, the kindle will suggest how the hand should be played. It will also tell you if you made a mistake. You can also select whether you want to play easy hands or hard ones.
I don't play this one as often as I do other games.  But it is OK now and then and my husband likes it.
This one is fun.  I wish it didn't do the button-flashy thing when you win.  The &#34;system&#34; for ideal hands is pretty good, but I wouldn't take it to Vegas, or anyplace where you pay REAL money.
Overall a good game. Have to mark which cards to hold, and can split, double-down, take insurance, ets. It will remind you of real casino machines, except here when you quit playing you still have money in your pocket. I recommend it.
I would have given this five stars but it never ends. And it gets kind of boring after about five miniuts.
Love playing Video Poker on my Kindle.  Great to play any time, even while riding in a car.  Just disappointed it didn't transfer to my Kindle Fire.
I play it once in a while when I am taking a break have other casino games I like better
if u need something to past the time with , this will work. It is what it is video poker.
Bought for my husband who does not get around very well.  Is frequently on the Kindle playing games.  Bought as he enjoys cards.
Just one of the mindless games I play when I;m in line or in a waiting room or have some time to kill.  Good game to have in your repertoire.
Who does not like Hangman? Ok, maybe a few people. If you do, this is a good way to have a little fun. Some of the words are tough to get. Especially the shorter ones. Fun to play.
i love solitaire and i like mahjong so this was perfect for me also . alot of fun . .
I have Mahjong Titans on my lap top but I share the lap top with my 12 yr old when she has the lap top this was a good substitute  game to relax with. the tiles are easy to see the game is easy to play on the old kindle i have
Enjoy playing this types of games. I would like it better if there was more boards to play. I like challenges.
I really like the game. However, I do find the game is too small on my screen for easy playing.
Keeps my mind alert and active and helps get through the commercials on TV.  Works for me and I like it.
Like the game.  Not sure how to make it larger, So hard for me to see all the symbols and play well.
If you like mahjong than you will like this. In color may be easier. But who needs color. It's fun.
The tiles are hard to see on the small screen of the Kindle Touch which I downloaded this game to.
I've been playing MahJong for years. When I saw a version for the kindle, I was rather surprised. I can truly say this version is every bit the same as some others I have played on a desktop computer. The only problem I had was that sometimes I hit the wrong tile and had to redo. That is understandable due to the size of my fingers, I suppose (I ain't petite!). There are a couple of tiles that are difficult to make out the designs, and I have only played one layout, but I understand there are 10 layouts. If you love to play MahJong, being aware of the size issue, try this one, you may like it.
It is OK, it really is just another Mahjong.  It keeps you busy or puts you sleep depends on which time of day you are using it!
It is a fun game. Both my seven year old granddaughter and I enjoy the game. I would recomend it.
The 1.0 version skipped over the tiles that were blocked in. So for the original dragon layout. It was much better. The advantage of 1.1 version comes in on the other layouts where there are less blocked tiles.Holding down on a directional key does make the cursor fly. It can fly so fast that you can pass right by where you want to stop. The 1.0 version was slower in moving where there are more available tiles and so more stops and more moves to get where you want to go.
Enjoyable solitaire game.  This is a new version of solitaire and fun to play.  You can challenge yourself on many levels.
and i mean that in a good way.  works as it should.  pretty graphics.  enjoyable.  happy to have it on my buggy kindle.
Great game for waiting to see your doctor.  I would like more layouts (there are only 10 different ones) but for the price it was well worth it.
It's a tiny sweet game that didn't cost a dime, so how much could be wrong with that?  Oh, you mean when the dealer gets Blackjack four times in a row?  I'll never play this game for money.  I'm not a card counter.
Just like any other Blackjack I've seen on computers. It gives suggestions if wanted. Hard to see cards tho but I do have vision problems.
a nice game to play with the computer. the plays go fast and it does not get boring. A good one.
I like this game ok. It's not my first choice but it would entertain me for a bit. Another free one.
Bet against the dealer and be a big spender, but no matter how many times you lose; you still have your money.
Not good at Blackjack and this is really helping me learn without parting with my money.  So easy to understand
I don't buy many games for PC,...but having this one loaded and running gives a great deal of enjoyment based on the amount of time you want to spend with it.  Hours....... or just minutes here and there when not busy.
This is a good way to pass the time away when waiting at a doctor's office, or anywhere that you are having to wait.
Yet another one that is what it is.  Blackjack is blackjack, you really can't spice it up, 21 is 21.
This game is fun and challenging.  It has a prompt if you worry whether to hit or stand..it also has a surrender notice. When I get bored, I start playing with this game..Good for average and good players..also beginners..not that great for experienced players. Great for car traveling.
I love playing 21 (Blackjack), both in person and on handheld devices. This game is the best looking game by far on the Kindle. The interface is killer, I especially love the quick keys that keeps the action fast pace. I like how you can change the table options, which is something that you don't see too often.Having played this game for over a month I have to say that the randomness of the cards seems to me a bit fishy. I've seen (7) Aces in a row delt a few times, but the dealer takes the cake in this department. Figuring that this game uses a 5 deck shoe the number of dealer blackjack's is off the scales! Whatever the built-in "cheat" mechanic is for the dealer, it needs to be dialed in better. Otherwise, I really like playing this game. Just don't get too upset when you lose 20 hands in a row.
The game plays ok. Wish I could increase my bets above the range set in the game, but that's a minor deal (no pun intended). Only minor complaint is the Kindle is black-and-white so the cards aren't as clear, but they're big enough to distinguish ok. I recommend the game as a fun pastime on the Kindle.
Gives you advise on hitting, staying, or splitting (if you can). That is sometimes a nice thing to have, but normally it is a bother and I am glad I can turn it off. Would recommend to others.
this is really nice game but it just goes on forever. if it wasint free i probley would'nt get it, but I hardly ever buy things.
It is as enjoyable and frustrating as the real thing! Took me a liitle while to figure out how the &#34;double down&#34; works.
I found this easy to jump into and play - Iost a bit!Better than I had expected.and easy to use with a good & fun challenge.
It is great to have someone to play Blackjack when you are alone, or at an appointment sitting in the waiting room.The directions are easy to understand. It works well on my Kindle.
They aren't promising you anything else, and they deliver on what they advertised.  It's blackjack... Entertaining in simple way.  What else can one say?
I like this game, what more can I say!  This is what I don't like about these reviews, after you say you like it, what more can you say?
I'm an hour into playing this game, and just now realized an hour has passed.  That part concerns me, as the last thing I need is another addictive game to play!This is a good, basic game of blackjack for your Kindle and the price was certainly right - Free!  I did briefly try out the customizations, with the one touted in the game description to make the dealer hit on a soft 17, and will have to see what else it will let me do.Why not give it a shot and download it to your Kindle?  After all, it *is* free!
easy to play.  Like the  colors, would recommend to a friend.  I cannot think of anymore reason to tell you!!
Has instructional cues that you can use while playing.  If not a good card player this comes in handy. Would buy again.
I have had fun with this.  It is a good way to learn the ins and outs of the game without losing all of your gambling money!!
I like the opportunity to learn from advice offered by the Kindle, but facts is facts.  Do the math, and the house will always beat you in the end.  Good learning tool in my opinion.
of blackjack, although it could use a little more variations. That said, it's free and does a good job being fun.
This is a great game for anyone liking to play Blackjack.  You get to play against the dealer just like the regular game.  I would recommend it.
the game is ok. my husband loves to play it. he likes to play cards. what a great game thank you
