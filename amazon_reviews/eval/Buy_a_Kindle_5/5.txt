Let me vociferously bellow out this refrain: Wow!  To say this outperformed my expectations would be an understatement--and then some.  The simplicity.  The performance.  The thrill.  It truly is going to change the way we read.  Or more to the point: the way I read.Few salient facts: I have over 2,000 books in my library at home--and all hardcover books.  I refuse to buy paperback books...and have for the last 12 years.  I had no interest in the Sony reader and would have never saw myself buying the Kindle 3 months ago.  Not in a million years.  But then I saw The Charlie Rose Show and the other media blitz--and read what the Kindle could do.  Must say: it got my attention.As I see it, buying the Kindle does not vitiate the hardcover(or paperback)book.  Rather, it gives us avid readers another opportunity to satiate our reading desires.  I will still buy my hardcover books and continue to stock my library shelves at home; and now, I will also be stocking my kindle with books I may not want in my library but still want to read.  And my god: some of the features on the kindle are amazing.  The dictionary.  The annotation.  The notes.  The automatic bookmark function.  If you are a reader...well, this will seem like heaven.  It does to me.One can argue price--and many have.  But then again, if books(and the joy of reading)are your passion...well, then $399 is not that much to pay.  Hell, what do people spend on clothes, or dining out, or vacations, or ipods.  I will say this: I would not sell this on EBAY to collect $1,000--as some people are already doing.  I will be using this device on a daily basis--and basking in its glory.  And no: there is no hyperbole in that statement.The only negative: the book cover is awful!  It does not hold the kindle well--and it seems, at least to my preference, to bulky to use.  I would assume, however, someone will make an aftermarket cover that will be perfect.Hope this helps.  And to recapitulate: if you love to read--YOU NEED TO OWN THIS!!!!!!!
I love the Kindle!!  What can I say?  I haven't enjoyed reading so much until I got this product.  Its all good.  The only con: Kindle book selection is still quite limited.  I am missing books from my favorite authors.  On a side note, for those who complain about accidentally pressing the "Next Page" button, I haven't had this problem because I keep the Kindle in its cover and I just hold onto the edges of the cover.In summary, I am very thrilled with this latest in technology.  It is truly an excellent product for readers of all ages.
I just received my Kindle today, and I've been impressed with it so far.  Here are my initial thoughts, and how I've arrived at my rating.-The design, look and feel are better in person that from the pictures onscreen.  I know that is hard to believe, but its true.  The Kindle feels solidly put together, altough very light.  It doesn't have that pasty biege look of an old computer.  Very pleasing to the eye, and the bright frame helps the contrast of the words.-I think the type and screen are superior to the eReader.  My son said, "Wow, how do they get that to look like paper" when he saw it.-The wireless is seamless so far.  I've obtained subscriptions to IBD, WSJ and Fortune.  I read these in paper format, and so far they have everything I need and will probably cancel the paper subscriptions.  They downloaded without a hitch.-The manual is one of the best I've ever seen.  Lots of white space on the pages, and easy to use.-The Kindle comes already hooked up to your account when you buy it through your Amazon account.  I don't know what you do if you buy it as a gift, but I thought it was a neat touch.-One gripe is that the ergonomics on the bottom of the unit could be improved.  The corner of the unit (particularly the corner resting in the left hand) might get annoying as it pushes into your palm.I have one major concern, which is whether Amazon will ultimately pass the cost of the wireless service to owners.  I see that the manual seems to indicate they will charge you for sending a file through Amazon to reside on your Kindle, but won't charge you if you send it back to your computer for download to the Kindle manually.  I get the sense that they're passing this wireless cost along to the consumer, and one has to wonder if they'll pass more to the consumer later.All in all, this product is not an incremental change over the eReader, but more of an evolutionary change.  It is what it is, a unit produced by a bookseller to please the customer, and to sell books and subscriptions.  Amazon is clearly trying to build a Kindle community, and so far I'm hooked.  I applaud the effort.  Any time technology and service evolves to address a need, we should applaud.  You buy this knowing its limitations with respect to DRM.  Buy it or not, but if you simply like to read and you use Amazon, then it makes sense to get one.My rating probably would be a 4 1/2, becuase nothing is perfection.  But since I can't leave a half star, I'll bump it up to 5.UPATED: 11-25-07While using my Kindle to read Slate, I clicked on a hyperlink embedded in the blog for more information about a topic.  I was taken to the website and was able to read the additional information with no problems.  The web browser if very basic, but sufficient for this purpose. In short, the Kindle allows you a full reading experience.I also showed the Kindle to a friend yesterday, who also commented how difficult it is for him (and me) to read articles on a computer for any length of time.  Kindle solves that issue.
I am an avid reader and books are fast taking over my living space. So, I was very anxious to try something new. My Kindle was delivered in just about three days, but I got "antsy" waiting, so went on line and ordered two books, wondering how long after my Kindle arrived before I would be able to start reading. I was amazed to find the books already downloaded when I opened the package from Amazon.The instructions were extremely easy to follow, and I was able to begin reading in just a few moments. The screen is fantastic, and I find myself reading in even less light than when I was reading printed books.Two comments/complaints: I wish the on/off switches were on the front - there seems to be plenty of space for them. Also, I am not a fan of the method provided to keep the Kindle inside it's case. It seems like a couple of strips of hook & loop tape would have been much more secure.Overall, I am extremely happy with my Kindle Reader, and have asked everyone for Amazon gift certificates for Christmas!
Yes, you read the title correctly, "We love our KINDLES", as in Kindles PLURAL!!  I've already reviewed the Kindle once, when I purchased it for myself, and gave it 5 stars because it DESERVES all 5.  Heck, if I could give it 10 I would!!This review is for my partner Chad, who this purchase was for, since our Kindles are registered to the same account.  In his own words "I love my Kindle and find it has made reading so much more accessible for me, given my hectic work and school schedule.  The e-ink screen is so paper-like it is unbelievable.  It is so easy on the eyes I could, and have!, read for hours on it.  Thank you Amazon for the Kindle!!"
I just got my Kindle.I was very skeptical about the look of the device from the pictures posted on Amazon and all the non users negative comments. In reality, the device's look rocks! It really is awesome.I was very skeptical about my reading experience being equal to my book reading experience. Not anymore!I bought a book, downloaded it, et voila!I need to spend more time on the device to give more feedbacks about other features. I will post more stuff as I learn more about my Kindle.First impression though...The Kindle Rocks! I am addicted. That sucks! :-)
UPDATE:  If I had it to do over I would NOT have bought the Kindle.  It is way to limited in function.  The major issue I have is with the interface.  If I buy a book for the Kindle I should also be able to see it on my computer or home network.  I want a Kindle that functions like ITUNES.  If I purchase a book I can only see it on my Kindle.  That is far to limited.  With some minor changes to the interface I could read my books on my computer or large screen TV.Previous reviewers have done an excellent job telling you about the Kindle.  The price is a little high.... but then it does connect instantaneously to Wickpedia! As an avid reader and researcher I find this to be fantastic.  Oh yeah they have a dictionary built in also.  You can change the dictionary to one that is more specific to your needs.It is very easy to read text.  My only quibble is that the screen does a little flash when the page changes.  I find this to be a distraction.I opened the box is just a few seconds.  For those of you that use Apple products you will have a flashback to every Apple product you have ever opened.  Very nice.I did not read the owners manual.  Why?  Anyway...after about 20 minutes I had it all figured out.  Installed SD card, personalized, bought a few books, and spent about an hour reading.The case they send is great.  They do not do a very good job telling you about it.  It is a very secure cover.  I found that leaving the cover on and folding the front back made the whole experience almost like reading a real book.I just discovered the blogs.  They are awesome.  Yes I know you can get a lot of them free.  I downloaded the blog from MIT...among others....check it out....you will like it!!!!UPDATE...It has been a few weeks.  I am currently reading a 500 page novel.  I no longer worry about the screen changes or buttons...it comes natural to change pages....do not even think about it...and it sure is more pleasant to hold then a large heavy book.  I have had no problems with the unit.  I have used the whispernet to download newspapers and blogs.  I also updated the dictionary for my needs.  I like being able to download owners manuals for portable equipment such as my Scalar microscopes and Vernier probes.
When I first mentioned the possibility of a Kindle to my wife, her response no doubt mirrored the reaction of many upon hearing about this new technology: the initial reaction was abrupt and dismissive.  Who has time and room for more "gadgets" in their lives--for toting and storing them, learning how to use them, remembering how to operate them after putting them aside even for brief periods?Like all of the digital toys everywhere, isn't this just one more plaything for those who, still living in the front half of their lives, are able to convince themselves they have endless time to kill?  Moreover, doesn't commonsense tell any serious reader that this gadget is, theoretically speaking, antithetical to the book and, practically speaking, counterproductive to the matter at hand: i.e. simply getting on with the reading of a specific text (for some of us, it's a pleasure; for those of us who are Faulkner or Browning enthusiasts, it's equally a challenge).  In both the theoretical and practical spheres of knowledge, as serious readers soon discover, the book is best served by the removal of all obstacles, rationalizations, procrastinations, diversions.  Reading, like writing, is a creative process: the reader, like the writer, is "composing/creating" meaning out of language, and the only way to get the job done is to get on with it.  And that's where the Kindle, like the book itself, soon becomes a reader's best friend.Despite the initial resistance, and the familiar arguments against acquiring yet another "gadget" soon to be sentenced to oblivion, I gave my wife a Kindle for her birthday.  Within hours she had become a believer in a device that is no replacement for, but a welcome complement to, the book and the reader.  Consumers who at heart don't like to read won't be won over by the Kindle.  It's not aimed at the anti-book crowd: it's made for the committed, experienced reader, analogous to the premium clubs required by a professional golfer to maximize his game. If you decide not to like the Kindle, it's not all that difficult to convince yourself that it's a non-necessity. Many of the reviews complaining about the quality of the Kindle cover, or the darkness of the print, or speed of page-turning appear to come from impatient sorts looking for an "alternative" to the reading experience itself--videos, audio books, sermons, self-help directions and condensed "talking points"--rather than for a genuine "enhancement" of the process.  In  a world of proliferating texts (a virtual textual "glut") the Kindle offers the reader a lightened path (and lighter load).After experiencing some initial reluctance myself, I decided that I was not going to demonize this potentially useful tool by requiring it to be something it is not--a novelty that will make reading an exciting sport or a Shakespeare tragedy as easy or "fun" as the viewing of a Spielberg movie.  Instead, take the Kindle as you find it, and trust the thoughtful attention of the makers to details like print quality, the screen, the contrast scale, the "old-fashioned" cover--in all likelihood you too will championing the device and, more importantly, reading more than ever.  If a future upgraded version adopts some of the snazzy cosmetics and automated additions that some reviewers have proposed, it will no longer be the Kindle but a dumbed-down machine for like-minded consumers.  As presently configured, Amazon's revolutionary product is designed to make accessing books, pages, sentences and words easier and more manageable than ever for "good" readers; it's not designed for readers who want to reduce Proust or Toni Morrison to the level of "chat-room prose," "basic-needs texting," and other forms of popular discourse that increasingly threaten the purpose and very existence of "the book."When reader-response critic Stanley Fish asked the provocative question "Is there a text in this class?" he envisioned something more representative of the dynamic nature of language and its meanings than the traditional text book. Turn the question around: indeed, there's an emerging class of readers to be found in the Kindle!  A liberated consciousness emits palpably from the understated inscriptions on its screen (unassisted by gratuitous backlighting and gaudy highlighting).  For those who read for knowledge and understanding (rather than mere information and escape), the Kindle promises to spark a revolution of Promethean if not global proportions.
Let me first expatiate the salient facts: I love books.  The feel.  The touch. The smell.  They all imbue my senses with a cornucopia of satisfaction and succor.Honest.And yes, I was exceedingly dubious--if not outright hostile--to the very notion of an e-book reader.  How dare they!  How gauche.  How materialistic.  How insanely trendy.  These thoughts, along with some strong vitriolic bile, came forth from my mouth.  And I was firm in my belief: I WILL NOT BUY THIS--OR BE A PART OF THIS.  PERIOD.  END OF DEBATE.Then, and as is the case with most men in marriages, I listened to my wife: "You love to read--just try this.  If you do not like this...well, then I will use it."  She was calm.  She was soothing.  She was reassuring.  So yes: I bought the Kindle 1 about a year ago.  Bottom line: I fell in love with it.And that then fleshes out the past--and brings me this review of the Kindle 2.  I will be quick.  I will be succinct.  And one hopes--boy, how I hope--that I will avoid sounding didactic, pedantic, or jejune.It goes like this: if you love to read(not texting, not emailing, not web surfing, not playing video games)then this is for you.  To say this device is life altering is not hyperbole.  Rather, and more to the point, it is just an axiomatic fact.  Any serious book lover or magazine reader needs to give this a chance.  The ease, the simplicity, the choices.  They will astound you.As for Kindle 1 vs. Kindle 2?  Look, if you can only afford Kindle 1 then get it.  It is still great.  However, and after having spent a few days with Kindle 2, there is a vastly superior difference between the two.  And to try and deny that is just foolish.  That's not a put down on Kindle 1. It's just the reality of the situation.As for all the details...I will let the others enumerate those points in much finer detail.  My last thought is this: I will always have a Kindle.  It's now a part of my life.And so it goes.
This was the first e-book reader I ever had. When I initially got it, I didn't think I'd use it for very much. My bad! I'm woman enough to admit that I was very, very wrong! Once I realized how easy it was to add books and games onto my Kindle, I realized that this was a game-changer for me.Let me put it this way, I used this item for a few hours every day...for a couple of years! Why did I stop using it? Simple - one of the buttons came loose from extensive usage and I took that as my cue to get a newer/updated one!
I really love my Kindle2. I have had it for 1 month. It is easy to read indoors or out. The navigation was easy to learn once I read the directions. Downloads are very fast. The experimental internet access makes it possible for me to travel without taking a laptop and without the need of a WiFi connection. My son has the iTouch and it is not a good reader and needs WiFi. The iPad doesn't have the selection of books that the Kindle has and costs twice as much. The Kindle2 internet connection is slow however and is not intuitive in its use.
I said I wanted one when the Kindle 1 was out, but I was reluctant to give up my actual books. I joked that if the Kindle 2 came out near my birthday, I'd buy one... and wouldn't you know it... so I bit the bullet and got myself one for my birthday. I knew I'd like it... but...This thing rocks! It is the shredded cheddar in my omelet. The whipped cream on my frappuccino... the... oh, you get the point.I've seen a Kindle 1 and I got to play with one and while it looked WAY cooler in person, but I wasn't sold. When I saw pictures of the Kindle 2, I was sold - and it was a great decision for me to wait. The Kindle 2 really is a good upgrade.I'm not going to sit here and tell you about it, Amazon does a good job of that... but these are the reasons I'm in love with it:1. All of my books (up to I believe 1500) can be in ONE compact little book-thingy.2. The text is SO crisp. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but it's absolutely amazing. Everyone who sees it comments on the fact that it's so... readable!3. I can change the text size. All hail the half-blind folks! I like to read in bed laying down, but I can't do that with my glasses on or it bugs me (side layer here!). With most traditional books, I can't read it really well, but with the Kindle, I just adjust my font and voila - I can read without my glasses. I can adjust it back down for when I'm reading with my glasses too!4. I can get a book any time I want. I was actually reading one night and thought "ya know, I'd like to read the next book right away in this series" so... (without even getting up or moving or anything!) I brought up the Kindle store and had the book on my device within like a minute. Heh. That so rocked.5. No backlighting! Reading on a LCD screen can tire your eyes out... I love the E-Ink technology and the fact that, like a traditional book, you have to use a book light or something like that. No eye strain!6. Reducing the "stuff" in my house. I've been getting rid of paperbacks right and left. I'm all about reducing the "stuff" and "clutter" in my life and the Kindle is right up that particular goal in my life.7. It's affordable. Okay, now don't freak out. Yes, the $360 you pay upfront can be a bite, but for the ease of use, I think this was a smart purchase. I read about 100 books per year, so that's about $1000 if I spend $10 on each book, not cheap, but considering the money I spend on books already plus the postage to trade books and my time keeping up with my trades... I think it will end up being about the same actually. That's NOT to say I'm giving up on paperback books, but I'm going to mix and match for a while. AND there are free books available for your Kindle :)8. Emailing PDFs and other formats to it and it converting it - this is SO useful for books that only come in ebook format. Amazon charges me some pennies to do it, but big deal. I don't have to sit at my computer to read it! Genius! (and I think you can get it converted for free, but I figure whatever they charge for sending it to me wirelessly without me hooking it up is well worth the cost)Don't get me wrong, it has it's down sides too - it's not exactly waterproof (put it in a ziploc bag is my plan), you can't really share books (which will cut into my book-trading addiction, but help me with time honestly LOL). I do wish they had left the wireless on/off switch as a physical switch. I prefer that to the software one, but eh, that's a minor thing.Anyway, if you are a book lover, you simply must buy this. Now. It's SO coooool! I promise... you won't regret it!
The Amazon "Kindle 2" is nothing short of amazing! It arrived with a minimum of packaging and included the Kindle 2, a power charger (which the proprietary USB connects into), and a slim "Quick Start" guide which really isn't needed (seriously!). The Kindle 2 automatically launched it's own startup guide and quickly walked us through the minimal setup. It was preconfigured with our Amazon account information, so we were downloading books within a half hour of unboxing the device.My observations:* Charges fairly quickly* Feels great in the hand* Very easy to read the screen* Easy to change font size* Very easy to navigate* Conveniently placed controls* Great built in dictionary that automatically shows the definition when you hover over a word* Text to speech! This works very well (although it is listed as an "experimental" function)* Lots of inexpensive book available to download (we got the complete works of Jane Austin, Charles Dickens, Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, and Edger Allen Poe, all for about the cost of one hardback book, and downloaded in few seconds)Since we did not own a first generation Kindle, we are not too disappointed by some of the things other reviews have pointed out.Things I would have liked to see added:* Option of using SD cards, but it seems that there are other ways of transferring our personal content onto the device (via USB or email).* Back lit screen, but a regular book light will work fine* Included case, this is going to cost us extraWe are thrilled with the Kindle 2 and now my biggest issue is trying to get it away from my wife (it was bought as a birthday present for her) and it seems that my kids also are eyeing it up.Highly Recommended!CFH***UPDATE*** 3/1/2009: We love the Kindle 2 so much that it has been used almost every waking hour since it was delivered. It is in such high demand that whoever is currently using it is afraid to set it down lest someone else starts to use it. So in order to keep peace in our household, my wife bought me my very own as an early Father's Day gift!
I received my Kindle in December 2009, just around the time the firmware was updated to 2.3.3 and native PDF support was added in addition to the Kindle's other formats. The latest firmware release 2.5.X adds further PDF control, (Panning and zooming) and makes reading complex PDF's a viable prospect, (especially magazine layouts). Also, with the latest update the fonts have being redesigned to be much darker, so the contrast between the text and the background is much better and clearer, (not that I had an issue before, but it does look noticeably better now.)The Kindle is a truly fantastic ebook reader, and also displays pictures and photos remarkably well using the 16 greyscales. There is an absolutely almost limitless supply of free books and reading materials that Amazon either makes available on their site or is available elsewhere on the internet, (out of copyright works, publisher promos, etc.)The interface is a breeze to use, and the new collections feature makes organizing your books simple. No more pages upon pages to trawl through!There are hidden games built in to the Kindle, (press Ctrl-Shift-M from the homepage for Minesweeper and then you'll also see an option to play a Reversi/Othello type game too against the Kindle). There's also features that can be enabled to allow photo albums to be added and displayed on the Kindle - handy for carrying photos of your kids around!Whispernet is a joy to use - having books within seconds is a big bonus - and free books are totally free - no delivery costs. Basic web browsing is also built in to the unit, again totally free to use - no phone bills or contracts. It is quite basic, but good enough to use when no computer is available - I use it for live sports updates when I'm out and about.After having my Kindle for 8 months or so, I have to say I'm overjoyed with it. It's pretty much perfect for what I want. Granted I'd love a DX to be able to read PDF magazines without panning around the page, but not enough to pay the extra. Since I got my Kindle, the price of the K2 has fallen considerably, and now represents even better value for money.To be perfectly honest, I don't really have a bad thing to say about the Kindle. Sure there are some gripes I have about the Kindle experience, but these aren't aimed at the Kindle or Amazon, but rather the publishers, (e.g. some books still have formatting/spelling issues but this isn't Amazon's fault, they are only selling the ebooks, not writing them - and to be fair Amazon do pull the books from sale if made aware of issues until the publisher makes corrections.) The only other gripe is that some bestsellers and new releases have crept up in price - but again, Amazon has fought this all the way, but it is the publishers that now set the price and Amazon can't control this aspect of ebook sales unlike more traditional dead tree books that they have more control over pricing with.)A special mention has to be made with regard to Amazon's after sales and support. It's superb. Amazon really are quite apart from the competition when it comes to looking after their customers. When considering buying the other ebook readers out there, remember who you will have to deal with if things go wrong!
I bot this Kindle because it had a feature that will read the books to you and since I am Dyslexic it helps because it takes me way too long to read anything and this is wonderful. And I can do housework and listen to it.
Have had my 2nd GenerationKindle Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G, 6" Display, Whitefor over two years now, and though there are newer and more up to date models available, have to say that this product has surprised me to no end, and continues to do so. Was skeptical about the first generation model when it was first released in November of 2007, so I waited. By 2009 it was apparent that the Kindle series had lived up to and even surpassed the expectations of friends who had them, so it was time.My second generation model, often referred to as the Kindle 2, lived up to the original specifications. It is said that within its under 8" x 5.3" exterior it can hold about 1500 non-illustrated books... figure out how much bookshelf space that would take in ones home. The text-to-speech option was something that I never thought would be used, but it was. There was a review that listed the specs of the Kindle 2 as having a "Freescale 532 MHz, ARM-11 90 nm processor; 32 MB main memory, 2 GB moviNAND flash storage and a 3.7 V 1,530 mAh lithium polymer battery." So much for the technical specs, but the geek in me was curious. And in 2009, Amazon released a firmware update for the Kindle 2 that was said to increase battery life by over 80%, along with introducing support for PDF files, which was a welcome upgrade. More on this later.About the only thing that I might have liked to see carried over from the original Kindle was that Amazon chose to not include the slot for SD memory cards. That would have been helpful, but one learns to manage the files and books downloaded.When I got mine, I also picked up theKindle Leather Cover, Black (Fits 6" Display, 2nd Generation Kindle)and theMighty Bright XtraFlex2 Clip-On Light (Kindle Version) Black. Both of these turned out to be worthwhile investments. One learns quickly to fold the leather cover back and attach the light in that fashion. The 8.4 x 5.3 inchesMoleskine Notebookis almost the exact size as the Kindle 2 with the leather cover, and the elastic band on the cover makes them easy and accessible travel companions.First Books:The very first items that I downloaded to my Kindle after its initial charge wereOn Writingby Stephen King,The Complete User's Guide To the Amazing Amazon Kindle 2by Stephen Windwalker, andThe Man Who Would Be Kingby Rudyard Kipling. The Kipling title was the first of many "Kindle freebie" titles to follow. There were many others downloaded within those first days, and it's a habit that has continued to this day.Adobe PDF Files:One thing that I found to be quite handy was the ability to transferring PDF files via the USB/power cable that came with my Kindle 2. The Kindle appears as a removable storage device when the USB cable is plugged into a PC or Mac, so that made it easy to transfer my camera and computer manuals into the Kindle for fast reference. Most of these are available as PDF files directly from the manufacturers, so those easily-lost manuals can be readily found when needed.Usage Notes:The keyboard to the Kindle 2 is a bit stiff, but one gets used to it. Highlighting passages and placing bookmarks is easy, and quite handy for future reference. I've found the coverage of the free 3G network to be quite good at most times, but if one is traveling (by air, subway, etc.) it's best to download reading material in advance. Have downloaded hundreds of books, numerous daily blogs and newspapers over time. Have found Michael Gallagher's daily blogFree Kindle Books Plus a Few Other Tipsto be quite useful.Summary:The closest current model to the Kindle 2 is theKindle Keyboard 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6" E Ink Display, which has more memory, 4GB (room for about 3,500 books), an much greater battery life, and free 3G wireless connectivity. It also has built-in Wi-Fi, allowing for connectivity to Wi-Fi hotspots on the road or at home. The prices for these new models are significantly lower by far than the initial price of my Kindle 2. So are these improvements enough to make me upgrade to the Kindle Keyboard 3G? No, but this user is seriously looking at theKindle Firewith its full-color, 7" multi-touch display, and its Wi-Fi connectivity. If that happens, the books will come off of my Kindle 2 and it will go in my larger camera bag to use it for my manuals. It's still a very useful 5-star device to me.
Amazon came out with Kindel a while back.  I looked at it but did not get it when it first went on the market.  I waited and waited.  Thinking just what would I do with it.  Could I get used to reading books on a screen?  Would they be clear?  I finally got it.  It is great.  I now have a lot of books loaded on it to read.  And it is easy to read.  In fact, several times I noticed that I would reach to the top of the Kindel to turn the page.  Then I would remember that I had to click to next page instaed of turning the page.
I bought the Kindle as a "gadget" since I like having gadgets.  Since I've had it (3 weeks), I've read three books!  I didn't read three books all of last year!  This book is so much fun and I find that I read so much faster than the traditional way.  It may cost me a fortune especially since I didn't have a line item in the budget for BOOKS before this.  My only complaint is that the screen isn't backlit.  It would be nice to read in bed or outside at night without having a separate light, but... oh well.  I'll get over it.... after I read about 30 more books!
I have had my Kindle for a couple of months now, and I just love it.  I have limited vision, and reading normal print sized books was getting difficult.  The Kindle has the ability to increase the font print size to whatever I need, and this is a god send for people like me with limited vision.  I am also enjoying the large amount of free older books, and even cheap newer books that are available.  I would highly recommend the Kindle for anyone who has vision problems.
The +++ have been covered at length. Therefore, I will address some of the reported cons:K 2 and books too expensive? Really? I more than paid for my Kindle 1 with all the free books provided by amazon.com. The beat goes on and it is accelerating. There are currently about 25 books for free (non public domain from Kindle Store) for you to download to your K2. Have you included the cost to Amazon of the "pay no monthly wireless fee" in your analysis?No K 2 improvement over K 1? K 1 rocks but K 2 rocks more. Try to highlight text straddling over 2 pages on K 1. K 2 does that elegantly without the big boxes. What about the newspapers/blogs reading experience? You haven't notice the difference. Oh please!No backlight? Get real.No Touch Screen? Yeah right, I read better on a device with a fat grease smear on the screen after I make a pit stop at MacDonald's.The prev/next/back/home buttons are too small? Oh boy! Didn't you complain about the opposite situation on K1.DRM an issue? Authors and publishers determine the drm profile of their ebooks. It is amazon/device agnostic. Complain to the Author's Guild, the association that wants to take TTS away from us Kindle lovers.Text to Speech (TTS) sucks! You don't need to use it. I do like how it reads the newspapers to me. It is very convenient and it will get better with software upgrade. Let me get that straight: My freshly published Financial Times crosses the Atlantic beneath the sea, then travel through the air to my K 2 and then my K 2 reads my FT out loud as soon as I get out of bed! How cool is that?No slot for an SD card? 1,500 books on the K 2 and an unlimited number of your books saved on amazon.com servers that can be downloaded at will for free and that is not enough! Try a Cray computer on your next vacation.Wishes: Add a prev page button on the right and a home button on the left. Global wireless access to Kindle Store.

I owned the first Kindle and now have the Kindle 2.  I read Ben's review with great interest.  I agree Ben!  I am legally blind.  I can however read using my Clarity Reader and my IMAC.  I can still make out words with the use of strong glasses and setting the font to the largest possible on the Kindle2.  I bought the Kindle2 for the text to speech option.  The voice is not very good but it suffices. I can strain to read the text but then close my eye for awhile and listen.  Plus the Kindle2 changes the pages so I do not get lost.  The text is easier to read than the Kindle1.  All in all I love my Kindle2.
I bought my first Kindle over two years ago and haven't stopped congratulating myself on the great decision to purchase this fantastic device. I love being an early adopter of all kinds of new technology but the Kindle is so unique that I can't even compare it to any other purchase. Other reviewers have listed all of the amazing capacities of the Kindle, so I will just list the aspects of my life that have been positively transformed by it:1. I'm a college professor and I get to travel a lot. The possibility of carrying all of my books, articles, and dictionaries with me anywhere I go has been invaluable. I can work on preparing my courses on the beach, or on an airplane, or pretty much anywhere without having to surround myself with piles of books and papers.2. An educator's life is often pretty itinerant. Since I bought my Kindle, I have moved between different countries and different states 4 times. There is nothing more painful when moving than packing books. They weigh a ton, occupy a lot of space, and take forever to pack. Now that I have a Kindle, however, I don't need to buy nearly as many paper books, so moving is much easier.3. I have always envied people who can walk around with a nice-looking small handback, instead of lugging around a huge backpack willed with books and papers. Now, I go to work with a small, beautiful bag that contains my Kindle. Most of the books I discuss in class with my students are available for Kindle, so I don't need to worry about leaving a book I need behind.4. As a scholar of literature, I always underline many passages in every book I read. My Amazon Kindle page keeps all of those passages organized and ready for me to copy directly into the article I'm working on or into my class plan. This is saving me an incredible amount of time.5. Kindle 2 has this great capacity to deliver my newspaper and magazine subscriptions when I travel overseas. You have to pay a little extra for that, but this service has definitely been worth the small price for me.6. Kindle 2 also has this fun capacity to share quotes you like on Twitter and Facebook in a matter of seconds. How often do you read something great that you want to share with your friends but don't feel like going to the trouble of copying the quote, then e-mailing it, etc.? Kindle 2 has this problem solved.7. There are free games available for Kindle 2 (and I believe we will see a lot more of such games appearing in the near future for free or at a very small price). This means you can enjoy your Kindle even if you are not reading.People often complain that new versions of the Kindle keep coming out and then the previous versions become outdated. I couldn't disagree more with that criticism. No matter how many new and more sophisticated Kindle versions come out, you can always find people among your friends, relatives and acquaintances who would love to get a less sophisticated version as a gift. I haven't repented being an early adopter of this product for a second and can't wait to see how it will evolve in the future.
"Do your research!" my sons said. They parroted my own advice to them before making big purchases.  I listened to my kids. For 18 months I followed blogs, techie columns, and consumer reporting information.  When I was certain the Kindle2 was what I wanted, they bought it for my recent milestone birthday.Everything you've read is true.  The Kindle2 is an efficient, wireless way to have a library at your fingertips.  Many books are free, or much less expensive than those on paper.  You can connect to the internet in seconds.  Want to subscribe to newspapers?  Just click.  Periodicals?  Click.  Want to Google something you just read?  Click.  Move the cursor, click, and dictionary entries appear.  Want to highlight passages, take notes, remember a location in your reading?  Just start typing.  This is a reader's dream come true!It's lightweight.  Take it along for your commute, to the beach, a doctor's office.  Even on your overseas flight or cruise.  No more having to make choices of what book to bring.  Now you can bring more than you'll have time to read.  Even better, you won't have to pay the airlines for excess baggage.Let's say you've got documents to read, or you're editing a paper.  Kindle2 eliminates printing and carrying.  Download your PDF file and you're ready to go.Don't get me wrong.  I wouldn't give up my home library for anything.  But, for convenience, portability, and the instant gratification of accessing virtually anything I want to read in less than 60 seconds, well, I wouldn't be without my Kindle2, either.If it were possible to give a 4 1/2 star rating instead of a 5, I would give it.  The only deficits (notice I didn't say 'negatives') are in the experimental read-aloud component and the inability to categorize my books.  After years of listening to books on tape and CD, the voice is too robotic for me.  I tried using my Kindle2 to read aloud to me while driving and did not enjoy the experience. I'm told, however, that it's possible to download a book on CD into my PC and transfer it into my Kindle2.  But that requires borrowing the book from a library or friend, or actually buying it--which negates the reason for buying an e-reader.  I'd like to categorize my books (fiction, non-fiction, thriller, etc.) as if putting them into files.  Maybe Amazon will create software--at no cost, please, for those of us who already bought our Kindles--that will allow these options.
To be succinct: WOW!Like many, I was skeptical--and to a large degree--of just how much I would like the DX.  I had owned the K1, then bought the K2 in March, and was quite content to take comfort and succor in my K2.  Then all of the hyperbole about the DX is announced--and my wife turned to me and saliently uttered these words: "It looks like you will be spending $500.  There goes our dinner at Roy's!"Bottom line: I'm out the $500, we still went to Roy's, and this DX is truly the apotheosis of what a Kindle should be.  Love the screen, the crispness of the text,  and ability to switch to a landscape mode.  All I can say is this: it was worth every penny to switch from the K2.  THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD HAVE WANTED ALL ALONG!To all of the new DX owners: isn't it great?!  As for the folks who own a K2--as I did and still do--you will want to upgrade to DX when the time is right.  Amazon hit a home run with this thing.Bravo!
First off, Amazon should have separate review areas for the different generations.  Most of the top reviews refer to the first generation Kindle DX, and have little revelance to the Kindle DX Graphite (version 2).  In 2013, my review here will have no relevance to the 2013-era device.  Time to split these things up.As a reader, this is gorgeous.  I'm actually preferring this over books at the moment, because I can focus on a page better.  All the technical PDFs I've loaded similarly look gorgeous. In one experiment, I put a complex, graphics-intensive, 4000-page 1GB PDF on the Kindle, via the computer link. Works wonderfully.Now, the browser.  Experimentally, this offers access to the internet, for free.I've tried out checking my mail, posting things, and looking through various sites.On the whole, I'd say the browser is fairly lousy.  But it works, and it's free.  As an emergency back-up to staying connected, this is incredibly valuable.  If things ever get desperate, this "lousy" browser will keep me connected.  If would be nice for this to be better, so long as it remains lousy enough  to stay free.  I full expect to see stories of lives being saved by the Kindle in the future.  With its low power consumption, it will be the last gadget standing in an extended crisis.Some things that could make the browser more pleasant:1. Turn the 5-way into a clickable cursor.  Needing to click down 30 times to get to the right link is painful.2. A laptop-style touchpad at the bottom would be very handy.3. Autoclear fields.  When a field is filled with a long, long URL, there is no easy way to clear it.Some general desirable items for the next version and the future:1. Ignore border fluffery.  Sometimes, a text will have a lot of white-space or fluff on every page.  Having a page-crop option for a document would be very nice.  Alternately, just being able to do a general 125% zoom on the center of a document would be nice.  Currently, that zoom level only offers the corners, which is heavily annoying when the center would give everything.2. Memory slot would be fantastic3. Cheaper magazine/newspaper prices.  They should be cheaper than the print versions, always.4. Automatic wireless shut-off / turn-on.5. Better folder capabilities are a necessity.6. Display collections as arrays instead of lists.7. Turning-off auto-landscape with Aa saves power. Oversensitive.8. Would be nice for device options to be in one place.9. Paid-for kindle-format documents with line graphics often appear smudged.10. Many paid-for kindle-format documents are terribly formatted.11. Free PDF documents, on the other hand, always look gorgeous.12. Buttons should be gentler to click.  The long bar must be clicked dead on to click.13. There should be significant savings for books, especially textbooks.On Amazon suggestions -- since I'm trying many free books.1. When an item is chosen, Amazon will often suggest 100+ other items.  This fails badly -- the only way to get back to reasonable suggestions is to mark everything popular as "Do not use for suggestions." Only items strongly connected should be suggested.  When I download Sherlock Holmes, there is no earthly reason to suggest Darwin books, rice steamers, and diapers. The algorithm for improving these suggestions is in basic graph theory (I could recommend some good books on the topic for the Amazon programmers).Despite these comments, all in all, a gorgeous device.  And a very useful browser, in a pinch.
I would like to say that this is the best thing that has come along in which to read books and magazines.  It is easy to handle but I will say one has quite a few things to learn how tohandle the Kindle.  Once you have learned everything, it is a breeze to handle it.  I would encourage anyone who loves to read to buy a Kindle and enjoy something that is easy touse.  Annie
My wife has had a Kindle 2 since they first came out. I hemmed and hawed over getting a Kindle simply because I read a lot of magazines. I'd heard that many magazines were going to be available in Kindle format, but who really wants to read them on that small of a screen?Well, I am still waiting for many of my favorite magazines to be available on the Kindle. However, I've found that the larger screen is great for PDF's! Many books and reference materials are available in this format. Are you a student? Many textbooks can be purchased in PDF format for much less that the physical book.I also use my Kindle DX for reading normal books as well. In low light areas you can enlarge the font and still have plenty of words on the screen. This is not something you would normally want to do on smaller screened book readers.I love my Kindle DX and I would never go back. I do sometimes miss the feel of a paperback in my hands, but then I realize that I am holding several hundred books all at the same time (many of which were free!)
Our Family owns 3 Kindles: K1, K2 and we now own Kindle DX.We rated K1 and K2, 5 stars. K1 got its grade for the seamless Amazon's wireless offering and the superior reading experience. K2 improved form function, introduced Text to Speech functionality and expanded embedded K1's memory.Why did I order a Kindle DX? I bought a DX for its ability to handle complex written structures. I read financial reports voraciously. Since I can't read these reports on my PC screen or on K2 (text yes, financial statements no), I print out fat financials reports on a daily basis. As soon as I ordered Kindle DX, I sent .pdf files with tables, files and pictures to my DX email address. Does DX end the tyranny of lugging around piles of work material? Let's find out.Text: I almost had a heart attack. I downloaded a PDF from Edgar Online. Their standard font is just too small for DX. On the second attempt, I used a bigger bold font and it worked perfectly. I now have my Kindle DX magical font. Then I tested the Auto-Rotation feature. That is the DX golden nugget. It works brilliantly! Within a PDF document, auto-rotate to landscape will render the appropriate text size. I tested this feature on the original Edgar Document et voila! I prefer the next page and prev page buttons located at the bottom of the unit in landscape mode. You can't annotate or Highlight in a PDF file. I trust Amazon.Com to deliver this feature in the not too distant future. If not, there goes one star.Graphs and Tables: I got the Daily livestock Report from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The document has text, boxes, graphs and tables on one page. I auto rotated this newsletter to landscape mode and the rendering reaches perfection.Pictures: Work of Art! I love the black and white pictures with lots of texture.Browser: Speed has not increased but the ability to extract Wikipedia material for me is priceless. The size of the screen facilitates reading in the browser.Form Function: The ability to handle complex structures comes at a cost. The cost is basically the super sizing of the unit. I find the unit to be much easier to hold in the landscape mode. My wife and I will continue to use our K1 and K2 for reading ebooks. I will be using DX for more complex material.Text to Speech (TTS): I find myself using TTS more and more. Unfortunately on DX, TTS does not work within PDF files. It does on K2. This is a minor issue since I use TTS for ebooks.Memory: 3,500 books on the DX and an unlimited number of your books saved within the Amazon.com's cloud which can be downloaded at will for free.  Some say it is not enough; I say bring a Cray computer on your next vacation.Don't want: I don't want a backlight on my kindle or touch screen on the reading space.Wishes: Global wireless access to Kindle Store. Bezos' vision of all books ever written available on Kindle (let's speed this up, please). Sudoku. Add a print to file feature in the browser so that I can clip Wikipedia or other web material to be retrieved within the main menu. Ability to access the documents I have archived on Pixily.Update 7/10/2009: I have had this unit for almost a month now and I am very comfortable with the bigger and heavier form factor. After a few weeks, the unit feels more comfortable to hold than most hardcovers. I now download most .pdf to the unit and I expect to save in toner and paper cost the cost of the unit over a one year time frame. I use the leather Amazonkindle cover to protect my DX. It works great!
A little background......I've tried a couple of ebook readers in recent years and, after a day or two, found them unacceptable for any number of reasons. For example, the Sony device was cumbersome and adding books was frustrating and a plain hassle. I tried an early Kindle, but was unimpressed with the overall functionality and screen clarity. I experimented with various ebook reading software for my smartphone (which has a screen the same size as the average iPhone) such as Mobipocket and eReader (Barnes and Noble's software now). But, reading from a backlit screen that was still so small and was, again, cumbersome and less than satisfying. Again, purchasing and adding books to the device was just too much of a hassle.Amazon has finally come up with an ereader that really DOES "feel" like a real book. By that, I mean, I HAVE found myself getting "lost" in the book or articles I am reading.....forgetting that I am not holding a paper book, but an electronic device. I never thought it would happen.....but the latest Kindle DX (July 2010) is so crisp in its display, so intuitively easy to operate and deep enough in features to make it a remarkable device. Adding a book is so simple, I suspect a young child could do it. Amazon's Kindle management features, both on Amazon.com and on the Kindle device itself are well-thought out and make the whole experience a hassle-free enjoyable experience. Just like buying a book in a bookstore used to be.....simple, rewarding, exciting with anticipation of a good read.I also purchased the Amazon Kindle DX leather cover.Amazon Kindle DX Black Leather Cover (Fits 9.7" Display, Latest and 2nd Generation Kindles)Despite earlier issues with the cover, it apears Amazon has quietly fixed them. There is now a magnet embedded in the back of the cover that, with a slight tug, gently reminds you to not open the Kindle cover from the back (apparently risking damage to the Kindle, at times, in the past). Again, well-thought-out, Amazon!
There are thousands of written and video reviews for the Kindle so I'll answer this question as my review. No need to rehash why the Kindle DX is an awesome e-reader and why it's better then all the other ones I've seen. If you want a complete review please look somewhere else.Why The Kindle DX Graphite Over The Kindle 3?* The main reason: The DX has a larger screen. 2.5 times larger. I have poor vision and on top of that - presbyopia (which most of us get as we get older) that makes small print, even with reading glasses, difficult to read for a long period of time.* The number keys are on the keyboard, unlike the Kindle 3 where you have to go into the symbol menu.* The DX's larger screen allows for the use of a larger font without having to turn the page as often as you would with the standard Kindle.* As a fan of the printed book I have, for the last 40 years, been reading the larger versions. You know, the hard cover size. I've always disliked the mass-market versions. If you are like me in that regard you'll need to get the DX. The screen size on the Kindle 3 is about the same size as a mass-market paperback.* The larger screen allows for better use of PDF files, comic books and children's books. Yes, they are available and do come with pictures.* The extra weight is noticeable but not to the point where it is heavy. A hard cover book with quality paper weighs more. Both the DX and K3 have a good solid feel.* I'm right handed and therefore I do not need the page-turning buttons on the left side. (You can turn the DX over and then have the page buttons on the left side if you don't mind having the keyboard upside-down at the top.)* The Wi-Fi capability of the Kindle 3 (which the DX does not have for some reason) is a nice thing to have if you can't get 3G in your area but since it is available (barely) at my home I really don't have a need for it. You can also hook the DX straight to your computer using the included USB cable. I'm not reading books at such a high rate of speed that I'll run out of things to read if I'm away from the home.* I prefer the toggle control on the DX over the 5 way switch on the Kindle 3. Not a big deal but it works much better for me.* The keyboards are similar. Both are QWERTY and both have print so small a mouse would need glasses. Fortunately you don't need the keyboard while reading.* The on/off button is on the top so it doesn't interfere with holding the devise. Kindle 3 has both on/off and volume on the bottom.Overall the DX is a nicer e-reader then the Kindle 3 but only because it meets my needs better. Is it worth the extra money? For me, yes. But you'll have to figure that out for yourself.NOTE: A little know fact in Texas is that the Kindle 3 is illegal. You must order the Kindle DX because everything in Texas must be bigger. (At least that's what I hear)
This is way better than a lot of other kindles! I have 2 kindle 4th gen, kindle touch 3G and a kindle DX this is the best it is bigger than all of them and the controller is like a claw machine joy stick. It has only 3G so you can access the Internet form anywhere. This also has eink pearl which is the best money can buy.Pros:Screen is 2.5x bigger than all other kindles.Very fast you can download a book in about 20 secondsLightweight and about as big as a iPadScreen is as big as a iPad.Cons:non touchscreenOnly one side with buttons to turn pagesWill not work well with left hand
I am entering this review from my Kindle.Have used it for a month now & have put hundreds of ebooks & dozens of programs andgames on it.Battery life has been exceptional, about three weeks of reading and downloading andsurfing the web.Have been able to read my computer email, read the news for free and buy thingsat Amazon ect.Web surfing is good, with free coverage almost everywhere and wifi as a backup(it switches automatically to the best signal strength)The screen is not color but hi resolution black and white. This is how the battery life is sogood. The resolution is so sharp that a whole newspaper page if visable on the screenand readable even with tiny printing and pictures.It is easy with 1 click to zoom for larger print & pictures.Ebooks and games are easy to put into groups. Just make a catagory and add as manyitems to it with multiple ckeckmarks as you wish.On the home screen I have authors names ect. One click on these and all the books arelisted to pick from.The Kindle remembers where you stopped reading, no matter how many books are beingread at the same time.Until they make a laptop this small and light with all these features and battery lifemeasured in weeks instead of 4 hours, I will use my Kindle....
I can't say enough great things about the Kindle 2.  In short, I am using the Kindle for books, magazines, and games.  In the past few days I've purchased two versions of the Bible for a total of less than $10.  I purchased The Reader's Digest, numerous books and games, and The Daily Guidepost 2011.  It's so easy to order from Amazon.com via the Kindle.When I visited my grandchildren during Christmas I was able to download a book for my nine-year-old granddaughter to read in less than a minute.  Now she wants one!  Two great features are you can set a password so no one can use your Kindle without your permission and you can turn the wireless off when you aren't using it.  One of the best features is the ability to enlarge the letters.  I can read everything without having to wear my glasses.I told a friend of mine about my Kindle 2 and she said she liked the feel of a real book when she's reading it.  When she tried out my Kindle 2, she changed her mind.The Kindle offers a whole new world in reading and entertainment!
I have to admit I was a little sceptical about buying one of these.  After receiving it I could not believe all you could do with the Kindle.  I am an avid textbook reader who takes notes and highlights things I like to remember.  You can do this with the Kindle.  I am working towards my Master's Degree and I've noticed all my Batchelor's degree texts were available for the Kindle.  I can't wait to get my textbooks on the Kindle for my Masters.  It sure will beat carrying around heavy textbooks!  Overall I am totally satisfied and would recommend this product for anyone!  Oh and it sure beats trying to find a book you are looking for by traveling to several book stores.  You pick the book on Amazon, click a button and within seconds you have the book and at less than what you would pay at a local bookstore.  How can you beat that?
I love my Kindle.  Never had a problem with it.  I use it everyday.  The only thing that would make it better would be a built in reading light.
I love this item! My whole famil fights over it! I love the fact that it reads out loud to the kids!
I'm very pleased with my new Kindle.  It's wonderful not to have to worry about being in a Wi-fi area as this Kindle has the capability of using the internet anywhere!I can download books, games, newspapers effortlessly.It's a little difficult to access e mail, but I didn't even realize that this product allowed me to access the internet and that was a big surprise.I would recommend that buyers of this product also purchase (and they're inexpensive) a user guide from the Kindle store.  Just look at the reviews for the best one.  They really help you solve problems and find out things you never new about your kindle.It's a great product.  I love reading books on it.  I love the fact that I can adjust the font.The customer service people are fabulous.  You can call about anything.  It's hard to believe how patient they are.  I called a lot when I first got my Kindle & they were so helpful.I'm hooked!
It is nice to have a product that has a two year product guarantee.  All the paperwork was in order, I received it via e-mail and hard copy by mail.
I doubt I can add anything to the other 11,000 plus reviews that hasn't already been said other than this is just what I wanted. Works good, wish I would have bought it sooner and I will probably wear it out (no knock on the quality, just my usage). It's not an IPad or a tablet, if you want a glorified smart phone get the DX or one of the other Readers out there. But for the purpose it's designed for and the price you can't beat it, and the 3G is a great back up when you're not near a wifi hot spot.
I LOVE THIS!  I read lots of books and this Kindle is just Awesome!!!  Went on trip recently, downloaded books as we traveled....great item.  The 3G is the way to go....best quality...Just wish it had a light for night reading...I'm sure there is one on the market, but didn't think I'd need a light, but now I see I do....will have to purchase a clip on...Great Product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I originally purchased a Kindle 2 from Amazon the end of July only to find a day or so after it arrived that the Kindle 3 was available for pre-order. I wondered initially if upgrading to the Kindle 3 (3G) would be worth it -- and IT IS! I love the convenience of the wireless connection, but wanted the freedom of having the 3G book delivery anywhere, as I live in a rural area and travel a lot. Now I have the best of both.The size didn't seem like a big deal initially, but now I can fit the Kindle 3 into a small purse with the cover included--something I couldn't do with a Kindle 2. Even _better_ the new slender profile felt SO GOOD in my hand as I read whether sitting or laying down (on the side or on my back--it didn't matter)!I found between the new e-ink screen and the graphite color that my eyes didn't wander off the screen--something I noticed with my Kindle 2. I had difficulty initially deciding between the white and graphite color, and I find the graphite doesn't detract from the e-ink at all, in fact, it seems to "frame" the writing on the screen.Another plus is the back of the Kindle 3 is completely non-slip material--almost a rubbery material--with no metal on the back like the Kindle 2 that could scratch or slip. The front and back don't show dirt/wear, just a bit of smudges on the back that wipe off with a soft cloth. Very nice materials with noticeably improved quality.The e-ink is better than ever and feels like a "vacation" for my eyes after staring at an laptop LCD screen all day. I'm looking forward to a fun weekend reading books I downloaded in anticipation of the Kindle 3 arriving.The surprise of the Kindle for me was how much MORE reading I am doing, and because so many e-books are inexpensive, I am reading books in genres I don't normally read.If you are on the fence of upgrading to a Kindle 3, esp now with the Wireless Kindle 3 at $139, I recommend taking the plunge.
In my previous Kindle (2nd generation) review, I called it the cheddar cheese on my omelet and the whipped cream on top of my frappuccino. Can't beat that - or can you? Hmmm... my favorite cold frappe is the caramel kind. If you are very lucky, the barista will drizzle a little extra caramel on top of the whipped cream. Yeah, the 3rd generation is kind of like that caramel. When you see it, you cannot believe your luck and you cannot decide if you should dive right in or take your time and savor it... Amazon has outdone themselves with the new generation. Wow. Wow. Wow. I opted for the wifi only version because I'm rarely without a hotspot and I don't need to use the browser on the go or download a book in a moving car or anything :)I think you can read the description for yourself so I'll concentrate on the differences. But, overall, reading on a Kindle is like nothing you imagine it will be. I always said that I would never get one. I wanted to keep my paper books and couldn't believe someone would want to read on that computer thing. Now I'm one of the biggest "enablers" of the Kindle. This thing gave my mother back the ability to read all books again (her eyesight is not what it used to be and you can adjust the font from tiny to very large - this is also great for me when I read in bed. I don't have to wear my glasses!). It also allowed me to clean up some of the stuff in my house. I used to hoard books. I still do, but they all fit in one little bitty Kindle now and not on the shelf, under the bed, in drawers, etc etc. But again... the differences, as I see 'em....Changes from the K2 to the K3 include:1. Compared with the K2, it feel so tiny and light. The difference is actually small, but it feels so small and light in the hand that I had to lay them side by side to satisfy myself that I didn't get some super secret new tiny Kindle. Hey, it's possible that good old Jeff Bezos wanted me to have the K4 here folks!2. The next thing I noticed is that I couldn't figure out how to turn the darn thing on. They moved the slider to the bottom. Okay, not loving that, it feels more awkward, but I'm going with the assumption that I won't notice after a few days. Also at the bottom, the charger light is brighter, small change.3. I thought the text was super crisp on my previous Kindle. Nay. Wow. This is SO MUCH darker. I'm actually shocked at the difference, it's really very significant. I was hemming and hawing over upgrading but this alone makes it work the price of the upgrade. I'd seen photos online, but you simply cannot understand until you see it. It's a huge difference. Did I mention you can choose between 3 fonts? Yeah baby!4. Gone is the HOME button the right side of the Kindle. FINALLY. I cannot tell you how many times, after 18 months of use, I STILL wanted to use that button to go to the previous page. Bye-bye to my button nemesis! WooHoooooo!! It is replaced with slimmer Next and Previous buttons that are just arrows. I'm still getting used to this as I'm used to pushing slightly inward to change the page, but after several pages, I adapted pretty well.5. Gone is the joystick. I should say that I didn't hate the joystick. I always thought it was fine. A little finicky, but just fine. What they have given us now is a little four way pad with the select in the middle. I thought this would be a little difficult to navigate, but nope, I have yet to have it go where I didn't want it to go. Fabulous! Along with that the Menu, Back and Home keys are now arranged around the little pad. All very well laid out. It is bit of an adjustment, but just taking the time to get my books settled back in was enough for me to get used to it and I don't even notice it.6. The keyboard thingy... there has been a little bit of tension in the kindle community about this. Some people are pretty peeved that the number keys are gone. Me? I don't care, you just press the SYM key now to get to them. I don't use the keyboard very often and the numbers even less often so perhaps that's why I don't care. It also leaves a little space between the screen and the keyboard for me to put a little label about what to do if it's lost, but that's my own reasons. I don't see anything wrong with them being gone myself. BUT the keys are GREAT. Pressing them is much easier than on the K2. Oh, you aren't going to be typing 50 words per minute (or even 20) but it's a much more pleasurable experience.7. The back is ... a little more "grippy" now - not like rubberized or anything, but it's not slick. Gone is the shiny back. I almost missed this because I always read my kindle in a cover/case so I don't really have an opinion. I guess it's good if you read your Kindle naked (which makes me quite... uncomfortable)Overall this is a GREAT upgrade. I knew I'd like it, but I honestly didn't think I'd be THIS impressed by it. Seriously, get one. So worth it!
I've been a Kindle user since my Kindle 1st Gen and upgraded to Kindle 2 when that came out.  I pre-ordered my Kindle 3G+WiFi and got it yesterday.  LOVE IT!!!!Totally worth the upgrade if you'd still thinking, for the following reasons:1) Improved Readability:  The text look much sharper (better contrast), especially noticeable in bright outdoors.  Text rendering is also noticeabilly faster (one main reason for the upgrade is that I read fast, and love the improved speed in flipping pages).  Also, longer battery life is great.  My typical use, Kindle 2 last maybe 2-3 days w/wireless off (page rendering or page flipping uses up battery and since I read fast, flip pages more often than slower reader).2) Handling:  Kindle 3 feels great in one hand due to smaller size, non-metal back (grippier) and finally correcting the page turning on Kindle 2 to click outward again (it was outward in Kindle 1, which they took away in Kindle 2).  This allows me to hold the Kindle 3 and read with one hand by "flipping pages" using my thumb (can't do that with the inward click).  This feels much more natural to me.3) Book cover with light:  Kindle 1 cover has the elastic strap to keep the cover closed, amazon did away with in Kindle 2 and it's finally back in Kindle 3.  I also love the LED light, which works great. It lights up the entire screen for reading and tucks neatly back into its slot when not in use.4) WiFi:  Quick and easy connection to WiFi hotspot, makes for quicker downloads in spotty cell connection.5) Global Access:  Haven't had the chance to test this out yet but very excited that I'll be able to buy books while travelling overseas.6) Size/Weight:  Love the smaller size, fits into more of my smaller purses.  Kindle 3 without cover is definitely lighter.  Kindle 3 w/lighted cover and Kindle 2 w/cover feels like they weigh about the same.Note: Updated SoftwareA) The new "Collections" options now allows you to organize your books on the kindle into "Collections", makes for much easier searches.  This software upgrade is pushed to older Kindle models also.B) Love the new Text options that add adjustments to paragraph/line spacing between lines as well as size of text.C) PDF files now supported - great for workD) Password Lock - I can put a password to lock access to kindle.  Great if I have PDF of work files stored on it.
UPDATE 9/14/2011: We now own two of these 3rd generation Kindles and remain extremely pleased with them. That being said, one of them developed screen issues and Amazon had a replacement out to me in a day and half and, since it was still under warranty, it was replaced and shipped free. Great customer service!Original Review: We already own two of the 2nd generation Kindle and bought this 3rd Generation Kindle as a gift for my daughter to take with her to college. After spending a good bit of time using hers, I have to say that it is every bit as good as the previous version and even better in a few ways. Here are my observations and some comparisons between the two versions we own:+ Easy to read display; does not cause eye strain, even after hours of use+ Fast; brings up books very quickly and seems much faster than our 2nd generation devices+ Small; physically smaller but retains the same screen size as the older Kindles+ Access to our family "library"; we can share all of our Amazon purchased books between all of devices+ Wi-Fi; works great and is easy to setup+ Fantastic battery life; seriously longer life and remembering to turn off the wireless gives days of reading without recharging+ Handles PDF files; great for reading college and technical papers sent to the Kindle via emailWe also bought theKindle Lighted Leather Cover, Black (Fits 6" Display, Latest Generation Kindle), which not only protects but also has a built in light that draws power directly from the Kindle.My daughter is thrilled with her Kindle and says it was her favorite gift.Highly Recommended!CFH
I absolutely love my kindle! I am an avid reader. I read at least once a day, usually before going to bed, but sometimes while sitting outside when the kids are playing or waiting for dinner to come off the grill. Kindle does not use a backlight, like a laptop, therefore the screen is always perfectly crisp and clear. You can't read in the dark, but that didn't bother me. The text-to-speech feature wasn't that great, only because it lacked the appropriate emphasis on certain words (i.e. it doesn't read the way my brain interupts). That's just a personal preference though - I focus better when reading it myself.3G Network Option: I highly recommend the more expensive 3rd generation Kindle with free 3G network. The browsing isn't that great, but you can do facebook and some email account. Hotmail didn't work for me, but gmail does. Being "expirimental" I'm sure all of that will get better with time, but I was extremely pleased with the product. The 3G network version is about $50 more, but you never have to pay for it again. It's not a monthly thing like a cell phone, no annual fees, nothing. Well worth the added cost in my opinion.Buying eBooks: I bought my first book from the Kindle Store and it took less than 30 seconds, start to finish, because I knew what book I wanted. The actual download was under 5 seconds. I was amazed! I clicked BUY and was instantly reading the prologue to Dragon Wing: Death Gate Cycle Volume 1 (Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman). I was never a big amazon shopper before, but you guys REALLY impressed me with this one!Battery: The 1-month battery life is seriously awesome! I have had my kindle for  three weeks now and the battery has yet to go low. I read that chargin takes 3 hours max, but haven't gotten to try it out yet (cause it just keeps going).One last note, and I know it's written in almost every Kindle review here but I'll say it again. Kindle is not for internet junkies. It is for avid readers of books, newspapers, magazines, etc. Sure, it has some browsing capabilities that embelish the Kindle's features, but if you're not a reader, just get a PC tablet (and maybe a few back-up batteries).
I wanted to buy this the very first day it was available. Still I waited and waited till I could not hold off any longer. My better half told me to quit holding my breath and take care of business.I am so happy I finally made the jump into the deep end. Yes I know this is not the end all and be all of technology still it is getting there. I do wish I was only 4yrs old though. Why do I wish this on myself? Knowing what I have seen come about during the last 60 years. I do wish that I could be here to see the next 60 years.The light bulb, The telephone, The automobile, The atom, The airplane, The laser, The microwave, The personal computer, The transistor, and The internet. So many things so little time. Now we have a library larger than the one of Thomas Jefferson, that can be carried around in one hand.It seems every time I think of something new to put in one of these fantastic items. I find it is already in it.I would try to hit all the high points in one of these but I would just leave out ten points for each one I do remember to include.dray
I live in Japan, and after the earthquake my cell phone service went down as did my internet (and thus, wifi).  I have no idea what technical reason is behind it, but the 3G network of my Kindle remained functional.  I was able to access the internet with the (albeit clunky) browser and figure out what was going on and stay in touch with family and work.  I don't have a TV either so I really had no other way to access any information other than via my Kindle.  Needless to say, I am hugely grateful to have had that access, and as much as I loved my Kindle before, I am even happier now.I suppose I should mention otherwise that my Kindle really is a fabulous product.  I am living in a small Japanese house that doesn't need to be cluttered with the 500+ books I have downloaded over the last year and a half.  Although, to be fair, I can say at least 100 of them are freebies I might never have purchased in paper form.  I love having the text-to-speech for when I'm stuck in traffic (I love hearing the 'naughty' words pronounced in that computer voice), I love the different font sizes, and I love the access most of all.  I don't have a convenient bookstore with books in English and, though Amazon does a fabulous job in mailing me things, nothing beats the instant gratification of the immediate download.  The eInk is easy on my eyes (no, I don't want backlighting for my Kindle...too much of a battery drain and a little harsh at night..I use a clip on light like for a tree/ink book).  The battery lasts me about 2 weeks of moderate reading, three if I'm busy at work and 1 if I've had an easy week or have been using the wifi.  I buy about 20% of my books from off-Amazon, so I never feel 'tied' to one seller.  The Kindle also has the best access and support for those traveling and living overseas (as far as I know about anyway).  The Kindle also has made a great change to my reading  habits--I read far more and because of the freebies and access I've started reading many new genres and authors.Well, those are the positives right off the top of my head.  The negatives--I don't feel like the Kindle is the best for anything job related or picture intensive.  Some don't like the lack of library access, and while that would be nice, it's not like my local military library has much in it.  (The online library offered is not of interest either...).Needless to say, my positives far outweigh my negatives and I am very happy with it.Highly recommend....particularly the 3G version!JTG
I purchased the Kindle Keyboard (wi-fi version) in early 2011 as a replacement for my older Kindle (which was then given to a friend). At the time, the Kindle Keyboard was known as the "Kindle 3."After using it for almost a year, I can say that the Kindle Keyboard is unequivocally a superb book reader. With the ability to adjust fonts and font sizes, books are always easy to read. The controls are simple, and I like the four-way control much better than the tiny joystick that the earlier Kindles had.I don't use the text-to-speech feature very often, but it's handy if I do feel like listening instead of reading.The web browser is very slow and it's a bit clunky, but I have used it in a pinch a few times. It's also in 16-color grayscale, so the graphics are less than dazzling. Since I use my Kindle almost exclusively for reading, this isn't an issue for me.Battery life is very good for a small portable device. I read about an hour each day, and I usually recharge the Kindle about once every two weeks, although the battery indicator still shows about 30% charge remaining.I have played a few games on the Kindle, and although it's not really designed to be a game player, there are a number of games that I've enjoyed playing, mostly of the puzzle-solving type.With firmware updates, Amazon has done a nice job of continually improving the performance and capability of the Kindle. I also like how easy it is to add non-Kindle books or music to the Kindle. When the Kindle is connected to my PC, the PC sees it as a USB device, and it's easy to drag and drop PC files into the Kindle (first make sure the file type is readable by the Kindle).And I love the size of the Kindle. It's big enough for reading and small enough and lightweight enough to be portable. The Kindle goes everywhere with me.
I can't say enough good things about the kindle! I've had mine for months now, almost a year, and I can not put it down. I use to read occasionally and my husband bought it for me because I hated when I would buy a book how much space they took up and I had heard a lot of good things about the kindle. Since I received my kindle I have read more then I have in years! Its so small you can carry it anywhere (I carry mine in my purse). The books are all at least half price from paper books and they have TONS of free books (once a month they put books you would normally pay for for free.They have new updates it seems daily (internet surfing, games, reading features,library lending) and the best part about that is any kindle can get the updates so unlike other e-readers you dont have to constantly buy a new device to get the new updates. I absolutely LOVE that its not a computer screen. After having to be on my computer all day long I can tell a HUGE difference in the color screen vrs. their screen. My eyes never start aching. I recommend it to EVERY ONE I meet! However, people that have to have color or a ton of apps this is not for you they do have new apps out all the time but not currently a huge amount. I personally dont need the apps (there are so many other devices for that). Amazon customer service is great! Never had a problem with them, If you accidentally buy a book (very hard to do but it happens) there's no jumping through hoops they simply fix the problem. My family all had a  different e-readers (my aunt the nook, my uncle the soney, and my cousin the off brand) Since seeing mine they have all changed over. The one downside I can think of is the device memory, Once you fill up your memory (you can have like 3,000 books but I had to test the theory) it starts running a little slower, However once you get a book off amazon they save it online for you so you dont have to have them all on your device at once, when you are ready to put more on simply go to your account and add it. They have added the feature to share books and have library lending coming sometime before dec. (2011) Again cant say enough good things about kindle. I VERY HIGHLY recommend it. If your still on the fence go online (even not on the kindle webpage) and read the other reviews 99% of people that own one love it. Kindle simply is the best E-Reader out there!
I am really happy with my new Kindle Keyboard.  I used to have a Kindle Touch I bought in Feb, 2012.  I am getting too old, and my fingers shake a bit.  It is harder to type on a screen, like the Touch, if your fingers shake.  A Keyboard requires you press harder on the key before it registers.  And so, it works much better for me.  I bought a cover that has a attached light for this Kindle, which I also really think adds value to the Kindle, itself.  It is no wonder the Kindle Touch was replaced with the Kindle Paperwhite.  In general, the Kindle Keyboard adds the ability to use ALT-KEYS to do "keyboard shortcuts" that a Touch can't give you.  However, you need to move around on the screen with "direction keys" with a Keyboard, whereas the Touch you just put your finger where you want to be on the screen.  For me, I will put up with "direction keys" to get "keyboard shortcut" functionality.  It also seemed the software I really wanted was always not available on Touch.  Before buying whatever Kindle you get, just look to see if you can get the software you want for the type of Kindle you plan to buy.  The real, quality capabilities of the Kindle you can get on any Kindle, no matter what you choose.  But, these little details are what makes me happy I switched from the Touch to the Keyboard.
I got the Kindle 1 in June 2008, about 7 months after its debut.  I fell in love with it, having my books with me anywhere, anytime, on such an easy to read screen, built-in dictionary, etc., etc., we all know the benefits by now, I need not rehash them here.Now I have the Kindle 3 and I must say: I'm falling in love all over again!  The improved contrast screen is even easier to read on and sharper, the response time is much faster when looking up word definitions or moving from screen to screen, page turns are a LOT quicker, Collections are a nice tool to keep your home screen tidy, and the WiFi and 3G both work very well.The ability to have virtually any book that you could possibly want within 60 seconds of thinking about it, to being able to carry around a library on a single small device, is truly remarkable.  I have found new ways of reading since I've gotten my Kindle.  I never used to start more than one book at a time if for no other reason because carrying around multiple DTBs is not very practical.  However with my Kindle, I have found that I like to have several books going at once.  I am able to jump from an intense nonfiction book to a light hearted satire oriented book to a mystery novel all with just a few clicks.  So, if I'm not in the mood for one particular type of book yet still have time to read, I am not out of luck, I'm able to find something enjoyable and thus make the most of time, how wonderful!!I love the seamless ecosystem Amazon has setup, between the hardware (Kindle), the availability of SO many books, to making the books readable on mobile devices, such as my Droid, Amazon has done a wonderful job of making reading SO ACCESSIBLE, which really is what it is all about in the end, right?Thank you Amazon for another wonderful Kindle, you have made a dedicated customer very happy, again.  :)
I love it... I never cared for readers before. They were clumsily designed and power hogs..The new Kindle is smooth as grease.. Easy to use, very light, and easy to navigate. The Mcover fits it perfectly (Amazon $10). The WIFI setup was very simple... It comes with your Amazon account already registered.The page turn buttons are well designed and on both sides. They are push buttons and not squeeze buttons, so cuts down on accidental page turns..The USB cable is a beautiful design. The cable can be used to charge from an AC plug in (included) or from a desktop pc. PC wise, when the Kindle is plugged in to the pc you get a charging page on kindle and a Kindle directories on the PC. You download a free book (manybooks.net my favorite)to the computer then copy and paste into the Kindle directory. Remove the USB and the new book will appear on the Kindle home page...The advertisements are no bother. They appear on the time out page and at very bottom of Home page... Well worth the 25 dollar savings and kind of interesting... I received it today 4/29. Six days early, can't beat Amazon's service....The Pearl screen is BEAUTIFUL. Very easy to read. Color is not necessary. You can put the screen in landscape mode,, very nice for full page reads.There is a manual on the Kindle that answers all questions (very well done) and how tos. I bought the note pad program .99 well worth it and very handy for notes. It pops up on a page when needed and leaves a number at point of note for future reference... Home button takes you back to first page and the menu button pops up when needed with many options....There is even a web browser on it. A bit primitive, but it works. The Kindle will read to you. Speakers are on back at top corners or you can use ear plugs. I haven't tried it yet. So much to do...This Kindle is a work in process. Many new things will be added in the coming years. WOW, I am really really impressed!!!!!This is just my first impression. I will update as I get more familiar.I LOVE IT!!!
love it
i love this game it is alot of fun to play to pass the time . . . . .
This is a wonderful collection of twelve card games for the Kindle 2nd gen and more recent models.I've played all the games now, and there are at least five or six of the games that I play often and really enjoy, (the others I'll probably play more soon and get just as much fun out of those too once I get more competent at beating them!) The games are very well implemented, with clear graphics and layout, and the keyboard shortcuts are always visible on screen are a nice touch to speed up gameplay. Full stats are available so the user can seek to better their records in each game to prolong the addictive qualities of these games further.For such a small price, this package of games will provide many, many hours of enjoyment for anyone who likes playing solitaire card games. Well done EA!(EA - how about developing a chess game next please!)
You wont run out of games to play. Great for passing the time. Its most likely more fun on the fire. but the original kindle is fun too.
After owning this game just one day, I can safely say that there has never been a hand-held version of solitaire that matches up to EA's Kindle version.  And if you are one of those people who love FREECELL, then you won't be disappointed!  Any other portable version of Freecell I have ever tried has been somewhat lacking in ease of playability.  Not so with this masterpiece!  The Freecell game alone is worth more than the price of all twelve games.I have already tried many of the games in this collection, and not one has let me down yet.  If you enjoy solitaire, and you have a Kindle, you might as well throw your other portable solitaire games in the garbage.  This one beats them all, hands down!Now, if we could just get EA to produce a Kindle "Texas Hold-Em" game of equal quality.....
Its solitaire. Several different versions.You know, the games you play at work when you are bored. :)You will have a lot more than 99 cents worth of mindless fun out of it.
I purchased this game towards the end of 2010 when there was a half off sale on EA Kindle games and this is fantastic.  I love playing regular Solitaire but this version allows you more options than just the standard game.  With 12 different modes of playing solitaire, this game can keep your attention for a long time.  Navigating this game on the Kindle 3 is great, click and move with the 5-way controller is all that is required for lining up cards.  This is one of my favorite Kindle 3 active content games.
This game is truly addictive so watch out!  I play every chance I get.  It is easy to use and fun.
If you like solitaire don't hesitate to purchase. A few like Pyramid require the use of the arrow keys but most use the qwerty keyboard. They are all single deck versions, hence no Spider but there is Spiderette which can play with one, two, or all four suits. Yukon, a past favorite of mine is included. Also, there is Wasp, an easier version of Scorpion. Wasp allows any face up card to move to an empty column [Scorpion only allows Kings to move to an empty column. Of course, you may play it like Scorpion by ignoring the rule that turns it into Wasp.]. The only thing missing is a re-deal of the same shuffle which is helpful in solving every layout of Freecell. Pyramid allows you to go through the stock multiple times until you win, or play comes to a standstill. The original rules of Pyramid only allow the player to go through the stock cards once.
Wow, I never realized just how many solitaire games there were. Lots of variations: Yukon, Pyramid, Canfield, Baker's Dozen, Peaks, and lots more. I wouldn't want to play some of these games with real cards (lots of cards that can be shifted from column to column), but on the Kindle it's great. Played it for hours on end, and helps develop strategy skills. Some games you can always be won, but finding out how is the challenge. Played this for many hours and still not bored with it.
For a black and white screen, EA Solitaire makes the red cards easy to distinguish.  Every game has a tutorial and a hint button that's easy to use.  There are games on here that I have never played before and now they are my favorites.  I have since tried another brand's solitaire game pack and was disappointed.  This game is excellent.
with some of my favorite choices for solitaire available on this game, I find myself playing a few hands every evening.
The EA Solitaire game is easy and enjoyable; and when I am in &#34;waiting&#34; mode somewhere,it is a good time-filler.
Thoroughly enjoyable. Within minutes, you are intuitively flipping cards around like the Solitaire so many of us grew to love on computers, cell phones, and, yes, REAL cards! Only things I can add to the other fine reviews here is that this worked (and looked) terrific on my Kindle DXG (9.7"). One quickly gets over the lack of "visuals" as far as black and red cards (shades of grey instead, of course). The software is gentle but firm if you accidentally try to play a "black" card on a "red" card. Love the feature to back-up a couple of plays now and then. Well Done, EA and Amazon!
All Favorites and fun to play !!!  These games are nice to have when you are in a car and not reading a book.
All the games work well, definitely a bargain.  Great for nerve racking waiting in places to loud to be able to read in or just for some good old fashioned fun.  Graphics are plenty clear and I'm an old broad with reading glasses.  If you enjoy solitaire, you'll love this.
This is just not one form of solitaire but all of your favorite types if you know how to play them. There is a tutorial for beginners which you can consult in case you don't know how to play. Once you get the hand of &#34;Canfield&#34; it might just be your favorite. If your Kindle is black and white you'll have to get the hang of recognizing spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts as black or white, but soon that becomes second nature when the game won't let you move spades on clubs. Buy it now from Amazon.com!
I was looking for a solitaire version for my Kindle and wanted to be sure I got something that was easy to use and worked well. This fit the bill. I was able to purchase it when it was a bit less expensive than it is now, but would definitely recommend it, even at its higher price. Easy to see cards, nice variety of games and works very well.
I've been playing Solitaire in one form or another since I was about 8 yrs. old. This book is fun with instructions that I can use for the games I never learned.  So far, Klondike and Pyramid are my favorites, as they have always been.  Good buy for anyone who loves Solitaire.
Great game, easy to use, looks beautiful on the Kindle.  Can play as a single player against "Al" (though I sometimes wonder how "Al" comes up with his words!).  Appropriately challenging.  You will not be bored.  Also, lots of options:  you can get hints, pass turns, etc.  It's fun.Grab it while it's half price!  Enjoy!Update 1/6/11:  Oops.... It's not half price anymore.  It's still worth $4.99.  Enjoy and Happy New Year!
This is such an amazing game.i love it and it s a gret way to learn new words. get it now. you will not regret it.
Old favorite where you can play against the computer or friends anywhere you go without the inconvenience of a board and letter tiles.  Challenging no matter how you play it, builds word knowledge and strategy skills.
I truly love scrabble. I play at least two games a day and usually more.Scrabble is the most fun game ever! This product has several options which keeps things interestin.
Love Scrabble. Play it all the time with my friends and family. Have fun being able to take it with me without worrying about losing pieces.
I play against the computer itself and it's pretty amazing! I intentionally bought this game for bus trips that I take and will certainly enjoy it for a long time. You have the option to resume a game in play or start a new one and you can shuffle your rack to possibly see new words or trade in some of your letters for new ones. Also the best button ever is the &#34;best word&#34; when you just can't think or see anything in your rack and the game is soon to end or the computer is ahead of you, just love that button!!  If you have large fingers you may need a stylus to play, but that's not big deal except you may have to tap the stylus a time or two to make things move. Good game to get.
this is so much fun... the challenge is great. the helpful hints are awesome.... love this game (and i was not a big fan before)
I absolutely love this game. I use it often when I need to relax. It keeps the brain sharp and I learn a lot of new words.
Scrabble is a favorite board game of mine and this electronic one carries on the tradition of an excellent word game.
Works great with my kindle 4thgen. I have been playing it non stop since it downloaded. I love scrabble and though I have yet to win against this AI I am glad I purchased it.
I have a Kindle Touch 3G.  I read the reviews previous to purchasing this and frankly, I was hesitant.  I'm not sure if it has been improved since the last reviews were written, but I have had absolutely no problems with this game.  It has not locked up on me.  I think it  is very well done.  I have Scrabble on my computer and play it all the time.  This is great on my Kindle because now I can play it anywhere.
When I'm not reading on my Kindle, I'm playing games.  Scrabble is a real "thinker".  I like that kind of game, it keeps my mind sharp and provides hours of entertainment.
My very favorite game of all times.
I LOVE playing Scrabble.  It is my favorite word game.  This one works pretty well with my Kindle although the letters are small
I love it, I play this one the most of all of the games I have so far!  It is Scrabble just as it is on the real thing!
Fun game and is very addictive, hard to put it down. If you like Scrabble, get this game you will enjoy it.
I wondered how it would display and work on my little Kindle Touch screen, but it works just fine, and it has improved my &#34;real life&#34; games, too. I do not use my finger, however, on the small squares, but tap them instead. My one complaint concerns the rare, odd word used in the game, which I have never heard of before. I do like the ready access to the two-letter words list though, and I have copied that as an aid in my live games.
I love words and making them work somewhere.  Scrabble allows me to team with my daughter and she is super good.
Scrabble is good for the brain.  It really makes me think to try to come up with long words, new words, etc. for the acrostic to earn the maximum number of points.  It's a very good way to kill some time at the doctor's office, drive-thru at the bank, etc. if I've thought ahead and have the Kindle with me.
It is addicting. I can even beat the computer once in awhile, yeah. I would definatly recomend it to anyone.
Between this game and the eBooks, I might as well glue my Kindle to my hand -- I haven`t put it down for days.
I got this game because I have it at home, and I love it. But  can't carry with me so I decided to get it on kindle. I got it on sale and so far love it. Definitely a worthwhile game.
We have always loved Scrabble and this is a fun, educational game; having said that, I would sure like to know what dictionary it uses as a reference. Some of the words and spellings it comes up with, while not recognizing others is amazing!
This game gives a realistic game experience.  You see the actual board on your screen and your tiles in front of you.  I was able to play quickly using the "tips" they give you by default during the game.  I have played this game on my Kindle Touch as well as my Kindle Keyboard.  On the Touch you select tiles and where to place the tile using your finger on the screen.  In order to fit the Scrabble board on the Kindle screen, each square is rather small.  And I found it difficult to make choices of the correct tile and correct destination on the board using my finger.  I am an older person, and my hand is not perfectly steady.  I had to cancel my move and reposition with my finger many times for each turn.  It would probably be ok, though, for a child's little finger and steady hand.  On the Keyboard the game works pretty well, since you just use the arrow keys to select the tile and destination.  A few commands can be done using keyboard-shortcuts.  The game itself is fun to play.  The computer moves are quick.  And you have the option of playing with the computer, or with other people by passing the Kindle back and forth.  The game with the computer can be played at 3 different difficulty levels.  The game with other people can be played with up to 4 people.  You have several different types of games you can play (classic, 75 points, 150 points, 8 rounds, 12 rounds, etc.).  You can also play a solo game by yourself.
it is everything you think it is. I like that there are various ways to play. 1 player, 2 player, against the computer. Fast game, slow game ect. Great for car trips,
I'll start this off with I really don't like playing Scrabble in the real life board game - I get impatient waiting for folks to hurry up and make a decision, they block me at every turn, etc.Now that I have that off of my chest, I highly recommend this electronic version of the game, as it is fun, super-addictive, and in a week's worth of ownership I've more than recouped my investment in entertainment value.  I think one of the more helpful features is there is a button to allow the computer to help you which, after all, is only fair because the computer is using the official Scrabble word guide.The multi-player mode is not too bad - you make your selection / take your turn, then when your turn is complete the Kindle will blank out th eplayer's tiles as you hand the Kindle to your opponent, then they will push a button to reveal their tiles: your opponent can't see your letter tiles unless you let them.As I said, i think it is super-addictive so let that serve as a warning.Have fun!
This game has me absolutely addicted.  &#34;Al&#34;, the computer opponent sure getsunder my skin and makes me frustrated, but it keeps me determined.
Scrabble for Kindle is really great. It has the simplicity of use and the beautiful graphics that distinguish free Kindle-based games(Shuffled RowandEvery Word, but at the same it has the kind of complexity that justifies its price.You can enjoy this game in a variety of ways. First, you can play against the computer and choose different levels of complexity. The computer takes fairly little time to ponder its move, so you never get bored. You can also play solo, which allows you to practice and perfect your Scrabble skills. Then, you can also play against other players, which will allow you to share this fun game with your family and friends. You can play a quick game, or if you have more time to dedicate to a full-scale game, you can choose that option. The Kindle version of Scrabble is a perfect way to distract oneself while waiting for an airplane connection or a dentist's appointment. Since various people can play against each other, it can save a whole group of people from experiencing the boredom of a long wait.The game is very well-thought out and was obviously designed with great care so as to make people feel that they are getting something of substance for their money. There is a list of two-letter words that this game accepts and that you can consult at any moment. These words are a customary bone of contention between experienced Scrabble players, so it's nice to see this whole issue resolved here. There are hints you can use. The game allows you to choose your moment when you want it to help you find the best word possible at this particular time in the match. There is also a function that permits you to revise all the moves that you and your opponent(s) have made so far. The game keeps track of your stats, which will let you participate in full-blown Scrabble championships with your friends.Overall, the game is great fun and is definitely worth the 5 bucks I paid for it.
I love playing Scrabble  -  always have and always will.  I't fun to play with the computer and I'm looking forward to playing with a partner on an upcomming trip !!
Great game to play on long trips or when waiting for an appointment.  Easy to use for just about any age.  It was delivered to my Kindle in seconds.  Good seller.  Would certainly deal with this seller again.
Love word games so much, especially scrabble. But I just can't seen to get one up on the other player. Can you please make it easier for me to win? It is depressing.
I love playing solo Scrabble - no one gets hurt feelings about losing, not even me!  I held off getting this because I bought my Kindle for reading, not gaming.  However, it went on sale, so I just couldn't resist any longer.  I play games on Pogo.com, which is owned and operated by EA, so I know the company's usual controls/cheats implementation.  This game did not disappoint.  Game controls and cheats are very well implemented.The controls are as good as you can get with the Kindle OS and available buttons.  There is a cheat called "Best Word", where the AI will search the dictionary for the highest scoring word the letters you have will make.  I have a wider vocabulary than many people, but I'm no genius.  I learned new words using that cheat.  EA has assured that the game will be enjoyable to most people who are not competitive Scrabble players.  Maybe a fun way to help build your, or your child's, vocabulary.There is also a "Pass 'n' Play" mode so two can play, as well as some control over difficulty when playing against the AI.  Very nicely done, and I am enjoying this game immensely.
As a teenager and as an adult I have always enjoyed playing scrabble. Although I must say I have never been really good at  coming up with bigger words to score more points. Plays just like the board game. I still find it to be a challenge, but then isn't that the whole point of the game. To challenge you.
You can play against an opponent or against the computer. There is also a variety of difficulty levels. Very user friendly. You can shuffle your letters, get best words, two letter words, ect.
This game was everything I was looking for in a Sudoku game. It is a little odd at first using the letters as numbers, but that is the best option with the limitations of the Kindle. The game is a lot of fun, and I've enjoyed the few hours I've put into it.
It looks like EA has done it again, with another great game for the Kindle.  I have been playing Sudoku puzzles since they were known as "Number Place" in Dell Crossword Magazines back in the Seventies.  I consider myself an expert at them, and I find the tougher level puzzles on this Kindle version to be challenging.Due to another review claiming that all levels of puzzles were easy, I started out with an "Insane" level puzzle, and I was not disappointed.  I finally solved it, but it was indeed challenging.  If you like Sudoku puzzles, you will love this Kindle version.Don't worry about having to bring up your "symbols" chart on your Kindle, as that won't be necessary.  You place a number by using your 5-way controller to reach the square you want, then pressing a keypad letter corresponding to that number (Q,W,E,R,T,Y,U,I,O = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).  There is a legend showing this at the bottom of the screen, and it can be turned off if you don't need it.There are a few nice features included too.  You can make notes in each square so that you can keep track of which numbers you believe could possibly go into each square.  If you find a game too tough, you can also use the "AutoFill" option, which fills in all the possible numbers for each square just as if you had made the notes yourself.There is also a "Hint" option, in case you get stuck and need a little help, although unless you are a novice, you probably won't need this unless you are trapped in a very tough puzzle.The one option I really like is the ability to input puzzles from newspapers, magazines, etc.  Although this game has thousands of puzzles, it's nice knowing that I can get out some of my magazines and put some of my tougher puzzles in the game to solve.  All the normal features are available when solving a puzzle that you put in the game yourself.  You can even have the game instantly solve your puzzle for you if you so desire.Other features include "Error Checking" and "Undo".Sudoku puzzles are not what I would normally call 5-star puzzles.  But I am giving this game 5-Stars because as a Sudoku game, it is as good or better than any other I have seen, and it is perfect for the Kindle.  If you are a fan of Sudoku, and enjoy a break from reading or from the other games, then this will not disappoint you.
Apparently there was a problem with version 1.0 when this game was initially released.....then quickly pulled from sale for about a day or so. Version 1.1 is superb!Easy navigation around the Sudoku board....clear, concise instructions...."Notes" feature is easy to use and, of course, integral to Sudoku....display is clear, pleasant and just plain fun to use...."Statistics" are well thought-out and great for tracking one's progress at solving puzzles....levels of difficulty feel appropriate, in my humble opinion. Overall....one well-done, well-thought-out game that is a joy to play on the Kindle. It seems to be a perfect match for the Kindle.
I love this game but i like the &#34;Every Word Crossings&#34; even more.  Im not sure why but thats my opinion. Before I knew about the crossings edition this was my go to for waiting on a dr to come in to an appt.
Seriously, I am not a word game type of person.  Yes, I like to read (mostly post-apocalyptic fiction and good thrillers), and if I have free time after that, then a television show is good to wind down from a long and stressful day, assuming of course I am not playing a console or PC game. I downloaded this because of the price thinking I would never use it, and then one day for no apparent reason (sometimes it just takes too much mental energy to read or watch TV) I clicked on this game on my kindle.  I started with the relaxed games (it is not timed and you can take as much time as you need to get words, and you can move to the next level if you get the largest word even if there are words you could not find).  I don't know why - but I am addicted now.  Every chance I get I work on these word puzzles.  I really think it is great for your brain.  I noticed that I am much better now after playing these word games for about a month.  WARNING - don't try this is you don't have time to play the puzzles - it is totally addicting!
I love this game is so fun you gotta download it you'll love it too, don't miss out on this game
This game is great for your memory, hope it keeps old "Alzeheimers" away...great fun trying to figure out all the words...Love it....even have my son hooked on it....went on a cruise recently and people at our table were raving about the game also...only once was I stumped....gotta go, Everyword waiting for me to find that next word....
Words galore! Holds the attention, words too advanced for most kids, great vocabulary builder.  Free game, so worth the money.
This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to try it; it sure is great!
When not absorbed in a book, I seriously enjoy this game. Not only does it challenge my reflexes with the timed portion, but I feel it keeps my mind sharp. Sadly, my first kindle died when I had a top timed score over 20,000, but it's more incintive to do better. Although some of the words are a little questionable, and some real words they refuse to use, i.e. Rape, Groin, it's also weird by using some well-known foreign words (Peso, Mesa), but not others. It also uses a few abbreviations and some obscure words, but after you get used to it, it's absolutely no big deal. Think SKA, EMS, PRO, HOS, BROS, BRO, SIS, etc.Once you get those tiny or strange words memorized, you're off to the races. I find it to be great for taking along to business meetings, when I arrive early or staff is late, doctor's appointments, etc. It beats doctors' offices filthy magazines (bacteria, not smut...lol) A recently published article stated reading those is like licking a doorknob. Maybe not that bad, but the dirtiest thing they've found. Ergot, I whip out my clean little kindle and read or play this or other word games. String Words is another favorite. I believe it would also be great for grammar school-age kids, because it makes the brain find words (a lot) with a fixed amount of letters. I like finding the I.N. and G. It usually leads you to the one or more longest word, which you need in order to advance to the next level.It's free, enjoy and have fun!
I love this game. First, they give you a bunch of letters that make the longest word if you use all of them (sometimes there's more than one solution), and then you're supposed to figure out all the other words you can make out of that word. Yes, you can get past the level without getting all the longest words if there's more than one, it just doesn't give you as many points. You cannot (in version 1.4, or mine anyways) click on the letter and have it be selected? I don't know if that's a glitch or just in my Kindle(I'm reviewing from a 3gen kindle. I have no clue how the 4gen works). But anyway, that is completely minor and hardly noticeable.I absolutely love this game. Another one almost exactly like it is Every Word Crossings. The only difference is that Every Word Crossings makes it much easier to figure out the words, because it's like Every Word in crossword style.Both of these products recieve a 10 out of 10. I'll be excited when Amazon decides to realease more free games!
i just love this game. i play it a lot. i would ignore the one star people. i got this game shortly after i got my kindle touch. it works great and is very fun.BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!
This is a fun little time waster of a game, proving a bit of distraction when not reading a book. Nothing amazing, but it's great for the price.
a fun time killing game that bothers you if you cant figure out the word.  If you really enjoy this game try every word crossings its about as addictive.
I've played this game a lot since its release and I consistently go to it over playing Shuffled Row (also free).Shuffled RowWhat I really like:The untimed game is a relaxing way to play and good for a break in the day or between reads. Better than the "beat the clock" feel of Shuffled Row. If you want the added time pressure, you can played a timed game, too.Every Word doesn't seem to use noticeably more battery life than reading a Kindle book.If you're thinking about buying the new Kindle Scrabble game,SCRABBLEdownload Every Word for a free, fun way to practice unscrambling letters into words.I love that I can press the page forward button to shuffle the letters for more ideas.Downside: I really can't think of any...except there are only 10 levels of play, so I have to replay at level one over and over, instead of going to more challenging levels.It's FREE!!Definitely download this game soon before it changes to a paid Kindle App.
This game is addicting. I wish it would use real words that people KNOW as words tho. I don't remember what dictionary they used but not even &#34;cheating&#34; on a computer unscramble/scrabble website can come up with the words they used sometimes. I just start throwing in letters and hope. lol
I play this regularly.I have fun trying to figure out the missing words. Can be frustrated that certain words aren't used.
On the recommendation of a friend, I got this game.  It is challenging and I am a compulsive player of word games.  I wish there were more like it.
I love playing these types of games.  It helps my mind from losing what I do have up there.  It is challenging and what I wanted.  Thank You again, Amazon.
This game is fun to play.  I have been having trouble getting things done because I am always playing.  With my Kindle I can take it anywhere.
lots of fun, good play. Hours of enjoyment. I have never run out of play time. I have had this for 2 years and still play often.
You don't have to be an ace at spelling with this game.  Scrambled letters you get and then you figure out what words can be made. First played this game with grandson on his Kindle.  We were hooked. Every time he came over to visit he'd bring his Kindle with him cause we had so much fun playing this word game. I just had to get this game. Will look for future editions, of which I will definately purchase.
This is my favorite game, I play it everyday. I love the crossword version as well. The best game ever.
I think that this game is great. it keeps you into it trying to figure out what the longest word is. Don't like it for some reason? Just get rid of it. It's free, so you won't be wasting money when you delete it.written by Andrew Donofrio
Fun game for my Regular Kindle.  Probably would be even better if I had a Kindle Fire, but still very good on my regular Kindle.
I have this game on my kindle touch.  It starts with easy words and progresses to those requiring more thought.  Good for all ages.
I love every word.  I play this almost daily.  It keeps my mind sharp, and challenges me with every game.  Love this!!
well at least shes using her brain now i guess. i hate to even think of how much i have spent on this crap.
I enjoy playing this game very much, though sometimes they use words that are not even in the dictionary.  This is not fair.  Why should the designer of the game design it for the player to fail?
I downloaded this before Amazon pulled it. After a good month or so, I realized I'm officially addicted.Now, this isn't the most amazing or delicious game ever invented - far from it.  But, it does give me another reason to make my Kindle my go-to device for reading and so much more.The game is easy to manage and navigate and I really like the fact that I can  choose a "relaxed" game that is not timed.The game works through levels.  At each level you have a set of scrambled letters that you use to make words.  Find the word that uses all of the letters and you can move up to the next level.If you can do the "Jumble" in the newspaper, this game should be a cinch.
Amazon produces very good word games for Kindle, and this one is no exception. The idea is simple - you are given a set of letters from which you need to create as much different words as you can. The longest word unlocks next level.What I like:1. Good gamplay (played on Kindle Touch) and nice graphic.2. Two modes - timed and relaxed.3. Good puzzles - not easy, but not very hard.4. There is tutorial to understand game better.5. Resume game option - you can continue solving previously viewed puzzle after you launch app again.6. Scores and statistics - very useful!What I would like to see new:1. It's interesting to have locked next puzzle until you find the longest word, but I'd prefer to have a possibility to solve any puzzle from the set.2. No hints - they would be very useful for such puzzles.Note: you can play app on Kindle, Kindle Touch, Kindle Keyboard, Kindle DX and Kindle (2nd Generation) devices.In overall - very good app for any word puzzles lover, end especially when it's free!
I love all the games I have gotten for my Kindle but this one has a true love-hate relationship for me. The game is really fun and a challenge to my 'old' brain but the "hate" part comes in the part of the game that makes me feel really dumb. Somehow I get the 'key' words easily but some of the really easy small ones seem to stay just out of reach of my recall. It does help that all the answers are in alphabetical order but even that sometimes won't unlock the one little word that escapes me. I do get the feeling that sometimes a word the game doesn't accept is later the word that fills a blank. All and all I would recommend it to friends.
I enjoy this game and have fun doing word unscrambling ..it helps relaxes me after a hard day at work....so enjoy it
People who love word games will love this version. The instructions are clear. It is easy to use. It is not overly simple as many games are. It shows immediate results without needing to wait for tomorrow's newspaper.
We purchased the Kindle before our Alaska cruise for the books.  But we soon found out about the games!  A few have been disappointing but the Every Word has been excellent!  We are so addicted, I think we play every day.  Some levels we work by ourself but many we work together.  The only thing we've found that has been unpleasant is that some words are "on the board" aren't ones we use so we don't get them. [sorry I can't think of an example].  Also, some words that we do use or know are "not on the board"... but they SHOULD be!  LOL  But that's okay, we keep playing and playing and playing!  Too much fun for us two 60+ year olds!!!!  now I'm using my iPad 2 and have sold my Kindle 3g... but this game isn't available for the iPad 2 ....  which is really sad... but I'll live without it, I suppose...
Love this style game.  Make words from one longer one. Keeps your brain engaged and mind working. Will buy more!
Even though it's redundant when I have played it as often as I have ... I don't stop playing it.  I prefer this style of word game to the game where you tie the letters together (Thread Words).  I haven't tired of it yet and I play it A LOT.
This is a great game! The whole family loves to play this game!! A very fun way to pass the time!!
This game is strangely addictive.  It is not necessarily fun, but I have not been able to put it down once I start playing.  It is partly triva and partly word assembly.  Very good for exercising your brain.
I,really loved this!  it kept me very busy during  the evening.  I would like to have this put back on my Kindle, instead of&#34;Shuffled Row&#34;  You can delete Shuffled Row, and put back &#34;Every Word&#34;Thank You!!
Every Word was a freebie for my Kindle.  If you like unscrambling games, this one's for you.  If you can unscramble the word using every letter - the longest word - then you can move ahead to the next level.  If not, you just keep coming up with words within the scrambled word.  Some of the levels are very easy and words are easily spotted.  Other levels are very difficult and I've yet to unscramble the longest word.  Like I said, very good brain work-out.
This game was probably originally developed by a foreign developer because of some of the foreign word answers, yet many English/American common words are missing. Still it is a great game and fun to play alone or with my husband.
Entertaining when I have to wait in line or have time to waste.  It keeps my mind engaged and my kids like it also if I need to occupy their time!
I like to have several puzzles on hand for waiting rooms, etc. It's a good way to pass time and use your brain, too.
This is a game for when you are bored. It is just a game, nothing educational about it or anything.
This is the first free Kindle game that I downloaded, and I played it so much that it became frustrating how frequently I had to recharge my Kindle!  It is very entertaining and easy to do while you are watching TV or have your mind on other things.
This is an excellent little game. I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be a great game for when I needed a break from reading, though I've found it very addictive!
Do get this as it is great fun. Entertaining for Hours at a time. A great way to waste your day and get back in bed when the sun goes down.
This is lots of fun! Really challenges the mind. Plus, it's free! Some of the words don't check out in the Webster's dictionary but whatever it's free!!
I don't normally do so well on word scrambles (especially the paper versions) but am doing better than average on Every Word.  One thing that really helps is your answers are alphabetized. So you can play with that to figure out the unfilled in words. Liked that once you got the biggest word, you can choose to carry on to find all the rest of the words, or skip instead to the next level (there are 10).  Hope Amazon adds more of these addictive little games soon. Great fun!
I love Every Word because it is fun to play and makes me think.  Good for my grandchildren too, we play it a lot together.
As a lover of word games, I have found this one to be addicting. It's another that I share with students.
Really like this game constantly makes me use my brain; even when I think it's in a resting stage.  Use it at least once a day.
I'll take it it is fun and free what eles do you want. Good word game to play to pass the time quicker.  I recomend and worse case scenerio you do not care for it delete it.
I used to do this with words when I was little to see how many other words I could make from it.
This is my very favorite game.  I try to find all the words at each level and it is very challenging to get to 10 and finish.  I love it!!!
I really enjoy playing this game on my Kindle.  It's easy to play on my basic Kindle and it never gets old.  I also like to think it keeps my brain in shape.
Every Word is a fun, challenging way to pass time between tasks or whenpropping your feet up at the end of the day.It also keeps the brain exercising.
This is really a good game.  You learn new words and you can challenge yourself over and over again. Its great.
Just when I start thinking that Kindle cannot possibly get any better and afford me any more enjoyment than it already does, something happens to make me even happier that I bought it. Now that Amazon has introduced these two free games (which, for now, work only on Kindle 2 and Kindle DX) you can take breaks from reading and entertaing yourself with these great games.The graphics look pretty sophisticated on both games. This tells me that Kindle's amazing capacities still have a lot of unexplored riches to be discovered. The game works very fast, doesn't require wireless, and is lots of fun.I hope the owners of Kindle 1 soon get access to these games as well. It would be wrong for Amazon to abandon the early adopters of the device.
This game is fun.  As far as all of these games sometimes I try the same word several times before it goes intothe spot.  All of these games I have reviewed have stuck on words that I have put in more than one time and so when ichoose to end the game and see the word...mostly just one word it is usually a word I have already tried.  This is the only problem of all of these games.
In my opinion this game is both fun and educational .It is also very good in the matters of prices.EVERY WORD is the game for YOU!!!
This is a fun game that you can play for minutes or hours.  It's challenging, but doable.  Varied game play lets you enjoy it at easier or harder levels (I'll explain that in a minute).  The interface is well-designed and the game play is thoroughly enjoyable.The game has a timed and relaxed mode.  In both, you must find the longest word to move to the next level.  In the relaxed mode, you can take your time finding the longest word; in the timed game you have three minutes.  Every other word you find increases your score.For maximum challenge, you can play the relaxed mode and try to find every word on the board.  For a quick game, you can play the timed mode and see how far you can go and how high you can score.I have a few things I think could have been better.  First, there should be separate high scores for the timed game and the relaxed game.  I've played the relaxed game and found every word on every level.  I can't compete with that on the timed mode, so I'll never beat that high score.  I keep track of my timed mode high scores on my own.  Also, the score depends on the boards you get--how many words, how many longer ones.  So it's a little hard to compare.Also, the word list is little odd.  Some common words--not vulgarities--aren't on the list, and some very rare ones are.  Also, there are some words that don't seem to fit the rules.  And I don't know why misspellings such as "nite" are allowed.  But as you play, you will learn these quirks and you will remember some of what is included versus excluded, enabling you to improve your game.  This will increase your vocabulary if you choose.  I've made a point of looking up every unfamiliar word.Finally, it's disappointing that deciding you cannot get the longest word ends the game, not just the level.  Maybe there should be a scoring penalty, but you should be able to continue.All in all, this is a game you can play over and over without growing tired of it.  Isn't that the definition of a great game?
I spend more time with this game than any other .  Sometimes my husband takes the Kindle away from me to see if he can find words.  He likes to start the levels.  When it becomes a challenge, he hands it back to me.  When is Part 2 going to become available?  Love this game.  Be careful.  If you like word games that have to be unscrambled,  this is an addictive game.
The concept is simple:  They give you several letters jumbled up, you make as many words as you can with those letters. Find the longest word, and automatically move to the next round. (I don't know about you, but for me it's generally easier to find the longest word than all those little 3 or 4 letter ones!)Is this the makings of a a great intellectual challenge?  Probably not...but it's damned entertaining, and sometimes a welcome respite when you've been reading for a while and just need a break.Personal recommendation?  Start with the "relaxed game" and learn the ins and outs of the game.  Who knew "ani" was a word?Then, move on to "start a timed game", when the game gives you an allotted amount of time to find as many words as you can.  Again, if you find their longest word, you continue to the next round.I'm NOT a big word-search fan.  Frankly, not a big fan of games overall, but this one is a welcome addition to my Kindle.
"Every Word" is challenging enough to keep you thinking for as long as you feel like playing.  Words range from three letters to five or more, depending upon your level of play.  Good for a wide range of ages and grade level. A lot of satisfaction when you are able to find "Every Word." and go to the next level.  Try it; you'll like it.
I like playing thie game. it sure does make you think. I play it everyday. I enjoy playing this game a lot
I love this game and it is very addicting.  I get playing and can't put it down.  Certainly a challenge and every puzzle is different.
I've been playing this game online for years and I still stink at it. Now I can feel stupid anywhere with the Kindle version. You gotta love that. Free is a great price for a fun game. Nothing new - this game has been around forever but with my age quickly approaching the old status it's good for the brain to stay active and games like this help. I highly recommend it.
This is my favorite game on my old black and white Kindle. It makes me feel like I'm giving my brain at least a little bit of a work out!
I have played this game more than any other I have. It is so fun and a challenge to my knowledge of words.
I do so enjoy this one very much.  Again I have to focus and think long and hard at some of the words to put in the grid.  I hope there will be more every word puzzles and I do recommend this one highly.
I must say I really enjoyed playing this game a lot. It was a little easier to play than playing scrabble, but still quit challenging. I like how it gets more difficult with each level you advance. I was hooked and didn't want to put it down. I got as far as level 7, by then it was getting late and I had to get to bed because I had to work the next day.  I couldn't wait to get home to pick up where I left off. I finally reached the final level, level 10 but not without some work. Very fun, challenging game
It makes you think fast and test your spelling. I like it just because it's easy and fun. So far my best word was 88 point.
this kind of game wil get you to become a spelling master and for people that are spelling masters you could  get even better.this game will get your vocabulary flowing to all kinds of places and is a really fun brain teaser for all kinds of ages.i would give this game all ten fingers and heres a few tips:pro tips: try to beat your high score find ways to add other words to the word that your making get a score sheet and write down your scores and try beat your best word score and high score and you will be victoriousbeginner tips:start out with small wordsthen work your way upthen once your up to the top your all ready to challenge the worlds best spellers in a spelling bee and you might get what you wanted.con tips:if you get a right word spelled wrong then maybe you were trying to spell the word to fastand thats all i have to say about this awesome game except that probably youve already done the stuff that i wrote on here.  see you later.:-&#62;
Alot of fun and forces you to think quickly.  Its a little frustrating when you don't get enough letters for the word your thinking of.  But its all in fun.
This is a great word finder game that times you while the letters increase or decrease as you go along. Points are scored kind of like scrabble.
I find this gamevery challenging.  It keeps you thinking.  It is a good spelling device and would be great for children learning to spell.
This is a fast paced, quick word game that I enjoy playing on my Kindle.  Best played when you won't experience any interruptions.
I like this game as well. I love word game an this was very different. Enjoyed it a lot. I play it all the time.
I think that this game is a great game for the Kindle. It makes you think quick and helps you to learn new words. It's also free and you don't need the wireless to play it.
My husband and I enjoy playing this together. When we have a little time to kill, we bring this out and work on the timed puzzle together. Even thought it is for one person, we get a kick out of beating each other by coming up with a higher scoring word. Sure beats sitting in front of the TV!
This is a really fast paced game. You need to think quickly before letters fall off at the end. Not a game I play for leisure, but definately one for those times I wont be interupted.
Love a great game of words that seems to challenge you every time? Good, because you will spend alot of time trying to beat your best score. Great word game.
My original review of this game, shown below, pointed out an end-of-game scoring flaw which caused me to give it 4-stars.  The flaw has now been corrected, and I have raised my rating for Shuffled Row to 5-STARS.It's nice to know that Amazon listened to the customers who pointed out a problem with this game.  Not only that, the designers have now adjusted the values for the letters, and those values seem to be more reflective of the frequency of their usage in the English language.  My first game after downloading the update was 503, which beat my old high score of 421.  And the game doesn't seem to be issuing consecutive identical letters like it used to.  I just hated seeing two "U"s in a row pop up!  Now I don't think that will be a problem, although time will tell.These three improvements have greatly increased the enjoyability of Shuffled Row, and anyone who is a word-game fan should by all means get this game.  After all, you can't beat the price.  It's free!(ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW)Shuffled Row, in my opinion, is the best game made for the Kindle to date.  However, I have found a programming flaw in the game.  Let's imagine that your score is 280 with three one-point letters left.  You spell a 3-letter word and are supposed to score three points, plus a 10-point bonus for emptying the rack at the end of the game, which would give you a total of 293.  But that is not what happens.  The game will give you your 10 bonus points, PLUS 10 points for your word, even though it isn't worth that much (for a total of 300).  This will happen with ANY word worth less than 10 points which clears the rack at the end of the game.  I also seem to recall it even giving me 10 points for a word that cleared the rack at the end of the game, even though the word was worth MORE than 10 points.  This was in addition to the rack-clearing bonus of 10.  Hopefully Amazon will correct this error and supply a fix through Whispernet or Wi-Fi.By the way, my high word-score is 100 (Quakers), and my high game is 421.....although this high occurred before I noticed the bug, so it should probably have been a few points less.A Great game, and even with the bug it's still worth downloading!
Love this brain teaser game.
I have tried many kindle word games such as Every Word, Every Word: Crossings, Thread words, etc. But Shuffled Rows is yet another kindle word game that is different but does not go out of the word game genre.Shuffled row has been the latest game I've purchased. Kindle word games are fun, but it's Shuffled Row that seems to never get old.I have literally played this game for an hour or so. But whatsoever I don't think Shuffled row is a game you'd want to stay on if your score never leaves. Just by chance, you might get a really high score. I tried to beat my high score, but 202 points is pretty hard to beat!I do happen to know there is a button that can erase your top score, but I guess this game is fun anyway. But day by day you may just want to beat your score, and where is the proof you've gotten here or there? It has no book of features that you have recently done, whatsoever. Though I am not suprised and am happy about thid great game.There was lots of advantages in this game that were better than Every Word. What I mean is like comparing Windows 7 with Windows 8. I think Every Word was slow, relaxing, laid-back and therefore sometimes boring. Shuffled Rows is a more fast-paced energetic game.And the great thing about shuffled rows is that there are no Level this and level that. It's all one fun game that is very fast. I'm not saying slow-paced games are not as fun as fast-paced games, that's obviously my opinion. But I do think this is funner than Every Word.This free game is one of the most addicting games. I truly reccomend it. And I think since it is free, It is worth downloading. I don't think that this game should be four stars, It deserves five.Games like this deserve to be  in the game Hall of Fame or so. I loved this one.Gina Bertaina, Age Ten
This free amazon game for kindle owners is fun and excellent training for coordination, speed of reactions, and comprehension. Sixty letters are placed in a rack, nine appear on the screen. When any of the nine are gone, other letters of the sixty soon take their place. The goal of the game is to look at the letters and select letters that make up word and to get a high score doing so. Some letters and longer words have higher scores. If there are nine letters in the rack and you don't use two or more of them to make a word, the letter on the left will be lost and a new letter will take its place. The game is set up to be helpful and fun. There are instructions that are very clear. They should be read before playing.
This is a newer game for us, but Shuffled Row has proven to be a lot of fun.  Although sometimes the letters seem to come a little slow, that's good if you want to make words with as many letters as possible, but then when all the letters are showing the first letter starts to end too soon!!!  Ya GOTTA BE QUICK!  But I really like it and keep hoping to beat the high game score!!!  I recommend it!!!
Loved it, couldn't stop playing it.  It's uncomplicated, quick and makes your brain work.  You can play it any time.
Wow, this is the best game.  I really enjoy it and anyone can play with alot of instructions.  Sometimes it is hard to construct a word before the first letter drops off but still alot of fun.  I highly recommend it.
Words fascinate me and the spelling is a nice check for the brain.  There are ins and outs of this puzzle which, when learned, make it more interesting.  I have worked it to the end countless times and like that shortness.
very entertaining and different, a kind of scrabble solitaire.  it's truly different and challenging, loved it.  It calls for a lot of concentration, though
Got time to waste, can't sleep? This is a good option. Simple game with enough options to keep it interesting
This is a fun way to pass the time! My whole family loves this game! Very Fun!!! Any age can play this game!!
