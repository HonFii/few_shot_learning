First off these are blue.  They smell.  The Mickey and Minnie characters are cute, but that has never driven me to buy an infant diaper. The new Sure Fit has made the quality go down drastically.  I normally purchase Pampers, however I tired these out after Pure and Natural worked so well.  These stink...literally. If you need a cheaper name brand diaper then go with Pampers Baby Dry.
They are a good price, and in general, they work, but when they don't, they don't.  I had this same problem with Huggies with my older daughter but decided to try again with my new baby.  Same issue.  If there is more than a small amount of pee/poop, it leaks right out.
This product is extremely leaky for a newborn, probably one out of five diapers leaked and he needed new clothes, bedding, ect. Pretty much every poo went through. However, the wetness indicator is helpful for new parent who is too tired to pick baby up to see if he needs changed.
We have tried both the Huggies snugglers and the Pampers Swaddlers.  For us, I think the Huggies hold in what would be blow outs much better.  Also, everytime I take a Pampers swaddler off of my daughter, the lining is sticking to her.  That can't feel good to have something stuck to her all of the time when wet- plus it is more likely to give her diaper rash.  The Huggies are so much softer on the inside and the lining has never ever stuck to her.  Everyone is different but for us the Pampers Swaddlers just didn't work for us.
I purchased these Pampers diapers two different times from Amazon.  The first time I thought the ink had run low during manufacturing and I got a bad batch.  However, the second time I ordered I saw the same thing.  It made it hard to change diapers at night since I couldn't see the printed face when fastening the diaper.  These diapers also seem rougher than the same product purchased in retail stores and other online stores.  Not sure if Amazon cut corners on this product or if it is simply sourced from a different facility.  Do not plan to buy this from Amazon again.
We tried these when my son got into size 2 because we loved them when he was a newborn.  They kept leaking! Every morning we had to do laundry. At one point we had to put 2 diapers on him to try to keep them from leaking until the baby dry pampers arrived. In the end pampers baby dry worked better for us
We have used pampers swaddlers for our son since day 1 and have always been very happy, he has never had any leaks or rashes. Size 2 has nevertheless disappointed me: we started using them when he was 6 kilos, at 10 weeks and found they were HUGE!!! Because they are so big (even though it says it's from 5 kg)there's a gap in the bag and he poops it all leaks into his onesie and back :(. Also, they are not nearly as fluffy as the newborn and size 1 ones. We have ordered huggies and they work perfect!! We will give these size 2 another chance in a couple of weeks and hopefully they will fit better by then.
So I was hands down a pampers fan as when I raised my niece, I mostly bought pampers. Before my daughter got here, I stocked up on size Newborn, Size 1 and Size 2 swaddlers. I wish I wouldn't have.Our daughter was pretty chunky when she was born but thinned out pretty quickly. The hospital that we had her at gave us Huggies Snugglers and they worked great, but when we brought her home we used the swaddlers and they worked fine until she thinned out. The pampers swaddlers are longer than the snugglers. We had constant leak problems with the swaddlers and the smell of urine was pretty noticeable (I am pretty anal about changing her diaper, so it's definitely not from lack of changes). I will however chalk it up to the fact that she just isn't a chubby baby. She is in the 57% for height at a little over 2 months but only weighs 9 1/2 pounds.After using the full box of newborns and going through a full box of size 1, I ordered the snugglers, we no longer have the problem of leaks and pee smells. I am however hopeful that maybe she will fill out some more again and that I can use the other box of swaddlers we have in size 1 with no leaking problems.
We playfully call my 11 month old Pee-Pee Girl in the morning because her Pampers, well....smell like pee.  We love these diapers because they are soft, and thin and seem to be fairly gentle on her sensitive skin (we also use Pampers sensitive diapers). They are also the diapers we got from the hospital, and how can you not love the blue wetness indicator?? But they simply are not for overnight wear, they hold everything in and we haven't had any leaking, but her jammies have to get washed every morning after wearing them because her pee-pee diaper, makes her clothes smelly too.
I was originally using theLansinoh Ultra Soft Disposable Nursing Pads 36 eabut bought these thinking they were less expensive.  But after doing some quick math, they cost the same per unit when purchased from my local baby store.These are more scratchy and not as comfortable as the ultra-soft ones.  These are also easier to peel out of the individual packets and easier to put into your bra because of the round shape.  The ultra-soft ones have one side that sticks to the individual packaging and it's always a pain to open.  They also have straight sides with only two rounded sides...so a bit awkward to put on.  But ultimately, I'm sticking with the ultra-soft ones because they don't scratch against my nipples.
It works for over night well, but I don't know if some of the QC missed or just random rashes occur but we change our baby as soon as she wakes up.  It's also missing in stars because I recently found out about the terrible chemicals in these regular diapers.  For what it's advertising for (and not claiming to be natural or safe, I guess), it's fine and does the job.
I have used both Pampers Baby Dry and Swaddlers for my newborn. Baby Dry diapers puff up like a marshmallow when they are wet making it very easy to tell when it is time to change baby. Stage 1 seems to be a different size for the two styles with Baby Dry less roomy than the Swaddlers style. I have never had a leak with Swaddlers but with Baby Dry the liquid poop keeps shooting up the back of the diaper and onto baby's clothes.  Other than the leaks, the ruffled edges that keep contents inside the diaper often fold inside and I have to manually pull them out after changing baby. If I forget to do that the diapers aren't sealed properly and poop has a way to get outside of the diaper around the leg area as well. With Pampers Swaddlers the ruffled edges are always properly aligned.
Smell like baby powder, even when full of pee or poo, maybe a good thing for some, but I am sensitive to smells and it makes me sneeze.They hold, only have had a few leaks and usually only if it was an hour or so between changings. Definitely don't live up to up to 12 hour protection though. That is laughable...(but who really lets their kid sit in a diaper that long?)
I had used these diapers before and wasn't too impressed.  They are cheaper than the ones I usually get, so I decided to try them again.  I should have gone with my first instincts.  The "baby dry" formula leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion.  They are flimsy and not all that absorbent.  They might be good for newborns, but they can't seem to handle a toddler-sized "potty."  They also might work if you change your kid like every hour, or are using them for back-up during potty-training.  Other than that, I wouldn't recommend them.  Now I have to use up 200 of them - I don't want to give them away if I wouldn't use them myself - since I got them through subscribe and save and ordered a big box.  Lesson learned.
This is a good product but its shades in comparison to the cruisers. With respect to wetness protection & leaks, It isn't as dependable as Pampers cruisers
These diapers are ok for the price.  We've thankfully never had a poo leak, but these will leak urine if left on longer than a couple of hours.  Forget about even trying to use them overnight!  I made the mistake of putting one on my son before he went to bed and he woke up in the middle of the night screaming because he was soaked.  Luvs are cheaper and seem to hold liquid better.  I'd probably choose those over the Pampers Baby Dry, but we will use up the ones we have left since they are just fine for daytime wear, when the child will be changed more frequently.
I added them to my baby registry, but since then I tried many other brands. I am using Luvs because they are as good, don't leak and hold the moisture, but are much cheaper than Pampers.
They were cheap , don't leak .But they smell really bad. Very tight and caused rash on my son's skin. Swaddlers are softer and better than these. I would recommend spending a few more bucks and getting swaddlers.
I was excited to try the cool alert but the yellow on pull up made my daughter leg and color go yellow . Only one time my daughter notice when she felt the cool
We registered for a wipe warmer because a co-worker told my husband that it was one of their must-haves with their baby. We thought the idea made sense early on for when you're doing lots of poopy night changes and you don't want to fully wake your child up. However, our son didn't seem to be bothered by the regular cool temperature of wipes. We also didn't want him to become "spoiled" and freak out with regular wipes when we couldn't be by the warmer. It became something that was plugged in all the time, became very drippy and steamy, and we didn't see the point. Did it do what it says it will? Yes. Would we get it again? No.
The 4t was too small for my average size 2.5 year old.  It barely fit for our trip and now, a few months later, they don't fit at all.  Where the product closes, it scratched the skin so be careful as the child is wearing it that you check to make sure the plastic is not rubbing them.
I bought this for my 18lb baby in Medium size, but the diapers is WAY TOO small.  There's no way my baby will fit on it.  However, my baby's legs are quite chubby (thicker than a bottle of water).  So I had to exchange the diaper, which was super-easy.  I got a Large size, but I'm already regretting not buying an extra-Large.Haven't tried the diaper in the swimming pool, but once I do, I'll update my review.
This is a good liner to add to your baby's swimwear.  The fit is a little bulky on my 19 pound son, even though the elastic around the waist digs into his skin leaving a red rash.  I don't think this is the perfect fit.  I wanted to love this.. but I just don't.  I probably won't order any more of these.
I received this item for my baby shower and I was so excited to use it. We came home with our son and my husband sat in the chair and the legs just busted and broke. My husband is not heavy what so ever so we were really surprised about this. Plus..the chair is really petite and short..not made for men but for smaller women like myself..I have not even had a chance to enjoy it yet...time to go return it.ProsEasy to AssembleFits Anywhere
These are okay for what they're supposed to do.  We've used Huggies pull-ups in the past, but I got these because there were twice as many Pampers per box as the Huggies for about the same price.  The Huggies pull-ups have better features that these Pampers do not:  easy open sides so if my kid has an accident and soils them, I don't have to strip all her clothes off from the waist down to get the pull-up off--I can just open the sides of the old one and chuck it, then open the sides of the new one to put it on.  It's a bit of an annoyance with these Pampers when my girl's wearing pants and shoes to have to take all of that off in order so slip a new easy-up on her and then redress her--especially when you're in a cramped public stall.  That's my BIGGEST complaint with these.  Also, the Huggies have a "cool alert" wetness indicator that "tells" my daughter when she pees.  These Pampers do not.  Also, if these Pampers get VERY wet, the lining and wetness absorbers seem to break down and come off all over my baby's skin, which is a pain to clean and scrape off.  Fortunately, my little girl is getting very well potty-trained now, so it's not as frequent an issue to deal with the lack of quality issue.  That said, I'll probably order these again just for the price.  However, if you're just now starting with training, I'd recommend spending the extra money on the Huggies just to avoid all the added headache.Overall, you get more pants for your money with the Pampers, but a whole lot better quality with the Huggies.
This stuff is so great. The consistency is liked a heavy whipped cream - a bit more fluffy than the original formula. So light and easy to spread on (I keep some cotton swabs in a travel container nearby for ease of use and cleanliness reasons). It has a soft, pleasant smell and not medicinal smelling like the original, as well.Update:My baby has had loose stools for about two days now and his skin is red. I was able to use wipes on him just fine, but when I used Desitin creamy, he screamed in pain and cried for several minutes. I read that the zinc oxide in it can really burn if the skin is irritated or broken. My son's skin wasn't broken in any places nor did it have any rash, but there was some redness. I am scared to use this product again because he was so uncomfortable. I will use vaseline on him from now on because I know that is more gentle.
Pamper diapers do not have the Velcro sides, which I already knew.  I thought that it may be easier for my 2 year old to pull them up.  My husband puts holes in them trying to wiggle them up a wiggly 2-year old.  Not sure they are that easy to pull up for the kid since they can roll in the process.  I'm not sure it's a step up from a regular diaper either.  Perhaps they are more comfortable.  Also, I struggle knowing which way is the front.  I have come to the conclusion that the front must be the more padded side.  They tend to give my 2 year old a wedgie in the back while the front seems to come up too high.
from the three varieties of training pants I've tried... these work... however they are still sub quality that I have come to expect from the company
These are a little better price than the Huggies Pull-Ups, and I feel that they have a better fit than the Huggies.  What I do not like, however, is the scent they have, which only worsens if they happen to get peed in.  And although the fit is very similar, they are not as sturdy as the Seventh Generation brand which are my twins' training pant of choice.If scented dipes don't bother you and you don't have the budget for the Seventh Generation, they are a good choice.
These work well for naps and car rides- though they are a little bulky. They don't hold enough for nighttime for my little boy, though. I prefer Target's version of pull ups- they seem to hold just as much (more?) and aren't as bulky.
I've been a "Huggies Mom" for the last decade, but now that I'm expecting my 4th (and last) child, I've been taking a look-back at diapers for both my 2 year-old son and my soon-to-be-born son. When Mars was born, this Huggies Mom was gifted with Swaddlers, and I liked the entire premise of them: They had very flexible tabs, an interesting looking clothish mesh liner (reminiscent of Always maxis --- that should have been my first clue), and seemed to fit him well. They also seemed to handle "blowouts" as well as if not better than Huggies. Unfortunately, that mesh liner gave his tiny butt a rash like I'd never seen on my other children (they'd been Huggies kids from the start). Switched back to Huggies, and voila. Rash gone.Fast-forward to now: I ran out of my fabulous Costco Kirkland diapers and haven't been able to get to the nearest town with a Costco to replenish the supply, so I decided to buy through Amazon (cheaper than at my local Albertson's, which is the only option here in my town). The price for both Huggies Supreme and Pampers Cruisers was decent; I bought the Huggies based on experience, but also a box of Pampers Cruisers based on the ratings here and the statements of how great they were for boys.Suffice it to say, my son's review immediately: "It's too tight!"The Cruisers have that neat flexible tab, however, they must run smaller than Huggies or something because I couldn't wrap the tab around my son's hips like I usually did; he'd complain that the diaper was on too tight. So I'd loosen them until he said, "That's better."His next review: "My belly hurts! It hurts my belly!"I checked to see what he was referring to: The hard and rather sharp wrap tabs of the Cruisers would poke him in the belly when he sat up or bent at the waist unless I'd placed them "Just So" each time precisely on the diaper. I'm used to Huggies' tabs: They're soft with rounded edges, and it doesn't matter where you put them on the diaper to close.But the review that cinched that I wouldn't be buying Cruisers for my eldest boy again: "My butt hurts!" or what every parent likes to hear: "My penis hurts!"The mesh lining gave him that rash *again*. I'd thought that since he was older now, that his skin might be less sensitive to whatever was in the Swaddlers that gave him the red spotted rash. I was mistaken. His butt and perineal area and sometimes even on his scrotum and penis glans would frequently have red areas, no matter how often I changed him. (Thank god for Baby Aquaphor!) I'd never had that problem with Huggies or Kirkland for that matter.I did buy a small package Newborn Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive in addition to my usual Huggies Supreme for when my second son is born, based on the rave reviews it received. Every child is different, and who knows, they might work for this one. But if that rash comes back even once, that will be *it* for me and Pampers.
As a mom of three, I have always liked Pampers for when my children were infants and as they got older I adjusted brands based on fit and the body types of my children. I read all the reviews of the cruisers and I so wanted to love this diaper. There are things I do love: The softness of the diaper is nice. I like the thinness of the diaper and the fact that there is little to no bulk in the fit. Overall I have found the diaper to meet my expectations except for at night. Nighttime use has been leak after, leak, after leak. No matter how many times I change my son.My son is a wee-wee pusher if that makes any sense. He pushes so hard at night that the wee wee comes out the sides of the diaper. I am not sure if its the fault of the Pampers but I even tried to double diaper with a size 2-3 baby dry and a size 3 cruiser over that and the wee wee literally rolled down the mattress. This was after changing my son two hours prior. I recently tried Huggies Nighttime and so far no leaks at night. I like the look and feel of the Pampers better but I can't ignore a dry baby and sheets.Three children and just as many diaper brands tried. One diaper is not for all. Pampers are great but may not work in your situation-especially if you have a wee wee pusher like me!
This product is ok.  Material are good.  May be it is a little too big for my 10 month old son's mouth or something.  He doesn't like to chew it. Only couple times.  Now he only play around with it and barely put it to his mouth. When I frozen it, it bring more curiosity for my son to put it in his mouth often. I guess to taste the coldness.  If you are looking for something to chew, buy a item has vibration. I recently bought one, my son loved it too much.
Im not too sure of my son likes this or not. It is pretty stiff, and when I give it to him, and show him how to put it in his mouth, he doesnt seem interested. It seems to be a little too big for him right now.Maybe when he gets a little older and the teeth start to poke through...
my son is starting to use this toy a bit more now as he is 6 months but I find the rings are a bit too big and it is hard for him to bite onto the whole thing. he hates it when I put it in the freezer, but other babies might like that.
This is a good product, let's start there.  It spreads nicely on your nipples & keeps them soft & crack free.  What I just couldn't get past is the nut-like smell of this.  I got some of the Motherlove Herbal Nipple Cream to try as well, which goes on super smooth & has no odor to it, and ultimately I just prefer that one over this one.  I also tried Lanolin cream, but hated how thick & sticky it was.  With both the Lanolin cream & the Angel Baby Nipple Butter, though they are safe for baby & you don't have to wipe them off first, my son would make a &#34;yucky&#34; face until he had drank enough milk to drown out the taste.  With the Motherlove Nipple Cream, which is also 100% natural and a 0 on EWG, he never even noticed I had it on.
I have to agree, there is a ton of stuff going on with this toy. But, I don't think its obnoxious. We get a good laugh every time it says that 'it's time for fun on the farm'. We are using it for the sit part. I have removed the panel and baby sits next to it and plays. She likes to take the phone off the hook and rake it across the panel making all kinds of noise. She likes the spinning flowers and the rings around the triangle, square, and circle. She also likes the hide and seek panel and will open and close it over and over. I agree that later on when she is trying to use it as a walker that we will have trouble because we have really slick laminate and the wheels are very slick and there are no stops either to keep it from just rolling away when you try to pull up on it. I can visualize her falling already. We may not use it after that point....a shame, it could have been better if it worked well for both 'sit and stand'.Update: We gave up on using this as a walker as it was too dangerous on laminate floor. Just used the play part unattached and well she loved playing with it. After the dogs stepped on it a few times though the sound started stuttering and freezing and finally just quit altogether. Definitely not durable, at all. Only lasted about 3 months. Contemplating whether to replace it since she did like it so much or just move on....
I have a love/hate relationship with this walker.My son loves it and has since before he can walk. He loved hitting all of the buttons, spinning the wheel son the bottom, and clapping along with the music. His favorite thing to do is to pick up the phone and pretend to talk. He started practicing walking with the Vtech and continued with it back and forth between myself and my husband. I really think this helped him get his balance and have fun too. In fact, he still loves pushing this thing around and he is two now.It is a pretty annoying toy for parents though. Whew, this thing never shuts up. It is loud, it will go off when not being played with to try and catch the attention of the child, and the voice on this toy is pretty annoying.So to sum it up, annoying yes, will your kid like it? YES!
Mom sat me down in front of this vibrantly colored toy and I was immediately attracted to the shapes and when I pressed them, they spoke to me!  I enjoyed the lights very much!  I took the phone off the hook and shook it.  I threw it because that was pretty fun to do!  It doesn't have a cord like those shapes.  I accidentally pressed a key for the piano part, but realized my Schoenhut piano is way more fun.  I turned around to get my Einstein piano, but Mom turned me around to play with the Vtech again.  I climbed up and reached for the handle and fell on my face, it sucked coconuts because the wheels have no grip.  I was pretty pissed.  I think I'll stick to Mom's piano bench and other furniture around the house.I loved the cow button!  I mean, it was AWESOME!  I pressed it four times and it Moooo'd at me each time!  The other songs were really ... I dunno... I think I heard Mom say the word &#34;lame&#34;.  Almost too babyish even though, yeah, I'm a baby, but they were out of tune and it kinda felt like that Bob Dylan song &#34;Rainy Day Woman&#34; with those slide whistle sounds - I like the Bob Dylan children's music station on Pandora, but these songs were sub par, man.  Mom was showing me the rollers on the bottom and of course the cute one with animals on it ... didn't ROLL!  It was just a cute sticker in the middle that looked like another roller that made sounds.  I suppose it did teach me about illusions.  I gave it another shot later in the day (well, Mom made me...) and I was just totally over it and she read me a story instead.
I am not the best person to review this product because I only used them maybe 3 times. I have been breast feeding exclusively for 9 months. I work full-time and pump twice a day.- I must say that it did relieve some discomfort. But, I am not sure I needed this product for that. I think any warm compress would have done it. Moreover, the Natural Nipple butter is great for my nipple discomfort.- I have very large breast and these just did not fit right.- I didn't notice any increase in let-down. That may work for some other people.- This was not the best use of my money. But, the product may be just fine for others. It is inexpensive enough to try.- I will probably find other uses of this product in our home.
This is a good lanolin product and very useful for sore, dry, cracked nipples. However I like to find multiple uses for my lanolin products so I wasn't them to be pure. This product isn't 100% pure lanolin (what the heck is PEG-40 anyways?). It has additional ingredients added... probably to add to that better consistency some other reviewers mentioned. I also noticed it separates when you're squeezing it out for use. I use Lansinoh brand. I use it on sore nipples, my DH's bum, my lips, my elbows... you name it (and it needs moisturized) and I put lanolin on it (even my shoes to waterproof them!) So I want my product to be pure.
This was my first time trying Luvs diapers and I bought them because I wanted to try a less expensive alternative to Pampers and Huggies diapers. My experience is that the Luvs diapers fit fine (maybe a little on the small side) and that their absorbency is OK. My main complaint about them is that they need to be changed more frequently than Pampers or Huggies, or else they leak. So if I am going for out and know it will be a few hours until I can change the baby for a wet diaper, then I use a Pampers Cruiser or a Huggies diaper instead. However, for at home use where I am able to change the baby more frequently, the Luvs diapers work fine.I have no major complaints about Luvs smell or design. I do think they run a bit smaller than Pampers Cruisers so you may want to order a size up for extra absorbency if you usually use Pampers diapers and are used to the Pampers fit. I also think that the Luvs tabs don't stick to the diaper as strongly as the tabs on the Pampers or Huggies diapers, so be sure to press the tabs more securely to the diaper than you might normally do to be sure they stick so the diaper doesn't fall off the baby.Anyhow, if the Luvs diapers are on sale I would pick them up again, but if a sale had Huggies or Pampers at the same price then I would not buy the Luvs. So, the deciding factor for buying these diapers for me would be the price. if the price is low compared to Huggies or Pampers then I can recommend these diapers, as they are functional. However, when you order them, consider ordering a size up for extra absorbency and to prevent leaks.
This would not be my top choice for diapers-- they are absorbent, but they are not a snug fit like Pampers have been. Good value if you are just looking for a cheaper diaper, but not one I would recommend.
This product worked really well the first time I used it, but for some reason it won't work very well any more.  it takes a lot of force to get any snot out...maybe I have weak lungs?  My infant screams every time I used it, no matter how gentle I am.  Sometimes I get stuff loose but it won't completely come out so I have to use the bulb syringe too.
Everyone says this device is great.  I could take it or leave it.  It does remove snot, but my son hates it.  The clear tube comes loose a lot when I am sucking which is frustrating as well.  I think a bulb syringe would work just as well.
These wipes are good, just not very thick or wet. We use them because we bought them and don't really have any complaints, but I like the thicker brands better because they seem to get more of the newborn goo off. They don't smell or tear easily so that is also nice! I was surprised that I needed to buy the container to put them in because they only come in the refill packs and don't have a resealable top on them...so keep that in mind!
It is good for every day use. Does not have a bad smell. For rush treatment I would recommend to use a different one. This one is more for every day.
This is basically petroleum jelly and a few other things. Supposedly it's supposed to help prevent diaper rash by creating a barrier, but this seemed to do nothing to prevent diaper rash. It also doesn't seem to treat diaper rash well either. Definitely won't be going with a petroleum based product again.
They are platic bowls, whats the big deal. Just buy these to keep your wife from complaining. Nothing special about these because there are cheaper bowls known as disposible/ resuable containers (glad makes them)
many of my friends suggested buying this product as it is very useful and it is ok. i find the plastic part a but cheap-looking, but it does attach fast to almost anything and it is rather easy to use.
This ends my search for a good, low chemical diaper, although it's not perfect. After my toddler grew out of the one-size cloth diapers, I debated buying larger cloth diapers, and in the meantime, I searched for a good disposable. We tried Huggies Pure and Natural, Whole Foods brand, Seventh Generation and regular Pampers.The regular Pampers worked the best - they were comfortable, no leaks ever, and no white residue left behind. However, they smell so strongly, I worry about what's in them.The Huggies have a rough plastic part near the fasteners that left red marks on his legs and the sides of his belly. They also left behind white cloth-like, stringy stuff and gel on his behind.The Seventh Generation leak like crazy. During the day, the regular ones leaked, but the overnight diapers worked ok. At night, even the overnight diapers leaked. When it gets wet, the material inside the diaper clumps in a weird way. And they are beige, which bothers some people, but I didn't mind. I also had to throw a few away from every box because the fasteners came off with any slight pulling.The Whole Food ones were the worst. They didn't leak that much, but were uncomfortable, rough and scratchy, and left rashes.Babyganics were great - they fit well, didn't leak and no other problems. But, they smell like urine, strongly, like I could pick my child out of a group of several, it was that strong.The Earth's Best fit well and don't leak. There is no weird clumping when wet. They have stretchy, soft fasteners that are stronger than 7th Gen. They are a little rough on the edges but have no weird smell like Pampers, which again, are my preferred but for the smell and chemicals. The roughness makes these not the best, and I don't think I would put a younger baby in them, but it doesn't seem to bother my toddler.Edit: After a couple of weeks, my baby developed a nasty diaper rash, which we've rarely had. I'm back to Pampers, unfortunately.
Not my favorite. Still uses bleach just non-chlorine bleach. They caused a rash on my daughter (who never had one with another brand).
We use cloth diapers, but for trips to the mall or out of town where carrying around poopy diapers all day is not an option, we decided to purchase a pack of disposables.  My local health food store carries these and Seventh Generation, and I chose these.  They work ok.  I like the tabs and the fit, but we have had a couple pee leaks in these and I've only used half the package.  My cloth diapers NEVER leak, but these leak out the legs.  My son is 8 weeks old and in size 1 (11 pounds) and they seem true to size.I like that they are chlorine free and more earth-friendly than Pampers, but honestly I love my cloth and hate putting these on him.  I'm just glad I don't have to use these full-time.  No doubt they are better for him than Pampers, but probably leak more.
These are okay wipes, but they are not as thick as other "thick" brands. I also noticed they aren't as wet as I would have expected but they do the job. We have a three month old so they work well for her, but not sure how they would work for heavy duty jobs of an older baby.
I had always been a fan ofGrandma El's Diaper Rash Remedy and Prevention Jar, 3.75-Ouncefor my baby's bottom.  Despite the fact that Grandma El's works wonders, I had kept hearing so many rave reviews for this stuff that I wanted to give it a try.  (I like variety!)While the ingredients in this are stellar, it didn't help my daughter's bum at all.  She typically needs to wear some sort of barrier cream at night or she wakes up with a rash.  Using this balm was the same as not using anything at all.  I know that this does help many babies, so it may just be that my daughter is extra sensitive.Even though this product didn't help my daughter's rash, I have kept it on hand for scrapes, small cuts, etc.  It helps out, so it's not as though I'm out my money or anything.  If I had another baby, I may try this as a diaper cream again, but for now - I will not be making another purchase.
I purchased this in an effort to cure my daughters horrible diaper rash. We cloth diaper so my options were limited. I have been happy with other Earth Mamma Products so I thought I give this a try. I didn't realize this was only a 2 oz jar when I ordered it so I was very surprised when it arrived and it was a tiny jar. I probably won't order it again based on the price for how little you get. I can say you only need to use a little bit and it goes a long way. It didn't cure the diaper rash but does seem to work at preventing diaper rash.
I normally buy pampers for my son, however Pampers had not come out with a size 6 overnite diaper yet. My son wears size 4 diapers, but pees thru the size 4 & 5 overnights therefore I had to try something else. I have to say that I'm NOT impressed. He gets those tiny beeds on him in the morning that I have to wipe off. The diapers also leak 1/2 of the time. I can't wait for pampers to finally release their size 6 diapers. I wasn't impressed, they were just ok.
These would be good if there were more to them on the sides. They would leak almost every time my little girl peed. Especially if she was turned on her side. The pee would just run out around the top of the legs. I finally quit trying to use them and switched to Pampers.Update on huggies in general: we ended up switching back to huggies, but only after they came out with the little movers pull on's. they work great and dont leak on the sides.
I like Huggies. I first used the 1 size Little Snugglers which I really liked. I currently have size 2 Little Snugglers, but these sometimes leak on me unless I get them on real tight. That leaves marks on my baby girl which I'm not too happy about. I'm really hoping that I just have to try different kinds of diapers until I find the right fit for my daughter. Next time I'm going to get Little Movers or Snug & Dry; hopefully one of them works. I tried Pampers but they were so thin! And I got leaks with them too, plus they don't have that waistband that Huggies have so it was easier for the poop to come right out of the top..not good!But I'm giving these diapers 3 stars because They're too narrow, and I sometimes get poop leaks which I think has to do with the fact that when I put the diaper on, even if it's tight, the part around her legs don't seem well-protected. It's almost as if Huggies ran out of the elastic material to make it all the way to the top of the diaper. Luckily I just bought one pack because I think it's time to go up a size anyhow. Hopefully my daughter doesn't gain too much weight before I run out of the pack!
We have two little ones in diapers -- ages 1 and 3 -- and I'm always eager to try out new diapers through Vine when given a chance. Here are my impressions:THE GOOD* I liked the concept of the day-and-night diapers in one box, and the percentage of each worked out pretty well.* The same size worked for both our tubby little guy and our skinny toddler!* The diapers are cute and not overly busy; no television characters here.* No problems with leaks or blowouts.THE NOT-SO-GOOD* I didn't notice a huge difference between the day and night diapers.* The nighttime diapers were less stiff than the Huggies overnight dipes we've tried, but they also didn't seem as absorbent.* The daytime ones were also a little on the stiff side. (We normally use Luvs but previously used Pampers.)* They're only slightly cheaper than Pampers and Huggies and are more expensive than Luvs.* I've never actually seen them in a store!So, while I wasn't disappointed in the Fisher Price diapers, they didn't blow me out of the water, either. I'd buy them again if I saw them -- IF! -- and they were on sale.
I bought these because of all of the rave reviews that it got. I wanted to wait until I had a few days with these diapers before I left a review. So here is my review: The "day" diapers are not near as absorbent as Huggies or Pampers. Before I bought these I was using a generic brand made by Diapers.com and I've been pretty happy with them thus far. Fisher Price was a little cheaper and had all the great reviews so I decided to give them a chance. With the diapers.com, Huggies & Pampers I did not have any leaks at all during the day. Not so with the Fisher price diapers. The first day my little one leaked and soaked his pants and onesie. Not cool. So I have to change my DS more often than with the others. This ultimately means that with the amount of diapers that I'm using during the day will eventually add up to the cost of using the premium brands. So in the end the cost is about the same. The "Over nights" I've only had one leaky diaper but I will chalk that up to baby sleeping in more than he usually does. So we shall see...I will be back in a week with a follow up update!Pros:Cute for either boy or girlThey seem softReally like the color guide for sizingCons:Day diapers are not near as absorbent as Huggies, Pampers or Generic Diapers.com brandCost is about the same as the premium brands when you consider the aboveUpdate!My final verdict on these diapers...All in all they are about .24 to .29 cents per diaper depending on which box you buy which is actually if you do the math slightly more expensive than Pampers .20 to .27 cents! Go figure! With that being said I would save the money and get the Pampers! I myself am a Huggies fan and will go back to using Huggies. These unfortunately just didn't do it for me. They leaked to a point where I had to use "dappi" water proof pants over them so my son wouldn't wet his pajamas. Fisher Price is relatively new to the diaper industry and if they're going to compete they need to step up their game. Otherwise they need to stick to what they're good at...toys!
The twins have used Pampers up to now with no problems but we were willing to try these for the sake of experimentation.I was surprised at how well they fit.  One twin is tall and skinney and the other is short and fat but the diapers fit both equally well.  I read the review complaining that the waist wasn't big enough but that baby must have been stouter than mine.The diapers absorbed fine, no leakage and no chafing.Ordering via subscription, Pampers costs me $.29 per diaper and Fisher Price costs $.21 per diaper.  By switching my subscription from Pampers to Fisher Price, we'll save $16 a month and that doesn't even count the newborn._____________________________________________________After using the entire box, we decided to go back to Pampers for better leak protection.
I got these diapers, because at the time they were the cheapest. They work fine and are cute, although they are a bit snug. Also, the nighttime diapers do not work as well as other brands at night. I used these during the day and other brands (Huggies, Parent's Choice, Up and up, ect.) at night. All in all, I'd buy them again if the price hadn't gone up. For cheap diapers that work well, check out Luvs.
For the price, this product will do what the standard generic diaper can do. Personally, we've been using Pamper Cruisers for many years and still prefer that over the rest of the products. the narrow fit on this diaper reminds me a little of Huggies. Although, this diaper didn't have leaks like the Huggies did for my children, it still wasn't as comfortable as the Paper Cruisers.Although, it was nice have the Night time diapers, quality wise the standard Pamper Cruiser did better at fit and holding in the excess than this product did.Overall, pricewise this product was good, but it didn't convince me to switch over to this product.
I got the box of diapers in size 4 when my baby was about 20 pounds, which is lower then the lower weight limit for the size 4 diapers. There are marks on the diapers where you could check if they are the correct size for your baby. If you put the diaper on and the tabs are in the green, it means that the diaper fits well, anything outside the green zone is too big or too small. Well, the diaper was just at the edge of the green for my 20 pound baby.When he did grow to the full 22 pounds, I tried the diapers again, this time they were fitting better. The blue Happy Nights diapers were much bulkier then the white daytime diapers. My baby got just one minor leak during the time he was wearing the diapers. The nighttime ones are considerable thicker then the daytime diapers for better protection. At the same time we used Huggies Overnights, Earth's Best, Nature Babycare and my last box of old style Pampers cruisers (the ones with the mesh liner and without Dry Max). The old style Cruisers were by far the best, thinnest, softest, most absorbent, no leakage, and dry to the touch when wet, although they were scented, which I do not really like. Huggies overnights gave us major leaks. Both Earth Best and Nature Babycare leaked a little, Earth best being a bit beeter. So, as to performance, Happy days and Nights diapers were quite not bad with only one leak, but they are stiff, and they become wet to the touch when baby pees, so he demands diaper change right away.
We have used Pampers diapers exclusively since our baby was born.  However, when the Vine program offered these, we decided to give them a chance.  The results were not too favorable compared to the Baby Dry Pampers.It seems like 50% of the time, these diapers leak, especially overnight.  They are a little stiff and not very soft.The color-coded tab feature, which is intended to help you know where to place the adhesive tabs is different, and a neat idea.  However, after some initial confusion due to the picture instructions, we have found them to be too difficult to open the tabs.  When you have a sqirming baby who doesn't want to have his diaper changed, these tabs are a little too stubborn.  Once applied and placed in position, the tabs also don't stick very well.We will be going back to Pampers once we make it through this box, if only because we don't want to waste these diapers.
I wasn't that impressed with this product, it was ok for at home, because it was a great deal, but I would not purchase it as my main product for usage for every occasion.
I have to admit.  We bought these for my son when he was small and we loved them.  We had them on the subscribe and save option and they were pretty much the only diapers we used as he got bigger.  I started using them with my youngest now, and we had a major diaper blow out today.  Now I realize these things happen, but its not as if she had the diaper on for an egregious length of time.  I'm just a little disappointed.  This diaper leaked all around the legs.  Not sure if I will continue to purchase them or not.  The price is great, but if they leak every time the kid has a bowel movement they aren't much use.
I bought these before the birth of my child because everyone said I would need them if nursing..not true. I have yet to use any of these. Apparently not everyone suffers from constant 'leakage'. Gave them an average 3 stars because I'm sure they work, I just don't need them. Recommended to wait until you needed some before purchasing this item.
I first used these in 2009 and now again for new baby in 2011, and noticed the design has been revised. Previous version had a very crinkly backing and a gusset so the pad could conform to the contour of the breast. New version is less crinkly, did away with the gusset and in its place are 2 sealed darts to make the pad convex. The underside of each dart is a "wing" of material that sticks out and show under thin nursing bras and garments. They do look awful! While I'm not quite a fan of the gusset design, I'm hating the sealed dart design even more. I wish Lansinoh could cut away the winged portion or at least fuse them back into the pad for a neater look. Other than the design, the concept is great. The SAP filled pulp really holds a great deal of leaked milk from engorgement probably the best nursing pads around for this purpose, and you don't have to change them as often as other brands therefore they are value for money.
I was expecting this to be better quality. The pad is pretty thin and the part that wraps around the mattress seems like it will tear easily.
Though it is not perfect fit, it does what you need it for. You can put it on the mattress and it will protect it from accidents.
This has kept the mattress dry, but it's very thin and makes noise when he moves on it like plastic. I use this as a last resort when his American Baby Company mattress crib pad is in the wash.
After having been through the nightmare of trying Luvs (with Leak guard Protection!) which just about every single diaper split open & created a mess of jelled absorbent crystals, I decided to try Huggies Movers. My daughter really pees a lot in the middle of the night. The diapers still leak on occasion & try to split open a little but they are still far better than Luvs. The Movers diapers size 4 seem bigger than other diapers of the same size. Perhaps that's why they leak. Like I said though, they're better than the others.
I am mostly a pamper buyer, but I thought I would give these a try. Since I have been using these my son has had 2 pee diapers leak and one poop one. I never get leakage with pampers. These don't hold the liquid as well as pampers, in my opinion.Even though, these have the four points with Double Grip Strips which is nice at top, it doesn't help the leakage at the bottom.Although some good points are there is no gel that comes off when it gets too wet. They fit my son pretty well. I just don't understand why I have been having leaky diapers with these when I haven't had a leaky diaper ever in size five with pampers.
I have always liked huggies over other brands.. and Ive tried everything.the plus to huggies are:*they have never leaked for me*I can use them overnight and my baby is protected, clean and dry (pampers get soggy diaper syndrome)*the quality is good for being disposable and the diaper stays in place throughout the day* They ares too bulky, yet are soft and absorbent.however, despite everything that i love about huggies... the tabs are so thick that if not secured perfectly they hang down just a bit over the bottom and the edge chaffs my babies thighs. It has made me very conscious of how i secure the tabs and thats not always easy when my active 1.5 year old is wanting to get up, or daddy is the one changing his diaper.I used to love huggies when my child was smaller and not mobile.. but it seems now he is walking and running i will have to change to pampers.all babies are not shaped the same, so you may not have this issue... but I do find either way the tabs to be slightly excessively thick top to bottom.
We have been using Pampers on our 6 month old.  When we started using these, we noticed that she soaked through her diaper a few times, especially at night.  This never seemed to happen with Pampers.Otherwise these seem good enough.  I suppose more frequent changes would resolve the wetness issue, but we're already changing her diaper often.I guess the most telling thing about these diapers is when I overheard my wife say to my daughter, who has no idea what we are saying obviously, &#34;yeah, we are back to the good diapers.&#34;
Smaller fit and less absorbency than snug and dry. They are softer but more expensive and you have to use more of them and buy  bigger size versus snug and dry. Not worth the irritation even if they seem a bit fancier.
We've been through pretty much every kind of diaper available.  Our favorites when my son was younger were Huggies Little Snugglers (with Pooh on them).  When he switched to Size 3, something happened and Pooh disappeared and was replaced by Mickey Mouse.  We moved up to the Little Movers (with Mickey) and all seemed well - until this latest batch of diapers when we went up a size - to Size 4.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but something changed.  My son is usually too busy running around to even care if his diaper is wet, but now, the second he makes the tiniest peepee, he pulls and points at his diaper.  I also noticed it is much lumpier than it used to be when wet - even if only barely wet.  Maybe part of it is him  growing up and realizing that it's not pleasant to be sitting in a wet diaper.... but he does it in such a way, where it seems like it actually bothers him.  And the lumpiness is what annoys me.  So Huggies are no longer our go-to diaper at this point.  Preferred the Little Snugglers to the Little Movers, but we preferred Huggies all together back when they had Pooh on their diapers.
So I have three children, ages 10, 8, and almost 3. When my ten year old was born we tried several different brands including Huggies, Pampers, and some store brands. As far as preventing leaks Pampers won hands down (Huggies was one of the worst). We stuck with Pampers with our second child and with our third for about the first 6 months of his life and then switched to Luvs since they were more cost effective. When I had the chance to try Huggies again I figured, why not, there has to be some improvement in a decade, right? Wrong. My son has have had several leaks in the week we have been using them. They have all been nighttime leaks but I expected more from these &#34;new improved&#34; Huggies. I will say I like the stretchable waste band, my son does not complain of them being too tight as he does with Luvs but I will continue to recommend Pampers to any new moms I know.
I've used Huggies diapers before, including the Little Movers with our first, but these just were not the same. We generally use a less expensive brand (much less) and for our little ones, these were inferior in just about every way. We haven't had leaks worth mentioning in quite some time, but with the introduction of these Little Movers, it became a semi-regular occurrence again. There's just something about the way these fit. They're too snug in some places, loose in others, and when the loose areas (around the legs) start to do their own thing, leaks happen (and the diaper itself is dry...there's nothing wrong with the absorbency, the moisture just never gets to the diaper).These also seem noticeably smaller than some of the other same-sized (4's for us) diapers that we've used and are using, but again, looser in places. Maybe Huggies is trying to change the overall fit of the diaper, but that fit doesn't work for everyone. One of our twins didn't have any leaks, while the other had them a few nights a week with these, so you might have a different experience...every baby is different. That said, both of them did have some irritation from the elastic around the waist and hip area, which we hadn't really experienced with any of the diapers we've used before. The more I think about it, the more I think these new Little Movers are just fundamentally flawed on the design level. We didn't have issues with them in the past. They're still not the worst, and if they fit your baby right, then they'll keep him or her dry, but at the asking price, it's really hard not to expect more than hit and miss.
We have always liked Huggies when I bought them in the past, with the exception of the newborn size Pure & Natural, which leaked so much for us in the very early days.  We have been using Huggies Overnights and overnight Pull-Ups for the past year and although we have leaks, nothing holds my heavy wetter all night except cloth.  What I have always liked about Huggies is that they don't have the powder smell that Pampers and Luvs have.  They do tend to leak a bit more for us than Pampers, but we never really had any major issues.Until now.This new design leaks.  Horribly.  I was holding my son one morning before work as I was dropping him off at daycare, and he let loose his bladder and it came right out the leg and soaked my shirt.  Other days he's had pee all over his pants and a puddle on the floor, and all over his sheets during nap time.  They just leak.  He does pee a lot, but it shouldn't come out like that.  We are wearing size four in other brands, but I noticed that Huggies run smaller than Pampers and the store brands.  Maybe we just need to size up?On a side note, I thought these were causing my son's rash (hence the response to my original review from Huggies below) but it turns out he's cutting 3 molars at once and the rash is coming from the teeth.  It keeps clearing and reappearing no matter which diapers we use, cloth or disposables.  I feel bad now for blaming Huggies for that....They seem thinner and not as soft as before.  We will try the size five and see what happens, but it's clear that these fours don't work for us anymore.
Of the three babies I have in diapers, two of them can wear Huggies with no problem, the third can't because they break her out. So, I have a three year old boy and an 19 month old girl wearing these Huggies.  My three year old is potty trained during the day time, so he only wears the diapers at night.  The diapers fit him well, and so far we have not had any night time leaks.  My 19 month old can &#34;technically&#34; wear size 4 diapers, but the size 4 diapers are tight on her chubby thighs.  These size fives fit her ok, and we haven't had any pee-pee leaks, although we have had some &#34;stinky&#34; leaks :(  These diapers tend to sag tremendously as she crawls, walks, and plays; whether she is wet or dry.  I wasn't sure if the sagging was because she was in a bigger size, but I managed to snag a size 4 Little Mover from a friend at church, and the effect was the same.  In short, while these diapers didn't leak much, I don't think I will be changing from my usual brand.
My little one has recently discovered how to move around, so I bought some little movers hoping that they would help her stay a little drier now that she wiggles more.  These diapers are significantly thinner than the Luvs and Pampers that I currently use, and significantly higher along the waist.  The latter is a good thing, the former is not so much.  I haven't had any leakage problems yet, but I kind of assume that there will be problems if I'm not able to get to them in time.
We tried these for awhile, but no one likes a leaky diaper. These just don't cut it, so we switched back to Pampers, the only diapers we've found so far that don't leak.
pros:1)I like products that are environmentally conscious. its important that we are aware how much waste baby products make on our planet2) no dyes or chemicals next to my babys skin is very important to me and that is a definate benefit to these diapers3) they are really absorbent and I havent had a problem with any kind of leaking so far4) i like the way they clasp, they are secure and stretchy unlike those made by seventh generationcons:1) they are pretty stiff and bulky. this is a huge con. although my baby doesnt vocalize any discomfort no matter what when he is moving around and sitting and folding over he gets marks and lines from where the diaper has pressed into his skin because they arent that soft.2) harder for me to tell whether his diaper is full because the moment i put them on they are so bulky its like they are already fullI havent decided whether im sold on these diapers. i still havent found environmentally friendly diapers that offer everything im looking for and i will continue my search, no bad overall though
We have a diaper genie and go through the refill pacts quite frequently. I don't mind spending the money to buy the refill bags but I wish more bags are in a pack for the price they charge. It runs out too quickly and is annoying to change out the refill cartridges so often.
I buy these refills for ourDiaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail with Refill, 270-Count. They fit in the pail well and do what they are designed to do. My only suggestion for improvement would be to have the end of the bags be connected to the plastic ring somehow. I dislike when I get towards the end of the pack and I throw a diaper in and the whole bag falls into the pail. I feel so wasteful having to cut the life of a bag short because it won't stay in the ring. Sometimes I'll cut off the filled portion and the remaining bag isn't quite long enough and I end up pulling the whole rest of it out. If it was glued in there somehow, then I could use up every last inch of the bags without wasting any.One tip I've seen people mention that I am going to reiterate is how to get more out of your bags. When it's time to empty, I push down whatever diapers are in the pail and squeeze out the extra air. I keep doing this until I have a compact air-free package of dirty diapers and then I cut the whole load off and tie it up. This will save you a lot of bag length. Try it next time and check out the difference between where you would have had to cut before and where you ended up cutting after pushing the air out. This technique will prolong the bags.
There's nothing wrong with the bags, but the diaper genie itself breaks every few days. If I were to have another baby, I would get something different.
This stuff is expensive.
we  have  been  using pampers  swaddlers since  birth till 5 months and size 3.. I got these when  my daughter  developed a rash  thinking  they  are  pure  and  natural  so  they  will  be  gentle  enough  for  her  very  sensitive  skin.. wrong .. yes they are really soft but from the outside as the organic cotton is only in the outside but the inside of the diaper  actually  touching  the  baby's skin is no  different  than regular huggies..so nothing special..and  they  are  so  small no way that they would last up to 28 lbs..  she  was  17 lbs in  size 3  in swaddlers  and they fit perfectly almost a little large but could barely fit in the huggies, weird..!!!! now she's 19-20 lbs and still wears size 3 in pampers cruisers witch are doing a great job keeping her dry and rash free.. and I use huggies overnights in size 4 at nighttime and they are great.. overall I would not buy these diapers again..tip : I recommend using baby powder over your favorite diaper cream with every diaper change it helps sealing the cream so it lasts longer in contact  with  the  skin  and  gets  the  job  done and also It absorbs excess moisture keeping the skin dry .. I use Johnson's pure corn starch powder and it is so good and smells great too..I hope this trick works for everyone because I know how frustrating it is to see your baby suffering from diaper rash.. good luck
I guess with a pure and natural diaper, I expect it to have no fragrances, but these smelled very powdery.  I hate the powder smell, so they weren't for me...  but they did hold fluid better than Seventh Generation diapers.
These diapers were great for my baby when she developed a diaper rash. We used them temporarily until her skin cleared then went back to a less expensive style. My only issue with them was that she required an increase in size much sooner because they seem to be a bit less absorbent and were very expensive. She was only 18lbs but had to be in the size 4 to prevent leaks. They are also just too pricey to be using a larger size with less in the package.
We picked these diapers as an alternative to seventh generation and earth's best.  However, we are not sure how &#34;pure&#34; the product is.  The outside is soft but the inside (the important part) seems like a regular diaper.  Huggies needs to disclose more about what is in this diaper.
This review is for the newborn size of Huggies Pure & Natural diapers, which we've been using for 3 weeks on our son, who was born at 7lbs 13oz, and still has a pretty tiny butt!They seem to perform well, but two things make me sorry I bought such a huge pack of them -- I probably won't finish it.1) They often leave little gel granules all over our son's crotch.  While these are supposedly not harmful to him, I'm concerned about them getting trapped in his newly healed circumcision and/or irritating his nether bits.  I'm definitely glad we weren't using these when he was freshly circumcised.  While the gel bits are more likely to show up with large urine loads or any delay in changing the diaper, they DO show up often enough even when I change his diaper instantly.  I've been holed up in a hotel with him for days while movers pack our apartment, and I'm so close to him that I'm literally changing him as soon as he pees.  Gel bits galore!  And they are very clingy and hard to clean off of his little bits.2) For some reason, our son cries every time he has a wet diaper with these -- and not with the other brand we tried.  It wakes him from a sound sleep, and he really cries like he's quite upset.  I wonder if the way the gel swells up when it gets wet bothers him somehow (?).  I though I was imagining it, but it's very very predictable with these diapers.  And poo diapers don't seem to bother him at all!  It's not that I'd leave my son with a wet diaper for hours on end, but when he's just gotten to sleep after a feed and would otherwise sleep at least another hour, that's a major blow to exhausted parents of a newborn.  I was worried that I'd miss the wetness indicator on our previous brand -- but I can tell the moment he pees just from the crying!One more thing -- not a huge deal, but something to be aware of -- there is a small area of black printing on the inside of the right diaper tab (on the left as you are looking down on the diaper from your child's feet).  If my son gets sweaty or moist for whatever reason, and the front flap has worked its way out from under the tab (as happens when he gets kicky!), the black ink comes off on his skin and leaves a purplish stain.  The first time I saw this I was concerned and thought he had a new bruise, but it wiped away with some persistent effort.We've had a few urine leaks with these as well, but generally only with really large pees or if we didn't notice that the leg elastic wasn't arranged perfectly with the flaps smooth and out.If it weren't for the gel bits and the pee-induced crying, I'd rate these 4-5 stars -- they seem to do a good job holding the nasties in, and they are truly unscented.
I usually use the unscented wipes but ordered these thinking they were the same, I did not realize the aloe would make the wipes so sticky, they are no good for wiping hands and face when out b/c they leave his skin very sticky (and mine since I use them to wipe my own hands a lot). I am holding the rest of the box for use on our newborn instead as she will not need them for hands or face only bottom wiping and the aloe I am sure is great for helping heal diaper rash bottoms.I just make sure I get the regular unscented now without the aloe.
I have two kids and we have been a Pampers family for years.  I finally decided to try the new Dry Max diapers and I have to say I'm not impressed.Pros:-They are definitely thinner and less bulky.  The one issue I had with Cruisers was the added bulk.-They have the same wonderful Pampers smell (I know some people hate this, but I can't put into words my love for the smell of Pampers.)-The design is cute.Cons:-They don't absorb urine anywhere near as well as the old Cruisers.  My son's diaper has leaked all over his clothes numerous times and each time, when I take the diaper off, it is barely wet.-After the first diaper being on him overnight, I noticed his bottom was pretty red.  He isn't prone to diaper rash and doesn't have sensitive skin at all.-They are nowhere near as soft and stretchy as the original Cruisers.-The mesh liner is gone.-They feel much cheaper.  Almost like Proctor & Gamble just slapped a new label on the Baby Dry or Luvs diapers and marketed them as a premium diaper when they really aren't.
I was thrilled to learn that Pampers did away with DryMax in their Cruisers, which caused hot, red rashes and blisters all over my son's diaper area.  :( However, these diapers still don't live up to the "old" Cruisers which were AWESOME.  I tried these with my son over the past week after having issues with the Baby Dry diapers, which worked well for us but are now causing a horrible rash. They are "meh." My son has leaked through them two out of the last three nights, peeing out through the top.  I have learned to fasten the tabs "high" on the waist, because if there is any room for the diaper to fold over, it will leak.  These also smell gross and are causing mild redness on my son.  They are super cute and I was optimistic, but overall, I'm super disappointed with Pampers.  They still seem to work well for most people, but are definitely not as good as they used to be.  I'm not willing to pay even Amazon's great prices for a mediocre diaper.
Definetly NOT what we expected from a Pampers product. If you have a little boy then you probably know how they are capable of completely soaking everything but the diaper they are wearing. While I hadn't met a Pampers product I didn't like before this... Cruisers diaper was it! I feel like the size runs a bit small or perhaps its just the fit with all the supposed abilility to move with your child although the boys for sure can still pee and poop out the sides quite well. I would never recommend this product to for overnights either. All in all, not a fantastic product. Will happily stick with the Pampers Baby Dry's!
These diapers are thin, lightweight, easy to put on, and retain moisture well.  I didn't have any issues with leaking.  They have cute Sesame Street characters printed on them and are generously sized. While some size 3 diapers are tight on my baby, these fit easily.  However, upon opening the box, I noticed a strong chemical smell which has remained.  I notice it when I'm in the same room as the diapers.Functionally, these diapers are 4-5 stars, but since I'm wary about putting something with such a strong scent directly on my baby's skin and also wonder about the environmental effects of a product that generates such a strong scent, I wouldn't purchase them again.
Either the crotch area was too wide or it was just the material, but my son got big, red and very sore welts on his inner thighs. He's always worn Luv's and those don't give him any trouble - they seem to be lighter weight. I just went back to size 6 Luv's and he's doing fine in those.
Like those families with divided loyalties over one fast-food restaurant or another (read: McDonalds or Burger King), we are typically a Huggies family. That doesn't mean we won't sprinkle our diaper stash with Pampers, or any other brand, on occasion, because with all things diapers, we tend to go where the deal is.  In this case we were given a case of Pampers to try.My son weighs 17lbs and is 6 months old.  He doesn't crawl yet.  My other son weighs 28 lbs and is almost 2  years old. They are oddly, both in size 4 Huggies.  I tested these Pampers on my 6 month old.  Huggies Snug and Dry Size 4 are for babies 22-37lbs.  Pampers Cruisers size 3 are for babies 16 - 28lbs.At first glance Huggies Snug and Dry size 4 and Pampers Cruisers size 3 look to be the same size. Pampers is a little thinner than the Huggies, and has a softer feel. Huggies has an extra booster-type pad centered towards the middle and all the way back of the diaper.  Pampers is one solid seam on the inside.  Both are cute in design, Huggies with Mickey and Minnie, and Pampers with bright colors and Sesame Street Characters.So here is what I found:- Pampers doesn't fit my 6 month old that well.  This is odd because it should fit him by weight because he's on the low end of the size 3's.  But he has a big belly and the Pampers seem to cut him off and feel too tight.- Pampers does hold its share of pee.  It has an interesting squish to it when full.  Leaks are rare.  Even with big poos Pampers holds its own, though not with a monster explosion.- Huggies seem to give my 6 month old extra comfort in the waist; he just looks more comfortable and not so tight.  Then again, my son is up a size in Huggies, using size 4 instead of the 3's Huggies would recommend, but there again I have the same tightness around the belly problem in size 3's... so maybe if I went up to size 4 in Pampers he would do better, which interestingly is for babies 22-37lbs - strange how they crossover in weight when size 3's go up to 28lbs.-  I think Huggies have more chances to leak when full, but they seem to hang a little low in the crotch, allowing for extra poo room.  Whereas Pampers would just squish when filled with poop and run up the backside of the baby (though not necessarily leak out because they have a good waist band).  Huggies tends to leak at the gussets; Pampers will not. I do like that Pampers has really good gussets!-  Pampers has a strong chemical smell to their diapers.  This is really the one thing that upsets me about Pampers.  It maybe that the smell means nothing, but you can't help but imagine what these diapers are doing to your child's skin.  I have friends who say they are not bothered by it, so maybe it's just me.  I'd hate to work in a Pampers factory and smell that all day.I do like Pampers, but even with my first son, they never seemed to fit well; they are either TOO big, or TOO small, never just right when they should be.  With these Pampers size 3, I think my son can only wear them for another month before he'll outgrow them, even though he should be able to wear these diapers until he's about a year old by weight! But I've found that all diapers have a little quirk to them that's hardly explained when you buy them; it sometimes depends on your baby's physical shape that determines how well they'll fit.Sadly, we'll have to pass on these Pampers, again, even though I really wish they would work for us. For now we are still a Huggies and Chick-fil-A Family.
This is where the sizing stopped working for my son, and he's been in a type of Pampers since he was born. The Cruisers Size 4 were too tight, the Cruisers Size 5 were too big, but the Pampers Easy Ups Size 4 were just right. It all depends on your child's body type. Overall Pampers makes good diapers.
We received Size 2/3 DryMax diapers and these as well as part of the Vine Program.  Basically the same thing applies to these as the Size 2/3 Diapers because of the DryMax concerns.In my other review, I stated the following: "Prior the the Federal investigation (May 2010), my wife had heard these were causing a rash. Our friends also told us their DryMax diapers were leaking. So, we tried them sparingly and didn't notice a rash on our baby, but on the day we used them all day long, he developed redness on his bottom and between his cheeks. Now there's an investigation by the Federal Government, so we're backing off on using these.  Its a shame."So the jury is still out on these.  We may continue to try these as he is now moving into this size, but for the time-being, we won't use these all day long.  On a positive note, these are best constructed diapers we have used.  They are made well.Update: The investigation is about the chemicals used to capture urine in the diapers, called polacrylates. Additionally, the leaking is seemingly a result of making the diapers thinner. With thinner material, it seems babies are being exposed to the chemicals easier, according to The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.Update 9/2/10:  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Health Canada (HC) reviews have not identified a link between Dry Max diapers and diaper rash.
I haven't used the old version of the Cruisers that so many reviewers loved so I can't compare to that.The diaper actually does absorb a lot of liquid when you "test" it by dumping a cup of water into the diaper (yep, I did that just to see how much it would hold).  However, what diaper engineers seem to have forgotten is that babies don't just sit still and pour liquids into their diapers!Unfortunately for the product designers at Pampers, babies move, wiggle, and dump a whole lot more than liquids into their diapers!  There is something about the liner that simply doesn't function properly, which is a shame because I like how unbulky the diaper is.  I do like the design of the elastic around the leg openings.There are better diapers out there for less money.
Not the worst diaper we've tried (and not as bad as the Pampers Swaddlers). But some problems with these and probably will not use them again:-Unlike Swaddlers, liquids are more evenly distributed.-They have a saggy fit (but I guess most Pampers do)-Lots of bleach & petrochemicals in these diapers (Pampers is currently facing several law suits for chemical burn - and many complaints of irritation & burns in the Amazon reviews).-The "thinness" is not a huge perk for me - the other concerns outweigh any advantage of being thin.-I much prefer Seventh Generation, the Costco/Kirklands brand, and we're trying cloth when at home.
Other than the free one's given at the hospital when my son was born, I do not buy Pampers.  Typically we use Huggie's, Costco's brand, Earth's Best, or Target (whatever's cheapest).  These diapers were a free trial pack, so I wouldn't normally buy them.Yes they are THIN.  My goodness.  I wondered if a diaper this thin could possible hold the magnitude of pooh and pee my 9  month old son is capable of dishing out.  To cut to the chase, it did!  I have no complaints there, but there were problems...The first problem is my son is on the small end (he's 17 lbs soaking wet), and he's already walking, which also means he falls on his bottom a lot.  With a regular (read: not so thin) diaper, he gets a bit of cushion when he falls.  With these diapers I felt myself cringed every time he fell because he always had a look like, "This didn't used to hurt so much before."  There's something to be said about having that little bum-cushion for falls.The second problem is there is no elastic waist band.  Most diapers have a thing elastic about two inches or so from the top of the diaper to keep the mushy pooh from leaking out.  One time my son pooped and I could see it looking down into the back of his diaper.  But it was kept in because of the high back.  But what if he'd been sitting in his car seat?  That poop would have squeezed right out the back!Those were my main complaints.  Other than that the elastic tape seemed to work fine and was stretchy and made for a good fit.  I love the fresh scent, baby powder, but it sometimes made detecting pooh a bit difficult because it was so strong.  The scent was so strong; in fact, you could smell baby way before he got near me.Overall I thought the diapers were okay.  But given that my son is walking (and falling) already, it's not really my choice to buy these ever again.  Also, since he's thin to begin with, these diapers made some of his pants difficult to keep up.
I did a comparison of these in size 3 and Pampers with Baby Dry in the same size. These Cruisers, with the Dry Max technology, are thin and have a purple tint to them. However they have a more "tall" cut around the waist, and as a result these seem true to size as compared with the Baby Dry, which comparatively seem almost a size smaller.Overall, I prefer the Baby Dry because they have a more natural feel to them. I am uneasy about the purple color and fragrance of these. Both these and the Baby Dry Pampers have leaked in the middle of the night. These Cruisers have had instances of night time leaks overall, but when they do leak, they leak more catastrophically than the Baby Dry, i.e. bigger wet spots and going way up her back and sides.These Cruisers perform fine during the day and my daughter seems comfortable, but I have had hit or miss luck with them at night.
If you read down the list of reviews, you will find two basic camps: love this diaper and it gave my kid a rash.  Now this is true of just about any diaper, but the reaction against the new "Dry Max" pampers has been particularly vocal.  So the question any parent would naturally ask is: will this diaper give my baby a rash?  Well... maybe.First of a bit about diapers:  To over simplify a little, diapers keep your baby dry using two things: "SAPs" or Super-absorbent polymers and Cellulose (made from wood pulp).  There are some other materials in the diaper, but the real work is being done by these two ingredients.  Cellulose can hold a limited amount of water when under pressure (i.e. baby is sitting or lying in a wet diaper apply pressure to part of it) so SAPs are brought in to provide a more absorbent and stable moisture trap.Now a little diaper history: the two main diaper manufactures are Proctor and Gamble (Pampers and Luvs) and Kimberly Clark (Huggies).  Kimberly Clark is a paper and wood products company and they brought their considerable expertise to the table when they created the successful "Huggies" line of diapers.  Proctor and Gamble countered by leveraging it's extensive chemical portfolio and began a long drive to improve their SAPs which allowed them to use less cellulose and make thinner diapers than Huggies.  Huggies do use SAPs, but they are less advanced than what P&G; has brought to the market.As a result you have more cellulose between skin and SAP in a Huggies than in a Pampers.  If the SAP, or some other chemical related to engineering the SAP into the diaper is the cause of the mysterious rashes, this could be why Papers is getting a lot of flack:  With "Dry Max" P&G; claims to be using a new a powerful SAP.  So it seems plausible that Dry Max Pampers may be more likely to trigger a rash, but nobody knows for sure.I my personal experience the child with allergies Couldn't wear Pampers (only Huggies) and the child without could wear anything (Pampers included).  My best advice would be allergy prone children may be happier in Huggies but otherwise you are probably fine with Pampers.  Getting a small pack and trying them out is probably your best move.
Diapers are an essential part of the baby experience. Some folks choose more eco-friendly and cost effective options like cloth diapers but my baby's skin is extremely sensitive making cloth not an option. So I've tried the 3 big names in diapers during my decade plus of parenting. I know what I like and what I don't. I know which one worked best for my baby boy ten years ago. But not all babies are the same and not every parent's needs are either. It took forever to find the perfect diaper for my baby girl. Pampers Swaddlers, I love you.Alas, Swaddlers only go so far in size and with a crawler you do need different areas of leak protection. Enter the Cruisers. Which are great as far as leaks go. I've only experienced a couple of minor leaks and they were all night time, save for one where they diaper wasn't on properly (yay for the age they start resisting being re-diapered :P). But then Pampers had to go and start up with the Dry Max. I still had lots of the regular diapers left when they first hit store shelves so I hadn't tried them when the news began reporting babies with chemical burns and petitions, etc. Since my baby has very sensitive skin I was scared to even try them at first. Still... the time came when I was almost out of the old ones and I was afraid I'd have to switch to a less reliable brand. I got my hands on a sample and said I would put one on my baby and keep a very close eye on her for a couple of hours. Fortunately nothing unusual happened, at all.Some other consumers complained about them smelling funny and I'll admit I don't smell it. As far as them being thinner... obviously they are, since they are now packed in smaller boxes (I compared). But on the baby and under clothes I really don't notice it. I also do find they feel squishy with even a little urine so it's hard to tell if I need to change my wee one immediately or if she can wait another 15 minutes while I finish cooking dinner or whatever. I still like the Pampers over the other brands but I'm of the mind "if it's not broke, don't fix it" as far as the Dry Max is concerned. I just don't see such a big "OMG what did I ever do without these" difference in them so I honestly would have been happy with the original Cruisers.Oh! And I wanted to also note that Pampers are very true to size. If it says 16-28lbs and your kiddo falls in that range they should fit just fine.
When my baby was born I tried these and when she pooped the netting would stick to her bottom really bad and would also make a net pattern on her bottom. I was changing her immediately after going to bathroom too. It's not like she sat around in them. Also, she was a small baby and these were fitting too large on her. So I quit using them. I started using Pampers baby dry and liked them. I recently bought a package of Swaddlers size 2 because the store was out of Baby Dry and was suprised. They aren't sticking to her like they were before. I am assuming the amount of liquid or texture of her poo has changed enough that they work correctly now. I haven't tried them at daycare yet as I am afraid they may leave her in them too long and they will stick or make the net pattern again. I can only give them 3 stars because they were horrible at first and now not so horrible but still not great. At least the don't pee out of them like she does Huggies.
After reading all the negative reviews, I must say that I was very skeptical about these diapers.  However, after having used them, I can't say that they are either very good or very bad.  We've used a wide range of diapers for our two kids, and this one does the job adequately.  A small issue I have with these are that they don't seem to hold as much pee as the Cruisers, which is probably enough to cause me to look elsewhere.  Especially considering that this new line is advertised as "Dry Max". I'll stick with my Huggies and Kirkland brands.
It was very unnecessary for Pampers to come out with Dry Max technology. The previous baby dry variety were perfect. We didnt get a rash but these diapers are still weird. They are thin, have a purple tint to them, and smell sweet. All of that is so unnatural to me.They do not hold pee well at all. They get very heavy and you really need to change more often as a result. They are also inferior night time diapers. My daughter would wake up and have leaked out every day for three days onto her sheet. I really hope these go away.
These diapers are fine but they are nothing out of the ordinary or special.  My 6 month old has been wearing them for about 2 weeks now and has leaked poop a few times.  She hasn't leaked urine but they are noticeably bigger as soon as she goes.Pampers, in my mind, are supposed to be premium diapers, and these are not.  I would not buy these unless you can find them at a price that is comparable to a non-brand diaper because I don't think the perform much better.
Pampers owns a huge share of the diaper market and I guess I wonder where they did their testing and how thorough it was with regards to the complaints about leaking and redness/rashes. Compared to "older" versions this diaper is more prone to leaking, doesn't seem to fit as well, and our baby was uncomfortable when wet for any length of time. I got these to use for travel as we use cloth for every day use. When the diaper was left on the baby for several hours, his bottom was redder than with a cloth diaper or even the older Pamper models.As others have suggested--you might want to get a friend that uses them give you a few to see how compatible they are with your baby. If you look at the reviews--parents seems to have a love or hate 'em relationship with them.
I used this product on several babies and the results were mixed.  Sometimes they leaked, sometimes they held up just fine.  Some bottoms were unhappy, others were content.  On the whole, I did not find these to be in any way outstanding or improved upon from prior models.  Before investing in a case, see if you can borrow a couple to test on your child.
I have two kids and we have been a Pampers family for years.  I finally decided to try the new Dry Max diapers and I have to say I'm not impressed.Pros:-They are definitely thinner and less bulky.  The one issue I had with Swaddlers was the added bulk.-They have the same wonderful Pampers smell (I know some people hate this, but I can't put into words my love for the smell of Pampers.)-The design is cute.Cons:-They don't absorb urine anywhere near as well as the old Swaddlers.  My son's diaper has leaked all over his clothes numerous times and each time, when I take the diaper off, it is barely wet.-After the first diaper being on him overnight, I noticed his bottom was pretty red.  He isn't prone to diaper rash and doesn't have sensitive skin at all.-They are nowhere near as soft and stretchy as the original Swaddlers.-The mesh liner is gone.-They feel much cheaper.  Almost like Proctor & Gamble just slapped a new label on the Baby Dry or Luvs diapers and marketed them as a premium diaper when they really aren't.
We've always been exclusively Pamper users from the Swaddlers to the Cruisers. However, for the first time ever may end up looking for a different brand now that Pampers have changed to the Dry Max types.There appears to be problems w/ leakage and w/ blow outs, and now we're at a loss as to why Pampers cut corners on the original design of their previously excellent diapers.We are extremely disappointed in the new redesign and wished they still sold the original types of Swaddler and Cruisers.
I received these as part of the Vine program.  Prior the the Federal investigation (May 2010), my wife had heard these were causing a rash. Our friends also told us their DryMax diapers were leaking. So, we tried them sparingly and didn't notice a rash on our baby, but on the day we used them all day long, he developed redness on his bottom and between his cheeks.

I had already ordered Pampers Swaddlers with Dry Max before I heard all the media buzz about Dry Max causing major skin issues. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have tried these if I had heard all that first. My son has eczema and sensitive skin runs in the family; we cloth diaper 90% of the time, partly to avoid irritation and chemicals. However, once I had them I decided to give them a fair trial and we had absolutely no problems. In fact, these really got put to the test when a major flood knocked out one of our water plants, meaning I gave cloth diapers a break to save water. So our son was in these round the clock for several days and I saw no signs of irritation.We had no performance issues or leaks. Honestly I can't speak to ability to contain blowouts since our son's not in that phase anymore. I did notice a scent similar to baby powder when I opened the box, but it dissipated when the diapers had been in a drawer. They are thin, but didn't seem more papery or rough than what I expect from disposable diapers, and I've tried a variety of brands. As others have mentioned, I do miss the indicator strip that Swaddlers used to have, but for an older baby it's pretty easy to tell by feel anyway.I'm knocking off one star because there's no reason to love them, especially with the indicator gone. I'm knocking off the second star because of concerns about chemicals even though I didn't see irritation in my son. My suspicion is that a few babies are allergic or sensitive to something specific in these diapers. I generally avoid extra chemicals around my child when I can, so I probably won't buy them again even though I saw no problems. However, I know of lots of people who cloth diaper their children because they are sensitive to disposables in general, so I doubt whatever's going on with the Dry Max issue is really unique.
I am a mom of 3, the youngest being twenty one months old and he is a teeny guy at the waist and rump so these 2-3 diapers fit OK. I was given a pack of these diapers to evaluate for Amazon's Vine program and after a month or so of using them here is the deal vs. 7 years (almost) strict Huggies usage.Cost vs. Huggies - about 3 cents cheaper per diaper. If you use Subscribe and Save for the High Count Snug and Dry, that eliminates any difference.Comfort vs. Huggies - less absorbant and seemingly less comfortable to DS when he did have a little wetness. They don't feel as pliable.I would like to mention that Huggies has also seemed to snuck in a little less absorbing padding as of late when compared to diapers I used to put on DD almost  years ago. That certainly has not escaped my attention, seeing how I have continually had a child in diapers over this time period! However, I let the baby decide what he likes and he frequently was fidgiting at his waistline and legs while wearing these diapers. We will continue to use Huggies, but thank Pampers for the opportunity to evaluate their product.I'd also like to add that despite claims that may be out there in regards to dryness it is not wise to believe a diaper will solve diaper rash issues since they create the very environment which allows rash to thrive. The only 2 methods I ever used for rash abatement were a good 10% zinc oxide diaper rash cream and tummy time spent on an absorbant pad (preferably outside in a playpen on a nice warm day) with the baby naked and rubbed down with a little diaper rash cream. My kids have never had a rash for more than 2 days and those being attributed to antibiotic therapy. Diet is also a consideration and something to speak to your doctor about if baby has frequent rashes. ANY diaper can create or exasperate rashes under the right circumstances.
Used this for an overseas trip on the airplane at gate check. It was a tight squeeze but managed to get the stroller in. I was glad I used it because it definitely protected the stroller during the flight, both ways. By the time we arrived back, the bag was torn. It won't hold up on another trip but for the price and protection it provided, it was worth it.
Bought this because the "baby dry" gave my son the nastiest rash. I read the reviews about how the swaddlers are supposed to be "Premium" diapers. Well, I'm still not convinced yet. My little boy still has a rash, not near as bad as the "baby dry" but it's still there. On the bright side of things I have not had any leaks at all unless my son happens to sleep in and by sleeping in I'm talking about going down to bed at 7pm and sleeping in until 8:30am and then having breakfast without an immediate change. I do like the soft cotton outer shell but honestly that means nothing if the inside of the diaper is giving my son a rash. So far I'm not thrilled with Pampers. Hope they improve on the quality of the diapers because from what I'm reading this is a wide spread problem.
Take a look at all the 1-star reviews for this product. You will find that almost all of them are related to the size 3 version of Swaddlers Sensitive. Unfortunately my experience has proved the same --- the size 3 versions of these diapers are indeed (for whatever reason) different than the size N through 2 of this diaper.My daughter has been in Swaddlers Sensitive since she was born (started in size newborn). They have been great diapers for her --- rare blowouts, rare diapers rashes, and if she did have a rash it was usually easily remedied by moving up to a larger size.This all changed when we started her on Size 3 of the sensitive swaddlers. First, I found I was changing her more frequently (or at least checking her diaper more frequently) because of a horrible chemical smell coming from her diaper region. I thought it was just me --- but reading reviews here confirms that it is the diaper. For some reason, the size 3 versions emit this horrible chemical smell whenever the diaper becomes soiled with urine. Some reviewers have suspected that this is because the size 3 versions actually contain Pampers "Dry-max" chemicals. This may or may not be true, but what i do know is that something is definitely different about the size 3s versus the N-2 sizes.Second, my daughter developed a persistant rash once we started her on the size 3s. Since she had been in this type of diaper since birth, i thought maybe it was her diaper cream (we use aquaphor). We changed that to Motherlove diaper cream and the rash still persisted. The pediatrician also prescribed her some anti-fungal (nystatin) cream in case what she had was something worse than a regular diaper rash. Still no improvement. Finally we changed her diapers (to Earth's Best TenderCare diapers, size 3). Within 1 day, her rash improved and now a few days later it is completely gone. This suggests to me that it was indeed her Size 3 swaddlers that were giving her a problem.Finally, as other reviewers have noted as well, the size 3 diapers just FEEL different as well. They are thinner, not as soft, and overall feel cheaper than the size 2 versions.Bottom line -- i truly believe there is something very different in the way the Size 3 diapers are constructed. If your baby is moving up to size 3, go ahead and try these --- but just keep an eye out for any reactions and have a set of another type of diaper on hand just in case. Good luck everyone!
I had the opportunity to review Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers at the same time as the regular Swaddlers and I came away from the experience with the conclusion that the Sensitive Swaddlers aren't worth the hype. Based on our experiences with these diapers my conclusion is you are paying more money for less diapers when you choose the sensitive swaddlers.In a side by side comparison of the regular and sensitive swaddlers the diapers are essentially the same with the only difference being the color scheme of the diaper.  The sensitive diapers have muted pastel colors on the velcro strip while the regular swaddlers have a yellow background with sesame street characters.  In terms of performance these diapers are the same as well.  We didn't experience any leaks from the legs with these diapers, but we had many explosive poo up the back diapers.  We've experienced this with every brand and variety of diaper we have ever used with all three of our children and so you really can't ding the diaper design for that.  The fact that they don't leak around the legs makes them a decent diaper.I did find it rather odd that my daughter who has only ever used Pampers diapers (we usually use Baby Dry diapers) kept getting a rash while using the Sensitive Swaddlers.  We would stop using these and the rash would go away within a few hours.  After a few days in either the regular swaddlers or the baby dry diapers we would try out the sensitive diapers again and within a day or less of using them the rash would be back.  Not what you'd expect from a diaper that claims to be for babies with sensitive skin.  This makes me think that Pampers just slaps the name Sensitive on these diapers, gives you less per box and charges considerably more hoping their consumers won't notice.Bottom line: They're a decent diaper if they don't give your baby a diaper rash, but it's worth trying the regular swaddlers out first to see if they work out for your child since they're a better value.
Usually I use the regular swaddlers on my daughter since she was born which did really great.. Absorbent and no leaks at all.. then I wanted to give these sensitive diapers a try for long trips and overnight as an extra precaution to avoid diaper rash completely..I was wrong.. maybe they are mild and no fargrance with a touch of aloe and all these wonderful stuff, but in return they are not as absorbent as the regular ones, so whenever I changed her I felt her skin is more wet than usual and after 2 weeks of using them she started to develop a rash and I never leave her in a wet diaper for more than 2 hrs, I tried every cream in the market and it didn't go away.. so 2 days ago I stopped using these diapers and switched back to the regular ones and she's already getting better even when I don't apply cream with every change.. I gave them 3 stars because they have the same design and softness as the regular swaddlers and they also never leak but not good when it comes to how much absorbent they are.. would recommend the regular swaddlers over these..
I have been using Huggies, Size 1, on my 3 month old, who is unusually small -- at 10 lbs, he is in the bottom 5% for his age.  Huggies fit just fine, and I anticipate that they will for the next month or two.  I tried these Pampers through Amazon Vine -- although the hospital gave us Pampers when we left, we switched to Huggies and never looked back.I think I will stick with the Huggies.  The Pampers are a bit larger -- which may work when he gets to 12 lbs, but right now makes them a bit too big.  They especially seem big in terms of width.  They also have a deodorizing scent to them.  This may not bug you, but my little one has ultra-sensitive skin, and even though these say "sensitive", I'm suspicious of anything that comes with a scent being placed on his skin.I do like the dry weave of the diapers -- they seem to keep moisture away from his skin a big more than the Huggies.  But I haven't experienced any problems on his bottom, so I'm not worried about that.I would recommend these diapers if your baby is on the bigger side -- especially if that is true of his width, rather than length.  Also, if he has not experienced any skin sensitivity issues.
The chairs and table are not heavy enough to stay in place so they tend to slide on rug or wood floors.
We really like the table....actually, love the table...the chairs are ok, they tip easy. This is an &#34;ok&#34; set and will serve its purpose...but we use the table more than the chairs!
I am a big fan of Pampers, espically their "sensitive" products. I purchased these wipes because there was a great deal on them. I loved the thickness of the wipe. It was more helpful than other wipes. The smell was a little strong. Mixed with other smells (you know what I mean...) it would make me sick. I would still buy the Thickcare wipes just the unscented ones next time.
So I bought these thinking they would be soft and thick. Before these I was using Pampers sensitive (Very happy with pampers sensitive). These are thick just like they advertise but they feel rough and almost stiff. If you remember back to when you were a kid and when you went to the bath room the type of paper towels that they used in the restrooms...the brown, recycled...looks like the sliced it from a tree and made paper towels from it? Well that's exactly what these remind me of. I was plenty happy with the Pampers Sensitive the only thing was in my opinion they could have been a little thicker, but I'd rather use a few of those than one of these on my little boy's bottom. Not at all happy with this purchase and I will be switching back to Pampers Sensitive! I would not at all recommend this to anyone! If in doubt go buy a small pack before buying in bulk and you'll see what I'm talking about! Hope this helps!
These wipes don't clean as well as soft care or sensitive wipes. I only bought these once and that is enough for me.
These are ok but they just don't stay in place well at all but they are better than nothing. They are soft and comfortable and they do absorb well. I just wish they would stay in place better.
I've gone through a number of different disposable & washable nursing pads (my favorite disposables are the Johnson & Johnson brand, but they're getting tougher to find) and while these Lanisoh nursing pads do the job, they're not the most practical or flattering from my perspective.  Each pad is individually wrapped, which I find to be somewhat of a waste and a nuisance because that just means I need two free hands to open and slap them into place (and if I'm being honest, I've got a shortage of free hands available since the arrival of our little guy.)  Once in place, the shape of these pads is unnatural.  There's a horizontal (or vertical depending on how you put them on) line that cuts across the breast area and if you're wearing a thinner bra or nursing tank, that crease shows right through.  Still, I haven't had an issue with leakage with these, so if you're looking for something that will do what they promise to do, these definitely will do.
Pros: Individualy wrapped great for portability.Soft so does not irritate, if changed when wet.Pads mold to your shape.Thin and adhesive strips to stick to bra so no bunches.Quilted Breathable stay dry honeycomb lining with moisture lock wicks away milk and soaks up a lot like at night.Cons: Does show through thin brasDepends on bra sticky comes off cotton easy, other materials had hard time removing, self some residue.
Over the years I've tried a lot of different brands of disposable nursing pads.  Hands down, the Johnson and Johnson nursing pads have been my favorites, but you can't always find them in the store.  So in a pinch when I'm waiting for my preferred brand to be shipped to me, I'm willing to branch out and use either Avent or Lansinoh nursing pads.What I like about the Lansinoh brand is the nursing pads are individually packaged.  That makes them ideal for when you are on the go since you can just pop them in your diaper bag and not have to worry about putting them in a zip lock bag to keep them from getting spilled on by a leaky bottle or covered in crumbs from an older child's snack.  The pads are absorbent and the adhesive backing is good at keeping them from floating around in your bra.What I don't like about them is they're not as discreet looking as the ones from Johnson and Johnson.  They give you a lumpy appearance if you have a shirt on that is a thinner material.  If you're wearing a sweater or something like that you won't have an issue.
This summer our family will be taking a lot of long car trips with our toddler. We expected to be able to turn our daughter's side to forward facing (and be able to use these to keep toys within her reach) but we decided to keep her rear facing a little longer. But we went ahead and put them on the seats anyway since her toys and books have taken over our backseats. Unfortunately the pockets on these are not very secure and I worry about our daughter's safety, since in an accident all loose objects become projectiles. In a high speed impact a board book or Magnadoodle could be deadly to a small child. As someone who has lost family members in car accidents, this is something I always consider when buying anything for the car and when deciding which toys to bring along with us. I may add some velcro to the pockets to close them and keep toys and other objects from flying about in case of an accident.Honestly, not fit much can fit in the pockets, even less if if I add velcro to close them. This product was pretty inexpensive compared to other organizers, but now I wish I'd spent more money and possibly gotten a better product.
I've tried to order this twice, but both times I've gotten a notice that it is no longer available.  Looks like a great organizer.  Would love to try it out, but I guess I'll have to go with something else.
I have to put it behind the next set, my toddler just mess with it, I have to figure out how to give it better use. I would recommend it, but every mom have a different need.
I'm not really impressed with these diapers.  They are fairly absorbent, albeit a bit bulky.  The tabs do not like to stay attached, which left us chasing our two year old to readjust her diaper frequently.  At one point it just fell completely off.  We also had the tabs tear off a couple of diapers as well.  They are cheap diapers and in this case you get what you pay for.
Ok I've edited my review which was previously a rave. I see where the reviewer who described having to pull out the tab twice is coming from, and I see where the reviewer describing how easily the tabs tear is coming from. There are essentially TWO versions of this Munchkin diapers. One with stiffer tabs (better version), and the other with super stretchy tabs (terrible quality). I've purchased size NB, 1, 4, and 5 and feel they're all mixed, not a clue if the different versions are size specific or old vs new batches. The NB, 1, and 4 had stiffer tabs while the size 5 purchased most recently has the super stretchy tabs very similar to Pampers and Luvs, they tear easily because of the way the diaper is manufactured, the seams are laminated after the diaper is folded so some pieces tend to have the perforation on the tabs so when you pull them to close the diaper they can tear. This version also have tabs which are folded in twice so there's an extra step to open the diaper vs other brand diaper. The stiffer tab versions don't have to be pulled out twice and don't have the perforated seam on the tabs. Obviously I prefer the latter. As for quality, I think the stretchy tab version is just a step up from Luvs. Both versions are equally absorbent and on par with Huggies (which I feel better are more absorbent than Pampers and Luvs). Both versions have elasticized backs to help contain waste within the diaper better.As for the NB diapers, they have MESH lining, so if you're looking for a cheaper alternative to Swaddlers, this is it!
I would not use these on my babies bottom.  They are not soft and gentle.  So I just use them by the toilet for the older kids when they need that extra help.  I will not be buying agian.
These get the job done  - they aren't quilted or super thick but they work alright.  The only problem I have with them is that they have been tearing when I pull them out of the container so it makes them difficult to get out.
I wanted to like these baby wipes, but I was really not a fan of them.  They are too thick and don't wipe up well.  They don't go in the one-up containers and are a pain to get out of the box.  I ended up returning them.
So my family tried this product in two ways:1.  Diaper rash cream versus A&D; Zinc.  The A&D; Zinc wins hands down.  I think probably any specific purpose diaper rash cream will work better than BabyGanics cream.  The BabyGanics cream wasn't bad, it just didn't resolve the mild diaper rash -- not better and not worse.  The A&D; Zinc makes the rash go away quickly.2.  Hand cream for red knuckles.  Did not really help me or my wife either.  Actually, I prefer Cetaphil moisturizing cream.The BabyGanics comes out of the tube easily, not messily (reminds me of lanolin), has a very mild earthy smell (not obnoxious at all), and goes on fairly easily.  So there is not much to complain about in terms of application, just the end results could be better.
They seem smaller than the Huggies swim diapers and my 16 month old has had red rub marks where the diapers rubbed him raw in the pool. I also prefer that the Huggies say &#34;back&#34; on the diaper so you know which way to put it on. I'll switch back to Huggies in the future.
I'm not sure how well swim diapers actually work, but these do alright. We didn't notice any accidents before or after swimming.
I used them for a little while but learned quickly that they are very impractical. i just carried some water or went to the closest sink to rinse, preferably with hot water or just carried a whole bunch of pacis to replace fallen dirty ones, or clipped it to make sure it didn't drop.
My son collapses these nipples which causes him to eat slower. I am still looking for a good slow flow nipple.
We mostly used cloth diapers and wipes with our baby, but every so often life would happen (traveling, etc) and we'd switch to disposables for a time. We tried popular brands like Pampers and Huggies, and also some store brands like Target. Those always gave our baby awful rashes. We decided to try 7th Gen and we were pretty pleased. We gave these a lot of lee-way because they are chlorine free and supposedly eco-friendly. We had a lot of blow outs and leaks, but I liked that these didn't have that nasty chemical smell that a lot of diapers have. We thought these were our only option for diapers for the longest time until I did some online research. I finally found The Honest Company. They are more expensive than 7th Gen but we never had any leaks, blowouts, or other issues. For us, it was worth it.For what its worth, we used both the old and new designs and we like the new design better actually. It seemed to fit better and we did have less leaking issues.
I do like that these diapers are more organic and free of dyes and other chemicals that can cause a rash on my baby.  However, once semi-full, they become very clumpy and saggy--which makes me change them more often, which means I am going through diapers a lot quicker!  Not ideal since the price is considerably more.
Over the past year and a half or so we've tested out several different seventh generation products with our youngest.  I've noticed that in that time it seems that the quality of the diapers is getting worse as time goes by.  When we first started using these diapers they were decent enough, but now I'm noticing that they just feel cheaper and seem to leak more.  I wouldn't buy these unless I was in a pinch and there weren't any others available.  The performance and quality simply aren't there.
It's great they're natural, and produced with better components, and if that's your primary concern, then these would be great for you.However, as far as fit and absorbency go, I don't think they are as good as the more well-known brands like Huggies, Pampers, Luvs.  Of course, how your baby fits into a diaper depends on the baby.Also, these are pricier than other brands.  So if cost is of a concern to you, look elsewhere.  (Luvs are a great brand for cost efficiency!)
These diapers work just as well as Huggies and Pampers as far as absorbancy.  They, however, do get very clumpy in the crotch once they are wet.  They hold urine and bms well during the day when you change the diaper pretty quickly after, but when I put them my daughter overnight (for about 10 hours) they did leak out at the cuffs around her legs, leaving her jammies a bit damp, but not major leakage. They do not have sizes on them, which I find a little annoying especially if you have multiple kids with different sizes.They are great for environment, but that will cost you-the average price per diaper is about 37 cents, whereas their Huggies and Pampers competitors run about 22 cents per diaper and Luvs run about 17 cents per diaper (all of these avgs are based on buying the jumbo pks).  So for my family, they are not an option b/c of the fact that they are more than twice as much as the Luvs we normally use. Overall, they are normal diapersOverall, they are decent diapers, but nothing super special, however, if you're on a major campaign to go green, have some extra money, but don't want to do cloth diapers, these are a good environmental choice.
I have used the Seventh Generation overnight diapers before, so I am familiar with the differences in these diapers versus the "mainstream" diapers.  My twins have worn Pampers their entire lives because my son has allergic reactions to every other kind of diaper we have tried with him (except the 7th Generation overnights, but they leaked)but I wanted to give these diapers a try.Out of the box, these diapers didn't look like brown paper bags (like the overnights) but they were much thicker than the Pampers Baby Dry that we currently use.  There were no issues with the tabs being secure, every one so far has been securely fastened.  Once I put the diapers on the babies they each tried to pull them off, since they don't talk, I can only assume it is because they thickness of the diaper made it feel much different than what they are used to.  Within an hour both babies were wet and needed a change.  I noticed that when wet, the diapers were very "saggy" and seemed to make them uncomfortable.  I changed them, and although neither of them were very wet, the diapers were very heavy. Unlike most diapers, these don't have any of the "gel" stuff to absorb wetness and the diaper relies on layers of padding to absorb urine.  I also noticed that both babies' skin was wet, which is not something I notice with Pampers.  Because I wasn't sure how well these diapers would absorb overnight, I did not put them on the babies overnight.  However, after three days of use, my daughter had such a bad case of diaper rash I had to quit using the diapers.  She has never had this type of problem before, the only thing I can think that may have caused it is that since the diapers do not absorb as well as Pampers, her skin became irritated from the wet diaper.  I would like to note that I never left wet diapers on her for a long time, as I always change the babies as soon as I notice that they are wet.  My son, who has always had very sensitive skin, had no problems with the diapers, but I can not justify buying two different types of diapers for my babies, when there is one brand available that they can both wear.  As a result, I don't think I will be buying 7th Generation diapers in the future.  I understand the appeal of them, due to the lack of chemicals, and being environmentally friendly, but for my family, this brand will not work.
I love that these diapers don't have chlorine in them, but they were quite leaky (even when there wasn't much pee in the diaper).  Not sure if I just got a bad batch or what since I didn't have that problem with the Size 1's.
I am not impressed or turned off by these diapers.  Here are my reasonsNegatives:My baby does not seem to have sensitive skin yet after a few days of wearing these, she had small dots on her backside.  She has never had a rash like that before, but I cannot completely blame the diapers as it could have been wipes or a number of other things.These are slightly more expensive than other name brands (per diaper).  And if your baby has no issues with sensitive skin and you aren't terribly worried about components of normal diapers, then store brand ones are a lot cheaper.  (up to 15 cents cheaper per diaper)They get saggy when she is wet.  I can tell when she needs changed because she starts walking funny as her diaper has begun to droop.Positives:My baby weighs the minimum for size 4, 22 lbs and these fit her very well.  Store brand size 4s were way too big and leaked out the sides.  So these fit well around the legs and have a lot of stretch.These aren't as ugly as the other Seventh generation diapers I tried.  They aren't a weird brown color, they are white with a band around the top.  They also don't smell like the regular overnight diapers from them.I will probably stick to another brand's natural diaper, as I saw no real benefit in switching to 7th G.
I really wanted to love these diapers. I like that they are environmentally friendly and are free of chlorine. I think the current "Lorax" designs are cute (I'm a bit of a Seuss fan, so that's a plus). I have to admit I had a little bit of a hard time with these diapers. In the first week using them, my son's diaper leaked twice. I'll occasionally have maybe 2 leaks a month with the regular store brand diapers, but with these he leaked twice in one week, so that was a bit disappointing. Perhaps these don't fit his body as well as other brands. He's only 22 lbs, and well within the size range for these diapers (22-37 lbs).What I liked:*Environmentally friendly*Free of fragrance and latex*Not processed in Chlorine* Hypoallergenic (my kids tend to have sensitive skin).What I disliked:*They are a bit pricier than my regular brand.*They leaked more than my regular brand.If your main focus is a "green" disposable diaper, these are a good choice. If you're looking for a super absorbent diaper, you might need to look elsewhere. I liked them, but I can't say that I just loved them. I would probably get them again if they were on sale, but I don't think I'd spend the extra money for them.
I am using these diapers for about a month right now. My son is 16 months old and average size. I am not going to be buying these diapers again after I am done with my last package. I like that they are environmentally friendly and don't have as much chemicals as other diapers; however, I don't like the fit, and especially the tabs. They also lack padding in the back. The main reason why I don't like these diapers are the tabs. They are too small and come off easily. Overall, they are OK diapers, but there are other environmentally friendly brands, that are better for similar if not lower price. I will come back to Nutured by Nature or Earth's Best diapers.
My 9 month-old niece, like most babies, suffers from diaper rash from time to time. My environmentally-conscious sister prefers to diaper her in cloth, but occasionally has to switch to disposables for short periods to help clear up her rashes. Both Pampers and Huggies have worked well for this purpose - my niece's rashes seem to be triggered by wetness against the skin rather than perfumes or chemicals - but Seventh Generation diapers haven't done the job.The look, feel, and fit of these diapers is great. The problem for us is the lack of absorbancy... whatever Seventh Generation uses for filler just doesn't seem to suck up liquid as completely as other disposables do, and that means more rashes instead of fewer. I've tried avoiding this by changing my niece more frequently, but I've found that even when the diaper itself is only barely wet, my niece's skin is still damp. I love the concept of this product, and I'm sure it would be wonderful for children sensitive to chemicals rather than wetness, but it just hasn't worked for us.
In one pack, I had problems w/ leakage for my twins about 5 times. I change my babies diaper often and there shouldn't have been any problem w/ overflow. However, occasionally there would be leakage during large bowel movements. On other products such as Pampers, Kirklands, Luvs, and etc I would rarely get any type of leakage. The problem was the absorption, it didn't seem to be able to handle much. I had to change extremely often to prevent overflow. Because the absorption was a bit slow, my babies ended up getting a bit of a diaper rash.Functionally, the diaper worked ok most of the times, even though visually it looked like a recyled brown paper bag as a diaper. Honestly, I would neiter buy nor recommend this product at all. It's best to keep to the brands you know. The pros of this product aren't worth the cost and the hassle of the leaky mess.
We used Seventh generations diapers for my baby before, when he was just a few months old, and didn't like them. They were leaking, and the velcro band was stiff and dug into my baby's flesh. Now he is 18 months old, and I found that they changed the diapers, so I wanted to give it another try. Now I see they added some gel to the core. My baby usually uses Pampers Cruisers or Swaddlers Sensitive, since they are now available in size 4, too. I compared the Cruisers with Seventh Generation, and this is what I found. They have roughly the same size, but the Seventh Generation definitely are thicker and bulkier. I filled one of each kind of the diapers with tap water to see how much they absorb. They both did pretty good job. After waiting a few moments I pressed on the diapers from the inside as if a baby sat in a wet diaper. Pampers was OK, but Seventh generation had water come right back through the lining and pool around my finger. I repeated the test after some more time, and then both of them were a bit damp to the touch, but no water was coming out. I lifted both diapers and shook them, and the Seventh Generation diaper had all its stuffing crumble to the bottom, whereas Cruiser's stuffing appeared to be intact.Then I put the Seventh Generation diaper on my baby. Again, as it happened before, the stiff velcro was trying to get to him. I was able to secure it so both top and bottom of it was covered with folded diaper lining. The next diaper change my baby was too excited for me to fumble with that, so I had to use Cruiser on him again. Also, the velcro on the diaper does not stick as well as on the Cruisers, and you need to flatten the area you want to apply it too, which is not very funny when your baby objects diaper change and tries to escape.As expected after my "lab" testing, when diaper became wet, it sagged badly almost right away, hanging low between my baby's legs. And it started to smell. Pampers uses some kind of strong fragrance to cover the smell of the gel, I guess that is why they do it.I didn't risk putting this diapers on my baby for night time, since he sleeps 12 hours, and I do not appreciate waking up for changing his sheets at 2 am, as I had to do when I first used Seventh Generation diapers. I did use it for nap time though with no leaks.The funny thing is that the diaper's brownish color comes not from them using unprocessed or unbleached material, but from a dye, as it states on the packaging. So much for natural color.Overall, I would say it is a decent diaper for being chlorine-free unscented and such, but not as user-friendly as Pampers. If my baby was allergic to pampers diapers, I would definitely get Seventh Generation for him.
I really like the neutral look of this diaper and the fact that it is natural, sustainably produced and safe for my baby. It worked as well as any other diaper I have tried (pretty much every brand), except for when it came to overnight protection. My son woke up halfway through the night soaked. These diapers work great for daytime, with an average amount of changes. Overnight with this diaper I would not recommend.
These diapers are amazingly absorbent for their smaller, less bulky size.  However, they can't compare to standard brand diapers such as Huggies as they are more prone to leaking.  They seem to work fairly well for a couple of hours, but leak during overnight use.  They are fine diapers, but are not worth the extra expense over standard diapers unless the "green" factor is very important to you.
If you can swallow the price to take care of our environment and keep unnecessary chemicals away from baby tushies, then these diapers work well with only one caveat.  The diapers hold plenty, even overnight.  The one annoying bit is that the tabs start too far back, which means digging the tabs out from under the baby.  You can get in the habit of opening the tabs before putting the diaper down, but it's still an extra step.
When looking at disposable diapers you have a lot to consider.  Depending on your baby, one brand may work better for you than others.  I personally prefer to use Pampers vs. other brands, but I gave these diapers from Seventh Generation a shot.  This diaper is supposed to be free of chlorine, which would likely explain the tea stained color of the diapers.  The diaper is also supposed to be good for babies with sensitive skin.  Having a child with sensitive skin, I can certainly say that the lack of chemicals that can cause rashes is a nice touch.What I like about this diaper is the overall softness and the gusset across the back of the diaper which is nice for keeping explosive diapers from shooting up the back.  What I don't like about the diaper is the stretch tabs that seem cheap and similar to that of some store brand diapers.  I'm not very fond of the color of these diapers, but I can't say I like seeing characters on my child's diapers either like I do on our usual brand.  I also think this diaper feels a little cheap.  Perhaps when compared to other "green" diapers this one is above average, but given that I typically use Pampers, I wouldn't know.  Also, this diaper uses a wood pulp material (like Huggies) as opposed to a chemical agent for wicking away moisture (like Pampers).  That is why a child with sensitive skin is likely to experience less rashes while using this diaper.These diapers are ok, but I don't know if they're worth the cost.  I suppose it all boils down to personal preferences and how well they work for your baby.
I loved the NB but now that we're size 2, they don't have a good of a fit anymore.  My son constantly has blowouts (he's 13lbs).  This morning, I found something weird in one of the diapers...looks like a piece of cardboard 2"x1" long inside the lining!I've written to them so I'll update if I hear back but it makes me wonder how such a large piece of debris got stuck there (see photo)
I have tried these as well as Earth's Best Size 2 Diapers. My daughter is six months old, just under 14 pounds, and is about 27 inches tall. I change her diaper every 1-2 hours.The Earth's Best leaked ALL THE TIME (forget using them overnight)! They were also scratchy feeling. My daughter had a permanent red mark on her back (even though I used non-petroleum jelly on the spot with every change), where the top of the diaper was scratching her. I read a few other reviews that noted the same issue. We also had MAJOR problems with blowouts.The Seventh Generation Size 2 diapers also leak, but only after about four hours (found out on one long road trip). My daughter sleeps for 8-12 hours at night, and they always leak overnight. We've tried not giving her a bottle for up to two hours before bedtime. She has a bottle every four hours, so we adjust her feeding schedule so that she doesn't eat right before bed. We always change her right before we put her to bed. None of it makes a difference. They leak and that's all there is to it. She also has a permanent diaper rash. These got three stars, instead of one or two, because we rarely have issues with blow-outs.We switched to cloth diapers. See my profile page for my other reviews.
I was not impressed with these diapers. I did like that they are good for the environment but thats about it. The overall color looks dirty. and they leak and messy. They do not look nice under a little girls dress, unless you add the bottoms..My daughter did not get a rash but it just wasnt for me.
Obviously, there is an expected trade-off when one is going to pursue a bit more environment friendly sort of diaper, and when I say environment I also mean the environment of the baby, trying to avoid chemicals or other elements that might contribute to issues, or at least are worrisome.So, with a bit more peace of mind often comes a bit less convenience. That's how these diapers end up being. No, they're not as good as thePampers Swaddlers Diapers Economy Pack Plus Size 1, 234 Count (Packaging May Vary), for all kinds of reasons already listed.  These have a bit less leak protection and otherwise just don't seem as entirely helpful.But, the fact is they're more convenient than cloth also. We live in a place where there seems to be perpetual water shortages and in general using water to wash diapers is more of a concern than the landfills (there's lots more land than fresh water).  So, this is a tradeoff.  Maybe not an all the time tradeoff, though, as I could see doing more half and half, a bit of peace of mind with a bit of ultra-convenience.Do I recommend these? Well, if you're the sort who wants to be more friendly to the environment, and that includes watching your water usage, then sure.  As an equivalent substitute?  No.
These diapers are geared for people who want to be green and think these diapers are going to save the planet.  There is something on the package that says to flush the solid poop down the toilet to prevent the landfills from being filled up.  Who are we kidding?  The poop will be gone way before the diaper will!  And where do they think things go when they are flushed down the toilet?As far as the actual diapers go, these are ok.  These are not even close to nighttime diapers as far as dryness goes.  In fact, don't be surprised if you find these diapers keep your baby less dry than other brands.
better for girls than boys. they don't feel as thick and plush as the typical name brand diapers. These are nothing fancy, no gimmicks, but they work ok and are much better for the baby's skin and environment.
not a great diaper and definitely overpriced. I will stick with cloth diapers and pampers for the night time for now
These are good diapers, they work well fine as pull-ups in the fact that they are easy for a child to pull up and down, the place they fail is in their absorbency. They are okay, but I would only recommend these once your child is well on his way to potty training success. They are not super absorbent in that they will not keep away accidents as well as a normal diaper. While it's great that these are more environmentally friendly, I still prefer Pampers to these diapers.
I picked these up for my son who still wets the bed when he sleeps.  Overall, I'm not very impressed.  They don't seem to leak, but it's like there isn't enough absorbent material so a lot of liquid ends up caught in the sides.  Every time he has worn them, his sides have been soaked to the point where my hands are wet with urine after helping him get out of the training pants.  This is a big negative for me.  Less important is the ugly factor.  My daughter walked in and saw him in one of the training pants the first day and her first words were, "What is that?"  When I told her it was like a Pull Up, she said, "Well, that is one fugly Pull Up."  I kind of agree.  Plus, the cover is so dark, you can't really even see the Lorax print.  But, looks are minor compared to the extreme wetness on his sides.  That is a deal breaker.
I can't quite recommend this product because for the price and quantity I'd rather go for a different product.It's an ok product, but my twin boys had lots of leakage issues. It is nice and soft, but I definitely wouldn't travel using these.Overall, not a product I will use again.
Those training pants were smaller then the same size pull-ups and easy-ups, and were much stiffer. They barely fit on my 35 lbs son. He only wore those a few times because of the fit, and didn't have any accidents in them, so I do not know if they leak.It ticks me off how they dye their diapers and training pants brown to show that they didn't bleach them. Why? The pants look dirty and it is extra step that requires extra energy, that is going to waste. It is not Earth-friendly.The training pants also sealed on the sides unlike the other brand, that can be opened almost like a diaper. So, if your child has a BM in the pant, you have no way to seal the mess. And if you need a change you will have to remove shoes and pants, and we all know how toddlers like that.
We have gotten a few different Seventh Generation Diaper products to review and have given them all one-star reviews except for this one. Our problem is that our daughter drinks a lot and pees a lot and so far every seventh generation diaper has had almost 100% leakage. These survived nap-time use but failed consistently with night-time in urine-volumes that the Pampers or Huggies could survive. Nevertheless, for smaller-volume urination seventh generation did well.I don't understand the draw of these. Basically, they are chlorine bleach free. I don't have any data that use of a chlorine-bleached diaper offers any negative health implications to your child. Other than that, these aren't more environmentally friendly than the other brands, they are more expensive, and they are inferior in quality. So while they work fine in some circumstances, I just don't understand why you wouldn't just buy the Huggies or Pampers alternative. After trying three Seventh Generation products, based on our experiences, we will be sticking with Pampers (and to a lesser degree Huggies).
I bought these for my 36 lb 3 yr old and they were a tad big on him so we had some leaks. I figured the size smaller would be too small but maybe I should have gone with them. My sons skin is very sensitive and they are great for that reason.
I got these as a free sample through Amazon Vine. They fit just fine on my very tall 3 year old and she seems comfortable in them. As far as quality, they don't seem to rip easily, which is good. But they do not hold much at all, even compared to other pull up brands, so if your child has an accident and their bladder was more than just a little full, expect a full wardrobe change. I have found other brands, particularly the Safeway store brand, to be better in this regard. Definitely wouldn't use these overnight, which is annoying because when you are potty training that is the main time you want coverage. The worst thing about these though is the price. I think they are way too expensive, and wouldn't have ever bought this brand if it hadn't been given to me free, because of that.
Potty training a little one with severe latex and fragrance allergies leaves us with few options for pull-up training pants.  I'd love to switch to cloth training pants, but daycare won't have any part of that!I appreciate that these are free of latex, fragrance, and chlorine (although you pay a premium for them).  But their absorbancy isn't as great as some of the competitors.  And the color of the pants (which does not bother me), has led to a bit of jealousy (as in, the little one would prefer the Dora or Princess design the other kids have at daycare, even though she doesn't watch the shows).  But we are managing to turn that into a positive..."big girl" undies with characters on them are the reward when potty training is finished.All in all, they work for us, because we have special concerns.  But I think the manufacturing could improve on the design and absorbancy.
Out of the package, I did not notice a smell from these pull-ups that some people noticed.  They are the same brown color as the 7th Generation diapers, and have the Lorax design that the diapers has.  Like the diapers, these training pants seem to run small, which could have pros and cons.  On the up side, the smaller sizes have more pants per package, so you "get more" for your money.  On the down side, I have discovered that when the diaper/pants gets a little snug, you have more leaks.  I have found the diapers/pants to run one size smaller, for example, when my twins wore size 3 Pampers, I had to use size 4 7th Generation.  These training pants tend to feel "stiff" on the outside, but the inside was comparable to national brand pull-ups.  The elastic around the legs was not very "tight" so there were a few leakage issues, but nothing major.  After using the 7th Generation training pants, as well as  diapers, I must say that I feel they are on par with Pampers or Huggies.  If the "enviromentally friendly" aspect is important to you, then you may feel strongly about purchasing these training pants.  However, if you are a parent who is watching your budget, I believe you will be just as happy with other (less expensive, but not inferior) brands of training pants.
It's okay.  That's a great way to put it.  I like the Seventh Generation approach and prefer a better material, however, this really does seem to leak more, causing us to think about the whole process more than we'd like.  If you're especially particular about the lack of chemicals or other potential manufacturing additives, then these might be a good choice. Otherwise, and for us, we're not dealing with a sensitive baby and so can put up with other brands for the sake of their better leak protection.
As much as I wanted to like these, because my daughter adores the Dr. Seuss characters, I just can't. They don't fit well around the bum making for frequent wedgie picks.By day they're perfectly suitable for potty training in that they're easy to get up and down and absorb enough moisture for between potty time accidents. But as a nighttime product... UGH! We only used it once for this because the one and only time she woke me up in the wee hours crying because she was wet. I figured she was just wet... not completely soaked from neck to knees. And the training pants barely had any liquid in them. I was really unhappy with that and I haven't found an overnight training pant from Seventh Generation to try.Overall, I'd probably go a size above my usual if I were to try them again. I just wasn't impressed.
I hate to just copy another one of my reviews, but as I found both these and the overnight diapers we tried pretty similar- I have to say pretty much the same thing:While I love the idea of using a diaper that is better for the environment, I also want one that works well. These were fine, but we did have a couple leaks. While I know the grey color is due to the fact that they are not bleached and therefore better for the environment, it just gave the effect of dingy-ness and there was a slightly off scent to these.In addition, I couldn't help but wonder how much more natural and environmentally friendly they actually are. I have not done any research, so I can't speak to this with much authority, but the overall feel was pretty similar to a standard disposable diaper which made me wonder.Lastly, the cost is simply a little off-putting. In general, you can get standard Luv's, Huggies or generics for half to 2/3 the cost of these. If I was a little wealthier, I'd probably be more inclined to research how much better they are, but as I am a working mom with not that much disposable income I am going to stick to the presumably less nature friendly disposables for now.The one difference and positive I will say about the training pants and opposed to the overnights, the side elatic was quite soft and definitelty a plus.
I've had kids in diapers and training pants for the past 8.5 years. We pretty much have our favorites, but I'm always up for improvement.These Seventh Generation Training pants were not horrible, and they do have the draw of being free from dyes and they are certainly soft and comfortable. The issue is, we found, is they leaked more readily than our Pampers training pants.If you want hypoallergenic diapers, these will not displease. If your focus is leaking (which has to be mine with a 3 year old) then I suggest looking at the other name brands first.If Amazon granted half stars, these would be 3.5.
I dont have any problem with the product or its effectiveness, because I feel that it cleaned my baby very well. However, I stopped using it after a couple of weeks, because the scent was not what I wanted. I like that fresh out of the bath smell on my baby, not strong, but a little sweet,and after washing with this, it was like I hadnt used soap at all.I switched to my trusty Johnsons, and now love my baby's fresh smell after his baths!
This contains fragrance and a bunch of other chemicals that aren't safe for baby. That said, it did clean well. I just wish you didn't have to spend a fortune to buy baby wash that doesn't have so many chemicals.
***update***we went through about a box and a half of these. i love everything about it except that it keeps leaking the absorbent gel. at least half the time, i find little gel beads all over my son's private parts, which is a total deal breaker for me. we never had this problem in 2 years in pampesr. i like these a lot and want to keep using them but i'm switching back to pampers until they fix the gel problem. i did call huggies to tell them about the issue. we'll see if anything changes anytime soon.original review:i recently started thinking about potty training my son and got a few different types of training diapers to see how they were. i've been using pampers since the day my son was born--i tried many different types of diapers but like pampers the best. huggies just didnt seem to fit him as well, but i tried the slip ons bc i really didnt like the pull up/easy up options. i like the huggies slip ons the best and this is why:- i try to minimize the amount of chemicals/fragrances that touch my baby's skin (bc it's not good for them) and i found that both the pull ups and easy ups have a very strong fragrance to them. pull ups also have a cooling feature, which i dislike even more. we dont need the smells, coolness and pictures to know that my little guy has gone peepee. the slip ons function similarly to pull ups/easy ups but with less of the "extra" stuff we don't want.- i really like that you can pull these up and down, or you can pull apart the sides and put them on like traditional diapers. i'm trying to get my son used to the idea of pulling his undies/diapers up and down at the potty but sometimes he won't have any of it and will protest (furiously). the resealable tabs at the side are exactly what we need.- we ran out of pampers cruisers so i put these on at night and we didnt have any leaks. we usually do leak at night but these held up--i was very pleasantly surprised.- this is a pretty minor point, but i like the tigger pictures much better than the pull ups/easy ups. my son likes tigger too.
These slip ons are easy to get on and off but the fit isn't the best. I only use them during the day when it's easier to use a slip on for my very active 20 month old.
I usually cloth diaper, but I'm not opposed to using disposables.  I began using these when my daughter was 18 months old and was wearing size 4.There are times when you really don't want to lay your baby down for a diaper change.  Before trying these, I'd usually bring my baby out to the car for changes - or would fumble around changing her while she was in her stroller.  I also keep a small supply of these in my storm shelter.  When we're trapped in there during severe weather, there isn't a decent place to otherwise change a diaper.  These are nice as they come off easily and another can simply be slipped on.I also find these useful when my little one is completely congested with a cold.  When she's tired or sensitive, she tends to become distraught during diaper changes.  Crying and laying flat for a change worsens congestion, so I'm happy to have any product that minimizes discomfort.I know that these diapers aren't designed for night or nap time - but it would still be nice if these diapers wouldn't leak when my baby is lying down.  I wouldn't ever purposefully put one of these diapers on her for her to sleep in, but I need to take precautions if I think she may fall asleep in the car.  (By precautions, I mean that I put a wool diaper cover over these.)  I just think that a diaper shouldn't be completely useless if your baby happens to be laying down.  Sometimes my daughter seems to be irritated by the side tabs on these.  They're not particularly soft.  It may be because my daughter is just used to wearing cloth, but even so - it feels rougher than other diapers.All in all, I like to have a small pack of these on hand - but these wouldn't be something that I'd use on a daily basis.
Slightly smaller than Sassy Bags.  Therefore they do not fit into the Rubbermaid little garbage cans that we keep next to our changing stations.  Otherwise these are great!
We normally used cloth diapers and wipes, but when we were traveling and certain circumstances we used disposable diapers and wipes. We tried Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes before trying these, but they caused a rash. These were not as bad, but we did notice that they were super wet. You have to let baby's bottom dry before putting on a diaper (the wetness is what causes a rash, since bacteria and/or yeast reproduces in warm, dark, moist places) and the unnecessary wetness of these wipes was annoying. There's no reason for them to be so wet to get the job done.These are okay in a pinch, but we prefer The Honest Company or Seventh Generation wipes.
I prefer the sensitive thick care, but couldn't find them on amazon.  These work fine, I just prefer the added thickness between my hand and the crap I'm wiping off my baby's bum.  These ones are kind of thin.  And while I have never had one tear, it just grosses me out a bit-even though I'm on baby #5.
These wipes work well but they tend to shed. There will be little fibers from the wipes on my baby's bottom. I'll be switching back to Huggies wipes.
I have all three wipes: Pampers Natural Clean, Pampers Baby Fresh, and Pampers Sensitive.-Pampers Sensitive is more solid like white paper. Natural Clean and Baby Fresh have more holes in them (Natural Clean has the most holes in it).-All of the wipes have a nice stretch to them.-All three were at times difficult to remove from the provided resealable pack. You have to be sure to push down on the other wipes, otherwise you'll get the entire ream of wipes at once. And you know how annoying this is when you're changing a diaper with one hand and pinning down a child with the other. (For whatever reason this occurs with most other wipes that come from their own pouch instead of a refill box).My favorite among the three Pampers Wipes are the Sensitive Wipes: a solid wipe, good stretch, and no scent.**UPDATE: Of all three Pampers Wipes the Sensitive Wipes are the only ones that do not have the silky feel and slip and slide when you are changing poop causing you to 1. use more wipes than necessary, and 2. get poop on your hands. If you typically useHuggies Natural Care Fragrance Free Baby Wipes Refill, 648 Count (Packaging may vary)and are considering a switch, you will not like these wipes as much. However, compared to the other two Pampers Wipes, these are the better choice. Pampers Sensitive has a little better bottom grip when cleaning poop, but it's still not as durable as a Huggies wipe.
I like that these are great for long nights, however i still have to double up the diaper. I am going to play with the diapers a little longer to see how they hold up.
I have been trying quite a few nighttime diapers and haven't come across one that doesn't leak or actually does hold all night. which includes this product...the only possible explanation might be that my daughter likes to sleep on her side a lot, so maybe at some point all of these diapers dont seem to absorb anymore what comes from this angle.but I think that they are not formfitting enough around the legs (even though my baby is considered big which should make it easier :)
I will jump on the bandwagon and complain about the redesign of this product.  I've been using Huggies overnights for years, and they used to be so great and the perfect solution.  I remember they were noticeably thick and never leaked.  Now honestly the only reason that I can tell the difference between this and the regular Huggies is the pattern.  Its not any thicker.  And my baby is a heavy wetter so we've had SO many leaks at night that I'm really frustrated.  Yes it helps to get a size up, but even that only helps a little bit.  Anyone have any suggestions for another brand to try?SO, if you are looking at these reviews, make sure to only look at RECENT reviews.  Don't go by the "raves" that are from 3 years ago.  (One of them may have been mine!).
This is a big diaper and good for overnite. But the diaper  could have been a bit softer and smoother. Also it does leak sometimes. But this is relaible than regular pampers.
