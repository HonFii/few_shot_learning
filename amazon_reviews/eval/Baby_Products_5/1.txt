I use Pampers Swaddlers now because this diapers indication is the smell of urine or stool.  Also, the urine or stool tends to leak from the sides or straight through.  These diapers were cheap for a reason.
I bought these as well as Huggies Snug & Dry in size 1-2 to use after my baby outgrew newborn size diapers. I used the Huggies fist because I heard that they ran a little smaller. I like them just fine but I heard so many good things about Swaddlers and saw so many commercials that I was really looking forward to using these. The only good thing about them is that they are softer than some other diapers. Other than that, I might as well be diapering my daughter with two layers of toxic toilet paper. Firstly, these diapers last for about an hour with my daughter. As soon as she pees I can both feel it through the diaper as well as SEE IT! The diaper lets the color of the pee show through and it turns yellow! SO I can feel the warmth and wetness of urine through the diaper almost as soon as I put in on her, no matter how much she pees. Secondly, these diapers smell good when you put them on but as soon as there is a little moisture there is a sickening chemically smell that emits from them. So, literally all day long, my daughter smells like urine and chemicals! Thirdly, my daughter formed a diaper rash immediately after she started using these(Triple Cream diaper ointment helped). Also, I started using the 252 count a week and a half ago and over half of it has been used already! ZERO ABSORBANCY. What a waste of money. From now on I'm only buying Huggies. Pampers has made an AWFUL first impression. Do not believe the hype!Edit: I always change my baby when she's wet, yet the smell is always there and it get on my daughter's clothes. I have to change her every hour to an hour and a half. Huggies diapers actually keep my baby dry PLUS there is no smell. PAMPERS DIAPERS ARE OBSOLETE.
So.... Pampers.  Where do I begin?  Well, to start, these are pretty much the most expensive diapers and you will rarely find a coupon available.  Hospitals use them, so obviously they're the best, right?  WRONG.  We started with Newborn size and quickly had to switch to Size 1.  He would leak out of them almost immediately.  And trust me, we change him often!  So Size 1.  Well.... besides the occasional nightly urine leak, they started leaking again - when he was right around 11 lbs.  Now, the box clearly states that they should work up to 14 lbs and my child is incredibly lean, so it's not like I'm stretching the diaper to fit around a big belly or anything.  But no.  We had to switch him to size 2 diapers at 11 lbs - which were enormous on him.  Should probably have switched him around 10 lbs - would have saved me some disgusting stinky laundry and a few items that simply went into the trash.Not to be gross, but let's get one thing straight..... I am not talking about urine leaks.  Nope.... we weren't that lucky!  They leaked poo - it flowed out of the leg holes like lava - both sides.  Sometimes only one side, but usually both.  I can't wrap my head around this.  We did everything correct.  Ruffles out, interior liner in place.... equipment pointed down, we fastened these diapers so tightly too after this started happening - to the point where the sticky tabs overlapped each other (a lot) and we kept them low.... but they still leaked.I am so super annoyed with Pampers.  I thought I was buying the best product, and in turn, I was basically throwing money away.  After this, I returned the last big box I bought and went to Target and bought every kind of diaper there that I could get my hands on - Luvs, Up & Up, Huggies Little Snugglers, and Huggies Snug & Dry.  So far, we only had one leak with a size 1 Luvs diaper.  We are currently using Huggies Little Snugglers and have had no leaks.And might I also point out that I believe Luvs & Pampers are made by the same company.... and while Luvs feel much cheaper, we find that they absorb more of the mess.  And for the price, Pampers should have that elastic in the back like Huggies and Up & Up both have.  I am so disappointed with Pampers Swaddlers.  I do intend on trying Cruisers when we reach Size 3, but buyer beware.... if you think that by purchasing the most expensive diaper you're buying the best diaper, I have to break it to you - you're definitely NOT - you're just paying for the name "Pampers" on the box!
I really liked swaddles size 1 but now I am using size 3 and they leak every-time my son poops and many times when he pees. This was the last time I used Pampers brand. The back of the diapers lacks padding. It thin like a sheet of paper. When my baby poops, it is all over his back and sometimes shoulders. I do not recommend these diapers.
I usually buy the Cruisers but decided to try these.  They leak and everything gets wet--even the slightest amount of liquid leaks out!
This are horrible for newborns. We had one on and not only did it leak through the diaper, but her clothes, blanket, and on to what she was sitting on. So gross. I won't buy these again. This is what I would expect from a cheap knockoff brand not a name brand. Don't make the mistake of buying this for a newborn.They also don't have the indicator strip, so you have to open to see which is frustrating for a newborn. Pay a little more for swaddlers or huggies because they are a waste of money. I'm donating them to a shelter or something because we can't use these.
This is the worst diaper we ever tried. After my 20 months old daughter go to bad (changing diaper at 9pm) we have to change it at around 4am, otherwise she (her outfit, bad and comforter) will be totally wet by the morning. We had no other diaper with such an experience. During daytime it is even worse, sometimes it start letting thru everything after few hours. We use 5-7 diapers a day whereas we needed only 3-4 from cruisers. This simply have not enough absorbent to stay dry for 12 hours (as advertised)
People kept telling me to try Pampers because they hold a lot of pee.  We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink.  I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change.  We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on.  I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right.  It says these are good for 12 hours.  Not for us!  They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder.  My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell.  Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad.  I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never. Again.
I ve always been a pampers user.. used cruisers size 5 for my son 2 yrs old and 32 lbs and they were great at daytime and used huggies overnight at bedtime...my husband got a giant box of these by mistake from a store , they were cheaper so I decided to give them a try.. BAD DECISION.. not soft at all and they leak after one hour of wearing them, terrible.. and they are smaller than cruisers so they don't fit well.. DO NOT BUY
I am a huge Pampers Swaddlers fan, but I have switched back and forth between Pampers and Huggies when each is on sale. In size 3, the only kinds of each that you can get in this quantity is the Baby Dry (Pampers) and Snug and Dry (Huggies) after trying both, I have to say Huggies wins HANDS DOWN.  The quality of the Huggies is thicker, softer, and have an easier to cinch in fit, just a better made product overall. I was actually shocked when I received these, they were THIN, so thin that there's no way they can stop leaks. The box of Baby Dry I received was also made in Mexico vs. all Pampers I've bought in local stores are all made in the U.S. so I don't know if that has anything to do with the quality I received. Regardless, I will not be purchasing again because of the quality. I am so surprised that Pampers sells such a poor quality product. Luvs are better than these. Never again.
I purchased this before my baby was born, intending to use this exclusively with my baby after hearing friends say this was the best diaper cream and seeing all the great reviews for this cream online. Good thing I received a ton of other diaper creams at my baby shower, since Butt Paste did not work for us at all.I began using it to prevent a rash, by putting it on baby's bottom at night. I started to notice some redness and started putting it on her during the day as well, thinking that maybe I wasn't putting it on thick enough at night. That made it even worse! I stopped using it altogether and the rash went away completely in 24 hours. I believe it was caused by Butt Paste all along. I threw it out right away and never used it again.
These were not near as thick as the fading design ones. They leaked constantly, every single one. I called Kimberly Clark myself and they sent me a gift card with my purchase amount on it. There is a difference between these and the fading design ones
Being a graduate student in pharmaceutics, I've learned to look up studies on ingredients before using products with them. The American Association of Pediatrics recommended in 1960 that pediatricians avoid using boric acid and it's use in hospital nurseries was discontinued then."Boric acid is known to present dangers to babies, but it is included in such products as Boudreaux's Butt Paste (2). Nonfat dry milk and goat's milk are inexplicably included in such products as The First Years Bottom Care Diaper Rash Relief System and Canus Li'l Goat's Milk Ointment. Tea tree oil is found in Bum Boosa Bamboo Diaper Rash Ointment and California Baby Non-Burning & Calming Diaper Area Wash. Although they also contain zinc oxide, miscellaneous plant ingredients are found in Aveeno Baby Soothing Relief Diaper Rash Cream, Aveeno Baby Organic Harvest Diaper Rash Cream, Balmex Diaper Rash Cream, and Puristics Baby Zinc Oxide Diaper Rash Cream (11)."The link for this paragraph is on the uspharmacist website, but this isn't letting me post the whole thing. If you copy and paste the above quote into google, you'll be able to find the article about it.This cream may work very well as others say, but you have to balance your benefits and risks to decide whether you want to use it. I used it before on my daughter until I read a few articles about the harmful effects of boric acid on infants. Then, I threw it away. If they decide to remove boric acid, I may try it again. Until then, NO WAY!
I did not like this product for couple of reasons. First it dried the top wipe completely. Second the plug was getting so hot that I was afraid it may cause fire. The bottom line is that you don't actually need a wipe warmer. You can warm the wipe in your hand in seconds and your baby will hate diaper changes or anything that wakes him up anyway. Spend the money on some toy.
I have heard nothing but good things about triple paste but it didnt work for us. It actually made her rash worse. I'm pretty disappointed. I really want to like it because its not as sticky or difficult to wipe off as desitin. But ultimately desitin actually heals her rash while this doesn't
i usually buy huggies brand but they were out of stock.so i thought id try these ,bad mistake.i was putting them on my toddler and one side tore half way off.this happens everytime i put them on him.there is no velcro on the sides,everytime they have to be changed i have to undress my son,which is not good when you have to do it in a public bathroom with theyre filthy floors.these leak like crazy,also when my son pulls them down the rest of the training pants tears off,so even if they werent full they have to be changed again,which means i have to undress him yet again.
We used to love the old calendula cream. It worked beautifully on my son's dry skin and eczema. His doctor recommended Aquaphor, which we use, but this stuff worked even better. I was blown away by how wonderfully this cream worked, and otherwise would not have paid so much for a tiny tub of cream. They recently changed the formula and is now TERRIBLE. It smells really bad too, sort of like particle board (it's like that smell when you first bring home Ikea furniture!). I'm really disappointed and a bit sad that they ruined such a great product. I hope CA brings back the old formula.
I used this day 2 after breastfeeding my newborn because I had a bad latch causing my nipples to be sore. The smell for me was pretty strong and I didn't like it very much, but I used it anyway. It isn't feel like it helped with the soreness after using it after every feeding (and in between feelings) for a few days. It seems more like a lube to use right before feeding to help baby slide to get a better latch. But my daughter didn't enjoy the smell cause she would make a sour face and release her latch.I had a sample of the Lansinoh cream and it made me feel better almost right away. The soreness went down after I used it and tried to feed her. It's a bit thick but it has no smell to it that will make my daughter not want to feed.I would recommend getting the Lansinoh nipple cream instead.
These are not practical because you cannot wash them.  If they get breast milk on them that is so gross.
HATE IT DRYS BABIES SKIN OUT NOT GREAT FOR ALL BABIES WOULD NOT EVER BUY. DO NOT RECOMMEND. TRY DOVE.
I happened to receive a box of these for free and thought, well, they are worth using since they are free....no way. The first one I used, leaked badly. The second one leaked. They feel strange, real thin shell and lots of loose beads inside and there is too much material bunching between the legs. They are so droopy and saggy even without urine in them that she will pull at them and complain. I couldn't even finish the package. After several leaks, and I'm not talking multiple urinations in the same diaper because I change every single time she goes. I gave up on them. They are stuck away in the closet just in case I run out of better diapers.
Luvs diapers with Leak Protection are far more INFERIOR than Target's cheapest Up & Up brand. Minutes after having the diaper on my daughter, she's sitting on my lap & suddenly I get peed on. Barely a half hour after having the diaper on, the dang thing splits apart and absorbent crystals were falling all over my carpeted floor with every crawling motion she made. I never know when the diaper will split & explode. The diaper may or may not last through the night before splitting & causing a mess inside the pajamas or all over the mattress. After having footless pajama leggings on my daughter one night, the next morning I discovered the absorbent gel crystals all over her mattress. This is a serious safety concern. My daughter is only 22 lbs; her size 4 diapers are for 22-37 lbs. In addition, they just had a sudden price change...What's going on here? First I wasn't able to subscribe to Amazon Moms then I was. After making my order they have a price increase. Target's Up & Up brand has the same problems with splitting but not near as bad as Luvs which advertises Ultra LeakGuard. What a CROCK! At least Up & Up brand makes no such claim. I'm switching brands.
I'm generally pretty open minded about buying generic diapers as long as they work; however Luvs does not work.  These diapers don't hold much liquid (and I change my kids frequently), when they get wet they swell up huge and seem to wick through the "fabric like" material, and the gel tends to seep through the material onto my daughter's skin.  This was the first box of diapers I ever got rid of after using a few in the pack...they simply did not work.  I was constantly worried that the gel would get all over my daughter's clothes, that the diaper would leak, or worse yet - blow out.  Forget it!  The anxiety is simply not worth it.Toys 'r Us diapers were okay.  Walmart diapers were okay.  Target's diapers were okay.  Luvs...oh my gosh, just pass them.  Not recommended.
I try these diapers because I saw the reviews, but when they arrived, just opening the box I hated them, they smell like those famous pantiliners for women, and that was just opening the box and not the bag where they come in, when the baby use them, they lose all the form, they look like if my baby would carry a ball between his legs...and I know when the baby is coming because I can hear the sound like a bag coming, and the sound of these diapers when he moves....no. no. no. My opinion here is : my baby deserves something better. The perfume gives him rash, and his pants get wet more often now each time that he pee, I'm doing laundry more often ...I'm completely disappointed with this purchase, even my husband that never gives opinion about these thing ask me to return them and to ask for a refund because they do not work as promised...so sorry LUVS, I have given you chance for 4 days and no, these diapers don't deserve that chance for me.
These gave my baby the worst diaper rash of his life.  I will never buy Luvs again.  It's too bad because they are so low cost.
I've used Luvs in the past without complaint.  They may have had to have been changed more frequently, but this is horrible.  After seeing their advertising of the diapers holding in "heavy dooty" loads, I was inclined to try them.  With the subscribe and save discount, I went ahead and purchased the case (they have monkeys on the front) and have had 3 blow-outs today on my b.f. baby...argh!  Don't waste your money.
We've been using Pampers diapers almost exclusively since our son was born 5 months ago.  We started with the New Baby diapers in the hospital and liked the softness and fit so we continued to use them until our son needed a size 3 (size 2-3 seems to be the largest they come in).  At that point we tried some other brands, but nothing was as soft or seemed as comfortable and well fitting as the Pampers, so we tried Swaddlers Sensitive diapers.  We went through two small bags, purchased at the drug store, without event.  Then yesterday we opened up the large box we ordered from Amazon.  It was the afternoon, and my son had no diaper rash at that point.  Less than one hour after putting on the first Swaddlers Sensitive diaper from the box, I changed him immediately after he urinated -- this is obvious the moment it happens, as these diapers have a very strong smell when wet.  Already his groin, scrotum, and little buttocks were red, inflamed, and angry looking.  I thought that perhaps I just didn't use enough diaper cream and hoped it would get better, and put on the second diaper from the box, as my poor child screamed.  I'd read warnings from other parents, but since we'd had such good luck with the first two small bags, I didn't believe these nice soft diapers could be the culprit.  A short while later, his poor diaper area  was even worse, and he was clearly miserable.  We switched to another type of diaper and by this morning his groin looked much better.  While I'm a big fan of controlled experiments, I can't bear the thought of my child being in so much pain again, so I won't risk putting him back in these diapers.  I'm contemplating wetting one and strapping it to my inner arm, however, to see if I get a reaction myself.  Do I know for certain these diapers caused the reaction?  No, but logic points suggests it's quite likely -- he had no rash before these diapers; I changed him immediately after he urinated (i.e. he wasn't sitting in a soiled diaper long); and the rash resolved when the diapers were discontinuted.  My husband was furious, and doesn't want Pampers to get another cent from us.  I may have to go back to Huggies Naturals, and deal with the annoying gel granules.  We tried Luvs, but they were poor performers for us.  Rest assured I'll be writing a calm and detailed letter to Pampers.  I'm a physician, and hope they'll take this seriously, as I certainly do.
Maybe it does work for older babies and toddlers but this is definitely not for newborns with their tiny nostrils....
I had heard about this product from a friend, and the idea of sucking snot out of my child's nose made me sick to my stomach. But my daughter was so stuffed up one day I decided I should try it so had it 2 day shipped with my prime account. I tried using this multiple times and one the product has a STRONG plastic smell and you can even taste it while using the product (YUCK!). But I also found it didn't work. I seemed to be messing up my daughters breathing pattern since me sucking was throwing her off but I sure didn't suck up any snot. So I returned this product, doesn't waist your time.
Update:  This company did change the name of this product since I made the original review.  It used to be called "Naturally Refreshing"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Back in the day when I used to be a little more trusting of baby products, I used these wipes and loved them.  There's been quite a bit on the news lately about Johnson & Johnson baby products, although toxins are found in many commercial baby products that aren't being mentioned.  I'll admit that these wipes smell wonderful (and this is coming from someone who is super picky.)  They are adequately thick and strong with just enough texture to remain soft, but still able to clean up messes.Since these were labeled "Naturally Refreshing" I especially didn't feel that I needed to research the safety of these.  However after doing some research, I would NEVER use this on my children. For those familiar with the Skin Deep website, you will notice that this is the #1 toxic baby wipe listed on their site and it scores an 8 out of 10 on their toxicity rating scale.  It's not just that these contain parabens (which I know many are comfortable with) but according to the Skin Deep site, they also include:DMDM Hydabtoin: (Allergies/immunotoxicity, Contamination concerns (FORMALDEHYDE)andRetinyl Palmitate: (Cancer, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Biochemical or cellular level changes)Skin absorbs things it comes into contact with and when you think about how many times these are used, it can be scary to think about.Obviously I'm aware of the fact that babies aren't all dropping dead after using baby products - but allergies, asthma, autoimmune disorders, etc are on the rise.  I personally do not feel comfortable as I want to do everything possible to keep my children safe.  The reason I'm writing the review is just to give parents a heads up so they can make a better informed decision on whether or not to use these.
After what we went through with my daughter, I would not recommend Advance to infants that have tummy issues. It will destroy their GI tract. We used this for the first 3 days at home, if that.
These wipes are nothing special and not worth the extra cost. I will not be ordering these again! I actually like Pampers sensitive wipes over this brand. The good thing was the light scent. These are way too thin!!
I thought these were going to be the Thick Care wipes I have been using with the cloth like texture. these are lousy and barely get poop off.
My 2-year old son always uses Huggies Supreme, which almost never leak, so we  decided to try another Kimberly-Clark product -Huggies Overnites Diapers, Size 6, Big Pack, 48-Count Box.We tried Overnites diapers for three consecutive nights and they leaked every night.  At first, we thought we were doing something wrong, but then we switched back to Supreme and had no leak issues, so the problem is with Overnites.Overnites seem to be thinner than Supreme and have less absorbent material.  This product did not work for us.  Amazon was great as always in making the return easy.
They were way too small, looked like a bikini, they leaked terribly I think due to no padding on the back. The only positives are that they are very soft and customer service is wonderful if you have any complaints.
I got lots of Huggies as baby shower gifts.  I've worked through Pampers Swaddlers, which were great, WalMart brand diapers, which were adequate, and local grocery store brand, which were great.  Huggies Little Snugglers are far and away the worst diapers I have tried.About 2/3 of the time the Little Snugglers leak.  Poop and pee come out the diaper leg.  The Huggies diaper is a little better than having just a snapped onesie to slow the flow, but not much.  I've tried running a finger around the inside of the leg to get the elastic smoothed, and any other positioning technique I could think of.  I've tried tightening the diaper, letting it go looser, etc.  I don't think it's possible to put these on my baby in such a way that poop and pee will go into the diaper.Let me also be clear that I'm talking about poop and pee coming out of the diaper within minutes of putting it on him.  I am not talking about two hours later, much less three or four.  I am talking about leaks the first time he poops or pees in the diaper.  Each diaper has a wetness detection strip, but I don't see the point, since the stream of poop down the leg and onto me is usually my first indication that the diaper has been gone in.Avoid these, and definitely try a smaller package, and not an economy sized pack to begin with.
The legholes are just too big. Our little guy is not a chunky monkey, so every time he pooped(and I mean every time) we had to change clothes, sheets, etc. Pampers is where its at.
I had a pack of these in the past that felt fine. However, this pack is extremely itchy and my skin is very sensitive to it, so I can't wear them. wish I could return.
I had a few of these in a sample in my Snug and Dry box. I love my Huggies, but did not like this type. They are actually harder to get on my daughter and do not last as long. The absorbency doesn't seem to be the same as the Snug and Dry or the Little Snugglers. I will never purchase these and stick with the other Huggies!
Apr. 27, 2014: Just as everyone else has reviewed, the diapers with the Mickey Mouse graphics are very different than the "old" ones with the Winnie the Pooh graphics. We've been loyal Huggies fans for a quite a while now, and I'm even embarassed to admit that I wrote a nasty review on Amazon of Pampers Baby Dry because they were downsizing all of their boxes, and now to see Huggies following suit frustrates me, especially because I feel like the quality of this product has also gone down, while becoming more expensive for the consumer. I never had a problem with the previous little movers, but now we're constantly battling diaper rash, nothing else has changed, so it has to be these diapers. We will be switching to a more affordable and hypoallergenic option when I'm done with this box.Dec. 26, 2013: Just as soft as pampers cruisers! Love the cute Winnie the Pooh graphics and the fit, I can really cinch these in, in the waist and have no leaks!
These are hands down, the WORST diapers we have ever used! When my daughter was born 2 years ago, we used Huggies once or twice when they were on sale, but we've always preferred Pampers. I will say that the only feature I like on these is the double velcro on the front, which really holds the flaps on tight.However, that's where the good qualities end. First off, the diaper itself feels very thin and cheap, almost like plastic. Also, the fit is poor and loose around the legs even when you try to pull the fabric up to tighten them, hence leaks happen. These are horrible to use overnight because the more pee that's in them, the more leaks will occur even out of the top when my daughter sleeps on her stomach. It makes an almost gel out of the pee that has a super strong odor and the wet diaper is actually moist to the touch on the outside of the diaper! It's disgusting and leaves her pants damp!But worst of all is that my daughter has never really had diaper rash her whole life and after 2 days of using these, she had a terrible diaper rash all over her backside and private parts because these lock the pee moisture in and keep her skin constantly wet, creating the rash. Save yourself the money and your child the diaper rash, and go with high quality diapers likePampers Swaddlers Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus 144 Count, which also have a wetness indicator line and are super soft. The Swaddlers diapers also come in size 5 as well. These Huggies diapers are pure junk!
I seem to always have the problem that Huggies are too small for my son while other diapers in the same size fit fine. These were a bit snug, which would be fine, but they also caused a rash, which went away the second I put a different brand diaper on him (in this case a Parent's choice diaper).
Our DD only wears diapers at night. We stocked up the last time they went on sale, so it's been a few months since I last bought these diapers. They used to be the best fitting, soft, stretchy diapers for my tall and skinny toddler. I picked some up last week, and I'm not happy with the changes. I don't know why they changed, but now the diapers seem shorter and they are very stiff. My daughter got a rash the first night. You also have to be careful not to rip off the Velcro fasteners when you disconnect them from the back of the diaper. I'm completely unimpressed, and am now looking for a new nighttime diaper, since Seventh Gen (poor fit) and Earth's Best (scratchy, rash-inducing material) aren't that great.
A relative gave me these and I figured they would be the same as Little Snugglers. WRONG. They held nothing and the pee and poop came through all the time. My daughter still wakes up during the night and even in a 3 hours spand when she would wake up she would be drenched. Finished the box and would never repurchase.
I have tried several different types of wipes for my 1 year old, and Pampers Soft Care wipes are by far the worst of the bunch.These wipes are a bit thin, which is not so bad.  However, they are very slimy and wet.  Trying to clean up a messy #2 is very difficult because of the slimy texture of the wipe.  Since we have a large case of them to use up, I now leave the container near the high chair to wipe up the baby's hands and face after eating.  They are okay for that use, but I definitely will not be buying these again regardless of the price.I also find the included plastic container hard to open and shut.  I am not sure if mine is defective, or if that is simply the way the container is designed.
this was the first time we bought pampers since I ran out of my "green/environmentally friendly" ones.I had to use one of them and it gave me a headache. I could smell this powder smell through her clothes. and even after changing her back into a scent free one, her clothes still carried the smell.aside from the fact that this is NOT healthy for the little ones, how can anyone take it?!
I used to use pampers as overnight diapers, because at lower size numbers our usual brand wasn't quite up to a marathon overnight session. Now that we're in bigger sizes, i haven't needed to have different diapers for day and night, so i've been using another brand full-time for several months. I got a box of these 'new improved' pampers, and was immediately surprised by how different they were.Get your hands on one of these diapers before you consider buying them.The first thing you'll notice is that they're 20% thinner because they left out 30% of the absorbent material. It may be the case that their 'new improved!' absorbent material is good enough to make up for this, but they simply took it out of the back third of the diaper. This means that, should your child lie on their back, the urine will go where the absorbent pad isn't.While you're examining the back of the diaper, note that it's missing the little elastic ridge that was good at keeping blowouts from being worse than necessary.You'll also notice a papery texture about the whole diaper, even the inside layer that'll be pressing against your child's skin. How would you feel wearing paper underwear? It can't be comfortable.If you go ahead and use these diapers, you'll notice a few more things. First, though it does a decent job of absorbing urine, the cloying perfume smell disappears the minute the diaper is soiled. One minute your child smells like diaper-perfume, the next they stink like they've been wearing the same soaked diaper for ages. Second, the inner surface of the diaper feels very wet, unlike the old version where the liner layer kept the sodden inner material from pressing against your baby's skin.I only used these diapers for a few days (i didn't plan to use them at all, but a scheduling screw-up meant we had none of our preferred brand for a little while), but i didn't see any diaper rash, blisters, or some of the other skin problems some other reviewers have mentioned. What we did get was a rash across my son's hips, where the elastic tabs come across (and before you accuse me of being an idiot who put the diaper on wrong - i'm not an idiot who put the diaper on wrong, i've never had this trouble before with any brand, including the old pampers). Fortunately, that appeared the day we finally got our usual diapers on hand again, so i was able to stop using these immediately. The irritation cleared up by the next day.3/4 of the box of diapers is gathering dust in a closet, because i'm not even comfortable giving the unopened packages to a charity.
Yes, they are soft, but they leak and there is no padding on the back. Will not buy papers brand again.
These diapers cause rash and burns on children.  I am surprised that they have not been recalled.  I would not purchase them.
I don't usually buy Pampers diapers.  The sides aren't very stretchy so if your little one is close to the weight limit (as mine is) buy the size 4.I like the thinness of the diapers and so far so good, no leaks.  If it stays that way it could easily turn me into a buyer of this brand considering there are coupons almost every month in the Sunday newspaper.  Two days into the test, I like them aside from the size issue!(A MONTH LATER)There's not a chance I'd EVER buy these diapers!  I couldn't even finish using the box.  My little boy has never gotten diaper rashes.  That is - until now.  He developed the first rash about 3 days into my test.  I put the Balmex on the area and that usually clears up any redness in a day.  Not so with these diapers!  After the rash not going away for 2 days with the Balmex I went to the Huggies.  Rash was gone within a day.  Fwd 3 days I thought I'd try the Pampers again.  2 days later, same rash.  UGH!  My poor little guy!  I feel terrible for testing these on him.  The rash was so bad the 2nd time I couldn't even put cream on him without him screaming crying.  I will never buy the pampers with the Dry Max again.  We frequently use Luvs which are made by the same company but don't have the Dry Max and he has no problem with those.  I don't know why they decided to put this material in the diapers.  I've read alot of other reviews now that say the same thing.
At the time I ordered these (from Vine) the reviews either seemed to love them or hate them. I decided to order them anyway to see if maybe they were just more than leaking issues from other parents.I would have to agree with Rick Ball's review. I read the older versions were great, the Swaddlers and the Cruise line minus the dry max.  Upon receiving the item I noticed a chemical smell just opening them from the box. It was so strong my eyes burned. I do have bad allergies so that could have contributed to it. Reading about the chemical burns and rashes babies are getting is shocking to me. I really hope Pampers either goes back to their older version or does more testing with the current ones.The diapers seem like a great idea but whatever they are putting in them is not worth the risk in my opinion.
Trying to be balanced, so first THE GOOD:-Thin & absorbent.-Velcro tabs are really nice.-Has a "bowl"-shape in bottom, & double-elastic leg. So poo is sealed from leaking onto legs or onto lower back.Now THE BAD:-While they are super absorbent, they do NOT distribute the liquid throughout the diaper. So unless your baby pees from multiple places on his/her body, the diaper will leak in front & remain dry everywhere else.-The sizes run large. They seem huge to me. But then again, we have a trim baby (not too chubby).-No wetness indicator. Not a big deal to me, but worth mentioning.(I know people don't want to hear this next point - I predict I'll get some pushback & angry  feedback for expressing my concern. Call me crazy, but I want only the best for my baby, & I want her as safe as possible. So here it goes anyway...)-My biggest complaint are the chemicals & bleach in these. The diapers smell like chemicals. Our baby has NOT had a skin reaction like other reports we've read ... but come'on, Pampers! Why do this to begin with? This is of particular concern for baby girls, who have more "exposed" parts and can get internal irritation from bleach and chemicals. This happens much more often than any of us would like to think.CONCLUSION:-You can call me a crazy conspiracy nut if you want, but Pampers/Procter Gamble is currently being sued because these diapers have caused chemical burn on thousands of babies. It's even worse for baby girls. Google it - New York Times, USA Today, etc.-Our continued frustration with companies like Pampers who don't listen to customer feedback, and continue to produce cheaply made products which are questionably/potentially unsafe for our baby and the environment (actually, those two things tend to go hand-in-hand).-We're switching to cloth for home use, and saving the disposables only for road trips & outings.
I was pretty surprised about the smell of these products.  I thought since they were Bert's they would smell natural.  The smell is overpowering, sickly sweet and artificial.  The products are actually really nice but the smell is just too strong and awful.  The smell is also way too strong for my baby, who is used to a soft lavender smell.  UGGGHHHH!!
I bought a few packs of these when they were on sale at our local grocery store.  Even at a discounted price, they are AWFUL!  They're thicker, sure, but drier, and rougher.  They feel like Huggies wipes, but worse.  The reason we have loved pampers wipes for the last four years was because they were soft, and had the perfect amount of moisture.  Pampers failed miserably with these.  Why they'd even put them out on the market, I have no idea.
They are definetly thick but rough. Have a paper towel Like texture. I'll buy the software wipes again instead! Like the light scent though!

First I received a product does not look like the pocket broken after a month in my car. Should be no star! I wish I can return it
Im really not sure how a swim diaper is supposed to not get water logged and still keep urine in. The diapers just get really wet and cold. They don't get heavy, which is the only benefit. I accidentally tested these indoors on my toddler, when one got mixed into the diaper bag. Pee just dripped down his legs. If that happens out of the pool, I can only guess how good they work in the pool. Really, it's only for looks and may help keep a BM out of the water...if you catch it in time.
I use to swear by Seventh Generation and then they went Lorax and the quality tanked.  I decided to try this new rebirth of the product but am still unhappy.  3 out of 5 nights both of my kids (1 and 3 and both in size 4) had big big leaks.  I ran out of clean sheets so I have not finished off the pack.  Back to the other brand....
Was excited to get this product as I had read about the seventh generation diapers being pretty great.  It seems like a lot of people have great luck with these, unfortunately we did not.On a diaper change my wife switched out to the seventh generation (from a pampers drymax I believe), and a couple hours later when she went to change the diaper, she was covered in a red rash.  My wife switched back to our normal diapers, and it still took awhile to go away, but a day later it was gone.  Needless to say it was bad enough that we won't even be trying this again to make sure it wasn't a fluke thing.It probably won't happen to your child this bad (or at least I hope not) However there must be something different about these, maybe something the chlorine normally washes away that could irritate your child.Edit:  It wasn't clear in my review but these were the new free and clear ones.
I got these diapers thinking they could be a good alternative to Pampers. Unfortunately, they are not. Frankly when I pulled them out of the package I said, "Hmm, maybe newspaper would be a better option." They don't feel good to the touch (not soft at all), but I had them so I decided to use them. I put one on my daughter right before her nap. When she got up the diaper had become unfastened and was super saggy, soggy and her bum had little SAP beads on it. I figured, "Well, that can happen even with the best diaper." I put a new one on and within an hour it to was sagging between her legs. There is very little elastic and either her tummy or her legs are wet every time she has worn them. I know these are supposed to be better for the environment, but they are almost 2x as much as Pampers and they don't work. With these I would have to change my 2-year-olds diaper every 2 hours and they still sag. Also, they do not wick moisture effectively her skin is wet/damp when I take them off.
I have a chubby toddler who has figured out how to open diapers but hasn't mastered potty training. I wanted to get something environmentally friendly, but these aren't a good fit for us. First off, they leak. My 17 month old peed through every one. Because they leak I was changing diapers more often and washing more than usual, which defeats the purpose of a disposable option that's more eco friendly.In addition to the leak issue, my daughter developed a diaper rash from these. I don't know if it was the moist environment or the material but they irritated her skin and the result was a yeast diaper rash, despite very frequent changes. Waste of my $ so back to Pull Ups I go.
My husband and I didn't like these wipes at all. We found them to be very slimey, leaving baby wet every time. The quality of the wipes wasn't that great either and it wasn't uncommon to be changing baby and have a trail of wipes in hand because they didn't separate easily. Before we even got through the box, we switched over to Huggies naturals.
I bought these because Amazon was temporarily out of my usual Huggies wipes in the Subscribe & Save.  I will not make that mistake again!The Pampers wipes are simply WAY TOO THIN and weak. (They feel and hold up like the very cheap wipes that come in the plastic cylinders.) They tear just by pulling them out the wipe warmer!  Try changing a dirty diaper and with the only free hand pulling a baby wipe from the wipe warmer...and it RIPS! Ugggg!I will stick with the Huggies wipes, which I've used for each of my children. The Huggies wipes still as good as they were 18 years ago.
We ordered this item by schedule, we have a baby that USE DIAPERS that means that it is an item that MUST be on time in the door of my house on the dates agreed...no excuse!
I tried these in several different sizes thinking maybe that was an issue but they always leaked. I love the daytime pull-ups. They work better at night than the nighttime pull-ups.
The title says is all: Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! The diaper split and made a MESS!!! I ordered the diapers thinking my daughter would be more comfortable in them. The delivery came yesterday, I put the first one on last night and when she woke this morning and I opened her sleepers, I discovered the diaper had split and gelled crystals were all over her skin, up & down her back, and all over insider her sleepers. The mess poured out all over her bedding. WHAT A MESS!!! I'm returning the entire shipment, minus one diaper, TODAY and am requesting a refund. I will go back to using the regular overnight diapers...which leak too but don't split as easily.
Well, these were great until they decided to update them. They leak ALL THE TIME now. My poor girls wake up wet and cold every morning. :(
These smell horrible. I would never order them again. Yes, I picked out this fragrance. Yet, these wipes smell, at least in my mind, like my daughter's bowl movements. That is not what I want to think about when I am wiping her up. I hate these.
I have previously reviewed Seventh Generation Diapers and had a very bad experience. (see my review onSeventh Generation Free and Clear Baby Diapers. My daughter has very sensitive skin and often has diaper rash. If I could have a diaper that might help minimize that I would like to consider it (Although I'm not convinced that the dye and other material in Pampers has anything to do with her frequent rashes).The problem I had with the day-use 7th Generation diapers was that they would quickly get water-logged and soggy, making her skin very wet. I was hopeful that an over-night diaper might do better in this regard, so I was willing to give Seventh Generation another chance.Fail! After the first night of use my daughter woke up in the morning with her skin looking like she had been in a swimming pool too long,  The liquid from her urine didn't soak around the edges of the diapers: It soaked right through it and all over the mattress. So needless to say, that is the last diaper from this box I will be using and I certainly will not be spending more than Pampers or Huggies (I prefer Pampers:Pampers Extra Protection Nighttime Diapers, Super Pack, Size 5, 72 Count) on diapers whose function is far inferior to those other ones.
I have tried a million different things from Seventh Generation. I don't like their products. This specific item leaks and is over priced.
I really wanted to like these diapers, because they are more environmentally friendly and contain less chemicals.  However, after one night of using these for my two year old son, I am extremely disappointed.  Upon taking off his pajamas this morning, I found a huge mess.  The top of the front of the diaper had basically disintegrated and pieces of it were stuck to him and his pajamas.  Even worse was the gel-like substance that was all over his stomach, legs, and his pajamas.  My son was visibly upset by the gel all over him, and I had to rush him into the bath because it was too much of a mess to clean with wipes.  I have never seen a diaper destruct like this, even with the worst types of blow-outs.  There was only pee in this diaper too; I would hate to see what it was like with poop!I'm sorry to say I will not be using these again; I will be going back to Huggies Overnights where the worst problem is an occasional leak.  If I could give these Seventh Generation Overnight diapers no stars, I would, because I have never seen such a horrific mess of a diaper.  I cannot recommend these.
I have a compulsive roller so changing a diaper often is a test of speed and wrestling ability.  I bought Huggies Natural wipes on a last minute whim when I ran out and my subscribe save wipes still had two days to ship (sometimes S&S is a curse!).  These wipes are terrible.  While they are gentle and have no off-putting smell, they do tear every other time I pull one out and not in the proper place.  I am usually stuck holding a quarter of a wipe with the rest still in the container.  Usually I don't have a hand free and things just become a giant mess.  Also these stick to my child's bum like crazy and don't really "wipe."  I will stick to other brands.
These wipes are not soft for baby at all.  They chaffed my poor baby's bottom terribly, probably because they are textured and not moist enough to do a good job.  I stopped using them for diaper changes after I saw what they were doing to my baby's skin and tried using them for other purposes, but they are just no good.  I will never buy these again.
Having a baby monitor with a camera sounded exciting. We could check on our little guy on the monitor before coming in the room to make sure he was really awake and not just talking in his sleep. Checking on him if he was too quiet would have been nice also. Unfortunately, we did not have the great experiences the other reviewers had. Although we really wish we could have said the monitor was super, we cannot.First, the monitor came to us broken. It had a white screen and only could be turned off by taking out the battery. I called the customer support line a few times and they were trying to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong to give it a white screen. On my third call, I finally got them to send me the return authorization form by email so I can get the monitor repaired. I promptly filled it out and sent it to them (having to pay the postage myself).Did someone email me to let me know if/when I would be getting my replacement? No.Did I have to wait over a month to get my replacement? You bet!My monitor came back to me without the piece that is used to load the pictures on a computer. Disappointing, but it gets worse.When we tried the monitor out it was really cool. The monitor worked for about four days before breaking again. We turned it on one night only to find a big black blob in the middle of the screen. Only the bottom 10-20% of the screen was barely visible and the top was whitewashed, save for the big blob.I emailed, waited two working days (they are supposed to get back to you within one day) and then called. I was told it looks like the baby monitor was dropped and has a crack in it, so the warrantee would not cover this. I told the lady that it did not fall but she told me "you have to see it from our point of view that it looks cracked."Let's imagine it did fall. Would falling on a thick carpet really damage this monitor? And if it would, is this the type of product you really would want to have? Of course, no one tries to drop their cell phone, but if they all broke from falling once, we would be more than dissatisfied with the quality and durability.
LET ME START OUT BY SAYING WE HAVE NEVER HAD A WIPE SENSITIVITY PROBLEM WITH MY TWO YEAR OLD.  WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE A VARIETY OF DIAPERS AND WIPES WITH ZERO PROBLEM.  WE HAVE USED PRIMARILY SWADDLERS/CRUISERS FOR DIAPERS AND PAMPERS THICK CARE WIPES.  SINCE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND THICK CARE ANYWHERE... I BOUGHT THESE.  THEY IMMEDIATELY HAVE MY DAUGHTER A RASH.  THEY ARE HORRIBLE. I HAVE USED OTHER HUGGIES WIPES (THE ONES IN THE STRIPED PAKAGING) IN A PINCH AND THEY ARE GREAT.  THESE HOWEVER. ARE NOT THE SAME.  I ALSO USED FOR A FEW CHANGES WITH MY NEWBORN.  IT GAVE HER WHAT LOOKED LIKE A CHEMICAL RASH...BRIGHT RED BURNS WHERE THE WIPE TOUCHED HER.
Since my normal subscription for pampers wipes was not available, I decided to give these Huggies wipes a try. I was not impressed and will not be purchasing again. These wipes come in 2 large resealable bags, which start to dry out once the package is opened, especially if you only have one child and you don't go through them very fast. Also the wipes are very rough. They may feel thicker than the other pampers ones I use, but my daughter actually cries and tells me these hurt her when we wipe. I would rather pay more locally to get the softer pampers wipes.
These leave a terrible soapy residue that feels slimy until dry. They also seemed thinner and longer than Huggie's wipes. Small annoyance, but I hated the container they sent with the wipes. It did not have the rubber stopper like Huggies, just a large opening so you ended up pulling out 10 wipes. It's hard to hold down a squirming baby and tear off a wipe at the same time.
These are so wet I have to wipe my baby's bottom with a regular tissue after using them. It's a pain.
I purchased these on accident...I usually use unscented and sensitive. The packaging looked the same and I made the purchase in error...when I got it in the mail I honestly thought they were still the unscented sensitive until I opened the box. Whew! These are very fragrant. We will whip through this box and never go back...my little girl's bottom has been fresh smelling since her birth due to very regular diaper changes...no need for this perfume smell!
There was literally NO difference between these and the original pampers cruisers.  It was almost as if someone switched what should have been in this &#34;ultra&#34; box for the cruisers.  This box only came with 116, and regular cruisers came with 160 (size 4).  I don't even know why this exists.BEWARE!  DONT BUY!  THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS REGULAR CRUISERS!
We really wanted to like the Pampers wipes ( we only use their diapers) but these wipes are such a weird texture that it is really hard to grab and wipe the poo off of baby's butt. It almost feels like there is some type of non-sudsing soap on the wipes that leaves a sticky residue on baby and it has a smell that is a bit off-putting. I have two packages left of these wipes and I only use them in the diaper bag. We stick to Huggies wipes
These wipes feel slimy and they stick together, making it difficult to get a wipe out with one hand.  It pulls out like toilet paper on a roll despite that these are separate sheets.  Also they are advertised as non-scented but they have a slight scent to them.  Purchased these for diaper bag but can't wait to use up; do not plan to buy Pampers wipes again.
This leaked every day. It didn't last at all. Pampers Cruisers is the only diaper that doesn't leak during the night.
Edit.... I had to come back and upset this I  have used pamper on both kids until a few days ago. This product caused not only a sever diaper rash but also chemical burn on my daughters. Upon further research pampers has been sued for this in the past and amazon has been aware and continues to sell the product... Should be ashamed.... Won't be buying diapers through amazon again EVER.
I am noticing everywhere that Pampers and Luvs are downsizing all of their boxes. Some of them are BIG downsizes too. For example, I just bought a box of Pampers Cruisers because they were on sale, and I got the last old box of of size 4, 148 count. The rest available at the store were all the new size 4, 136 count for $40.  Really? That is absolutely ridiculous.  This Baby Dry box of size 4 used to be available in 192 count, (which is still available on Amazon but not for subscribe & save) and is now only available in 180 count. Why, Pampers?  The same goes for every line of diapers that Pampers makes. I WAS a loyal Pampers fan in the beginning, with my son because I loved the ultra soft Swaddlers but not anymore. I can understand if the company was spending more on the product, and making a higher quality one, but from what I can tell, these diapers are the same quality as the old ones for MORE money. After comparing these and Huggies Snug & Dry; Huggies is a better quality diaper AND they offer a larger quantity at this size, so I'm a convert. I REFUSE, I mean absolutely REFUSE to pay the same amount for LESS diapers.
At first I didn't notice anything too bad about these diapers, aside from the tabs leaving red marks. After using them for a few weeks though, I noticed my baby was developing a slight redness on her legs where the diapers sits. But the worst part is that the tabs left SCRATCHES on her skin! At first I didn't know if it was caused by the diapers but after it happened again, I knew there could be no other cause.
The perforation sticker on the corners of diaper are not strong enough to hold the diaper in place and often come off. As a result there are innumerable diaper leaks. It does not work as promised to provide overnight protection. In the new improved version of Pampers baby dry diapers, the number of diapers per pack have been reduced but the price has been increased. The quality has also deteriorated compared to the older version,The inner layer of diaper seems very thin and so does not absorb maximum leakage.I would not recommend this product to anyone.
I think to address the obvious quality vs quantity issue here would be moot. Most review's here seem to have beat that with a dead horse... (and I agree) Here is your work around.. Simply demand AMAZON bring back subscribe and save for the previous version of this diaper (assuming it come's directly from amazon and not a third party) OR move to another brand... At least that way you'll continue to get the diapers you want and buy yourself time to search for a better product...Your not going to get any satisfaction from the generic.."Hi, My name is bob... sorry our product sucks now but look at these cool new graphics, and we made them even more absorbent than ever... (EVEN THOUGH THEIR REVIEW RATING IS 3K  4 1/2 STARS ON THE FORMER AND FALLING DRASTICALLY ON THE NEW PRODUCT LINE.. And parent's are complaining left and right about just how "Unchanged, or worse" the product is... but yet they still keep stating .. "Hey call our 1800 number... because apparently an actual solution is too much to ask for..) I guess common sense surpassed their csr rep's who haven't grasped that most reviewers actually have read the generic copy paste response NUMEROUS times... scoffing at the obvious lack of sincerity and actual solution...NOW for the review..and WHY these diaper's suck so horribly now....-The backside of the diaper is too small and makes for fun clean up of poop (especially for breastfed babies)-POOP now leak's like crazy out the sides (This used to be reserved for huggies.. apparently now Pampers is just as accommodating for the mom who just loves poop stained baby clothes & linens)-The tabs that fasten the diaper are constantly ripping off in a box of 170ish we now have lost 13... count them... 13 diapers.. And I've only gone through roughly 70 in this box (We used to have the occasional economy sized box were maybe 3-5 diapers had this happen)AND BEATING A DEAD HORSE... Thanks for the downgrade in quality and quantity... LOVINGGG THAT....***
It's too bad this product is scented (and not even nicely scented at that) because it is otherwise a decent diaper for the money.Anything labeled sensitive should be chemical free, and that includes chemical fragrances.
I'm all about less chemicals when it comes to my babies.  My favorite wipes are cloth with just water, but when I am on the go that isn't always easy to carry with me.My first try at these wipes was for a poopy diaper.  I had a hard time getting the wipe out of the package because they all seemed to stick together and I ended up with around 5, which actually wasn't such a bad idea because one was not good enough to do the job.  They have no grip to them and wouldn't clean the poop well enough.  I had to really work at cleaning my baby's bottom.I compared these to Honest wipes which are also fragrance-free and sensitive.  Hands down Honest wipes were much better.  These gDiaper wipes are smaller and easily tear apart--they are almost like netting.I've tried quite a few different wipes with my 3 kids.  These were probably my least favorite because they just don't do the job well enough.  For a quick wipe up or using on a snotty nose, they do fine, but for anything more substantial, they fall apart and cannot actually clean up the extra "dirtiness."Update 5/18:  I originally gave these a 3 star rating.  After using them for a while, I am lowering my review to 1-star.  I HATE these things. They are so difficult to get out of the package (I either can't get any or I get half the package).  They are so flimsy that they are practically falling apart before being used.  These are the WORST baby wipes I have ever used.  On top of all that, they are insanely overpriced.  I do not recommend using them because you will only end up frustrated like me.
My child is four years old, but we still use baby wipes to clean up after she goes to the toilet, as well as for cleansing her hands, face, etc during the day.  I have tried a lot of different brands of wipes in the last four years, and these are without the doubt the worst of the lot.These wipes are extremely thin, and my fingers easily poke through them.  The way the wipe material is made, there are many holes.  When using these to help my daughter wipe after a bowel movement, we had to use three wipes (stacked together) instead of just one.  Even though they are made of environmentally friendly cellulose, having to use triple the amount of wipes isn't doing a favor for the environment.Unlike most wipes, these do not "pop up" another wipe when I pull one out.  I have to dig out another wipe, which is difficult when the package is nearly full.  I cannot imagine doing this with a wiggly baby or toddler with a messy diaper.These wipes are only suitable for very light duty use.  I now use them only to wipes my daughter's hands and face, and I use them at night to remove my makeup.  I received these through the Amazon Vine program at no charge, but I definitely will not buy them in the future.
