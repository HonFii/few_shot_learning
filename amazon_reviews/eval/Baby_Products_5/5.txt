I purchased this baby lotion for the soon coming winter months because it has Shea & Cocoa Butter in it. I received the package today and tried it tonight to make sure that I liked it and I do. It is thick and creamy like Johnson's other baby lotions. It did NOT leave a film or anything on my daughter's skin. I have used Shea & Cocoa butter lotions that make my skin feel like I dipped myself in wax, this was NOT one of them. This left my daughter's skin feeling soft and moisturized.My recommendation before you buy this: smell it in the store. I personally really like the smell, however it smells more like Shea than Cocoa, so it's not sweet. The fragrance is hard to describe acutally. To me it initially smells like a clean shea butter smell. I used the lotion & baby wash on my daughter. It has been 4 hours since her bath and now it smells more shea butter than anything else. Her skin is very soft. I am actually thinking about trying it tomorrow because it does not necessarily have a "baby smell", it's just a light & soft scent... which I personally like.My two biggest recommendations: Smell it in store & buy it on Amazon. The price on amazon is much cheaper than in store!
I really love the thickness of this cream, but it is not oily at all. I use this on me and my twin babies. I used it as a hand cream and I could immediately go about my business without slick hands. It's really good stuff and has a light baby powder smell. I like that glycerin is the second ingredient. I was really looking for a good replacement for some Johnson's baby cream I bought overseas (Thailand) but it had mineral oil as the 2nd ingredient. The formula on the US version is actually better with more glycerin in it so I'm happy I don't have to import the overseas version because one small tub was $10 on Ebay.Note: I found this at Kroger for $3.16 a tube. Now, it's on sale for $2.99. I had already done the subscribe and save with Amazon, but won't be doing it anymore as long as Krogers offers it because Amazon isn't offering a substantial savings.
My babies smell good enough to eat! My daughter thinks its yummy. Have to keep it out of reach she likes the taste of lotion!
Not only is this great on my son but I love it too and actually keep a bottle at my desk at work to keep my hands super soft.  Actually, people at my work love the smell and are always &#34;boring&#34; it as well because it works so good on those cracked hands.
If you have ever had a problem with messes going up your child's back you need to try these!! They have a great waistband, the best one I've found (and trust me, I've tried them all). I was a loyal Pamper's buyer until I found these. They don't look as pretty as Pampers but you won't care once you see how well they work. I find that they absorb just as much as the Pampers Baby Dry but they actually hold the mess in the diaper. No more poop up the back!
Purchased as a subscribe and save item and we are very satisfied.  Huggies is the only brand we trust because they do their job well.  Very rarely do we get leaks with Huggies.  Easy to use and comfortable for our child.
The stretchy waste and velcro on these diapers makes it so they can fit longer. The only time we have a problem is overnight my son sometimes leaks through, but overall they are great diapers.
I used to try using generic diapers in sizes 4 and 5 and was always cleaning up a mess!  I have learned my lesson and now only buy Huggies or Pampers Cruisers for sizes 4 and up.  Here on amazon.com with my Amazon Mom Prime membership I can get Huggies much more affordable than Pampers and so I have stuck with Huggies for the most part.  I also like that Huggies sells these diapers in smaller quantities so that if during the month my child's size changes I am not stuck with a ton of extra diapers.  These are also great in size 3!  I am very happy with Huggies and they are my &#34;go-to&#34; brand for diapering my 3 kids!
We love these diapers, they don't irritate my kids sensitive skin, and it's usually fairly easy to her a good deal on the case on amazon! We rarely have leaks or blowouts.
I have used these diapers since my son was born and they have always worked well for us, I will continue to use.
This is the only brand of disposable diapers that I have found that don't leak out the legs on my daughter. She has super skinny and long legs. I did notice that I have to switch the size a bit sooner than the max guidelines though.
I did a little research (Diapers.com, Babies R US, local grocery stores)  - and these were the bet priced. We've tried other brands and these held up the best. We have only had a few leaks and it was more of how our daughter was sitting which would cause some gaps to form.
I really prefer the Target brand.  But hey if I can get cheap diapers somewhere you bet I am going to snag them up.
Can't beat this price with the Subscribe and Save program.  My mother bought them for my son and he has refused to wear anything else since!
Got these as we transition into walking and they do a wonderful job as a diaper!  Also, these are helping prepare for potty training.
I used to be a die hard pampers mom. Now I've made the switch! Pampers seem to work better when the kids a re younger. When they became toddlers I started having too many leaks so I switched and I'm happy
I've been a big champion of the top rival brand and I have bought numerous units of that brand for more than two years. I decided to give Huggies a try & I ain't going back! It has better grip, better fit & leaks far less often
Huggies are pricey.  We usually buy the Target store brand unless we have a coupon, except for when we have to buy overnight diapers.  Then it's Huggies Overnights all the way.  My son leaked out of the Little Snugglers newborn diapers, so we were hesitant to try the bigger sizes.  They are great!  I have never had a leak, poop or pee.  We have tried Pampers and Luvs, which are ok diapers but I hate the powder smell.  We have tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature chlorine-free diapers as well as Kroger's chlorine-free store brand, Comforts for Baby.  Of all of them, I prefer Target brand and Huggies.  I love Huggies Pure & Natural wipes as well.I know lots of people who swear by Pampers for their boys, but I find that Huggies work better for mine.  We had leaks and rashes with Pampers.  I wish Huggies weren't so expensive.  We can only afford to buy them if they are on sale.  Maybe if they'd ditch the Disney characters (unnecessary IMO) they could sell them for less.These are easy to put on my super wiggly nine month old boy who never wants to hold still for a diaper change.  The velcro tabs adhere well and stay in place.  They fit great and don't sag when full.  He is super active and we never have a problem with them shifting around.Overall, these are the best non-store brand that we've used.
This product arrived in a 3 day time span. I was both surprised & thankful for that, since we were nearly out & needed the diapers quickly. This is one of our regular kinds that we use (also use Huggies Little Snugglers and Pure & Natural), so I was familiar with them before this purchase. Very happy with the performance of these diapers & would recommend them.
When I had my daughter I vowed that we would not be above using generic store-brand diapers for her to help cut back on costs.  And for a while we did use store brands (Walmart, Target, CVS,  Toys R' Us) before discovering that none of them were quite as good as the name brands.  A few of them were horrible at absorbing liquids, and a few of them just fit very awkwardly, like they were not cut to fit the contours of a baby's body.Pampers and Luvs I dislike because they are scented and therefore not great for babies with sensitive skin - they constantly caused diaper rash.Which brought us to Huggies.  Not only do I find the Huggies to have a far-superior fit (they are shaped to the curves of a baby's legs) but they are also unscented and most importantly super absorbent.  They may not be as cheap as the store brands but knowing my daughter is wearing a diaper that absorbs well and fits great is what matters to me.  We've used Huggies since stage one (including the over-night ones) and have never had any problems with leaks or diaper rash - they are the only diapers I will buy.
We've used both Pampers and Huggies for our daughter (7 months old) and I like both, but since Huggies is more economical and works great for us we're sticking with them for now. No issues with fit or leaks for our baby.
These Huggies are really good diapers. My son is a very active little boy, and these diapers hang right in there with him. They don't leak, and are good all-around diapers.
We started off almost 5 years ago when our daughter was born on the quest for the perfect diaper. Tried Pampers, then we went to Huggies, experimented a bit with White Cloud and Luvs, but we have always come back to Huggies for their durability, comfort and fit.Since then the DD has pottytrained but we have added another lil one, and will be adding yet another in a few months. DD was a bit chubby through the waist and tall, DS is a skinny tall type. Both did very well with these diapers thanks to the elastic waist and velcro tabs.The subscribe and save is great for our household. One less thing to stick in the grocery cart...one less thing to worry about running out of. Box comes to our doorstep right on time, every time and often it is within a couple days of the order placement date. And the price here is very reasonable.
I loved it from the minute I opened this gym. It is larger than all the other gyms I saw. The toys selection is good. The toys can be moved around. It includes four toys and a mirror, you could add a lot of toys too. There are additional slots for more toys. The colors in this gym are very bright. My baby loves it.
I love this - its so cute and has many things to look at. My daughter loves it and plays on it all the time. Only problem is that when she spits up, it leaves a watermark. Other than that - its great!
Bought it for my daughter and she played a lot in it. The hanging toys were great for keeping her interested.
these steam bags are easy to use and they last a long time. When I bought these I did not realize that you could use these more than once which is really nice.
I love these microwave bags!  They are such a time saver and just make life a little easier when you have to clean pump parts or bottles.All you do it put your pump parts or bottle parts in the bag, add a few ounces of water, microwave for a few minutes, dump the water and everything is sterilized!Each bag can be used 20 times before you are supposed to get rid of it.  While these bags are not a necessity, they are a nice convenience item to have around.
I got these because I was battling breastfeeding thrush and had to sterilize everything everyday. Very time consuming with twins so my lactation consultant gave me one of these Medela bags and it works like a charm. You can use each bag up to 20 times and you can fit a good amount in the bag so it lasts a long time. Great for sterilizing pacifiers too, only takes 3 minutes. I highly recommend!!!
I love how quick and easy to use these are! Each bag has 20 uses so they are a great cost benefit and because you just toss in 2 oz of water and pop them in the microwave for 3 minutes, I can sterilize all of my pumping stuff for the day in about 20 minutes while I'm doing other things. Then I just toss the bottles and parts on theMunchkin Deluxe Drying Rackand I know they're clean and good to go! So happy with them and highly recommend them!
After dealing with thrush and mastitis, I started using these bags to steam my pumping parts at least once a day. It's quick (3 minutes in my microwave), easy, and about six cents per use ($6 for 100 bags). It's much easier than waiting for a pot of water to boil, waiting for the parts to boil, then cleaning the pot. I've used this for cleaning pump parts, tubing, nipples, bottles, and caps. Granted, these aren't an absolute NEED...but they are very handy and worth it for us. They'd also be convenient for traveling. Plus, because of the heat, when items are removed from the bag, they dry quickly. You'll love these!
Bottles, nipples, bottle rings, pacifiers, breast milk bottles and tubing, silicone ice cube trays for baby food. LOVE these bags. They are BPA free and clean in 3 minutes in my microwave. Super easy to take with you if you are traveling with baby in hotels that might not have enough space for dishwasher or kitchenette. Throw your stuff in the bags and nuke 'em! Sanitized in minutes. Also, you can use each bag 20 times. I still have two bags from my original purchase 9+ months ago. Love these things
These work like all other steam bags.  I use them for pacifiers, bottles, and pump parts.  It really is a lot faster to use a steam bag versus traditional pot ot water.  I like them, and I think they are a good value.
works really well and def gets the pump accessories clean. bought them for a friend and kept a few for myself ;-)
These are handy for travel. I have a home sanitizer that I use when my little one is sick, or something needs sanitized. However these are perfect for when you are traveling. They fit right in your bag and most hotels have a microwave, if not in the room somewhere in the building!
Everyone has their preference and this is mine. I've been using pampers for years. My daughter is now 15 so you can guess how long. I have to admit that I've tried numerous brands throughout the years and I've always come back to Pampers. Huggies left a gel-like film on my baby's tush and I did not like that. Wasn't sure if it was safe so went back to Pampers, Luvs leaked so back again I went. My baby is due Feb 5 so decided to give this to my g/f who just had her baby weighing in at 8lbs 4oz and she loves them. She states that the feel of the diapers are almost cloth like and that there is no leakage which is what most parents look for. The price for disposable diapers have increased over the years so I would do the subscribe and save program to save a few dollars.
Pampers have exceeded my expectations, yet again. I switched to huggies for the price, but quickly switched back to pampers when my infant started leaking out of the huggies. I also love that pampers are soft and not thin/crinkly like the huggies. You get what you pay for, and it's worth the extra money to not be changing sheets at 4 am!
I use many types of diapers and have tried out almost every brand but for newborns these are the go-to brand! Over the span of four boys (note, I haven't tried these on girls but my friends with girls buy this brand too) I have found that Pampers Swaddlers (not thePampers Baby Dry Diapers Super Pack, Newborn, 112 Countare the best. I have even tried theHuggies Supreme Little Snugglers Newborn - Newborn (36 Ct)and didn't like them. They have a special band and stretchy material that keeps their runny newborn poop in the diaper and not going down their leg. They're also high enough in the back to get most of the poop from going up the back onto their outfits. I usually buy these until size 2 and then go toHuggies Snug & Dry Diapers, Size 4, Giant Pack, 140 Countfor size 3, 4 and then size 5 I do either Huggies orLuvs Ultra Leakguards Diapers, Size 5, 168 Countdepending on price-I don't think that the Luvs have enough stretch in the lower numbers so I only do size 5 or 6. I do love the Pampers cruisers but they're too pricey for me! Good luck!
Great Pampers Swaddlers Diapers Economy Pack Plus Size 2 204 Count, Love pampers, even thought i don't use it myself. My son does. he is 7 month old. ^_^  Pamper rocks.
Thank you very much. This is a good one on market, easy to use, I like the green link which let me that diapper is wet.
We used these in the hospital an then purchased them when the babies came home. My twins were in newborn size for about 6 weeks. The blue line is about useless, but I just changed them after every feeding.
I've never had a problem with Swaddlers.  They were the first kind of diaper I used on my son and they got the job done.  They are super soft and pretty absorbent, they also smell great (when unused of course!), They also fit my baby very well.  The Huggies seem to run a little bit smaller.  The only thing that I think would improve these diapers is if they made them "baby shaped" like the Huggies.
I heard from other parents and also from reading reviews that the Pampers swaddlers were great diapers.Well, after trying out Huggies, Target brand, and Pampers, my wife and I really like Pampers the best.  Why?Hey, when you're holding the baby, you don't want to suddenly feel wetness coming through on those newly washed clothes.  I found it pretty annoying to have to change the diapers, toss the clothes in the laundry, and wash the baby with the other brands, when I should have been playing with the baby. I think the Huggies did a fine job provided that you changed the diapers frequently to keep the absorbancy intact.  In the end, it was worth paying a little extra $ to get less leaks.  The one thing that Huggies did a better job of was the diapers seemed to be less perfumy.  Pampers seem to have more of the "baby/talcum smell".
Pampers Swaddlers is our favorite diaper, the blue line that shows if the diaper is wet is great! The swaddlers are also softer than the Huggies brand.
My family LOVES Pampers Swaddlers diapers. They are by far the softest diaper that we've used. I think we've pretty well made our rounds on the different brands of diapers, too. We also use cloth diapers about half the time, and Swaddlers are still our preference. Neither one of my sons have ever had any kind of allergy from Pampers, either. We have ran across some that have broken them out, but not Pampers. I HIGHLY recommend Swaddlers. In my opinion, as far as diapers are concerned, they are the absolute best!!
This is a simple choice.  That live and learn commercial should apply to these diapers.  My sister has three children, she tried about every type out there and settled on these because they were the only ones that didn't "blow out."  She is extremely cheap, so if she buys the more expensive diapers then you know they are worth it.  We tried the ones in the hospital, but when we tried these we donated the others and never looked back.  They don't cause diaper rash (and we have sensitive skin and can't use Huggies products).  They don't leak (when we have two leaks in one week we know it is time to move up a size, we literally will go a month or more without a leak).  And they stay on (well until our 30 month-old figured out how to remove them, but she is ready to potty train anyway).  They are definately worth it!!
Love the swaddlers for the little wetness indicator. Great because they're soft inside and out and guard against leaks. Best value online!
My daughter has put these to the test and they have withstood the challenge.  After some serious blowouts and some pees that could rival a race horse we still have yet to have any type of leaks.  The fit is great, they are comfortable to her and they keep everything from getting messy.  What more could you ask for from a diaper for an infant?
my daughters and I love it, it is comfortable, soft and absorvent. The wetness indicator is a big help specially for the first six months.
Works great for us. As a new mom the blue line was very helpful. After these we moved to Pampers Curisers. Amazon was the best price we ever found for these.
I am not one to buy name brands but I will admit I do like the Pampers Swaddlers for my 3 month old.  They are super soft and thin, yet very absorbent.  I have yet to have a leak in them and I have no doubt had she been wearing an off brand there would have been a blowout!  The Size 1 diapers (8-14 lbs.) fit her perfectly in the front, back and crouch area.  The Velcro tabs on the sides stick like should and they are easily re-attached if need be.  The front has a cute Sesame Street character and a yellow strip for a wetness indicator.  I really though can't get over how soft and thin they are, its amazing how great they work.
They are very soft and comfortable for the baby.  Throw-away diapers are so convenient for every day use as well as when you are away from home.
Pampers Swaddlers are great diapers.  While other diaper brands can provide equal coverage and protection, there is no other diaper that is as soft and smooth as these.
These are our 'go to' diapers and have been since our son was born.  We end up using fewer diapers because these seldom leak.
We're on our 2nd kid and use Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers with wetness indicator line exclusively.The key is the wetness indicator -- when you're not sure and don't want to go through the trouble of unwrapping the kid from a diaper only to find they didn't wet or poop it up . . . the wetness indicator lets you quickly make that decision.Besides that, minimal blow outs and side leakage, no irritating elastic bands near the legs and able to handle huge volumes of pee.Hook up the amazon mom and subscribe and save and they are reasonably priced relative to big box stores.
These are the best diapers. They are softer than any other brand out there and really feel more like cloth than a diaper (great for sensitive baby skin).  They hold liquid well and are nice and high on the backside to contain leaks.
We have used these diapers since we brought our daugther home from the hospital. No issues with diaper rash or big blowouts (that we had with Luvs or Babier R Us diapers when we had some of those diapers passed down to us from friends).  The yellow to blue line is also a quick visual to see if she is wet. You can buy these diapers at time at even a greater discount if you look for &#34;open box&#34; deals-these are repackaged diapers (sometimes from returns) but the diapers themselves are perfect and have never been opened from the plastic bags inside the box.  These diapers will save you from getting stains on your baby's clothes.
Pampers has been the best brand of diapers for our baby. They feel soft and rarely leak. I loved getting this big box, but my son did outgrow this size diaper before we could finish using all the diapers.
This is by far the best diapers for newborn. The indicator lets you know when to change the baby. I would recommend this to new parents.
I love Pampers, they fit my LO's so well, very few blow outs! I love the wetness indicator on the smaller diapers as well.
Swaddlers Rock! They are quite possibly the SOFTEST diaper i've ever touched! No poop outs. No pee outs. Just a great, great product. An when you grow out of these head for the Pamper's Baby Dry's. They are awesome as well.If you are a diaper cake maker, the Swaddlers are the best for your cake creations. What a great gift for a mom to be! Get her hooked on them right away.Now we know the prices on these diapers average 23-27 cents they are worth it. Even if you only used them at nights and put on a cheaper diaper for day wear. We splurged and lived on these diapers with our newborn! Made the days & nights more enjoyable and less filled with crib sheet changing and outfit changings.
We have used Pampers Swaddlers for my son since he was born.  We tried other brands and styles of diapers but none were as effective as the Swaddlers.  My son has never had even a hint of diaper rash despite sleeping through the night since he was been 9 weeks old, and I credit these diapers.  There is a mesh lining in the Swaddlers style that seperates baby's bottom from any peeps or poops.  I don't know how it works, but these diapers suck all the moisture into them so even if the diaper is soaked your baby's bottom is still dry!  My son was big at birth and has continued to grow rapidly.  None of the stores near me carry size 3 Swaddlers.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  They have the size 3's and between Amazon Mom and subscribe and save they are cheaper than anywhere else even with coupons or sales.
I received these from Trend Marketing...and so far they seem like the same ones in the Hospital. I kept one diaper, and the new ones I just received do not have any foul odor indicating Dry Max as described by others. I will do an update if my baby baby(little Kristian &lt;3) gets any rashes... I pray they don't give him any or I'll be really pissed. This is my 3rd baby and Swaddlers are the best diaper if you can get it w/o dry max... Only w/o dry max. Its not worth the risk...you can't heal your baby once they get a rash :( Huggies are 2nd best but w/ boys they leak because the run a little bigger than swaddlers and when the wee wee sticks up when the have to pee if the diapers been on for a while(still dry) the pee just goes straight on the clothes not on diaper. (No problems w/ poop leaks on Huggies)
Great quality and absorption, no leakings.  I bought two of these boxes, but my baby outgrew them very fast.  I ended up giving away half of the box.
Most hospitals I know of will use these Pampers Swaddlers diapers for babies born in the hospital. I am sure many of you are buying these because it was what your baby first used at the hospital.I have been ordering these exact diapers (either from sellers Trend marketing or Planet Stuff, both "fulfilled by Amazon") for about a month now for my newborn (born 6lbs 7oz). They fit her great and we have not had any leaks or blowouts (knock on wood). They are soft, seemingly comfortable for her, and I do not believe that it irritates her skin.Here comes the tricky part.As you may or may not know, Pampers has something called "DRY MAX" that is added to some diapers to make them more absorbent. These extra substances may or may not irritate your baby's skin. Search online and you will find that many people have complained about having DRY MAX in the diapers and it giving their baby a rash.To convolute things even more, go to a local store that sells diapers and you will probably find that some Pampers Swaddlers packages say "with Dry Max" on them and some dont. So Pampers makes two versions of Swaddlers, one with Dry max and one without? WRONG! (well, according to Pampers themselves that is wrong).Straight from Pampers themselves:1. Any regular Pampers Swaddlers (non-Sensiitive versions) diapers have Dry-Max2. Pampers Swaddlers SENSITIVE do NOT have Dry-MaxSo, what about these diapers? They are marked as Pampers Swaddlers (non-Sensitive). So we assume they have Dry-Max in them right? WRONG! Pampers does it again and confuses us even more --- order these (from the sellers i listed) and you will notice that packaging has a special little symbol on it that reads "SPECIALIZED HOSPITAL PRODUCT". What's that all about? I contacted Pampers again:"Thanks for writing!There is some packaging that is normally not offered at the retail level.  These Swaddlers are going to be plain white for the hopsitals, and the make up of the diaper is like Swaddlers Sensitive.  "So there you have it. Even those these are marked as Regular Swaddlers, they are a special hospital version and do NOT have Dry-max (a.k.a. are made like Swaddlers Sensitive).whew, that was confusing!When my baby moves up to size 1, i will go straight to Swaddlers Sensitive and not even deal with this dry-max vs. non-drymax fiasco (note: many people are happy with dry-max too! just depends on your baby!)hope this helps!!!!edit* just wanted to mention, in the Amazon picture for this product you can actually see the special symbol. It is a white circle with a + in the middle, and around it says "Specialized Hospital Product"
My husband and I received MANY diapers at showers before our son was born.  The swaddlers are by far my favorite diaper!  These are the kinds of diapers that were used at the hospital when my son was born and I was fascinated by the color changing strip in front.  The strip turns from yellow to green when wet.  These diapers have never leaked and can hold a lot of liquid!  My son slept for 7 hours the other night and had a full diaper in the morning, it was heavy, but he was dry!
We just switched out 10ish pound 5 week old to the size 1's because we had been having leakage problems with her Newborn size Swaddlers. This did the trick! I love these diapers and plan to continue using then. The wetness indicator strip is great - although you can still usually tell by 'feel,' the stripe takes the guesswork out. The stretchy sides seem comfortable for our little one and when the sizing is correct, we've had no leakage problems except for big blowouts (which you can't do a whole lot about!).Baby rarely complains about a wet diaper because these do a really great job of wicking moisture away from her skin (there's almost a mesh stuff between the soaker-up-part and her), which should help prevent rashes and helps keep her happy. It's also nice because we don't HAVE to change her at night etc if she's wet but not complaining - good to not have to wake up a sleeping baby in the middle of the night after a feeding just to change a diaper!
NO LEAKS! Well, as long as you are using the right size! These are so soft and the indicator line is a big plus. They handle blow outs well, but no matter what diaper you use, blowouts will happen. They also keep baby dry, no rashes yet!
We switch to Pampers after my daughter broke out in an allergic reaction to Huggies and never went back. After having no relief from perscription creams and doctor visits my sister suggested to switch diapers as it might be an allergy.  As soon as we changed diaper brands the rash went away.We don't have leak problems, no diaper blow outs, and they never stuck to my children.  Pampers are priced way better on Amazon compared to Target and even Costco.
I see a bunch of debate here in the comments about whether the diapers in this package are the "hospital" newborn diapers, or the "regular" Pampers Swaddlers newborn diapers.  For myself -- I am not sure.  Looking at the case we just received (our second case of these) the special "+" symbol others have referred to is not on the packages.  I'd add also that I don't specifically remember that symbol on the ones we took with us from the hospital, either... so your mileage may vary.If you need these diapers, you're probably also too tired to remember such details unless your infant has a particular issue which requires the "sensitive" diapers.  I know that in our house, sleep is a fond however distant memory!Our twins go through diapers.  Lots of diapers.  We're already on our second case of these, and we like them a lot.  So far, zero blow-outs, and very few leaks.These diapers are a huge upgrade from thePampers Swaddlers Preemie New Baby Diapers 20 eathat we started with (we bought those from the baby store in packs of, strangely, 31????).  The Preemie diapers lack the tell-tale yellow strip that turns blue when wet.  We use that strip like a gauge to tell us when diaper change time is approaching even in the absence of poo.  I find it particularly useful to tell when the diaper is wet, because the structure and crystals inside the diapers do such a great job of trapping the wetness that it doesn't even feel wet to the touch - inside.Complaints?  Few from our house.  We'd like an even larger and more economical package - like I said, we go through a lot of diapers!  The small 20-diaper packs in this case are also hard to open - I'd really like it if they had a tear strip or perforation on them so I can open them neatly and easily without dangerous scissors or trying to tear the plastic with a not-so-happy baby in my other arm.Overall, we really like these, and have no plan to switch brands.
These diapers never leak.  I feel like we've tried everything on the market (2 kids!) and find these to be the best.  I highly recommend them to anyone that asks.  I'm also disappointed they stop at size3!
Love these diapers - no leaks, fit well, doesn't restrict movement, great price with subscribe and save - thanks amazon!
I like the blue indication line and the fact that there is a fragrance to mask most of the smell of stool and urine.  It's far from perfect, but it's the best I have used thus far.
I tried all brands but this one doesn't leak at all.  The size works well with my kids because it's never usually too big or too small.
As far as I'm concerned, a diapers job it so keep "me" dry, and if it keeps my baby dry too, that's an extra bonus.  I've seen some BIG messes and yet, i stay dry (at least while the diaper is on).  So i highly recommend these!!!  And haven't been able to find them anywhere cheaper than Amazon subscribe and save.  Thanks Amazon!
I've sampled numerous brands of diapers on all three of my children--2 girls and a boy--and Pampers has ALWAYS been the best at containment and comfort.  Some of the other brands leaked so badly (pee and/or poo), it was as if they weren't even wearing a diaper.  It was SO frustrating, not to mention an expensive waste of money!  With Pampers, there were little to no blow-outs or wetness leakages.  Pampers diapers also seem to be more absorptive in the sense of better keeping moisture and filth away from baby's skin to prevent diaper rash and/or allowing it to heal.  All my babies have been Pampers babies.
The pampers brand has been in the family for 40 yrs now. Trust in the name. Loved the swaddlers because of the fit!
Swaddlers are the best diapers we have purchased. The indicator strip is great for us because she doesn't always tell us when she needs to be changed. We haven't had diaper rash at all because we are able to change her at the first sign of wetness because of the strip rather than waiting for her to cry. It is awesome and great for new parents. I am giving these for all new moms for shower gifts!
We found Pampers to be the best newborn diaper. They are great with leaks and the wetness indicator was a huge help to my husband.
This was the first time we had used diapers that weren't specifically for sensitive skin.  We've used thePampers Swaddlers Sensitive Diapers Economy Pack Plus Size 1, 192 Count (Packaging May Vary)and Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Diapers, Stage 1 (8-14 Lbs), 56-Count Packages (Pack of 4) (224 Diapers), since they are both designed for sensitive skin.  I'd heard good things from other parents about the "regular" Pampers Swaddlers, so decided to try.I have been very pleased.  We have had no skin reaction (rash) with these, which is a huge relief.  They fit well and we haven't had any major leaks or blowouts.While I also liked the Swaddlers Sensitive, I was glad to get the "extra" diapers that come in the "regular" Swaddlers box.  We are now finished with the Size 1 diapers, and have moved into size 2.  So far the fit and performance is good.  I highly recommend the Pampers Swaddlers.
We've tried other diapers, and there is a reason that Pampers are more expensive. Less mess, less hassle, line indicator. Other brands leak and we've had problems with. Pampers is dependable and is the gold standard of diapers.
Overall, this diaper is a great first diaper to use for your newborn.  I bought pampers because that's the only brand I had really heard prior to becoming a mother.  I was very satisfied with how soft they are and how the elastic legs don't seem to be too tight for babies.  As a first time parent, I also appreciate the wetness indicator.  I became obsessed with changing my baby if I even saw a hint of the stripe.  Now that he's 1 year old, I can relax a bit...These are the diapers I choose when I make diaper cakes for girlfriends' baby showers.  They have a very white, fluffy and soft look to them... and I know the diapers will get used since they're considered a "premium."While I really like these, I also highly recommendHuggies Pure & Natural Diapers, Newborn, 72 Countbecause those don't have a scent.  The pampers scent isn't very strong but it's noticeable whereas the Huggies Pure and Natural is odorless.
These are the only diapers that fit my kids right. Package arrived on time and in good condition.  This is about a 3 hour diaper.
These diapers are, hands down, my favorites. They fit my baby boy very well, they are super soft and they absorb a LOT of liquid. He sleeps between 10-12 hours every night and I don't have to change him once during that whole time. Swaddlers are definitely a favorite in this house!
It keeps the mess most of the time inside even though we are pretty close to the upper weight limit. Recently we had few rush but only because it's getting too small for my son. We are just upgrading to size 2. Generally, I would recommend to upgrade as soon as the baby hit the lower limit of next size.
as a pampers the best that's it. I did try to buy different brand but I came back to it
Pampers, in my opinion, are the best diapers! I love them. My daughter has a problem with other brands making her break out or have blow outs. These are amazing on both fronts! I will not buy a different brand!Although I prefer the "sensitive" ones, these are still awesome!
I love Pampers brands even though they are little pricey than others. And the ebulk is just enough to last my baby the whole month. Love that I get them automatic thru Amazon Moms and the price is better than in store!
We just had our first, so being new to the diaper world, we tried quite a few different styles and brands before figuring out which were the best. We found that Huggies, the most expensive diapers out there, seemed to leak no matter what the style. Your average grocery store brand did better than those and at a fraction of the price. The absolute best in leak protection though, we're Pampers without a doubt. And I especially like the Swaddlers, because of how easy they are to put on them and the handy little color-changing strip that lets you know baby might need a change. ;)
These diapers are wonderful! The best thing about Swaddlers as opposed to regular Pampers is the elastic that goes all around the waist. Not only does this give a perfect fit no matter your baby's size but it really does help prevent messy leaks. The extra couple of dollars you spend on Swaddlers is more than worth it. I only wish they came in larger sizes!
For every derriere there is the perfect diaper. It just so happens that this diaper was an excellent fit. No leaks and it keeps baby dry. The diaper size is such that it is not an issue to pack multiple diapers in the bag without having too much space taken. I would recommend.
The hospital first used these on our little guy when he was born. But my other two used a different brand, so of course following the old ways of doing things, I used the other name brand the other two kids used when they were babies. But this little guy was allergic to them... Using pampers swaddlers after a few changes his rash cleared up and hasnt come back. I just wish they made them in size 4. Swaddlers sensitive come in 4 but you get less diapers in a box for more money... Overall, highly recommended diapers.
these are the best first diaper.  our hospital used them and so did we.  we stayed in them through size 2
Super soft , super absorbent and super cute.. never ever leaks with pee but sometimes leaks with a blowout. But that's pretty normal specialy if the baby is on his back..holds pee for 12 hrs at night with no problems at all.. My daughter is 4 months old 16 lbs..she's in size 3 now although size 2 still fits her, I prefer going one size up when the baby is about to reach the weight limit..I was going to switch to cruisers after size 3, but now swaddlers have size 4 & 5.. so I might keep using them..
love pampers swaddlers. they fit so nicely, not to tight on my growing baby. and they keep him nice and dry even through the night. will def buy again!
They really are the best. I am one of the weird people that love the way they smell too. They smell like Cabbage Patch dolls. We haven't had ANY leaks or blow outs with Pampers swaddlers, and the only place I buy them from is Amazon. They don't even carry these huge boxes in regular retail stores. So much more convenient and cost effective. I'm always on the lookout for the warehouse deals too. It really is a great deal, and all of the boxes of diapers I've received through the warehouse deals are factory sealed like new.
I used Pampers for my children years and years and years ago and loved them then. 30 years later, they only gotten better! Love the fact the these diapers have an ultra-dry layer with aloe for extra protection.  The fit is perfect, no leak factor, and wetness indicator are all new improvements in the Pampers product over the years.Pampers brand, is a name you can trust and this particular variety is highly recommended. Wouldn't buy any other brand.
These diapers are wonderful for us. Our daughter was average weight, above average height, with sensitive skin, and breastfed. She peed A LOT since she was very active and breast milk is digested faster than formula. So I changed a lot of wet diapers :)I am so glad the wetness indicator strip is BACK!  With our next baby we will use these too. They kept our daughter bone dry and comfy without the bulk. I did not notice a chemical smell from them at all and our daughter has never had a diaper rash with pampers, even without rash cream.I am due with our second baby in April and he or she will be a pampers baby too!
There is a reason Pampers have been around for so long - they are a name that you can trust, and their quality of diapers keeps getting better.  When it comes to your newborn nothing is too good or too gentle for their sensitive skin.  With the fantastic fit and comfort that Pampers has for all of their diapers, these diapers have a helpful wetness indicator so you know right away when your little one needs to be changed.Highly recommended for all those tiny tushies - you can't go wrong with Pampers!
I just love these Pampers Swaddlers.  They are so soft on my baby.  They don't leak at all either.  I wish they made these in larger sizes.
We love Pampers!  The swaddlers are perfect for newborns and their belly buttons! Size 1 is much better to buy than newborn, they're in size 1 much longer!
Swaddlers are by far the best that I have used for both of my children. Minimal leakage (I have only had issues with spray up the back...ick I know but i am sure that happens with all diapers since babies lay on their backs!) I choose nothing but swaddlers for my munchkins!
I am not sure how people managed without the blue indicator. I love how easy it is to see if I need to change a diaper.
I was a Pampers baby and my son seems to take after me as he doesn't have a reaction to these diapers from Pampers. Guess you can call him a second generation Pampers baby :) He's been a size 1 since he was born and the hospital provided us with Pampers Swaddlers Diapers during our stay. I loved them so much that as soon as we were discharged we ran to the store to purchase a case. These diapers are really soft and super absorbent. Some mornings I wonder how in the world my son's diaper was able to contain so much pee and not leak! We've rarely had any issues with leaks, the only time we did was due to my husband or I not putting it on right (first time parents). Once we got the hang of it though, we haven't had any issues! One tip I can give is to make sure that the ruffle part along the legs are pulled out once the diaper is on. We call it the second protector barrier for those occasional explosions. I love the fact that there's a wetness indicator on these diapers. There's a yellow line that runs from the front to back and it turns blue if it gets wet. Being able to check the color of the line means that we don't have to peek in and risk causing a future leak. One thing that the description does not mention is that the top front of the diapers have baby Sesame Street characters printed on them.
Great fit for my slim little guy, and they kept him dry through the night. Great diaper for the price.
I love these diapers. I have used them on both my kids already. I have no issues with leaks or anything. I love the softness of the diaper and how well it absorbs. Pampers are the BEST diapers in my opinion. Never had issues with them. I buy pampers for all my friends with babies for their showers. I will always recommend pampers products.
only thing is the do have more of a perfume sent to them then other diaper brands, otherwise good diapers
Wonderful diapers, especially for the very little ones. They're soft, not bulky like huggies brand, and they do not leak.
I would recommend Pampers diapers to anyone with a child. They work great! I wish they had the swaddler brand when they get to the bigger sizes.
So, first things first - yes this is a vine review - BUT, these are actually my diaper of choice anyways.My daughter is a tiny little thing.  Her doctor calls her "petite and perfect".My daughter (G) is indifferent to diapers, yet we've only ever used Pampers, Huggies & Safeway store brand.Pampers did something to their diapers I guess before G's time that has a lot of people upset.  Some babies apparently get super rashes from the dry max.  I have very sensitive skin, G has pretty sensitive skin (mild cradle cap/ezema) - everywhere but her butt.  Dry max has NOT been an issue for us.Pampers tend to fit a bit smaller then Huggies IMO.  Pampers have shorter tabs and tighter legs.  For instance - G started out in Pampers NB, they fit great (she was 7.4lbs at birth, 6.13lbs when we left the hospital) but by 6 weeks they were too tight on her thighs. We stretched them out to finish the box. She then used Huggies NB which fit better (stretchier tabs and wider legs) until she was 9 weeks old.  Previously Huggies had been too big on her.We moved her up to size 1 because she was maxing out the holding capacity of NB's.  Pampers fit her big, but were workable. She was about 11lbs at 12 weeks. According to their sizing, she should stay fitting in them for a couple more pounds - UNLESS - like the NB's the legs become too tight.Conclusion:Pampers: shorter tabs, tighter legs, fits small, so best on the smaller side of sizing (7-8lbs NB, 8-11lbs size 1) awesome leakage protectionHuggies: stretchier tabs, bigger legs, fits large, so best on the bigger size of sizing (8-10lbs NB...), awesome leakage protectionNOTE #1: I had a small pack of the size 1'a that DID NOT have the wet strip indicator.  I received a big box that did.  I'm not sure if its just luck of the draw or maybe they're fading it out?NOTE #2: Safeway brand is comparable to Huggies, and we liked them too!
These are hands down the best diapers for newborns up to size 2. We didn't like the sensitive version but these are just the right thickness, they have a wetness indicator (though I wouldn't bother using it, chances are good the baby is wet!). We had some issues with leaks and blow outs here and there but that's to be expected in any type of diaper every now and then. They are pricey but worth it for baby's comfort!
love that it still has the line to tell you when its wet, cuz tho i can tell my hubby cant lol, he needs the line. they are blanket soft, smell like a baby, and do not leak even over night when my son sleeps 12 hours. better than any other diapers out there, better than huggies premium and with subscibe and save i save tons and get these that are not avail in stores in bulk amount at fraction of the cost. plus i live in a small town and saves me a 2 hour round trip to get the good diapers .
These are great diapers. They hold an unbelievable amount of liquid without leaks. They manage to whisk away the liquid from the baby so he is more comfortable for longer.They are easy to put on and the elastic fasteners work well and are reposition-able.Great diaper. No wonder these are the choice of hospitals.
Swaddlers are way better than baby dry, may be personal preference . Soft, smell good and don't cause diaper rash.
I loved these diapers for both my girls when they were sensitive skinned newborns.  The &#34;wet indicator&#34; was fabulous for late night changes.
Last time Consumer Reports rated diapers, the Cruisers were given the highest mark.  These diapers are super-absorbent and sell for a good price.  I like them.  They prevent leaks and are easy to put on.  BTW, even if a baby is a few ounces short of 16 pounds, these fit perfect, too.  Of course, your mileage may vary.  I wish I had these when I was an infant.
We've always used cruisers - they're perfect, especially since they never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, leakoh, did I mention that they never leak?
I ran out of these diapers and started using LUVS which worked ok during the day but every night we were getting leaks.  I switched back to Pampers Cruisers and thankfully no more leaks.  I know these are more expensive but they are worth it.  I like their stretchy tabs because I feel like they move with my son better than any other brand.  Our second child is on the way and I will not be switching around this time.  I will purchase Pampers Swaddlers and then Pampers Cruisers.  I will not have the time or patience for leaks and all the extra laundry that involves.
I do not know what we would have done if these were not made, our son is 2 1/2, not fat at all but very tall, he is as tall as most 4 year old and wears size 4 and 5t clothes. His father is very tall too. He is potty training and in underwear during the days but we had nothing to put on him at night that fit anymore, the pull-ups training pants leak after only one pee with him, so not good for night, the overnights were too small and we were tired of changing sheets and he would not wake up when he leaked and we felt horrible finding him sleeping in a wet spot of pee in the morning. These diapers are truly a blessing. They work great, no leaks! We discovered them at our local grocery store one day and were paying $16 for 18 diapers for a month, then I searched them on Amazon and was so glad to find them. Thanks Pampers for making a larger size diaper, and thanks amazon for selling them, plus now that I know you can have the convenience of diaper delivery I will never go back to lugging home big boxes of diapersand wipes again, and we have our third baby due in October!
I have tried other diaper brands, but really like the protection of the pampers diapers. I will only buy pampers diapers now.
We loved Pampers Swaddlers for our newborn, so when he needed size 3, we tried Pampers Cruisers.  They fit great.  They have stretchy sides and velcro tabs that stay closed, even when opened and reclosed several times.  The diapers have a baby powder scent that helps mask urine odors, but it's not strong enough so that I don't know a poopy diaper needs to be changed.  They are really absorbent and we have never had leaks when my son has slept for as long as ten hours.The only problem is an occasional unusable diaper.  I've found that about one diaper in every three packages cannot be used because the velcro tab is missing or sewn too far into the diaper.  To me, it is a small price to pay for diapers that I am really happy with.
Been using this since LO was born. They're soft and absorbent. I also use the cloth ones but they're kind of a hassel because they don't seem to stay in place. So I switched to these. I don't change them as often as I should. I change once a day only because I didn't have much leakage.But I know they absorb well because there were times where I couldn't BF my LO and had VERY VERY BAD engorment and leaked a lot. I even had to express some out onto the pads. These held up well! Obviously I had to switch to new ones afterwards but they held up well! I think it had about 1 oz of milk leaked/expressed onto each pad and it still seem like it can hold more.
These are really good, as they are individually packed and has a little sticky tape that allows it to be attached. I have recommend this to my friends who are going to be have their babies soon.
I've tried several brands of pads and these are hands down my favorite. Their best feature? 2 sticky areas instead of 1. They actually stay in place and hold up to me opening and closing my bra with them in it. They're soft, they absorb a huge amount without leaking, and they don't show under t-shirts.
These are so nice for when you are first nursing. I think they absorb extremely well. I have had them on for 24hrs and no leaks. They have adhesive on the back, but I usually just put them in my bra and they were fine. These were also nice because they didn't rub against my nipples at all.
if I could.  When I first had my son the nurses in the hospital suggested different things for leakage.  Some of which made it worse.  I tried different brands of pads when I got home and found these to be the best by far.  I was a fountain in the first couple of months and these never leaked.  If I ever have another child I will go to the hospital with these in my bag.
These work beautifully - I use them every day and they keep me dry and comfortable throughout breastfeeding and leaks!
I've tried a few different kinds of breast pads, and these are my favorite. I tried Boots brand breast pads in the UK and thought they were too plastic-y. They probably gave me mastitis. Then I tried Johnson & Johnson breast pads. At first I liked them because they are very thick and cotton-y and have a little cup for your nipple. However, the nipple cup is a mixed blessing because it also shows through your shirt. These breast pads are a good combination of breathable and slim. They also work -- no leaks. Highly recommended.
I tried these and the Medela pads, and the Lansinoh pads were so much better.  They are a bit thicker than the Medela pads, but still thin enough to where they won't show through your clothes.  I never leaked much, so the absorbency of these pads was never really tested by me, but they worked well when I was opening my nursing bra for frequent feedings.  The adhesive wore off quickly and the pad did not stay stuck to the bra, but the pad held its shape was easy to put back into place.  I have been very happy with these nursing pads.
Great Pampers Swaddlers Diapers Economy Pack Plus Size 2 204 Count, Love pampers, even thought i don't use it myself. My son does. he is 7 month old and up to size 4 now.. ^_^  Pamper rocks.
Best diapers we have used for the baby. Size 3 is larger than a size 3 of Huggies, hence will last longer, thanks!
We just love Pampers. We've had absolutely no blowouts or leaks. They hold a lot of pee so they're great for babies who are sleeping through the night or at least sleep for long periods. They're soft and fit well. I've heard bad things about Huggies and Luvs are almost as good as Pampers, but I think we're a Pampers family for life! (Well, at least until she's out of diapers.)
I love Pampers and this is a cheaper option than their higher priced brands.  They still work great.  No leaks!  Love them!
My daughter has worn Pampers her whole life, starting with Swaddlers Sensitive and has done these Baby Dry exclusively ever since and has never had a diaper rash. They are just good old fashioned diapers with a great fit, elasticized leg openings and easy to use closures. We love the Sesame Street characters too. I always get a laugh when I show her the character each change.
I used these for my little boy last night and they held up! Of course this is only the first night that he's used them but already I'm impressed. My stash of Fisher Price diapers which by the way I HATE! They leaked almost every night but this review is not for them...so...back to my Pampers! The fit is nice the design is cute and best of all they have not leaked! I'm happy so far and will be back in about a week or so for an update! If you're interested in my review the fisher price diapers check out my profile and reviews!Update! One week into my package of Pampers baby dry and wow...all I can say is wow! No leaks at all! I've used brands like Huggies Supreme, Huggies Over nights, Diapers.com, Fisher Price &lt;---Sucks! Out of all the brands I've used these are the best! I've had no leaks at all! These hold it all in even better than the Huggies Overnights which were made for well...Over nights! I have a new favorite brand and I'm so happy I tried these! I would recommend these diapers to parents who are looking for excellent leak protection!Update #2 This is my last and final update...Almost three weeks into the box of diapers and I'm still happy as ever! My husband even took notice! He recently said..."we haven't had any leaks have we?" I proudly said "Nope, not one!" I know I said this before but these are way better than even the Huggies Overnights! I love these and will be sticking with Pampers from here on out!Unfortunately I have to give another update: Although I have had no leaks at all, toward the end of the box my son started to develop this nasty rash. I recently bought a box of Pampers Swaddlers, so we will see how that goes. So far I'm not thrilled with Pampers. :(  It's great that there have been no leaks, but my son has a nasty rash! What is that about?!?
These suckers can hold a LOT of pee.  Our daughter was peeing out every diaper we put on; with these, no more leaks!
Sometimes I can't believe how much liquid this diaper holds! My son is a BIG boy and sometimes the diaper is so saturated it looks like it'll burst, but it doesn't, and no leaks either.  The little ruffles around the thighs keep the poo smudges to a minimum even when he moves around.  I used to clip coupons and waited for sales at the supermarket, now I just wait for it to come to my front door, for about the same price!  So much more convenient.
I have a 14 month old - 14 month olds eat a lot. They poop and pee a lot. This diaper holds a lot and doesn't leak. It's like a match made in heaven!
I have used Pampers baby dry for both my kids as their general purpose diapers. I didn&#8217;t see the need to purchase the more expensive variations like the cruisers or swaddlers. These fit well, material is soft, and they are very absorbent. The only other type of diaper I use are the bedtime ones.
We use these diapers when we put the baby down at night. We were having a lot of leaking issues with another brand and it was very frustrating trying to change the sheets and baby's clothing at 2am! I thought we'd give this product a try and we are leak free during the night! (And yes these diapers can hold a lot!)
I have used Pampers ever since my son was born and I have yet had a wet bed an occasional blow out but these diapers keep my baby dry no rashes and holds alot of urine. I will never switch worth the price and even cheaper if you subscribe
My daughter is tall and skinny (75th percentile for height and 10th percentile for weight) and these diapers have worked great for her since she was in the size twos.  Very few blowouts when she was younger and now in the size threes and eating solid food, I don't think we've had any.  She has sensitve skin and we haven't had any issues caused by these diapers (other brands yes, these diapers, no).  Here on Amazon they are the best price I've found by far with Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save.  They always come quickly and we've never had any issues with the packaging.  Highly recommend.
I have been a Pampers mom since the birth of my firstborn. I like the baby dry better than the cruisers because these fit her better. They seem to be slimmer and longer (sits higher on the waist). We are nearly done with diapers for the older one now, but I will buy them again for the baby when she grows in to 5's
The prices always seem very reasonable and the quality is very good. They hold a lot and are reliable. They seem to be pretty breathable which is always a plus in the summertime since she seems to get rashes somewhat easily due to the heat. I would highly recommend these.
I love economy pack, they give you a lot for your bucks. This pack lasted over a month and I never experienced any leakage. I will buy again
I recommend the baby dry over the pampers cruisers because these are not cheap looking like the other ones are!Also these are the only ones you can get in sensitive as apposed to the others that are scented and won't give your baby a rash!
These never cause diaper rash, and I've never seen them leak.  The price is reasonable, and our 2-year-old likes the pattern printed on these diapers.  My wife and I wish we had tried this brand right from the beginning.
These diapers work great for my son - no leaks, and he has full range of motion with walking.  He can wear them all night without problems.  I would higly recommend, especially with subscribe and save through amazon
I've sampled numerous brands of diapers on all three of my children--2 girls and a boy--and Pampers has ALWAYS been the best at containment and comfort. Some of the other brands leaked so badly (pee and/or poo), it was as if they weren't even wearing a diaper. It was SO frustrating, not to mention an expensive waste of money! With Pampers, there were little to no blow-outs or wetness leakages. Pampers diapers also seem to be more absorptive in the sense of better keeping moisture and filth away from baby's skin to prevent diaper rash and/or allowing it to heal. All my babies have been Pampers babies.
We buy these diapers for use at night.  They are very absorbent but with young babies (3-6 months) they really only last about 6 hours or through two feedings.
Pampers are the best diapers! I will never buy any other diapers. My baby stays dry, she rarely wets through. Any other diapers she immediately soaks through to her clothes. Love the pampers!
My 9 month old daughter has been wearing pampers since birth, and has not had a single diaper rash! We used Swaddlers for the first few months, then switched to baby dry when she was 5 mos. She's a chunky baby, and pampers fit her very well.
was 2 months and I NEVER have leaks. And buying them from Amazon is really the cheapest. I buy at least 30 bucks worth at a time...shipping is FREE that way. They are cheaper than the grocery store, tax free, AND delivered to my door step?? Where's the catch here?I've been doing this for a couple months and there is NO better way to buy diapers. It's like having disposable diaper service. God Love whoever thought of this. ;)
Once our son hit size 2 the swaddlers started leaking and the baby dry were the only ones that could keep him dry all night.  We have stuck with them cuz they work.
Love the delivery to the door and diapers my babies butts free of rash :) Never had issues with leaks for boy or girl. I am a mother of 2 18 months apart :)
At the end of the day and trying all those eco-friendly diapers,this is my "go to" brand. No chemicals no issues,it is soft,works great,breathable and great value!
pampers are def the best diapers ever. tried a whole bunch of others but nothing holds like pampers do. so happy not to have to change clothing any more along with wet diapers
Good Deal with S&S and Prime, but when the budget is tight we go even cheaper, trying not to spend more than .18 per diaper.
These are bar none the best newborn diapers we've tried. They are super absorbent and allow our little guy to stay asleep longer even after wetting the diaper. They are so absorbent that it is hard to tell if he is wet or not! They fit well, are soft, and ride high up his back to keep poo where it belongs. No poo explosions with these guys. We're pleased with them, and please that Amazon ships them to our front door for a better price than even the big-box wholesalers.Try them, you won't be disappointed.
These diapers are great!  Keep little one nice and dry.  No leaks at all.  I will definitely purchase these again.
I tell everyone I know when the get preggers not to waste time with any other brand. You just can't go wrong with Pampers IMO. After trying literally every diaper out there I prefer these hand's down. You couldn't even give me huggies for free :P. Seriously... even at my baby shower if you gave me diaper's that weren't Pamper's I gave them away to other pregnant friends.
I love baby dry diapers. They keep my daughter dryer for longer which is wonderful. Also between my Amazon prime discount, and the subscribe and save I got a really nice price on the diapers, which I could never find in the store. These and Luvs are the only two diapers that we have never had a leaking problem with.  Highly recommend these diapers and AMAZON Subscribe and save.
It seems to be the most flexible and comfortable on my little one's bum. The diapers do cost a few cents more than LUVs which seems to be the cheapest, but I still kept coming back to these because they are so well made.If you're looking for some advice on other baby registry essentials, check out AllMomsArePerfect dot com. You'll get the lowdown on what you really need and what you could save to buy later or avoid completely.
I used to subscribe to the Luvs diapers but didn't like the strong "baby powder" scent so I decided to try these Pampers Baby Dry. I read some reviews from people who complained about the "new Baby Dry" and how it was attributing to diaper rashes but in the last few weeks, we've not hand any problems and I love that there is no overpowering scent. These are a couple of cents more expensive per diaper which could add up if you're really concerned about saving but I would rather have a diaper we're happy with.
ive been purchasing diapers  for years.these are perfect they are soft,absorb well even at night.they work better than the new cruisers.i have bought these and cruisers,the old ones worked well.the new ones leak everywhere especially infront.i have never had a poo leak from these diapers.unless your child has diarrhea there shouldnt be any leaks.these are also a better value than the cruisers.
This has been our favorite brand so far...I change our daughter on average every 2 hours during the daytime, so it is not for lack of changing-- my daughter just holds her pee and does a big &#34;waterfall&#34;...it is a fast flow! This has been the only diaper to be able to absorb quick enough! While I would prefer to use organic/completely non-toxic diapers-- they just cannot hold up. I tried multiple brands in the beginning (lots of baby shower diaper gifts!)...this is the only winner so far.
No leaking, no discomfort, not moving around just working very well. I never had an issue with pampers. Love it.
I have tried many diaper brands including many store brand diapers.  However, I always end up going back to Pampers even though they cost more.  Pampers are the softest and they seem to hold the most waste.  They also seem to keep kids the dryest and the Baby Dry does not tend to fall apart.  These diapers have good elasticity and can fit many body types.  Additionally, they stay secured well and resecure well if they need to be refastened.My only complaint is the Pampers rewards program.  The point system is very skimpy and it takes a very long time to accrue enough points to get a meaningful gift.
The Pampers Baby Dry Diapers 228 Count is the best deal you can possibly get. There are none that even come close. Delivery was amazing it only took 3 days to arrive at my house. The diapers last more than a month you just can't beat that.
I was given some extra Dr. Browns bottles as a hand-me-down but they were missing the middle parts.  I bought two of these packs and they work just fine with both new and old bottles.
These are good replacement parts for the dr brown bottles. After awhile, the rubber part retains odor and you cannot get the smell out. Replacement parts are good to have and to replace old ones.
These will grow germy funk, so it's good to replace every three months or so.  They fit perfectly, of course.  Worth it.
I had to replace my original ones after about a year cuz they had stains I couldn't get off so I felt they were not clean , I actually like these better than the cream colored ones
This is very similar to Destin. It seems to work great at preventing diaper rash. We put it on our baby before bedtime because she doesn't get her diapers changed as often during that time. Thus far, there have been no diaper rash.
Our week-old son had the beginnings of a diaper rash. After putting this on, it was gone by the next time we changed his diaper. A friend who is a nurse recommended this, and it couldn't have worked better.
I know the name is silly and before I had my baby girl I always giggled when I saw it on friends' baby registries. After hearing them swear by this product though (and even switch from OTHER diaper creams) it definitely peaked my interest. Specifically when friends told me about how after using it their little ones' diaper rashes just disappeared. I have used it on my baby girl from day one and I can always tell a difference if someone forgets to put it on her during a diaper change because it's the difference from having no redness when I go to change her, or her having a little redness. It's a thick cream but comes off very easily (both baby's bottom and your hands). It will leave a light tan color in the diaper, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that it absolutely protects your baby, absorbs into their skin to keep it healthy, and is easy to put on and take off! I'll never use another brand!
We tried a bunch of other diaper rash ointments, but none of them seemed to really help. Some even seemed to make the rash worse. With the Boudreaux's however, there was a huge difference after the just the first use. Won't be using those other ones again.
Got through breastfeeding without any pain. Put this on after every rinse on your nipple and before breastfeeding. It's supposed to be okay even if baby ingests it. It's pretty thick and I never had dry cracked nipples using this and/or pain with BFing.
Admittedly this product maybe a little expensive for the size, however, it is worth every penny and i would be lost without it. I thought it would just come in handy with sore cracked nipples but i have also discovered it helps the nipple shields so they stick and do not move around on me and make feeding that much easier. The nipple cream they gave me in the hospital didn't do that, nor did it feel as well as the Motherlove cream feels. My only complaint maybe that it doesn't come in a larger size and i cant put it on subscribe and save.
I have used this with all of my four kids.  I love how you don't have to wipe it off to nurse your little one.  Very soothing, especially during those first few weeks of nursing!
I love motherlove products. Never met one I didn't love.  This one is no exception.  No need to wipe off!
I absolutely love this product! I like this better than Lanolin. I breast feed my first daughter for 10 months. I am now at 10 weeks with my 2nd baby. This is a great product.
I'm a mom of 4. I've been through the cracked/scabbed nipple thing with my daughters too. My sons, for some bizarre (Freudian?) reason have been marathon nursers without problems. Minor problems, but nothing like looking at the raspberry that used to be your nipple (even with proper latch and positioning and all that) and wondering WTH went wrong? LOL... I recommend Nipple Cream by MotherLove.com. It's cheapest through LuckyVitamin.com. That, plus the Ameda Comfort Gel pads... and your nipples will *adore* you. That's what I've been using with my newborn (2nd) son. I alternate between the Comfort Gel pads and the Nipple Cream. I love Lansinoh as well, but I find the Nipple Cream *much* easier to apply to abused nipples.One application of the Nipple Cream will have you seeing instant results with instant relief. I was introduced to it at the hospital, and couldn't believe how much the Nipple Cream helped the pain. A must-buy.
Great for moisturizing. Not scented, very gentle and soothing. Almost the consistency of lip balm but not sticky. I love that you don't even need to wipe if off before nursing because its organic. I would highly recommend to nursing or pumping moms.
Even as a pharmacist, I can not even begin to comprehend how this possibly works, but this formulation is divine. My nipples were salvaged. Thank you MotherLove!
I used this stuff religiously the first few weeks breastfeeding, it was a godsend! I ended up with 2 and kept one upstairs and one downstairs. I also liked that its all natural.
I used to swear by lanolin for nursing after my first daughter was born. When I had my twins, it took my body 2-3 weeks to be able to nurse my girls pain free. This. Stuff. Is. AMAZING. Lanolin kept my skin moist, but this stuff actually HEALED me in between nursing sessions. I can't sing its praises loudly enough.
I've used quite a few nipple creams, and this is by far my favorite. It's easy to apply and moisturizes and protects my nipples. I like this better than the Motherlove Thrush and Diaper Rash salve and Lanolin-it's easier to apply.  I do with it came in a tube instead of a jar because once it's used for a week or so it's hard to use my finger without getting some under my nail-but I just run my nail backwards in the cream to prevent that. It's olive-oil based, so if you don't like the smell of olive oil you might not like this. If left in a hot car (like I did by accident!) it won't change consistency. Highly recommended!
This stuff is fabulous.  It works brilliantly, and it's so much nicer and easier and more gentle to put on than Lanolin paste.  I wish it came in bottles bigger than 1 oz.  Even though a little goes a long way, I am almost out, so I will absolutely be buying more of this.
This is great for nursing moms, but is also a great ointment for whatever ails mom or baby. It seems like a small container for the price, but a little goes a long way. This is a must have for any new mom. I tried several other brands but they were very hard to apply and didn't spread well.
My daughter is an incredible person - she is funny, precocious (*sp) and will fill her bed with pee if she doesn't wear one of these each night. She's a smart girl and getting better at not peeing at night and maybe these are preventing her from advancing towards a more progressive life as a little human because when she wears these she never wets the bed - her pull-up is 5lbs heavier but the bed remains dry. Woot?!
I love these training pants with the cool alert liner!  I'd tried the kind with the fade-when-wet designs, and it only served to tell ME when they were wet.  The cool alert told my little girl when she was wet AS she was wetting herself, which helped her develop self-control--the whole goal of potty training.  I plan to use these as my subsequent children reach potty training age!  Would highly recommend these!
My daughter (3.5 years) is potty trained during the day but still needs some help at night.  These work great.  They are comfortable for her and hold a minor amount of pee.
This product came doctor recommended, so we switched from Desitin to Butt Paste. Well worth it. It's has an oily finish that keeps a protective layer over any rashy areas, and seems to work well as a preventative measure.
I got this on recommendation from a mother of two when we had our first little girl:Pros- Smells much better than Desitin- Not greasy at all- Easy access container (easy open, easy close, wide mouth jar)- Prevents diaper rash effectively, and soothes other irritations when they pop upCons- A little pricier than other options -- that aside -- no criticisms of this product!Get some -- its worth spending a little more to keep your little one from being uncomfortable and cranky!

I use this size at her changing table and the tubes in her diaper bag or at quick change spots in other areas of the house! The lid on this one pops up so you're not having to unscrew a lid with one hand on the baby which I think is a very convenient aspect!
We have been using Boudreauxs since our daughter was born, and she has never had a diaper rash (she is 9mos). We now only use it at night because she wears an overnight diaper for about 12 hours.
I am so happy with this purchase. We recently took our 1 year old on her first flight and used this bag to carry her car seat in (still an infant car seat -- Chicco Keyfit 30 ).The bag is padded everywhere except the zipper flap portion, which theoretically i guess doesnt really need to be padded because that's where the seat goes in.The bag is more designed to hold a bigger car seat, so when you are using an infant seat you have plenty of extra room to spare. We put more items in like diapers, blankets, clothes, etc.I greatly appreciate the backpack straps, makes it a lot easier to lug around.I flew United and Southwest, both let us gate check this big bag which is really nice (gate check means you leave it at the doorway of the airplane, they pick it up, and then when you get off the airplane you pick it up right there, no need to go to baggage claim). At your gate you just ask the person at the desk for a gate check tag.The only annoying thing about this bag is that it is so big that it wont fit through the security scanner conveyor belt. I had to take everything OUT (carseat, etc) and run each item one-by-one through security. However, that inconveninece is WELL worth it to me to be able to gate check it, instead of checking it in and having to pick it up at baggage claim.
This is a great bag. Easy to carry as a back-pack and kept our car seat in perfect condition during the flight.
I recommend this backpack carseat travel bag to other parents constantly. It is so hard to maneuver toddlers in a stroller, all of the luggage and the children's carseats through the airport and I find this bag to be the perfect solution. Both my husband and I wear one of these carseat backpacks on our backs through the airport with our toddler's carseats in them. This leaves us hands free for one person to wheel the carry on suitcases while the other one pushes the tots in the double stroller through the airportTravel tips:- you can store extra items with the carseats in these travel bags! I usually include a bag of diapers, , extra jackets, blankets, and stuffed toys for the kids on top of the carseat in the bag so that I don't have to overload my carry on luggage with it. Just be sure that the extra items that you store with the travel bag are light enough so that it does not add a lot of extra weight to the backpack and hurt your back as you wear it through the airport. As long as I just include some light clothing items and some diapers along with the carseat in this bag, as a woman, I have no problem carrying the weight of the bag through the airport.- If you aren't gate checking your carseat in this bag you can also take it onto the plane. Just remove the carseat for use, and simply fold the bag in half and put it in the overhead bin containing the few extra items (clothes, diapers etc) that you put inside it. I find this to be so helpful as it is often difficult to find places in carry on luggage for everyone's jackets, extra toys and changes of clothing that you want to have handy during the flight.- Though most carseats fit in this bag with no problems, some oddly shaped carseats, like the Safety First Air do not fit in this bag because the wings by the headrest of the carseat stick out too far for the bag to be zippered closed. However, although we have a Safety First Air seat, we still use this travel bag with it by zipping the bag up as far as it will go around the carseat and by using a bungee cord around the travel bag to ensure that it doesn't fall out of the bag when we wear it through the airport. (However, I would only do this  bungee cord solution to wear the bag as a backpack through the airport. I would not trust gate checking or checking as luggage the carseat in this bag with only the bungee cord to hold the seat in the bag).We have used two of these travel bags for countless trips and have had no problems with the bag ripping or getting holes. The travel bag is also  very well padded on the inside and it has protected our carseats from any damage through countless trips. Our toddlers sleep so much better on the plane in their carseats and without these backpack travel bags I have no idea how we would manage to get the children, carry on bags and two carseats through the airport and onto the plane. I am usually asked once per trip to the airport where I got these bags by other parents who are struggling horribly  to carry their carseats and luggage through the airport. I cannot recommend them highly enough!
