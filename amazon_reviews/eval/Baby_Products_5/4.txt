I gave this 4 stars because I love the smell.  Sometimes I might put some on my baby (a little goes a long way ;) ) if we are going to see family etc just to have that wonderful baby smell :), especially if we are out and about and baby's bath was a while ago, lol.  That being said, I need to use other lotions like Aquaphor if I am serious about preventing dry skin, because this lotion isn't that great at keeping skin moist.  Our Pediatrician does not recommend using it as a lotion to prevent dry skin, but its ok for us to use it after baths etc for the nice smell (and like others mentioned it can be strong, you don't want to put too much on your baby since my guess is that strong smells aren't good for little ones).
From what I hear, Huggies work better for boys. I purchased this for a friend's baby shower. She was having a boy. Most of the moms I know with boys use Hugges, while the mom's with girls use Pampers.
Great diapers, do not leak and hold my little guy for a really long time and lots of pee. Love huggies.
These are great for during the day, but not for an entire night. They always leak during the night with my son, so I had to him Pampers Cruisers just for night use and they work great. Huggies during the day, and Pampers Cruisers at night for my boy.
I don't know how to feel about these diapers. First of all, we switched from Pampers Swaddlers to the Snug and Dry when my son got into size 2 diapers. Pampers are WAY softer than Huggies; which have a more papery feel, that's a pretty universal truth, so if that doesn't bother you, than go for it. They have cute Mickey, Minnie and Pluto designs on these diapers, if you care about that.  I had issues with the size 2 snug and dry tabs ripping off when I'd put on his diaper.  That's really annoying because you've basically just rendered a perfectly good diaper, useless and have to throw it away. The size 2 snug and dry leaked all the time, out the sides of his legs, and I chalked it up to the diaper being too small (he was 17 lbs using a 12-18 lb range diaper) so when I switched to the size 3, I thought this would solve all of our problems, but unfortunately, it hasn't. They seem to hold in liquid really well, (one diaper can hold up all night) but a solely breast-fed baby with non-solid stools can leak thru the leg gussets on this diaper too. I always make sure the inner blue liner is apart and pulled out too, to make sure that it can catch all of baby's mess, but it still leaks. I got a box of Pampers Baby Dry this time with my subscribe and save and we'll see if they hold up better than these. Overall, it's a decent diaper, but I have a chunky boy and these STILL leak about half of the time.****Update:After trying Pampers Baby Dry, I highly recommend Huggies Snug and Dry. Considering that the only two choices you have in size 3 for this quantity are Baby Dry and Snug and Dry; I've tried both, and Pampers Baby Dry are shockingly bad. They are SO thin and rough, and plastic feeling I could not believe that these two are even competitors. Don't bother with Baby Dry. They're garbage. To address the leaking issue I stated above, Pampers leaked just as bad, so I still haven't completely solved that problem but I don't know if I will until my baby starts eating solids; which he will, in about a month. Huggies fan for life now.
I was looking for a baby gym that was affordable, yet not hazardous or too cheap looking. I like that this mat has so many things for the baby to play with. I wonder how long it will take for her to find everything on it! I'm happy that this folds up so that it can stay out of the way when not being used, it travels easily, and I can keep dust off of it. I personally don't really care for all of the bright colors but it's not for me to play with anyway. I'm sure my baby girl will love this when she gets here. The price is right!
I am currently using this for a second baby. It still looks great and has held up very nicely through a few washes. It is easy to fold up and tuck away. It's colorful and feels nice. However, the music/lights didn't last long, broke during use with first baby...so I just took the music panel out and have used it without that feature. Still a nice play gym, but taking off a star for the lights/music which could have been of better quality.
My 6 month old son has a lot of fun on this mat... he loves the animals.. and loves putting them in his mouth. I am glad that they're made of cloth, so he doesn't get hurt when he puts them in his mouth. Taking one star off because I really wish that the hanging animals and the mat itself were machine washable.
We set this up when we brought our baby home from the hospital.  It has lots of bright colors that newborns can see and lots of great toys and textures for when they develop more. Two perpendicular arches over the mat have holes to fasten animals (monkey, giraffe, elephant, parrot) that rattle, crinkle, stretch or shake and a teething ring with beads.  The mat has fun colors and textures too.  It has an elephant ear that crinkles, a felt tail on the giraffe and a felt mane on the zebra, and a bird that squeaks.  There are also flowers that light up when music is played.  Pressing down on the flowerbed starts the music, and you've got a choice of Mozart or nursery rhymes.  Unfortunately, after three months this stopped working properly.  It stayed on all the time (even when we turned it to OFF) and the batteries soon drained.  Aside from this problem, we love the mat.  As a newborn, we could set my son on it to take naps.  As he got older, he started admiring the colors and reaching for the animals hanging from the arches.  It's great for tummy time too.  He loves looking at the animals that are on the mat, grabbing the elephant ear and flowers and looking at himself in the big mirror that's in the corner.  Also, the mat washes up so well.  Spit up comes right out of it and none of the colors have faded one bit in the ten times I've washed it.
I purchased these bags on the recommendation of a friend. I use it for my breast pump and bottle accessories. It is fast and efficient and does the job.
We love Pampers Swaddlers!  I use cloth diapers but my newborn is too small for the All-in-Ones I use so I need to use disposable diapers until they fit.  Pampers Swaddlers are the best!They don't leak!  They are good on sensitive, newborn skin!  Love the blue line that appears when the diapers get wet!  These diapers fit well & are true to the weight range they have on the box.I have tried several brands of diapers on my 2 daughters.  When we have to use disposable diapers, we usually pick Pampers.  Target brand (up&up;) are the closest comparison to these diapers.  We have never had luck with Huggies diapers.
I have been primarily a Huggies mom for over a decade. However, with the birth of my fourth child, the hospital this time provided Pampers Swaddlers instead of the Huggies (due to a change in the purchasing supplier, not due to parental/physician/nursing staff requests).I had already purchased Huggies Supremes for home use, having tried Pampers Swaddlers (due to a friend's recommendation) about 3 years ago with no success (horrible rash on my then newborn son due to the mesh lining!). Overall, insofar as performance goes, I honestly see no discernible difference between either the Huggies Supreme or the Pampers Swaddlers. (Except for the fact that the Huggies newborn size has the "wet/dry" feature on the front of the diaper; the Pampers Swaddlers does not unless you buy the "Sensitive" version. The Swaddlers provided by the hospital wasn't the "Sensitive", but *did* have the line feature regardless in their size 1s. The Huggies does not have that feature in the size 1s. Wish it did.)However, there are aesthetics about the Swaddlers that appeal to me that has me rethinking Huggies for the first time in 10 years... at least until the Cruisers. (I can't stand the Cruisers. Swaddlers, yes. Cruisers, no.)1. I like the softness throughout the Pampers Swaddlers. The Huggies Supreme diaper is soft on the inside of the diaper (which *is* important), but not necessarily on the outside. The Swaddlers diaper is soft both inside and out.2. I really, *really* like the fact that the Swaddlers is a "plain" diaper. The hospital version does one better: No cartoon character AT ALL. Instead of some stupid cartoon character on the band, it simply says "Pampers". I *love* the fact that the diaper itself is plain and white. NO FREAKING CARTOONS on it. I do *not* see the sense or the need to put cartoon characters all over the diaper, especially for a child in size 1-2-3; who cares? Certainly not the child! All the cartoons do is pimp yet another product and show through clothing, which I find highly annoying on both counts. The Huggies Supreme diapers have characters and designs over the entire diaper, making it extremely ugly, and I honestly can't help but wonder how much, if anything, does that add to the overall cost of the diaper? I have emailed Huggies requesting the designs to vanish... we'll see.As for the mesh causing a rash on my new son... I'm not sure if it's the Lansinoh Cleansing Cloths, the Triple Paste rash cream (prevention), or an improvement of the Pampers itself, but so far, so good = No rashes. (I highly recommend the Lansinoh cloths and the Triple Paste, by the way.)Insofar as leaks and blow-outs... Both Huggies and Pampers are the same. Both do an excellent job... both leak and both blow-out at times. It's life.I do recommend the Swaddlers... Just be aware of the rash potential with the mesh lining, and perhaps the above-mentioned products will reduce that happenstance.ETA: Apologies - had to go; baby was crying. Where was I... The leaks/blow-outs for either diaper run about the same. Both do a fabulous job with containing both leaks and blow-outs, but I have experienced both messes with both diapers. It just depends on baby's output; I don't think there's a diaper in the world that could contain such a natural thing... unless the diaper wrapped around the baby like a onesie. LOL!For fit... Both Huggies Supreme and Pampers Swaddlers fit wonderfully on my newborn... However, I have to admit I prefer how the Swaddlers fit at this stage in his life; the Huggies seem to run slightly larger in size to the Swaddlers. The sharp tabs of the Swaddlers don't seem to bother my son at this point; I usually pull them nice and snug and almost overlap them under his cord at this point anyway; he isn't active enough to get them to move into a position that could make one of the edges of the tab poke his belly like my older son (one of the reasons why my older son hates the Cruisers). Still, that's one area Pampers could improve with no extra cost: Make the tabs have smooth, rounded edges like the Huggies.Baby crying. Gotta go.
Of course every kid is different but Pampers Swaddlers fit my son the best. He is tall and solid (ok, maybe a little fat!) and these work well for him. Huggies seem made for shorter babies.
I like Pampers Swaddlers because it's affordable and provides just enough softness for my baby's gentle skin. The dry weave really keeps moisture away for the skin, and the "velcro" works well to keep diaper in place. It can hold quite a bit of waste!
No little reward number codes, like the ones from the store. [[[EDIT 12/21/2012: I was incorrect!  There are reward numbers on the inside of the individual packages!]]]Although size 1 diapers were getting small for my daughter, these seem quite large.  She'll grow into them, I guess.  We haven't had any leaks as a result of the odd sizing.These still have the yellow/blue stripe, and we like that.They have sesame street characters, a little older than the characters on the size 1 diapers.
If your baby has sensitive skin, Swaddlers are great. I have compared Pampers to other brands and I think they make the softest diapers causing the least irritations. Fit doesn't seem to be something you can judge because every baby is different.
I have used both Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry for my newborn. I have never had a leak with Swaddlers (with Baby Dry newborn liquid poop often shot right up the back of the diaper and onto baby's outfit) and the same size in the Swaddler style seems to be a lot roomier than the Baby Dry style. There is a slim indicator strip on the front of the diapers to indicate whether they are wet inside but to be honest by the time I have taken pants off or opened up the onesie to allow me to see the indicator I am already pretty much clear the diaper is wet. One complaint is that the top layer of the inside of the diaper has netting that wicks away moisture (to avoid leaks and keep baby's bottom dry) but also serves to dry poop bits which makes them stick to baby's butt. Cleaning takes more time because you aren't just wiping; you are also scrubbing dried poop bits.**UPDATE 3/31/13**: Although this packaging says Size 1 fits up to 14 lbs, do yourself (and anyone who will be holding your sweet bundle) a favor and upgrade to Size 2 once baby hits 12 lbs. Otherwise you'll experience frequent blowouts. We thought it was just us until several moms in our mom's group confirmed that 12lbs is the safe limit for Size 1 diapers.
I was hesitant to use Pampers after reading the reviews online here and elsewhere about the Dry Max and subsequent rashes. However, I bought a box and have been pleased on this diaper's overall performance.  They fit fine, my daughter has never had a leak (although she's been precariously close to leaks at times), and no rash or skin irritation.  She is currently wearing the size 1 diaper which goes up to 14 lbs, and I am finding my 12 lb baby could already go up a size in terms of the waist.The reason I can't give this a full 5 stars are for some minor annoyances.  First, when the diaper is wet my daughter's clothes feel damp. Not enough to even have obvious wet spots on her clothes, but just this weird dampness.  As soon as she is in a clean diaper, that feeling goes away.  Second, if you touch the inside of a wet diaper to test how dry the diaper actually keeps your baby, it does feel damp enough that it's noticeable.  Of course a wet diaper is, well... wet...but when the advertising touts of the diaper feeling dry, this one doesn't fully meet the standard.  The only diaper I've found that actually does feel dry on the inside to the touch is Huggies.
Several months ago when I was starting to build up my diaper supply for our baby who was then on the way, I intended to buy only Pampers Swaddlers and then Cruisers when she hit that size range.  Then I started reading reviews and talking to friends who had small babies.  I heard and read all these awful things about the Dry Max chemical that Pampers was using in their premium diapers.  I ultimately decided that we would use the Baby Dry diapers instead to avoid the chemical diaper rashes that people were reporting.  When I was given the opportunity to review these swaddlers, I figured it would give me a chance to see if I could actually use them on my baby without giving her an awful diaper rash.  I was surprised when they arrived and there was no mention of Dry Max on the package.  Then I did a little research on the Pampers website and it appears that they are no longer using Dry Max.Our experience with the new Swaddlers has been very good.  We like the way they fit on our little one.  We haven't had any issues with leaks or diaper rashes and that makes us all happy.  My husband and I like the yellow indicator strip that turns blue when the diaper is wet.  That's not a must have feature for us but it's a nice touch.I think these diapers are certainly nicer than the Baby Dry diapers.  They are a better quality and they offer a nicer fit.  The lining of the Swaddler diapers is a mesh that I think is a bit odd.  I'm really not sure what benefit, if any it offers, but I prefer the lining on the Baby Dry diaper over it.Overall it's a good diaper and one I will certainly be purchasing in the next size up once we work our way through our stock pile of Baby Dry diapers.
great volume, very good diaper. it was an excellent fit for my baby and never leaked even at times when the diaper was engorged with pee
We've tested just about every diaper on the market. For us, the thing that really set Pampers Swaddlers apart from the rest are the wetness indicator & super-absorption. If you've ever had a problem with leaks, this is the diaper for you.Due to a number of factors (concerns about cost, chemicals, our baby's health, environmental impact, etc), we've settled on a 50/50 ratio of using cloth + disposable. We never had a problem with leaks until size 3 or 4 (maybe due to diet? breastfeeding? every child is different!). But what we DID notice was a little redness in the genital area, that we didn't get with other diapers tested (we've tested them *all* - Huggies, Pampers, Kirkland, 7th Generation, Babies R Us, Luvs, Up & Up, Parent's Choice, etc).This could be a number of factors (breathability, etc), but we thought the Pampers were overkill for us since leaks weren't an issue. Please keep in mind to make a diaper more absorbent, you must add more chemicals (Pampers, like most manufacturers, use a chemical absorbing gel). This is typically more of an issue for girls.So after considering all the factors (fit, absorption, strength, cost, chemical content, etc) we gravitated towards these other three brands as well:Earth's Best TenderCare Chlorine Free Diapers,Seventh Generation Free & Clear, and Up & Up (Target Brand).Hope this helps - Good luck!
My little girl is 7 lb 4 oz and we have tried several brands of newborn diapers for her... many we got as shower gifts and we had planned on using environmentally friendly diapers so we bought a bunch of Earth's Best.  Here's the round-up.... these Huggies Little Snugglers are the best for several reasons.-Huggies Little Snugglers: We love these for several reasons.  First off, they are the smallest of all of the brands we tried so they actually fit her a little better.  Like I said, she is 7lb 4 oz and so a lot fo the other diapers are a little too big even though they are newborn size and they dig into her legs.  These are also good because they have a strip that changes color from yellow to blue when she's wet, not essential, but nice.  They also have a cut out for the umbilical cord.  They have a couple extra features like a little elastic pocket thing inside the back waste band to prevent blow-outs coming up the back, which seems to work pretty well.  They are nice and soft too.-Pampers Swaddlers Newborn:  These are our second favorite.  They are a little bigger than the Huggies Little Snugglers, which is  drawback for me, but they are soft so they don't dig into the legs too much.  They also have the strip that changes color when she's wet.-Honest Newborn Diapers: These you buy online, it is a company that sends monthly diaper bundles.  It was started by Jessica Alba and is a green company with recycled diapers and household products.  I like these a lot, but again, they are just a little bit big.  They have really cute patterns, are soft and work pretty well and they are also environmentally friendly, which is a bonus.  They downside is that you have to order them on a monthly basis - $90 a month for about $280 diapers or something. They actually have a pretty good deal where you can get a starter kit with 10 diapers or so for free (I think you have to pay shipping) to try out the diapers and products.  (Link:  [...])  I think I may use these more when she gets bigger.-Earth's Best Newborn:  Sadly, these are my least favorite.  They aren't as soft as the others and they are pretty big and bulky.  They are way too big for her now and when we used on, it dug into her legs and made red marks when we took it off.  I bought a ton of these so I guess I'll use them when she's at the top end of the newborn size scale  - like 9 lbs or so.
I've used this for both of my sons and worked great. The only thing I didn't like is the gel pieces that come off but, other than that it works great.My baby was having diaper rash for a while but, I don't think it was because of this diaper...He was at the age he was having teething and he started baby food and all.It actually absorbs liquid diarrhea so works awesome. No leaky diarrhea!
This is a great diaper, it's our second favorite behind the Swaddlers Sensitive.  It doesn't have the color indicator, though at this size you should be able to easily tell when the diaper is wet.  :  The fit is comfortable for our little one, the elastic doesn't bind and we haven't had any allergic reactions or anything.
I had been using Huggies before I switched over to Pampers Swaddlers.  I prefer the Swaddlers for many reasons.  First, they have a wetness indicator on the diaper.  It's a yellow line that extends down the center of the diaper.  It turns blue when the diaper is damp.  this is a quick and easy way to tell if your baby needs a changing.Secondly, the fasteners are very stretchy, so I can make the diaper nice and tight on my baby.  When I moved up a size, this was very important.  There was no gap around the waistband.Additionally, the leg area is very well protected.  I have never had a leak from the legs.  I have only had a couple times where I dealt with a blowout, and that was up the back.  I think the back could be extended a little to make this a truly awesome diaper.This economy pack includes three plastic wrapped packages of 78 diapers.  I brought one to my parents, one to daycare, and kept one for myself.  This is very convenient to have them packaged as such.  Also, the price per diaper is very cheap- around 20 cents.  I plan on buying this brand from now on.
Overall we're pretty pleased with this product.  Below is a list of the good and bad features of the product:The good:1.  They're soft.  Haven't had any rash problems.2.  They're stretchy and seem to work well with a growing baby.3.  They're really absorbent, especially for #1.4.  For the most part, they don't leak.  They do once in a while, but not nearly as much as other diapers out there.5.  The indicator strip is nice.  One takes it for granted after a while, but it makes me wonder how our parents got by.6.  The ordering options here on Amazon are really convenient.  For one thing the bulk package is nice.  You can also subscribe and save.  And of course it's always a bonus to get a big box delivered to your door.  No more wrestling a large package out of the store and to the house.The bad:1.  Really the only thing I don't like is the smell.  The perfume odor is a little bit strong, as I think a few other reviewers have said.  My opinion may be a little biased on this score, since I absolutely hate the smell of baby oil and can't stand most other perfumy products either.  So take it as you may: I don't like it, but my wife does, and it doesn't seem to bother the baby.
These diapers are the best disposable diapers you could ever buy for your baby. My baby has sensitive sking so we mainly use cloth diapers but for daycare she needs disposables and these are the only ones that dont make her get a rash. Huggies are just useless for my baby. If you do a side by side comparison of this diaper versus your regular Huggies snug and dry you can see and feel and smell the difference. These are so much softer and gentler on the skin. We used this on our baby from the hospital and then we tried huggies when she was about 3 months because we received so many boxes of huggies, after just one day of using huggies, her poor little bottom was covered red bumps, so we returned all of them to the store and bought more of these pampers swaddlers.Like all other disposable diapers these diapers do leak sometimes especially if you dont double check around the thighs to make sure the ruffles have been properly pulled out. These are still the best disposable diapers.
These were the only newborn diapers that fit my preemie for the first month of his life.  They are a little smaller than other brands, and they are cut better for very small babies.  For the same reason, I would not recommend these for full-term babies, as you will get more use out of other brands that are less expensive.
i have ordered pampers on amazon since my daughter was very small and have never had a problem. this package looks a bit different, i dont know if pampers just changed the diaper or what. have yet to test them out but they do smell the same...haha.
I bought these nursing pads based on the good reviews.  With my first daughter I strictly used Medela nursing pads.  I switched to the Lansinoh pads because they seemed to have better overall reviews.In many ways both products are similar.-they are both individually sealed, which is nice for traveling & throwing in my diaper bag-they are curved to try to conform to your breast (I find both nursing pads to be mediocre in being concealed under my shirts)-they have sealing tape to hold them onto your bra (which I don't use because I like to lay them beside/under my daughter while nursing...I don't like when they get all bunched up when I unhook my nursing bra)-they are very absorbent (much, much more so than the reusable, fleece nursing pads I first tried)The most bizarre thing about these Lansinoh nursing pads is that they are sealed together into the semi circle.  I have to figure our how to open them up every time I use them.  I thought the first one might have been sealed by accident, but every pad is like that.  I hate having to find a small gap in the seal to pull them apart.  That is my biggest complaint about these.All in all, it is a toss up between these & the Medela nursing pads.  These win because I got 2 samples of breast milk storage bags.  I appreciated that!
I received these as a trial pair, I have still yet to buy a box of them as my little one has yet to arrive and wanted to try out a couple different type before i purchased any. However, I am leaking and got tired of leaking all over my good bras. They stay on all the bra all day even through this  crazy heat, its been 95+ everyday with humidity and the adhesive lasted in these all day long. My only problem is that they are quite large and just fit in my full coverage B cup. But i know once my little one get here and my milk does come in i am sure that will no longer be an issue. They are very soft and seem quite comfortable at this point.
I have used these since I had my sons, and they are great for leakage. They hold a ton of milk and lock moisture in well so you don't feel wet. They have sticky tabs on the back to secure to your clothes but I don't use them. They stay put pretty well. They even work at night, but if they shift you can leak through your shirt, or if you sleep through the night and have a big supply. I recommend these over medela,I just think they are more comfortable and discreet under clothes. The one downside is they can be a bit scratchy after awhile.
SO I PUT ONE IN MY DIAPER BAG NEEDED RELIZED IT ONLY HAD ONE IN THE PLASTIC... SO I WAS LIKE LEFTY OR RIGHTY? HMM...I HAVE TWO BOOBIES, WHY ONE PER PACKAGE? I FOUND THAT SO DUMB BUT THE PRODUCT ITS SELF IS THE BEST IVE TRYED (=
It is a good product, but I am giving it a 4 star because the material is not as soft as the crusers.
I find these to be much softer and less prone to leak compared to the generic brands I had been using.  I tried these when I found out they were cheaper, and found they are much better.  They are great for day, but need to put Huggies overnight diapers on in the evening.
My daughter occasionally collects a little bit of residue from the diaper down there, but for the most part it's clean, doesn't deteriorate, and holds a lot of water.
great product and great leakage protection but these diapers seem almost too small and my daughter, she is 24 lbs. the pampers cruisers fit alot better.
When it comes to diapers, there is really only one major criteria that it has to have in our household: the diaper cannot leak/result in major blowouts. While I know that there are no 100% leak proof/blow out proof diaper out there, the Pampers Baby Dry diapers come pretty close. We have not experienced any leaks with Pampers, as opposed to store brands or Luvs.Our daughter is highly prone to diaper rashes, and with the Pampers Dry Max, we've noticed that her rashes have decreased significantly when wearing these diapers. The diapers absorb so much liquid, and keeps it away from our daughter's skin!  The one gripe we have with Pampers is the scent - their diapers are generally heavily perfumed.  If your kid makes a big stink, this may not be a bad thing - we just didn't care to smell our daughter before we heard her enter a room (deposit or not!).  Outside of that, these diapers are fantastic! Highly recommended!
These diapers fit my daughter very well. She i shorter with stubby chunky thighs. They have only leaked once or twice, during the night but my daughter sleeps on her stomach and sleeps 12 hours straight. Otherwise I have had no problems with leakage.
These have amazing leak protection, and definitely keep baby dry. They're also a great value for the price. The only reason I couldn't give them five starts is because I still like Pampers Swaddlers a little better with the wetness indicator and a little better fit. Swaddlers are substancially more expensive though.
We like pampers and love huggies.  We used pampers for a year, because it was what fit our son's bum the best.  Then he grew into Huggies shape, and we like them better because they don't feel wet to the touch when they are full.
I like these diapers, they're easy to put on a squirming baby. I like that the swaddlers have a wet indicator, but those aren't available for Amazon Prime, so I went with these. No real complaints, I can usually tell when my baby needs a change without a wet indicator.
Not as great as Cruisers. They are ok, but are rough to the skin and break open easier. I would buy these in a pinch but much prefer the softness of the cruisers.
Bought these for my newborn baby.Would definitely recommend them.Most importantly our newborn had no rashes which is common with low quality diapers.
I love these bottles. We used them when my son came home from the NICU until he transitioned to solids. These were perfect since the vent system helped reduce the amount of extra air that he could have ingested which would have caused him extra gas pains. The problem with these inserts are that they are hard to clean. We didn't have a problem with the premade formula but, when we switched to the powder to be more cost effective, it left a permanent stain on the inserts. Plus, they are so hard to clean. We would scrub them with toothbrushes and could never get them looking decent. I still think these bottles are the best so, it's worth cleaning the extra parts.
I use this for prevention at night and for minor rashes. It has basic ingredients and no parabens or anything. It does not stay on as well as Desitin, but it soothes the skin and is a good overall cream. For more severe rashes the purple Desitin can't be beat.
Great product. I used it a few times for cracked/dry nipples. Not so much for sore nipples. I found sore nipples require a new position, a new latch (hard to get baby to change after a few months of doing a certain way), or letting them rest for a few hours. If you're nipples get dry and ashy, then this product is great. I've been nursing for 16 months and still have the original container with plenty left. It doesn't take much. Sometimes I swear I saw little oily stains on the inside of my bra, but those nursing bras are so thick in the cup that it never soaked the whole way through. I love that it's all natural (actually, you could probably make your own by following a Pinterest tutorial ;)
The jar is very small, but a little goes long way. It helped with sore nipples I had for first 4 days after delivery, but I also tried other creams and my son liked most Lansinoh lanolin cream (with this one he was making faces and refuse breast for a few seconds-but still ate fine).I like all natural ingredients (5 of them, main one olive oil).Now I use it as a lip balm.
We have been using these for about a year with out daughter.  When we first started using them we found them to be great.  Our daughter was proud of herself because she felt like a big girl because she could pull up her own diaper.  The images on them made her excited each evening when she would pick one out.  She also started to enjoy waking up in the morning and checking to see if the line indicaters would still there to show if she peed or not the night before.The problem that I have with these though is that they are too absorbent and she can sleep through the night even if she peed.  I was hoping for more out of the &#34;cool alert&#34; feature.  Ideally you want something that not only protects the bed but also makes the child aware that they have peed so that the next time they will try to get up before that happens.In summary, I would defiantly recommend these to any parent who is hoping that that they can get a good night's sleep and they don't have to change sheets at 2:30 am.  They seem comfortable to the child and they fit well.  My daughter still uses these as a safety net a year after we first introduced them to her.As a suggestion, when our daughter was potty trained we found that she would still pee in these at night.  We ended up chalking it up to both the fact that she was being lazy and that she was a very sound sleeper.  We decided to have her wear a pair of underwear under these pull ups.  The idea behind this is that if she peed in them it would be uncomfortable but it would catch the pee so that it did not get all over the bed.  This experiment turned out to be very successful!  If you find yourself in the same situation I would highly recommend this.  It is worth a shot!
I don't usually buy cool alert as I only use these at night for my girls when they're newly toilet trained.  And as they rarely wet in them, I don't want them to have the sensation to wake up  during the night.  They tend to only wet in them if they're coming down with an illness or if, for some reason, we've forgotten to take them to the loo before bed.  They're fine to use, I just can't really review about the cool alert because I must have only bought these once by mistake.
My kids don't notice the cool alert at all. We were pampers cruisers users before pull ups and these work just as well for accidents. Easy open sides are very important to us - easy to open and easy to wrap up & throw away.
My daughter struggled with extreme diaper rash.  She has terribly sensitive skin so we were constantly battling rashes.  We tried several other diaper creams, with mixed results.  I chose this product because of it's size (we don't need to buy diaper cream for another decade!) & because we had heard good things about it.This product works!  It always cleared up my daughter's diaper rashes.  In fact, we still use this product on our 3 year-old because she still gets very bad rashes when she isn't cleaned well enough.This cream is VERY thick!  When I put this product on my daughter I have to wash my hands very thoroughly with soap & water to get the cream off my fingers.  That shows how waterproof this cream is!  The thick cream is also very soothing.  My daughter comments that she feels better right away.  I appreciate how effective this product is.The only problem that we have is that this product stains clothing very badly!  We used cloth diapers & the liners are completely stained,  We also have to strip the diaper regularly because this makes the fabric waterproof (which isn't food for cloth diapers!).  Because we occasionally have to use this product on our 3 year-old, several pairs of her underwear are stained.Overall this is an amazing product.  Just be careful when you use it.  Don't wipe your hands on your clothes!
I love the big tub that this stuff comes in. My newborn daughter has a very sensitive rear end and gets diaper rash and irritation very easily.  This stuff goes on easily and also wipes away a lot easier than other popular diaper creams.  The only thing that I hate about this stuff is the scent.  The smell reminds me of regurgitated bubble gum! LOL.  Seriously, thats what it reminds me of.  That is the only reason I didn't give this item a 5 star rating.  Once you get the diaper on and baby clothes, the smell isn't that noticeable.  I use this stuff at every diaper change and we have no further diaper rashes on our newborn daughter.
I use this for prevention at night and for minor rashes. It has basic ingredients and no parabens or anything. It does not stay on as well as Desitin, but it soothes the skin and is a good overall cream. For more severe rashes the purple Desitin can't be beat.  The tub is a better value than the tube.
I'll start out by saying, yes this is a little costly. I had thought about not making the purchase due to the price, but in the end felt it would be much easier to handle our car seat while traveling. The straps are thick and padded, easing the strain on ones shoulders. It is helpful for transport from vehicle to airport, then back again. Especially when you are dealing with suitcases and children. We checked our car seat with the airline. When I received it back, there was a large hole in the bag. This was disappointing! But, thankfully I'm not buying another car seat instead. I have a Graco Nautilus 3-In-1 car seat, which I find large and bulky. So as far as size, the travel bag should fit most car seats.
I liked this warmer well enough , I guess, for the price. I did notice that the wipes were sometimes dried out on top. One thing I did not care for was the large amount of condensation that the lid created, which is probably normal for this type of thing.That being said, it was great for those cold nights that you dont want to use an icy wipe on your baby's bottom, and the glow light helped too during those late night changes.
Works OK but some wipes get dryed out and it wasn't that useful I guesss ill have to see how it comes in handy durning winter probably won't recommend.
I had my daughter in October and this was extremely helpful for cooler weather. The wipes were always warm in the warmer and only slightly cooled when I used them on my daughter. Made night time diaper changes easy instead of the shock of an ice cold wipe. People told me I could just warm it up in my hand, but personally being sleep deprived and not wanting to hold an ice cold wipe in my hand while managing a squirming baby on a table was not appealing to me. Negative is multiple wipes normally come out at once when you just try to grab one. Also if you let this get really low ( a couple of wipes left) it normally means those wipes will some what dry out. When the weather warmed up I have continued to use this just unplugged. The weather will be cooling down again soon which means I will be plugging it in again.
I ordered two of these and they both work great. If you're low on wipes, the last few will get super wet. If the warmer is full, the top wipes will dry out. You can add a little water to avoid this. The light that goes on is not bright enough to see what's going on in the middle of the night, but it's better than nothing. It is quite large and will not fit on any type of diaper organizer, but I don't think any of the wipe warmers will. If you're looking to save money, this is definitely an item you don't need. My son was fine whether the wipes were warm or cold.If you're looking for some advice on other baby registry essentials, check out AllMomsArePerfect dot com. You'll get the lowdown on what you really need and what you could save to buy later or avoid completely.
After I refill this with a new pack of wipes, I just pour a cup of water over the pile of wipes.  Then they stay warm AND wet.  I tried both Lansinoh and Huggies wipes, and both dried out with the warmer.  But the cup of water solution is really easy and makes this wonderful.  If I couldn't add water, I wouldn't use this at all.  That's not munckin's fault - wipes weren't made to be kept warm all the time.  THey are only as wet as they need to be when contained in a plastic container.  So just make them a little wetter, and everything works great!I wish Munchkin made a hand warmer too.
I bought the bigger size for my son who just turned 2. He's about 35 inches tall and weighs about 28 pounds, and they are a little big on him.
I like that it is easy to remove with side snaps, but it is larger than her swimsuit so the ends of it pop out on the bottom. It is okay, just not pretty. Also when she had a MAJOR poop it held it but it was harder to get off when wet and poopy because only one side opens. It was sort of a mess...
I got this for when I had my baby, and it is a great deal for the price. My husband put it together for me and it was not too difficult. He did put wood glue on it when he put it together to hopefully keep it functioning for longer. I weigh about 130 and it does not squeak when I use it, but it does squeak when my husband who is 170 rocks in it, so that is why I give it 4 stars.
I purchased the Stork Craft Hoop Glider just prior to the birth of my daughter after looking for a glider in the same price range locally. While it's not the best glider in the world, it's also not $300-$400 so it might well be the best for the price.I opted for the cherry and beige model with the chenille fabric (the rest are microfiber). Installation was a cinch. The ottoman comes preassembled, and the chair itself was very easy to put together. I'm neither the most talented nor the most patient furniture assembler, so I'm glad it only took about 20 minutes to have it ready for mommy and baby. I doubt it would take anyone much longer than that, it's that easy. Before I ordered it I was a little bit worried that if might be of a bad build quality and feel weak, but it's as sturdy as any model I checked out.The gliding motion is smooth and natural, and my wife uses it daily for nursing and I make use of it when it's my turn to rock or feed the little one. Overall it's comfortable enough, although the seat pad gets a bit uncomfortable when you're sitting for an extended period of time. I wish that they would have made the seat cushion thicker and a bit softer, but that's my only major complaint, and even at that, it's nowhere near enough to make me regret buying the Stork Craft glider.This isn't the best glider out there, but for the money, you could do a lot worse (or spend a lot more to get one that isn't much better). If you're on a budget and looking for a glider that will do the job but not break the bank, I heartily recommend this one.
This glider and ottoman set is just gorgeous, especially for the price. It glides smoothly and is easy to aseemble. The padding is thick and comfy which is a big plus for a mom who will be holding a baby for long periods in this chair. It's a good pick if you're looking for style, comfort, and affordability.If you're looking for more baby gear reviews visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com It has down to earth reviews from a perfectionist mom who does a ton of research on baby products. You'll find a stroller shopping guide, baby carrier guide, and what to expect after the delivery (stuff no one takes about).
I finally purchased a glider to use with the new baby. After going to a couple stores and taking a look at the 200-300 and even 400 dollar ones we decided to go with this basic glider to save money for christmas and other necessities.So far I have had it assembled 2 weeks and use it many times during the day to nurse and read books. The bottom cushion is a bit hard but honestly this glider is well worth the money if you are on a budget don't feel bad about getting this one over the more expensive ones. It is pretty and does the job just fine.When it arrived there was a huge rip in the box and the outer corner of the glider was exposed. Thankfully it was packed with foam around the corners and did not sustain any damage.Assembly was quite easy and the glider bottom comes assembled, the ottoman is completely assembled. So it was 8 screws I believe, to assemble this and my DH had it done in about 20 minutes.It has a nice warm finish and should match well with other cherry furniture. The cushions are a sandy beige color and are attractive.I'd recommend this as a nice glider for someone looking to save $$.Update - March 12, 2009 - Still satisfied with the purchase, has maintained its quality and gets a lot of use.Update - May 22, 2010 - Now a nursing/reading chair. Frequently used and in nice shape. Looking into getting a better cushion set.
Overall I like these better than Huggies Pull-Ups but I haven't had leakage issues with these or any of the other brands of training pants, once I got the sizing right.  I first tried 3t-4t but that was too small for my regular-sized kid.  Came to find out that size is a 5 in diaper language so i went a size up and everythings is great.  We use Pure & Gentle, Huggies and Pampers training pants.  For a size 6 in diaper language, you'll need the 4T-5T size.in training pants.These by far have the most material so I prefer them overnight and on longer trips.  In honesty though, I buy whichever of these is cheapest at the time of my purchase.The only two features that can be viewed as downsides are that the bulk may prevent some clothing from fitting. and the sides aren't reclosable.  The latter I don't mind, because it makes it easier for my baby to pull it up without dislodging the tapes but on the other hand, you have to pull down the easy-up to check for wetness.Most of the training pants have 'wetness indicators' but I've found that none of them work 100% of the time and the child can wet possibly more than once before a change in the wetness indicator is evident.
I think these run a little small, but that is the only reason they didn't get five stars.  My daughter's skin is very sensitive, so I was a little nervous about these to begin with, but they haven't broken her out at all.  She is also a heavy wetter in her sleep, and we have barely had any leaks.
Pampers Easy Ups for girls are a good potty training pants. The Pull Ups hold a good amount, don't leak, and when there is a big deposit in there, you can rip the side tabs to take the training pants off without having to pull them off. Our daughter just started transitioning to these training pants, and we haven't had any problems with leaks. The only thing we have to complain about these diapers is the perfume smell - it's pretty potent. However, if your kid leaves super stinky deposits, it probably is a good thing to have that much perfume in there. Recommended.
The Pampers Easy Ups are a nice training pant for children that are almost completely potty trained.  They are made of a soft material and similar to underwear where the sides do not come a part (with the velcro like material like other training pants).The fact that they look more like underwear is encouragement for kids to get out of the training pants and into actual under wear.  But if your child is just starting potty training the only thing I would point out is that if you do need to pull these down and there is something in the pants it tends to smear down legs, etc.We have been choosing Pampers as our training pants now that potty training is almost complete and during the night being that these come in a size 6.Also, each training pant has a cute character design on them which the kids love!
These cream works well to keep my baby's bottom from becoming red. However, when she developed a diaper rash due to diarrhea every two hours, it didn't help at all and I had to take my daughter to the pediatrician to get a better cream.
We go through a lot of Desitin in this house! I like the creamy feel of Desitin, the lack of a strong scent, and its effectiveness. We use this after each change to ensure rashes are kept at bay and it does the job well!
When you have a baby with a diaper rash, you want it gone, and fast.  Almost always, you end up with the prescription, but this helps it heal faster.  It's super thick, and stays on their bottom.  Works.
These diapers work great, but my son's daycare ask that we send pull ups/easy ups with velcro sides, especially in the wintertime, so they don't have to completely remove clothing to take off his pull up.  I love these diapers otherwise, but sorry pampers, I have to switch.
My grandson is in the process of being potty trained and have tried both the Pampers Easy Up and Huggies Pull ups.  They are both about the same but need some improvement on the stretchy sides of the training pants and absorbency.The Pampers Easy Ups are a bit softer and fit well but be careful when pulling up the diaper after your little one has used the potty as sometimes they stretch and tear at the sides.  And if your little one has had too much liquid, there is a chance of leaking. Can't wait until he is fully potty trained but in the meantime the Easy Ups will work.
Pampers Easy Ups for Boys is a good potty training pants for boys.  The Pull Ups hold a good amount, don't leak, and when there is a big deposit in there, you can rip the side tabs to take the training pants off without having to pull them off.  Our son uses these training pants only at night, and we haven't had any problems with leaks.  The only thing we have to complain about these diapers is the perfume smell - it's pretty potent.  However, if your kid leaves super stinky deposits, it probably is a good thing to have that much perfume in there.  Recommended.
My kid just commenced pre-school and he is midway through potty training. This product helps a lot with the transition
These are great on leaks, however ours is tearing really easy in the bottom area. Devinately not as sturdy as a diaper. But at the same price as diapers, they are much easier to get on. I will be testing out other "training pants."
I've tried both Pampers Easy Ups and Huggies Pull Ups.  They both have the same absorbency.  The Pamper's wears better on my little guy.  He likes the softness of the Easy Ups than the Pull Ups.  Though he likes the characters on the Pulls Ups (Cars, Monsters) he prefers to wear the Easy Ups.  When he wets the Pull Ups, they sag and droop on him.  It's only happened twice but it has leaked when he takes a nap.  The Easy Ups have better staying power and don't droop.  No leaks, so far.  All kids are built differently, Pampers just happen to fit my little guy better.

Smell is good. my sons skin is not sensitive, so I use different kinds of product on him and no allergic reaction. I am an aveeno user baby wash-wise to be economical. But i would buy this again.
My grandson likes this but won't use it for long. I am not sure if it's due to the size, my grandson started to teeth at 3 months, or because of the different textures?  He may enjoy it more when he is bigger, I bought some smaller in height / width teethers and he seems to like those.
Bought it for my daughter when she started teething. Was very handy and also served as a toy by itself apart from being a teether.
After researching a LOT of baby shampoo on EWG's Skin Deep database, I decided to try this shampoo (in the smaller size) for my infant son. It smells good (different than baby shampoo, a little like a dreamsicle but not quite as sweet), and the foam is easy to apply and rinse off.
this product smells good and is efficient. it is not very greasy which I like, but it helps cracked nipples.
I love these little bottles, they are so convient. My daughter has gotten larger and now can drink a bottle in one setting. If I am out and about, without my wife. This is what I give her to feed her, if I can't warm up my wife's milk. I am not going to deal with the whole nursing vs. formula debate. Smarter, more informed people can debate the merits of formula. All I know is that my daughter likes, it and this is a convient form. I just wish they woud quit trying to up-sell the nipple rings. I did learn that the nipples from my re-usable bottles fit on top of the bottles. Game, set...Match!.
Before my son could crawl, he would lay down and look at this and play with the buttons on it. When he was working on walking he would try to stand up and hold this, but it moves too fast for him. He didn't use it until he started walking. So as a fun, musical toy, it's great, but as an aid to learn to walk, which it's marketed for, it's not helpful.
Points for having a variable volume control. My ten month old has enjoyed this for 3 months, which is saying a lot since she's hard to please. When she was younger she just enjoyed aimlessly pounding this thing silly. Now she climbs up on it and attempts to push it around.I know there are 2 settings on the wheels but I still find that they move too fast. I actually wish there was a locking mechanism that kept the wheels from moving at all. Other than that, I can't complain much about the value of this.
Maybe because my children both took initiatives toward walking just after six months and the baby has been walking over a month and is 10-months-old, but this is not the safest toy, on hardwood or laminate flooring, for a child without sturdy ankle-supported shoes and some directly-behind-or-nearby adult supervision.  It tends to slide uncontrollably, which is obvious, but may explain why their are so many different range of reviews.  It does not do that well on thick carpeting and is best on a flat area rug, in my humble opinion, unless your child is no longer a pre- or beginning walker but has is experienced with walking.It does help after they get their balance but not as much as just walking on their own, barefoot, with adult supervision and encouragement.I love the faux piano the shapes and other features such as songs.  It even has an old-fashioned fun.On a side note, the whole toy has features that are not cohesive as an overall thematic idea.  I guess for babies and tots it does not matter, some may say, and I could see that, but if you compare this other large vTech and competitive toys, well, it's just a tad stranger than most to the eye and to figure out the educational value as a whole, altogether, combined.
DS can sit in front of this forever!  There are a bunch of different sounds and songs that my son loves. he's 7 months old (and about 30 inches) but the sun at the very top left corner is still too high for him to reach when he sits.  Still, he likes the other buttons.I like that it turns off automatically after about a minute of not being used.i also like the &#34;slow roll&#34; feature on the wheels - you pretty much set the speed that they should roll at.  The slower setting means that my son can push the buttons without the walker rolling across the room.I gave it four stars because of the following reasons:1. the &#34;phone&#34; has no string on it so it constantly gets lost (not saying that it falls off by itself - i mean when it's taken off).  I guess this is good too because otherwise, it might be a choking hazard but it would be better if the phone part wasn't on this to begin wtih.2. even when the wheels are set to &#34;slow moving&#34;, it still moves too fast.  It would be nice if the wheels locked completely so that it wouldn't move at all.that said, i would definitely recommend this and would buy it again in a heartbeat.
I gave this to my son when he was around 9 months old, he loved all the lights and sounds and his favorite part is the barn door that says "peekaboo" when you open it. It doesn't move to fast when you give it a push (only on carpet)..the only thing is that when you press a sound they all play! so i can see it getting overwhelming for a younger child.It keeps him occupied and entertained while I'm busy doing home stuff. Some researches say that walkers are not good for babies to start walking because babies need to see their feet and watch where they going, but this walker is desined that way so babies CAN both see their feet and look ahead of them.This toy is exactly as it says a sit to stand learning walker. It has lots of interactive features. The front "face" comes off so he can sit on the floor with it and play....when he is feeling adventurous hhe pushes it around. It does not have any resistance feature on the wheels (like some other walkers) so he is still learning to push it and control it without falling but I would recommend it and buy it again over other walkers (I have 2 others that don't interest him as much)
My daughter and nephew love this toy but they were already walking when they began playing with it. I agree with previous reviews that it is light weight and can be dangerous for babies trying to pull up and lean on something. For toddlers and early walkers though, it is a fantastic option with lots of engaging activities.
These are really soft and comfortable, but they dont hold the heat or cold very long. I do like that you can use them for either hot or cold, though.
I bought two sets as other reviewers suggested. I kept one set in the freezer in a ziplock bag and the others I had on hand to warm in the microwave. I would use the warm ones before feeding my daughter and they really helped, and I liked the scent of them. I then used the cool ones afterwards or whenever my breast felt sore. After I stopped breast feeding I passed these on to a friend and she loves them as well.
Much easier than having to warm up water and then doing compresses....I never used the frozen remedy but I'm sure it would've felt good...
I usually use Pampers Sensitive wipes or Costco wipes, both of which do not "grip" enough and thus I have to use a whole bunch to get the poop off (solid food poop).I tried the Huggies Supreme wipes because I have read that Huggies makes their wipes thicker and are quilted to help "grab" things better.  They do indeed work so much better than the smoother wipes, and have the perfect level of wetness. They also have no fragrance which is great. While I will stick with Pampers for diapers, Huggies makes a far superior wipe.My only complaint, which knocks one star off my review, is the packaging.  Unlike the Pampers, the Huggies wipes are not separated into wipe container-sized packs, all the wipes are lumped together, and the zipper to seal the bag doesn't seal very well so I have to put the bag inside a Ziploc bag to keep the wipes wet.
One and Done on most &#34;messes&#34; (sometimes the wiggly baby requires a second, but that is rare). Soft, durable, and no fragrance. I will be buying again.
This bag is great, and exactly what we needed for the flight. It stayed in one piece, no rips or tears, but I did reinforce the seams with duct tape before travel.  Our Britax B-Safe car seat fits inside WITH the base for the car!  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because it is a bit of a pain getting the bag back together in the zippered pouch.
We are on our second bag (we travel a LOT) and this is a very good product. It protects the stroller from all the dirt and grease in the cargo area. We have a Peg Pergo convertible car seat which fits easily into the bag, even with the Brica Airport Travel Wheels attached. This bag is easy to see when you're deplaning and has a large area for writing your name. I will continue to purchase replacements as needed, but our first one lasted about 20 flight legs.
Maybe not with your hands...but my sensitive nipples can absolutely feel these are softer thanLansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-pack.I switched to the regular ones thinking I was saving money but turns out the unit price is the same when I buy these from my local baby store.  ($6 for 36 vs $10 for 60 of the reg ones).But these aren't perfect.  The individual wrapping on these are weird that a piece sticks to the pad when you open it whereas the regular ones don't.  Also, these are not as round as the regular one but I don't think it makes that much of a difference.  Good absorbency and frankly both pads can be seen somewhat under clothes.Overall, I would recommend these over the regular ones.
I like that they're individually wrapped, so I can easily throw a couple in the diaper bag without worrying they'll get dirty. What I found interesting was that the 36 count box contained pads that were packaged so they were slightly stuck to the packaging, whereas the 60 count box I purchased after did not (which I found to be better/easier to use). They're comfortable, which is a must.
I leak every time I nurse so I was excited about getting this product. Although in the directions it does say 'don't expect that you won't leak at all' I still was disappointed that my clothes got soaked after wearing this product. It explains that you have to wait until your milk supply is regulated in order to get the best results. If you have a full breast, expect leakage. It even pools the milk until you open it up which means your nipple is sitting in moisture until you release it.I still gave it four stars because it does stick well and is reusable which is important for the price of this product. If I am not full then it doesn't leak so that's a good thing.If you want more reviews on baby registry products, visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com.

My cousin told me about LilyPadz while I wa nursing my first daughter.  I immediately fell in love with them!  I could sleep without a nursing bra on!!  I could swim!  My nipples didn't show through my shirts!  AND they prevented leaking!I have told so so many friends about LilyPadz & have had friends tell me that they have told their friends.  It has been a LilyPadz revolution!BUT, I have been having problems with my LilyPadz with my second daughter.  After wearing overnight for the first time I noticed a sour smell.  I have since noticed this smell whenever I wear these.  I was correctly & make sure they are very, very dry.  But I think the milk, sweat, & other moisture creates the environment for that smell.I have also been leaking out of my LilyPadz more frequently.  I have been surprised.  I wondered if this was due to the fact that I began using these so soon after my milk came in & I was quite engorged.I have taken a break from using these, but will probably go back to them in the future.Another note: for those who read that these lose their stick too soon, try this.  I wash mine in Dawn dish soap (the instructions say to use a soap that de-greases).  While I am washing, I rub the sticky sides together.  In the instructions it says that this will help restore the stick.  Whenever I read this type of complaint, I wonder if they are following this instruction.  It works!
This works really well at moisturizing sore nipples and doesn't have to be washed off before feedings. I only wish it was a little bit better value. I didn't notice a weird smell that everyone else seemed to notice.
We were pretty satisfied with the diapers up to this point, but I've been getting 204 of these diapers for the same price... all of sudden I'm getting 180 count? The diapers work pretty well, however, they do seem more paperlike compared to pampers and huggies. We've had more leaks with sizes 3 and 4 than we did with sizes 1 and 2... If the leak frequency doesn't decrease with the 180 count box, i'll switch to another brand.
Luvs are practically the same thing as Pampers, just a heck of a lot cheaper. We've had a couple leaks with these, but I think it was because she really needs to be a size bigger than what I bought. We've had some major poos in these and never had a blowout. Don't bother buying expensive Pampers, these are the same thing.
I love LUVS.  They work great on both my daughters and son.  We don't have leaks very often.  My only complaint is the tabs tear off fairly often when putting the diaper on.
I've tried many brands of diapers on my son and recently we tried Luvs.  I like the Luvs, the price is right.  They aren't my absolute favorite, but for the price, we will use them during the day.
I like these for the price, but I like Huggies more.  These are good but they are not as high quality as Huggies and beyond a size 3 I won't touch Luvs!  They are not durable for overnight wear beyond a baby.  My toddler blows these out if I try and use them for her during the night.  I would buy them for sizes 1-3 but not any bigger.
These diapers are great, especially for the price.  My 2 year old daughter is wearing them during the day and at night and we only occasionally have any problems (she will occasionally leak but only if she has been wearing it too long or pees a lot in a short period of time).I did use size 1 and 2 Luvs diapers and was not a fan of how they fit my girls but once they got into size 3 and 4 diapers, I liked them a lot more and they became my go to diaper.I will still buy Pampers or Huggies if I can find a really good sale on them but with two kids I have less time to hunt down deals, so I just prefer to buy these Luvs because they are a decent price per diaper.
These work great for day, have never leaked, better than other brandsFit well, very absorbent, easy to put on too
These diapers work just as well as the pampers diapers.  The pampers diapers do seem to be a little softer.  I buy luvs using the subscribe and save option and find these diapers to be the best value.  I find luvs to be better compared to generic brands I have tried and just as good as the other name brands.
I feel that LUVS do not stand up to the punishment as well as Huggies do but sometimes our budget determines which diapers we purchase!  I recommend.
The scent is overbearing. The scent overpowers my babies room, the diaper bag, him, it is too much. The fit is amazing. The thinness is great. The absorbancy is awesome. They contain the messes perfect. 5 stars if the smell weren't too much. One good thing about the scent is that it keeps the diaper pail from smelling bad. I honestly cannot bear the scent though so I am searching for another diaper. My son has sensitive skin and these diapers did not bother him at all.Update: I still have not found a superior diaper. I tried huggies little movers and the scent was mild but they leaked everywhere. I tried pampers swaddlers which has a baby powder strong scent but it is more bearable than luvs perfume smell but they leaked. I tried Walmart brand and they were perfect fit and no smell but didn't hold enough at night. Seventh generation leaks. Earth's best has poop blowouts everytime because of the fit. I still want to try the regular huggies, the baby dry pampers and target brand but for now I am using Parent's choice (walmart brand) in the daytime and Luvs at night.
I have tried several different brands of disposable diapers and if you think all the diapers are made alike, well you are wrong.  I bought this because of the leak guards as my grandson is on the verge of being potty trained by still needs a diaper while he is learning to go potty &#34;the big boy&#34; way.My grandson is not a chubby child so the fitting around the leg is not as snug as it would be on a heavier child, hence the leaking.  Other than that, the diaper is fine you just have to watch and make sure than when they do go potty, to change them as soon as you can to avoid leaking.  Sometimes I wish the diaper manufacturers would make a diaper that fits a non chubby child snugly.
My 9 week old is a big boy at nearly 18 pounds. Luvs diapers have been great, but even though these should be the right size for him, there is a lot of leakage. It could be that because he's super chubby he just needs a bigger size and so I can't go by the weight limit on the box. If you have a long and lean baby within the suggested weight limit, these might work better. Otherwise, get a bigger size. I tried a size 4 on him today and they fit much better!
Good quality and fit. They come up a little shorter than Pampers and don't keep baby as dry. But during the day I change them more often anyway. Overall great value. No blowouts or leaks that any other diaper would keep in. I havent smelled anything off. They are overall about 7 cents cheaper per diaper than Pampers Swaddlers. And we just won't discuss Huggies, since I have nothing good to say about them. They don't feel as "luxurious" to MY touch as the Pampers, but baby feels the inside of the diaper, not the outside. They' don't have the little mesh barrier on the inside, but they do have the double layer leg holes. I don't love the looks of them as much either. But seriously, that's just getting nit picky. Overall I like them for a daytime diaper. Highly recommend.
This is the review of Luvs with the monkeys and not the blue clue's characters.  The newly redesigned Luvs are actually not better in my opinion for the most part, they are just as good as the old ones; they are tad thinner but more durable.The best part of the news one might be that it seems I can fit more of them in the same amount of space, but...they do have tabs that tear off and make for more unused diapers than before for some reason.And for me personally, Luvs is not the best quality diaper but it does the job in that if you change often it can definitely get the job done and it's always cheaper of a deal without coupons than it's sister diaper Pampers Baby Dry.My son used to complain a lot when I would put Luvs on him when he was younger because he was so used to Swaddlers and Baby Dry, which was back then and now, a tad thicker and more comfy-feeling than Luvs (barely and not by much is it though).Now, he does not. So, I guess the diaper is o.k.  They changed it, but change is often a very good thing, so far...
I don't love LUVS, but I do like them. They are not as good as Pampers, but they do the job. For during the day these are perfect as their price is amazing. It usually leaks at night though, but for the price, I can't complain too much.
Started using these on my 7 month, 17 lb. son because the price was unbeatable-7 cents per diaper after my $10 off coupon and Amazon Mom/Subscribe & Save!  So far I am impressed.  I've used Pampers and Huggies and have had problems with each- namely poo-splosions up the back with the Pampers and out the leg holes with the Huggies.  And I never let my son sit in a wet or poopy diaper unless it happens during the night, yet I've still had these problems with the more expensive brands.  Both brands also puff up a lot when wet.  I put my son to bed with one of the Luvs and in the morning when I went to change him the diaper was much less puffed out than the other brands, though he had been wearing the Luvs diaper throughout the night and I assume had peed the same amount as usual. These diapers do have a stronger "powder" smell than the Pampers or Huggies but I've heard that after taking them out of the package and letting them "air out" the smell gets less potent.  Other than the strong smell, the one tiny complaint I have is the design- it is this horrible looking purple monkey, and it's the same on all of the diapers!  I wish the diapers were just plain or had a cuter design.  Again, a small complaint- all that really matters is that diapers hold in poop and pee, which the Luvs do!
The diapers are good but after a few days my son's boy parts were red and irritated. I stopped using them right away to avoid a nasty diaper rash. In Luvs defense, he also gets irritated when I use Pampers brand diapers which I found out are made by the same company.Other than the irritation these are good diapers! I wish he could use them. At first I thought they ran small but after purshing a size 5 that was bulky on him I appreciated the nice fit of the size 4. The diapers are not snug but fit more like underwear.The diapers are thin but absorb well! I don't mind the smell but I can see how it would bother some people.I NEVER had a leak during the time I used them.
I have been using Luvs for my 1 year old now for awhile. I never have any issue with leaks (even in the morning with a very saturated diaper) except for when he has outgrown them. At that point I know it is time to move into the next size. I also love Huggies Pure & Natural for their softness, but I feel like the Luvs hold in the leaks better.
I used Luvs with my little girl when she was little which was 7 years ago. They do a good job and are a good price. With my son (10 months) I send Luvs to daycare and he wears Pampers at home. The Luvs never leaked at night with my daughter, but they do with my son. The Pampers do not leak at night with my son. My daycare provider prefers Luvs. I guess it all depends on what works for you child and how much they go at night.
I wish I could give these a 3.5 star rating, simply from the almost overwhelming baby powder smell. I know they're probably trying to cover up the smell of a soiled diaper but the baby powder scent -- to me -- is a bit overkill. What's nice about these diapers is their price. However I do need to keep searching for a better option.
These aren't as soft as Pampers Swaddlers/Cruisers, but they are much cheaper. They fit the same, too, in my experience. They are pretty similar to Pampers Baby Dry, and while I do prefer Pampers, I normally go with Luvs for the cost savings!
i orderd these because they are pictured and advertised as the newest luvs,they are not.these do work well for day time.if you like pampers babydry,youll like these.but for night time you might want something else,these did fine for me overnight but must be changed as soon as baby wakes.they may not work for everyone overnight so you may want something else for night use.
I really like using Luvs. The price was great, then all of a sudden Amazon started changing the price. The product is great but the price changes are annoying.
I use these with my daughter in her cloth diapers, prefolds and microfiber liners. They work amazing in healing her diaper rashes. I can actually say it healed. I noticed she was getting a rash, or has a rash, because her girly areas were red. I immediately put this on and on her next diaper change the redness was going down. By the end of the day, about 3 diaper changes later, the rash was gone!I use to have to use Desitin with disposables or a disposable liner instead of cloth. But now I don't have to.Reason for why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is that my microfiber liners are starting to smell. It smells heavily of this ointment and with some smell of her pee/poop. Mostly the ointment. I think this is not washing off my microfibers but my cotton prefolds are safe.
I was a cloth diaper user until I went back to work full-time and decided that I like sposies for the convenience.  This "rash remedy" worked well with my cloth.  We used BG 3.0's and 4.0's, Flip, and prefolds, and it did not build up in any of those.  But when we used cloth my son had maybe 2 times where he had a rash.  Now that we use disposables full-time, he gets rashes like crazy.  Every time he has diarrhea he gets one, and they last for days.  Some of them bleed.  It's horrible, and nothing seems to really work, including Desitin (stinks, smells like fish).  I was using Vasoline as a moisture barrier, but I like this better because it's safer.  They both work about the same, slowly, but surely.  I do like the smell of this, and it does remind me of the Strawberry Shortcake dolls.One 3.75 jar has lasted us almost a year.  I would definitely buy this if you are looking for an alternative to Vasoline, even though it costs 3x as much.
I was using Earth Mama Angel Baby balm for my little girl with her cloth diapers, which I loved, but Amazon stopped carrying it so I tried this.  It works well, it is a bit thicker and kind of sticky, overall, I like the texture a lot.  The only issue is that it has a sweet, cloying smell that I don't like at all.  I prefer the Earth Mama but now it is prohibitively expensive so I think I'll stick with this.
I purchased this in an effort to cure my daughters horrible diaper rash. We cloth diaper so my options were limited. Compared to other products available the price was right for this one. It didn't cure my daughters diaper rash and we ended up needed to get something medicated but it does seem to work well at preventing diaper rash.
[url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GGQ5PM/ref=cm_cr_thx_view]Amazon.com Review[/url]I have been primarily a Huggies mom for over a decade. However, with the birth of my fourth child, the hospital this time provided Pampers Swaddlers instead of the Huggies (due to a change in the purchasing supplier, not due to parental/physician/nursing staff requests).I had already purchased Huggies Supremes for home use, having tried Pampers Swaddlers (due to a friend's recommendation) about 3 years ago with no success (horrible rash on my then newborn son due to the mesh lining!). Overall, insofar as performance goes, I honestly see no discernible difference between either the Huggies Supreme or the Pampers Swaddlers. (Except for the fact that the Huggies newborn size has the "wet/dry" feature on the front of the diaper; the Pampers Swaddlers does not unless you buy the "Sensitive" version. The Swaddlers provided by the hospital wasn't the "Sensitive", but *did* have the line feature regardless in their size 1s. The Huggies does not have that feature in the size 1s. Wish it did.)However, there are aesthetics about the Swaddlers that appeal to me that has me rethinking Huggies for the first time in 10 years... at least until the Cruisers. (I can't stand the Cruisers. Swaddlers, yes. Cruisers, no.)1. I like the softness throughout the Pampers Swaddlers. The Huggies Supreme diaper is soft on the inside of the diaper (which *is* important), but not necessarily on the outside. The Swaddlers diaper is soft both inside and out.2. I really, *really* like the fact that the Swaddlers is a "plain" diaper. The hospital version does one better: No cartoon character AT ALL. Instead of some stupid cartoon character on the band, it simply says "Pampers". I *love* the fact that the diaper itself is plain and white. NO FREAKING CARTOONS on it. I do *not* see the sense or the need to put cartoon characters all over the diaper, especially for a child in size 1-2-3; who cares? Certainly not the child! All the cartoons do is pimp yet another product and show through clothing, which I find highly annoying on both counts. The Huggies Supreme diapers have characters and designs over the entire diaper, making it extremely ugly, and I honestly can't help but wonder how much, if anything, does that add to the overall cost of the diaper? I have emailed Huggies requesting the designs to vanish... we'll see.As for the mesh causing a rash on my new son... I'm not sure if it's the Lansinoh Cleansing Cloths, the Triple Paste rash cream (prevention), or an improvement of the Pampers itself, but so far, so good = No rashes. (I highly recommend the Lansinoh cloths and the Triple Paste, by the way.)Insofar as leaks and blow-outs... Both Huggies and Pampers are the same. Both do an excellent job... both leak and both blow-out at times. It's life.I do recommend the Swaddlers... Just be aware of the rash potential with the mesh lining, and perhaps the above-mentioned products will reduce that happenstance.ETA: Apologies - had to go; baby was crying. Where was I... The leaks/blow-outs for either diaper run about the same. Both do a fabulous job with containing both leaks and blow-outs, but I have experienced both messes with both diapers. It just depends on baby's output; I don't think there's a diaper in the world that could contain such a natural thing... unless the diaper wrapped around the baby like a onesie. LOL!For fit... Both Huggies Supreme and Pampers Swaddlers fit wonderfully on my newborn... However, I have to admit I prefer how the Swaddlers fit at this stage in his life; the Huggies seem to run slightly larger in size to the Swaddlers. The sharp tabs of the Swaddlers don't seem to bother my son at this point; I usually pull them nice and snug and almost overlap them under his cord at this point anyway; he isn't active enough to get them to move into a position that could make one of the edges of the tab poke his belly like my older son (one of the reasons why my older son hates the Cruisers). Still, that's one area Pampers could improve with no extra cost: Make the tabs have smooth, rounded edges like the Huggies.Baby crying. Gotta go.
I would first like to say that I was loyal to huggies with my first son. I decided to give Pampers a try because of the sensitive line. I never had a blowout yet and the diapers are roomy. Huggies run small. I would recommend these to a friend.
I like these diapers. They run a little bigger than huggies also. I buy these because of the wetness indicator. I hope that pampers starts placing the wetness indicator on all diapers and in larger sizes. It helps cut down on rashes at daycare because they can look for blue! Also my husband prefers it:)!
I have to admit I was a little disgusted when I received The Snotsucker from one of my DINK (double income, no kids) friends. I seriously thought it was a dig at my joining the "breeders". However, it is an amazing and awesome device that is also gross (well, unless you really like snot and boogers; most women don't fall into that category!)When I received it, I couldn't believe that it was $14. The packaging is a clear, cheap plastic box, and the little blue tube is attached to a clear hose with a small blue filter at the top. It looks like a gag gift that someone might give you from Spencers or Archie McPhee.However, it knocked my (baby's) snots off! The congestion we could hear was way up in the nasal passages. The little bulb aspirator given to us at the hospital was useless for that. So I pulled it out and thought, "What the hay, I'll give this a go." I put it up to my baby's nose and inhaled. Boogers and snot came rushing out. I couldn't believe it! They collect in the bottom of the tube - while the little blue filter is at the top, I can't imagine that there would actually be enough congestion (or that someone could suck hard enough)to physically inhale the mucus that high.My baby still doesn't like the aspiration - but he fights less when I use the Nosefrieda as compared to the bulb aspirator.I also love that I can clean it - in the sink or in the dishwasher. I never have figured out how to clean the bulb aspirator correctly. (wonder what it looks like inside with all the dried junk in there?)So while it might be gross, it's certainly something I would give any parent with a young child or newborn. Highly recommended. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because I think that $6 would be a more appropriate list price.
I LOVE our Snotsucker, as it gets the goo out like nothing else.  I just hate the taste of the plastic mouthpiece.  It tastes and smells strongly of petroleum products to me -- granted, I have a very sensitive sense of smell, but it's really horrible.  We have two Snotsuckers, and one seems worse than the other.  I put up with it because I could never go back to a simple bulb aspirator after seeing how much more effective the Nosefrida is though.
This product does the job, it sucksAll the nasty clear, yellow, or green guckIt works really well and it's cleanNow to my child, I seem less meanSo when your child is sick, has boogers coming out all over the place, that blue bulb sucker thingy is sub-par.  It doesn't suck that great, kids hate it, etc.  But once I got this nosefrida, it has helped immensely.  It sucks really well, gentle on the nose, and you can control the vacuum sucking power with your mouth.  The container is big enough where you can suck a lot of stuff and not touch the filter.  Even if the filter is touched, it can be rinsed to a certain degree.  It comes with about 3 extra filters, but I haven't had to use them just yet.  Though someone mentioned kids don't cry when you use it, well, that depends.  My kid hates anything touching her nose, but this tool has helped a lot because it's fast and fast is what I need to get the job done because my infant squirms so darn much.  Thank you nosefrida!
Our baby has a stuffy nose all the time, and frequently spits up through his nose. A quick frida and he's done! He doesn't like it, and usually has a good cry (mostly because I think he doesn't like his arms being held down), but once it's done he immediately stops crying and falls asleep much more comfortably. Highly recommend, much better than the bulb.
Works great but sort of hard to clean. This gets boogers out of the baby like nobody's business but I have found that it is hard to clean. We use a small baby bottle nipple cleaner on the bullet shaped part and sometimes run diluted bleach water through the straw to keep the gunk from building up in there.
My son has reflux, and as a result, spits up a lot (often through his nose), so we find ourselves having to clear out his nostrils a couple times a day to help him breathe better. Sorry if that's TMI, but it's the truth.  We have the hospital bulb syringe (which FYI, is a million times better than any other one you'll ever buy - trust me!) - but it still takes several minutes for me to clear out each side - and truth be told - he hates every second of it.  This contraption is expensive.... and it's so gross to even describe how it works.... but it works and it works FAST!This is a product that is worth investing in - and I know it sounds gross, but if you clean it properly as recommended, and change out the little blue filter thingie, you should have no issues.  Plus, the tubing is completely clear, so you can see if it's clean.... no hidden things lurking around (as in bulb syringes - yuck!)
The smell is very pleasant and they get the job done. I've been buying these wipes for four years now.
We had been given a sample of this direct from the company, so I decided to give it a try (we had regularly used Enfamil). Baby accepted this formula just fine, but it did give her horrible constipation. I ended up mixing it half and half with the Enfamil, to help with the constipation problem.
GOOD BUT TOO EXPENSIVE I WOULD RECOMMEND USING COUPONS AT STORES LIKE WALMART OR TARGET.OR SHOPPING AT SAM`S CLUB STORES. TOO MUCH ON AMAZON.
I bought this baby powder for my daughter because it is talc-free. The 3-pack was a good value. So far she has had no skin reactions from this powder despite having very sensitive skin like me. I would say that it works well and does its job although I don't much care for the scent.
Works well, but talc powder spreads more easily.  I'm not sure why being talc free is such a popular trend now...
The Aveeno Baby Soothing Relief Moisture Cream has been a real quality-of-life saver for my twins. Around the 3-month mark, my twins developed severe eczema that stemmed from a milk allergy (they had much less severe eczema prior to that). We switch their formula to one of the expensive hypoallergenic formulas, and that seemed to alleviate most of the symptoms, but their eczema flares up from time to time and NOTHING has come close to helping as much as this. Even Aveeno's own eczema-specific cream, which seems much heavier and greasier actually made it worse. We tried tons of other products, some all-natural, some worked, some had no effect. This is light, odorless and easily absorbed by their skin. It almost seems tailor-made for their eczema symptoms.I've since learned that this contains parabens, a fact that I'm not crazy about (and stops me from giving this product a better rating). That said, it's hard for me to say that I'm going to stop using it when nothing else we've tried has come close to providing the kind of relief they've had from this product. I really, really, really wish Aveeno would make an attempt to reformulate this, because a lot of people who will not use a paraben-laced lotion could be missing out on some much-needed relief.
This is good for my baby. We put it everyday after bath on my baby. It helps keep the skin smooth.
These wipes are very good. They are soft, wet but not dripping wet, a little thin with pores you can see through, but have no lint and do not stretch. These come in re-sealable packages and do not come with the plastic tub. They are perfectly portable and have enough wipes for a couple of days use per package, especially since I have twins. Sometimes those little plastic travel containers don't hold enough wipes for a couple of messy diapers. They are great for the bathroom and I found like I mentioned before that they leave no lint which is great for a quick cleanup on dark outfits when you don't want a bunch of white fuzz on you (Huggies Natural Care was really bad about that). They are a great all purpose wipe.
I have been changing diapers for almost 8 years now (I have 5 kiddos) and this has always been my go-to wipes.  I get cheaper ones sometimes for wiping faces, and for changing older kids, but if we have diaper issues (rashes, etc) I always switch back to these.  I am not a fan of the smell (unscented), but I do like how it helps lower the chances of irritation.  I used Huggies wipes for a little and they seem to be to wet?  I don't know what it is, but I could definitely notice a difference on my babies' diaper area.I would highly recommend these wipes.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they are pricier, and I do use wipes for cleaning my kids hands sometimes etc, and so I would buy other wipes for that purpose if I could.  (Although sometimes I just want to have one set of wipes, and so I will use the pampers sensitive ones even if it means wasting pricier wipes on things like wiping a mouth after a good ice cream cone etc :) ),
Not overly scented, no do they leave a residue/film after use. They are of course more expensive than generic brands but you get what you pay for. I've used these on my daughter for over 2 years without any problems.
I have used Huggies, Luv's and these wipes and the Pampers Sensitive are my favorite by far. They are durable and wet but not too wet with no overwhelming scents. The Luv's felt like they were cut too short width wide and they had a stronger scent then I would like for my infant. The Huggies work well also, but are almost too thick. I feel like it's wasteful to have a wipe that thick. The Huggies also had a stronger scent. The Pampers are my standard and I always order these in bulk!
UGH! Why is it that the best diaper cream we could find had to be petroleum based?We did our due diligence and tried other, similar products. We tried pretty much every diaper cream there is, and many that are similar to Aquaphor like Burt's Bees Baby Bee Petroleum Free Multipurpose Ointment. Nothing worked as well as Aquaphor.We mostly used cloth diapers, but when we used disposables on occasion our baby broke out in horrible rashes. Aquaphor was the only thing that worked to prevent a rash. It did NOTHING to treat them whatsoever. In those times, we mostly used coconut oil or calendula lotion.I was told to just try straight Vaseline since its cheaper than Aquaphor and pretty much the same thing. We did that, and it didn't work as well. Aquaphor is unfortunately the best we tried.
Everyone knows Aquaphor ain't cheap but everyone keeps buying it anyways. That's because this is the only thing that will keep diaper rash off my baby!
Not sure what made my infant's skin all red, cracked, and roughAnd putting ointment on a baby's face can be toughBut just strap down their arms with a swaddle techniqueand you'll find out why this product is uniqueit heals like a Elvin compound as seen in Lord of the RingsDoesn't hurt to rock the kid and singSo that sleep and ZZZzzzs can it bringSo a pediatrician friend said that for bad eczema like my son has, to use Aquaphor and it really does work.  Need to apply 3-4 times a day, and need to make sure you strap down the kid's hands because they have a tendency to wipe the stuff off with their hands.  Dr. friend said that at times hydrocortisone anti-itch can help reduce his desire to scratch his face as well.  But don't take this as prescription, ask your pediatrician.
Useful kids product for babies, toddler, preschoolers and parents.  We use on everything from dry skin, eczema, boo-boos, scratches, raw noses, the list goes on.  Can never have too much, so buy it is bulk here.
$1 per bowl. What could you ask for? They're the right size for mealtimes. Easy to clean and seems durable. I handwash and don't use these in the microwave.
This is very soft and feels much nicer than the other crib covers I've bought. Very disappointed that the plastic backing melted together in the dryer on low heat. It's too short to fit his whole mattress now.
Bought it for my daughter and it worked out great. Did not have any issues with it. Great price too.
I like these wipes soooooo much better than Pampers. They are thicker and you only need one even with the messiest mess. However they are FAR from &#34;Natural Care&#34; with all the added ingredients. Just make your own if you want  &#34;Natural Care&#34;.
I mostly buy huggies right now for the rewards points so thats why i chose to go with these. they are more natural i suppose then others and I like that they have no fragrance and no alcohal to dry out my tender babies sensitive tushy.I prefer things all the way natural, but I cant afford everything like that all the time and these are closer than some others.if there are things in the ingredient list that i cant pronounce then they arent "nature care"always feel like its slight stretch of advertisement.for the money and quantity, best deal.wipes not to thick and not thin where i feel dirty after changing my baby. good wetness as well. as long as you seal them properly they hold moisture well in the bag
I appreciate the sturdiness of these wipes.  I've (accidentally) found that they can even withstand going through the laundry and be reusable!  I love that they have no scent, and don't bother my baby boys' sensitive bums.
Love this thing! Easily clips onto my diaper bag and is easy to grab a bag for a stinky diaper. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the bags don't pull apart easily - you really have to tug to separate them. But so what? It does what I need it to do.
Overall I like the product a lot but it doesn't seem as dry a fit, so I do sometimes see a risk of diaper rash.  I love that it's one of the few out there that labels their product to be dioxin free.  I wish they made overnights.
The fit of these are very similiar to seventh generation. The diaper itself is white instead of brown. It holds a lot but I get poop leaks very often. It is made in Mexico. Seventh Generation is made in USA. Seventh Generation diapers are brown but are dyed that way for some reason. The Seventh Generation seem to be a little thinner but still hold a lot. I get less blowouts with seventh generation for some reason so I am only giving these 4 stars. I have switched my subscribe and save monthly shipment over to seventh generation to support the country I am from.
My 5mo son has eczema and incredibly sensitive skin.  After dealing with a 2 month rash in his diaper area, his pediatric dermatologist suggested he was allergic to disposables. But since I wasn't mentally ready to cloth diaper, I searched out every "free" diaper out there that claimed to be hypoallergenic.Out of some 7 brands we tried, these were slightly better than ok.  They held up well in terms of poop & pee. The tabs are easy to peel off and use.  The cut is slightly boxy, there's no slim area for the legs/crotch...rather, it's like taking a rectangular diaper and folding it in half.  Also, I find the outer shell to be very crunchy...not as crunchy and stiff asSeventh Generation Free and Clear Baby Diapers, Stage 3, 35 Count (Pack of 4)but still pretty crunchy.These were pretty on par withFisher Price Happy Days Baby Diapers Jumbo Pack, Size 3, 36 Count (Pack of 6)but these were pricier at 21 cents vs 17 cents for the Fisher Price (who knew they even made diapers, let alone chlorine free ones?) diapers.Overall, if the environment is a top priority for you, then you'll like these.  But if you're just a mom who's looking for a chlorine-free diaper for your sensitive baby, I'd go withHuggies Pure & Natural Diapers, Size 3, 70 Count (Pack of 2) (Packaging May Vary).  They are the softest and non-irritating to sensitive skin.  They also have a much better fit than these boxy ones.
This are a good buy,a bit expensive. The look is depressing and feel a bit rough,used this for a few months and went back to the Pampers Baby Dry.
we like this diaper. it is soft, absorbs very well, also holds through the night with no leaks and is easy to open and close. one thing i am not so fond of is the strong smell it gives off. (my nose is beyond sensitive though, when i ask my husband what he smells he says strange wood scent, but not bad.)
Earth's Best Organic Chlorine Free diapers are a nice green alternative to traditional diapers.  Used a combination of Earth's Best and Seventh Generation for over 2 and a half years and were happy with the quality.  We had occasional leaks but I assume that happens with most diapers and it isn't something unique with this brand specifically.Diapers are soft, maybe not as overly soft as other popular national brands, but a good feel.Diapers are white and has the Earth's Best logo around the waist band in the front of the diaper.  The closures on the diaper are nice because they are &#34;Velcro like&#34; where you can open them to check in the diaper and re-secure them and it will still hold.
I don't know what it is about diapers in general, but they all leak on us.  Maybe operator ever?  At least the organic one's are good for the environment.  Did you know you generate some of the most waste over two years in your first years of life!!!
These are great wipes at a great price, especially with the Amazon Mom subscription price! I only gave them 4 stars because I think I like the regular Pampers Sensitive wipes a little better because they are stretchy and I personally like that, but I would definitely buy these again.
These are my favorite wipes now.  They're slippery and soft like the originalPampers Sensitive Baby 3x Wipes Refills, 192 Count Packages (Pack of 4)but thicker.  They're not so thick it's rough (likeHuggies Naturally Refreshing Baby Wipes, Refill, 184-Count Pack (Pack of 3), which I don't like at all (although they smell good).Also, these pop out of my wipes warmerMunchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmerone by one, one-handed!  The orginal is a pain because they come out in one long grouping.I also use theKirkland Premium Baby Wipes - 900 CountCostco brand and like those but these are much better in my opinion.  If the price is about the same, I would go with these.
I love EarthMama AngelBaby products and this one is no exception.  It works great on diaper rash, dry skin, eczema, cradle cap, minor cuts & scrapes.  My only issue with it is that it has a strong herbal (eucalyptus-like) smell that baby doesn't seem to appreciate too much.  It is not scented, it is just the smell of the product itself.  Works great, is a ZERO on EWG's Cosmetics Database, just don't love the smell.  Only improvement would be if it could somehow be unscented.
These diapers do their job and I don't have to change my babies diapers in the middle of the night.they last a good ten hours for my two month old.i haven't tried any other overnight diapers so the one thing I would change is that they are a thing bit scratchy.i wish diaper companies would make disposable diapers softer for sensitive baby skin!
Until I found these overnight diapers, my toddler was wearing the regular Huggies to bed and every other morning I'd find a leak.  So I got sick of washing my bedsheet every day and ordered these.  We have been using these overnights for over a month now and while we still got a handful of leaks, I'd say these are pretty good for overnight use.  They fit well but do not seem as comfortable as Pampers diapers.  In the end, though, as long as I don't have to deal with wet beds, I'm happy.
Our almost 3 yr old sleeps in our bed with us (UGH!) and I quickly found out what a PIA it is to change the king size sheets every time he leaked through the diaper, which was alot!  He sleeps 12 hrs a night or longer.  We tried the Pampers extra absorbancy, no luck there.  We've been using these diapers for a long time and they are so much better than any other option.  They contain the wetness from 12+ hours at least 85% of the time.
I used Pampers Cruisers in the day and these at night. I have tried the Pampers overnight brand and they do not have the leakage protection of these. My daughter has very sensitive skin and these do not bother her at all. Been using for months and never had a leak. Only problem is that they do not mask the urine smell, maybe just because they hold so much.
The most important feature for me is the small pouch at the back of the waist band to catch poopy. My babies are breast fed so explosive poops are common. I would rather clean up a mess that leaked out the side a little than one that runs up their backs. No diapers are aboslutly leak free (as a lot relys on us to make sure they are on securely) but I have not had any issues with this brand. They hug her little waste the way Luvs do not (and I am a HUGE Luvs fan). I hope this reveiw helps.
I've found that Huggies tends to run a little smaller in size than the other diaper brands. Very happy with them still.
I really like the indicator strip for when they are wet or dirty. These are nice and soft and seem to hold a fair amount of liquid. The size worked well for my baby from about 7lbs to 10lbs. I really like these.
Without any baby experience, I stocked up on 3 different types of NB diapers.  A fourth type was given to us by the hospital.The Huggies Little Snugglers were the brand used by our hospital and we were given a package of 40 when we left the hospital.I had stocked up on Pampers Swaddlers, Pampers Dry Max and Seventh Generation.HUGGIES -- This was my favorite overall.  This one has a good cutout for the umbilical cord.  My husband & I also really like the stripe on the outside that changes color when the diaper is soiled.  As first-time parents we really liked having this because even though we change our baby at every 3-hour feedings, we like to change him in between if he needs it.  Since we don't really know what a soiled diaper should feel like, this little detail made it very easy for us.  The only caveat is that this is the only brand that would leave little "crystal"-like substances in the diaper.  At first I was alarmed thinking these were from the baby's urine but after a quick google, it seems some diapers can create these.  Out of the 4 types we used, only the Huggies left this.  The Huggies also held in the poops well.  The size seems like it grows with the baby for the first month without any problems.Seventh GenerationSeventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Diapers, Newborn (Up to 10 Lbs), 40 Count (Pack of 4)-- This was my 2nd favorite.  Again, there are pros and cons.  The pros, besides the fact they are chlorine-free, is they held in the watery poops well.  But I don't like that it's difficult to tell when the diaper has been peed in.  You can't feel wetness so you kind of have to look at the heaviness in the front.  This is a slight pain especially if you're a first timer and aren't sure what a wet diaper feels like.  I know this sounds stupid but if a newborn is only outputting one ounce and you want to change the diaper, it's tough to tell.  I do like the minor detail that it doesn't have silly characters or designs on the diaper.  This fit our long but lean son well for the first month.  This does not have an umbilical cord cutout but it didn't ride up high like the Pampers.Pampers SwaddlersPampers Swaddlers Dry Max Diapers, Size N, 84 Count-- Despite the claim that it has an umbilical cord cutout, I couldn't tell.  I still had to sort of fold over the top so it wouldn't rub against it.  It has no wetness indicator as I guess like a previous version.  It did hold in the poops well.  My 3rd favorite.Pampers Baby DryPampers Baby Dry Diapers, Newborn, 124 Count-- I didn't like these at all.  The fit was much more snug even though my son is slim. This was also the only brand that leaked out poop.  When it didn't leak, you can see the yellow through the diaper.  This was also the "stiffest" diaper of all the ones we used.  This didn't have an umbilical cord cutout either.  I also didn't care for the Sesame Street characters on the diaper even though this obviously does not affect the performance of the diapers.For any other expecting first time parents, I had stocked up on NB size diapers (more than 400 when you son was born at 8lbs+.  We also went through multiple diapers at each diaper changing session because as we would go to close the diaper, the baby would either pee or poo so we would start all over again.  This would happen as many as 4 or 5 times.  Yes, that means going through 5 or 6 new diapers at one session because small amounts would soil the diaper.  If I had it to do again, I would order one case at a time since the Amazon Mom/Prime shipping gets the diapers to your door in 2 days.  You might also save money by buying a smaller package at a brick and mortar store as your baby grows out of a size instead of having a huge case of leftovers.
I personally love thes diapers but my little one cannot use huggies anymore due to an allergic reaction. but the fitr is awesome
The texture on these has changed in a good way.  They seem softer and even more comfortable for baby.  Just as absorbent as ever.  We really liked them.  The cutout for the umbilical cord is also nice.
I like the price of Huggies, although if I had more money, I'd buy Pampers.  They simply do not protect my children (I had this problem before with my first daughter) from the extreme toilet situations.  However, those are fairly rare, so I choose to save money and deal with the blowouts.
These diapers fit well and do not leak like some other brands do.  They are also a little larger than the Pampers Swaddlers, so they can be used for longer.
They worked out great for our daughter. Did not have any issues/problems using them. Would definitely use them again it needed.
The bra is very soft and comfortable, but it does run a bit small. I plan on ordering another one in a larger size but keeping this one.
I received this bra today in a small. I am a 32B and it has some extra cup room but not any extra band room really. I wear it on the last of the four hooks. I found it to be very comfortable and the elastic isn't too tight and didn't cause red marks on me. The hooks are fairly easy to undo and I imagine that it will get easier with practice. Overall, a good bra to sleep in. It's cut fairly low on the sides so it may not fit a large bust very well.
This maternity bra is comfortable with some support.  I enjoy wearing it to bed and find it easy to maneuver with one hand.  Some maternity bras are surprisingly not easy to hook and unhook with one hand. I ordered my correct size but feel I could have gone a size smaller, it seems to run a little larger.
These diapers seem to work fine, and my darling cousin Alyssa didn't seem to mind them. She was leak and rash free, which is really all you look for in a diaper, right?
Pros:- I have used a lot of different kinds of diapers.  I lot of the off-brand diapers work fine during the day but leak at night.  The nighttime diapers in this package do effectively keep my daughter dry at night.- I really like the Size Right strip across the top of the diaper which lets you know if the diaper is on evenly (who hasn't put a diaper on a bit crooked with a squirmy child which has led to a leak?).Cons:- These diapers are definitely bulkier than most.- The cost per diaper is around 24 cents.  I can usually get Pampers or Huggies for cheaper per diaper on sale and/or with a coupon.Conclusion:These diapers prevented leaks which is a huge consideration for me but unless I can find them cheaper than Huggies or Pampers, I probably will not buy them again because they are pretty bulky.
Some babies don't have and sensitivity to being in a wet diaper, others let you know right away. We have one such baby in our family that is the latter. With the daytime diaper there wasn't any major difference in absorbency that we noticed, but the nighttime diaper was definitely an improvement.Pros:~ Nighttime diapers allowed baby to sleep longer before waking.~ Even with the longer time between changes, it didn't cause any skin discomfort.~ Cute unisex designs on both diapers.~ The amount of day and night diapers were a good mix.Cons:~ Both diapers seem a bit on the stiff side.  Not a big deal for the nighttime, but not great for the daytime diapered baby who is moving about.~ Price is a bit high per diaper when compared to some of the other brands normally purchased.
I gave these to a friend with a girl toddler (her second) and had her report back. Here are her impressions:The mixed package was a little gimmicky but made sense in theory and seemed convenient if the diapers were good. However, I probably wouldn't buy the mixed package again, because while they nighttime diapers were very good (would use again), the daytime ones were unremarkable, and no better than any other, cheaper daytime diaper. The 4 stars are based entirely on the nighttime diapers; without them, this would be a 3-star item.
My kids have used diapers from all the major brands including Cruisers, Baby Dry, Huggies, store brands from Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, etc., etc.  Compared to these brands, Fisher-Price's diapers provide excellent absorbency.  This is especially true of the night diapers here, which provide true protection for the entire night. (My baby is a big drinker, drinking 12 oz. at bedtime and another 12 oz. through the night. The Fisher-Price night diaper is the only one that hasn't leaked.)The front of the diaper has this color-coded strip that helps you fit it right: just make sure the tabs close over the green areas.  The strip is a bit hard to see at night when there is inadequate night, and obviously useless when you fumble in the dark in the middle of the night, but otherwise it's really helpful.Compared to Pampers (Baby Dry and Cruisers), the Fisher-Price uses material that's not as flexible, so if your baby is very active he or she may not be very comfortable in these during the day.  Not being brand-loyal, I nonetheless find Cruisers the most comfortable (judging from my kids' behavior) for active babies and toddlers.  Fisher-Price, on the other hand, provides adequate protection and should be okay in terms of comfort for babies who are not hyper all day long.I'm happy with these enough that I'll buy them in the future -- especially the night diapers.  The absorbency and the fit helper feature make these diapers a good choice.
This diaper runs a little small. I've compared it to Kirkland's (costco) and the Fisher Price diapers are about a half inch shorter. I've had to go up a size for my babies, which means less diapers of course. But, they are a pretty good diaper. As soft or softer than other economy diapers and just as soft as Kirkland. My babies haven't had any trouble with rashes, although there is still the occasional blow out depending on the consistency of the BM. TMI?The regular diaper I wouldn't recommend for traveling because it's going to keep in wetness for maybe 4 or 6 hours tops. So save those nighttime diapers for traveling and night use, obviously.  I use the subscribe and save and amazon mom and save 30% off the full price. You can't beat that. I'm done shopping Walmart for diapers! Yay!
These diapers are a bit bulkier than most I've used.  They seem to have a lot of padding for absorbing leaks, which is good, but I haven't had a problem with leaks in more streamlined diapers.  I would have liked to see these diapers at a lower price point, then I would have given 5 stars.  As it is, I will continue using pampers sensitive, which can be found for the same price by a frugal shopper.  I'd recommend these if you find your current diapers aren't absorbent enough.  The smaller sizes of these diapers probaly don't benefit from extra absorbency, but for a kid near the 37 lbs. maximum, you might need it during the night.
I'd never think I'd see the day when a toy manufacturer decided to make diapers. Well, they day has come, and by none other than Fisher Price. This package includes both night time and day time diapers, and fit my 1 1/2 year old daughter just fine. They never leaked, and seemed to work just as well as any other major brand we purchased (we typically have stayed with Luvs or Huggies). While my wife personally still preferred the Huggies over the Fisher Price diapers, largely due to how "soft" the Huggies are in comparison, I felt they did just as well. I especially liked the color coded fitting guide printed on every diaper. Essentially, it was a red, green, and red strip that indicated where to properly pull and place the tabs for ultimate snugness and comfort.For us, the night diapers have lasted longer than the day-time diapers, which is one disadvantage, in a way. At least for us, we always end up with extra diapers when we potty train, but that's what neighbors are for, right?In the end, these diapers are definitely a good, competitive option in the market. Quality and performance seem to be just as good as the "big boys" like Huggies and Pampers. Pricing still isn't as competitive as with Luvs or even a generic brand like Kirkland Signature.If you're in the market to try something new though, give them a try.
I like these diapers for several reasons, the lower cost being the most important.  But they are also made and sized nicely, and actually are a bit roomier per size than others I've used.  I like that they include day and night diapers in the same box.  The night variety are great and sturdy, and keep baby dry all night, but I find that the day version is not quite as absorbent as the Pampers we are used to, and we've seen a few leaks with these.  Overall, though, we are quite pleased with this economical option.
Our preferred brand of diapers are Huggies so that is primarily what I'll be making my comparisons to in this review.We just moved my daughter (age 2, 27 pounds) from size 4 Huggies into size 5 - the size 4 was just a little too snug on her now.  The box of Fisher Price diapers we received was size 4 but I found that they still fit my daughter very well and she seemed quite comfortable - they were not too snug.  Even though the box says size 4 there still seems to be quite a bit or room in them with nice stretchy side tabs to fit around those chubby little legs that are always on the go.The shape and cut of these diapers seems to be like most diapers out there - square.  This is one reason I prefer Huggies over others - Huggies are nicely curved and contoured to fit around baby's legs.  These Fisher Price diapers fit fine and my daughter seemed perfectly comfortable in them, I just prefer the way the Huggies fit.  Also I find the Huggies to be a bit softer and more flexible, again this is just my preference.  The Fisher Price diapers are plenty soft and flexible - they are very comparable to most diapers out there.Lastly the absorbancy - these did very well and seem to hold quite a bit of liquid.  On absorbancy alone I would give them 5 stars.  I do like that the box mixes both day-time and night-time diapers in one package, both the day-time and night-time diapers were great - we never had any leaks or mishaps.Overall I would recommend these diapers - although my personal preference is still for the Huggies based on their design and softness, if I saw a good sale on the Fisher Price diapers online or in the store I would likely get them knowing that they perform just as well.
I was prepared to not like these diapers.  I have found that most diapers leak at night.  Needless to say, I was AMAZED at how well these do for overnights!  There was no leaking whatsoever.Since my own child is potty trained, I tried these out on my cousin's son.  My cousin was at her wit's end trying to find a nighttime diaper that did not leak.  She is now a very happy mom with the Happy Days & Nights Diapers by Fisher Price.  What a great idea, Fisher Price!
I was excited to try these Fisher Price Day and Night Diapers.  Mainly because I haven't ever used a nighttime specific diaper for my 19 month old son.  I have had problems with other (non-night specific)name brand diapers leaking in the front overnight.  I have been pleasantly suprised by no leaks!  The nighttime diaper also seems to have a more comfortable fit compared to the day time diaper.  The only issue I had with these diapers was the sizing.  My son is 26 lbs and wears a size 4 in most brands however, these barely fit within the green (correct) fastening area.  I think the next size up would be a perfect fit for him. I really like the combo pack feature it is great to have both types in a one stop shop.
