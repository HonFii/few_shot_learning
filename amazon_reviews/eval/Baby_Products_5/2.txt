I love that these diapers are cheaper than pampers, but that's pretty much all I love about them. My daughter has always worn pampers, but since she's older now, I figured I would try a cheaper diaper and save some money. Well, it certainly isn't worth it when they crumble and don't last. She has leaked so much with these, something that never, ever happened in pampers. I'll be switching back once this box is gone.
When I had my first daughter I wanted to try pumping after my milk came in.  I did not sterilize my tubing/bottle/shield, so I threw the milk away when I was done.  I thought it was so important to have my bottles & shield sterilized for the good of my baby.However, when I told my pediatrician that I had thrown out my milk she was appalled.  She explained to me how unnecessary it is to sterilize pump parts & bottles.  They simply need to be cleaned.  Breast milk is sterile & therefore the shields need only to be rinsed with very hot water immediately after pumping.  If they are not immediately cleaned they simply need to be washed as you would wash your dishes.Additionally, will you continue to sterilize everything that your child uses?  Baby food spoons?  Baby food bowls?  Sippy cups?  Most likely, no.  It is excessive & unnecessary to sterilize pump parts every time you use them.One reviewer stated that they were beneficial for traveling.  This might be the only reason these bags need to be used.  Hotel soap isn't exactly the best thing to use & often hotel water doesn't get that hot.  All in all, these are a silly product as people are overly cautious about pump parts.  No need to be!
I do like the convenience of these bags, but they are marketed to be multiple use and every one I have used breaks (typically at the seams) after the first use. They are handy, but perhaps another brand would be better.
Nice size, good for the money for pampers diapers, but just did not work well with my daughter. Does not have band around the back of the diaper so with my daughter the poop goes right up the back. I just use up and up at target which do great with her and my money.
The liner does and always has caused problems with the baby's bottom. I don't buy them for this reason. Huggies cut his legs, so I go with LUVS when using conventional diapers. I can't see paying more for diaper rash. They actually did worse to prevent leaks than LUVS especially when the babe is down for a long nap.
I'm a first time mom of a baby boy.  I've tried many different kinds of diapers on my son.  Pamper's Baby Dry are the worst I've used.  They don't hold much at all!  I've been lucky and my little man sleeps through the night, but these diapers can't stand up to that (even when he was only 2 months old)!  Every night they leaked.  I couldn't stand it.  I had to buy a different kind of diaper to use at night time until that package of baby dry was gone.  My favorite diapers have to be either Pamper's Swaddlers, or Huggies Supreme Natural Fit.  The only thing is, the Huggies seem to run a little bit smaller than the Pampers.
I tried these diapers when my son was around 3 months old. They are thin and a tad scratchy. The tabs do stretch well but the velcro area where you stick the tabs is a bit small so I would fumble when I changed the diaper. We had several leaks with these diapers and ended up getting a really icky white beaded substance on his bum when he would wake in the morning. I also walked into his room in the morning and he would have leaked so much in these the whole front of his shirt would be soaked in urine too. I have not bought these diapers since we used that one pack and don't think I ever will use them again.
I have been a loyal Pampers customer for years, but lately, I don't know what they are doing.  When they introduced DryMax, I switched to Baby Dry because it caused mild redness on my older son.  I have happily used the Baby Dry -- they really do last 12 hours and have never leaked for me.  When my younger son was born, he reacted horribly to Swaddlers with DryMax, so we switched to Baby Dry.  He just moved up to size 3 and is now reacting badly to these diapers.  Even with heavy duty diaper cream, he turned red and became very rashy.  Last night I noticed that he was VERY red in the creases of his legs and then realized his skin was raw and bleeding.  The diapers are nowhere near too tight.  I realize that sometimes things happen to kids that is not the manufacturer's fault, but after taking a break from these for a day and then coming back to them, my son is red and rashy again.  I think I'm ready to give up on Pampers.  I don't know what the heck they're doing, but their diapers are sub-par compared to what they used to be.*Edited on October 4, 2011
I liked these the best when my baby was 16 lbs. but now at 20lbs he leaks through every one of them in 2 hours or less. The 4's fit a little too big and I know he's almost ready but these are supposed to be good to 28lbs and they are not. I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don't trust them. Size 3 of Sam's Club brand is working WAY better than these and cost less too.
This is good diaper for a day time only. Suppose to be able to keep baby dry for 12 hours, but this is not true. My 1 year old son wears size 4, goes to sleep at 7 pm and wakes up at 6 am-there was leak every morning! I started to change him in the middle of the night when he wakes up for food and still leaking. There is something about the fitting, that when baby is moving it doesn't hold wetness well.I started to use a bit more expensive Pampers Cruisers and Pampers extra Protection Overnight and they are 100% dry. They hold a lot for baby's pee, I never had an accident with these.So I give 2 stars because Pampers Baby Dry are ok diapers but definitely not 12 hours as they claim.I found out that it is better to upgrade the size of diapers when baby reaches the weight that is in the middle of the bracket. Example: size for is usually 22-27 lb, and size 5 starts at 27 lb; when my son will reach 25 lb I will start using size 5. There is less leaks because bigger diaper holds more and there is more room around belly. This tip doesn't work for me with Baby Dry, there is always gap between belly and diaper when diaper is full.
We Liked the swaddlers.  Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
The diapers are super absorbent and do a great job.  Half way through the bag, we noticed that the sticky tabs weren't sticky.  The diapers weren't staying on.  This could just be a bad batch of diapers with no sticky, but for the cost of diapers, I am not going to take a change on buying another set of diapers.  We are sticking with the Pampers Cruisers - love them!
This does leak and many times spolis  my kids dress. We have changed the size of diaper we use, but yet the same problem continues.
I bought these because I had a really good deal. Unfortunately, the deal was too good to be true. My daughter consistently pees out of the front when she wakes up in the morning. During the day, these diapers are fine because she lets us know when she has peed. I wouldn't put them on at night. They tend to leave little opaque pebbles on her butt. As for the sizing, they tend to run big with tabs made for newborns. I would use these at daycare or in the diaper bag because you can get 5-6 diapers in a small bag. Right now, I would rank generic diapers from HEB (I live in Texas) better than Pampers.
I did not like the greasy and oily texture of this, or digging my finger into the jar to scoop it out.  It gets under your fingernails.  I felt like the grease would transfer onto my clothes.  It was hard to apply vs. the thicker Lansinoh lanolin.
I requested this glider in my registry and someone bought it for me. I had read the reviews and it seemed like a good deal. Let me tell you, after sitting many hours in this chair..it is just not comfortable. The cushions are just too small and thin to sit on for very long. I cannot find a thicker cushion to fit it either. Using a foam pillow under the cushion right now. Also, the seat cushion started coming apart at the seam in just 1 month of use. The ties that tie the back cushion to the frame ripped out in 2 months of use. The wood finish scratches easily. And it is just plain small. All in all I desperately wish I had opted for a more expensive chair that is bigger in size, more comfortable, and better built.
I just received this chair the other day in cherry with the beige seat. My husband was so excited to start putting it together until we realized that three bolts on the bottom  of the gilder were stripped, and one was missing. Also beige is not exactly what I would conceder the color to be, closer to a very light tan with a grayish color, it is more a dirty beige. The seat itself is also a bit thinner then i would like so needless to say I have concerns on how well it will hold up over this next year or so. We will be exchanging this item and hope that the next one will be better made since i really do not want to offend my mother in law at this point. If the next one has the same problems with the stripped and missing bolts then i will be looking into a different brand.Update: Sent the old broken one back to Amazon and Amazon shipped a new one to me very fast. Thankfully this one didn't have the problems like the last one did. Almost 7 months pregnant i was able to put the glider together by myself and it was very easy. Well everything except for the snaps for the arm rest covers, getting those to stay on took more time then putting the whole thing together. I am still worried about the thickness of the seat, i have also discovered that the fabric is itchy and that the seat is not very wide, i would not recommend this chair for someone who is on the heavy side.
I was always loyal to Pampers and tried these Easy Ups before any other brand. It's very disappointing that the side flaps don't open (you basically have to rip them open). Because of the that it just made sense to switch to Pull Ups.
I've used pampers exclusively since we left the hospital. My daughter is 12 months old now & we're using Cruisers size 3, the old version with "Go Baby Grips" on the package is far superior to the "Comfort Flex". They removed the mesh liner (which we liked as it kept the skin off the wetness) and absorbency has gone down the tubes. I drive around now & look for places that sell the old version (and buy those instead). Sad I have to stockpile diapers from the old production line.
My son didn't care for this toy/walker. I liked the idea but it seems to be too busy for him. He only played with red square, the sounds and lights are too much. When I tried to play with him he just turned his head away and went to play with simple toys (loves pots, pans, measuring cups, bottles, cans etc).Also the walker has no stop option for standing babies trying to play, the walker has to be next to something sturdy like wall or coffee table. The product by itself it's good quality for me it's unnecessary.Baby loves to walk with it, but it can be too fast on the floor other than carpet. I return this walker and take my umbrella stroller. He loves to push it around and I can control the turns just by holding the handles.
These wipes feel stiff and they tear easily! Also, my son just got a diaper rash and he hasn't had one in almost 9 months! Very dissatisfied with these wipes!!
I really thought this would have been a lil better but unfortunately it wasn't.  I am sure it has to do with the airlines not handling things properly plus where the handle is they might not see it or use it so I'm guessing they might have been throwing it around by the draw string.  It ripped and frayed in various places all over the bag.  I'm sure it also has something to do with sliding around under the plane.  I mean at least it looks better than a black trashbag but still... for the price I don't think I'll be buying a new one for every travel.  Will look into better options.
I bought this product at another store.  I didn't realize there was more than lanolin when I first used it.  I thought since this was a different brand the lanolin was &#34;thinner.&#34;  After I read the ingredients, I went back to Lansinoh, which is pure lanolin, though no a smooth application.Pros:-It's easy to apply.Cons:-It's NOT pure lanolin.- It has a taste to it, which my son doesn't mind, but I do, so I stopped using it.
We've used these diapers since birth and I'll use them will all of my future children. These are the only diapers that don't leak for us! I love the stretchy sides and the tabs that wrap far around the waist to catch the liquid! Buying them from Amazon is the best because you can't beat the price anywhere else!I'm updating this today (Nov 16, 2011) because I've noticed many of the subscribe and save item's prices are going up up up. Be careful and watch your subscriptions because it may be better to go back to buying them at the local store.
I have been making my way through all the brands trying to find the ones I like the best. I have tried huggies, pampers, parents choice, Kirkland brand, rite aid brand, and these Luvs. So far, out of all the ones I have tried these are the worse I have experienced so far. They are so light weight and flimsy that they barely hold any pee. My son slept six hours, and when he woke up, as I nursed him I noticed that his sleeper was a little damp in the front where the diaper was. I realized the pee was soaking through the front of the diaper and into his sleeper. My son has slept for longer amount of time in all the other brands and never had any of them not hold the absorb of pee like these Luvs. Huggies starts to bleed out of the front with pee at around 12 hours. But these diapers can't even last more than 5 hours on my baby. I feel like I have to wake him in the middle of night when he is wearing this diapers just so the pee doesn't absorb through and start to dampen his sleeper.Not only does it not hold much pee, but the diapers have a very strong powder/floral smell to them which I don't like. If I close my baby's room door for a bit, when I open it the room is smelling strongly of these diapers and it isn't a pleasant smell either.The diapers may not leak from the sides, but if my baby sleeps for longer than 5 hour it starts to leak from the front of the diaper where the cartoon characters are and even from the top. I don't like keeping my baby in a wet diaper for a long period of time, but if he is sleeping I would rather not wake him. So, if your baby sleeps for long periods of time, maybe you should stay away from this brand.
I tried these diapers on my newborn son because I had bought 4 packs while they were on sale during my pregnancy. The first diaper we used completely leaked and soaked through his whole outfit and he was only in it for maybe 1.5 hours. I didn't like the fact the diapers were a bit "scratchy" in feel too. I returned all of the packs because of the leak.
My mom baught me a box of these diapers before I had my baby. I had been using Pampers Swaddlers since she was born, but she grew out of the size ones, so figured I'd use the box of size 2's of Luvs. I only used a few of them before I had to stop. They worked leak wise, but they gave my baby a major rash, and not just on her bum. Her skin got all red around the waist on her back, and her tummy. It was red and blotchy. And her bum also got red and blotchy. And no, the diaper wasn't too tight. It was a reaction to something in the diaper. When I opened the box I noticed they were heavily perfumed, way more perfume than the Pampers I had been using. I'm guessing it had to do with either the fragnrence, or the dye they used in the diapers that irritated her skin. Unfortunately I couldn't use them at all. Guess you don't know until you try them. I've stuck with Pampers ever since. The Huggies Natural Care diapers leaked like mad, adn she's not a big pee-er. The Pampers have never leaked. All babies are going to blow out a diaper no matter what the brand, but she's never had a wet leak in the Pampers, so I've stuck with them. I think the Pampers are worth the few extra bucks. So, I wouldn't say don't try these, but if you have a sensitive skinned baby, I'd stay away. My baby doesn't have particularly sensitive skin, but these really irritated her.
We decided to try these at a rather inopportune time.  My son is on antibiotics for an ear infection and has slightly runny poop.  The fact that these have no elastic in the back causes leaks every single time he poops.  Sometimes they leak around the legs, too.  I don't have the problem with the other two brands we use, Seventh Generation and Target brand.  Those both contain the poop just fine.Another thing I've noticed with these, as well as with Pampers, is that they cause my son's sensitive skin to break out.  I think it's the powder scent.  Why do the diapers need to smell like powder?  For this reason I will avoid them, even though they don't seem to leak pee.  I will stick with the two brands that work for us.Update 3-17-13:We put these away until the runny poop was done, and they do work ok now.  No leaks.  If not for that awful powder scent and the fact that I have to "frost" my son's bottom with cream before use to prevent a rash, I would probably buy these.  They do contain the poop and pee.  I just wish companies didn't add perfumes to baby products.  It's not good for them to be breathing in all those fumes.  Glad I only bought a pack of 36 to try.
The Leak guard is meant to hold pee within, not liquid baby poop which shoots right out the back ALMOST.EVERY.SINGLE.FREAKING.TIME!! Sure you'd say these are cheapest diapers around but you also got to consider the cost of detergents, stain removers and wasted expensive clothing which had a poop stain too large to remove... I'd probably have more luck saving $$$ buying Little Snugglers (last brand used) which costs more per unit! I'm very pleased with Little Snugglers but bought Luvs this time just to see if the extra savings was worth a switch, and if the monkey motif version is any improvement from the previous Blues Clues diapers. Slight difference I think. The stretchy applix tabs seem shorter, less paper pulp more SAP beads instead. I'm using sz 2 on my tall and chunky 2 month old and feel this is the right size as other brands of same size fit him the same with absolutely no leakage. As for containing pee I feel it does its job pretty well if you fit the diaper on properly snug around each thigh and waist.I've used Luvs on my toddler but don't like it because I find it leaking out through the leg holes when it gets wet it sags because of its lightweight construction and gentle elastics around the thigh. I had to remember to let him wear pants even when indoors in summer just to keep the diaper up. When diaper is kept in place it does not leak at all. Never had an issue leaving my tot in just a diaper with any other brand other than Pampers which essentially had the same effect. Same manufacturer same issues.
the diaper in itself was okay, especially the yellow line that turns blue to let you know your infant peed is fantastic and helpful.the reason I dont like it and havent given it more stars is that it is strongly scented.if I would have known that a diaper for sensitive skin is scented I would have never purchased it. I am sure it can not be good for the skin of a newborn
The only thing this has going for it is that it is cheap.  Just remember, you get what you pay for.  We don't like that these wipes:1) have a strong smell2) tear easily3) are hard to get out of the warmer one at a time with one handI suggest you pass on these.
My daughter refused to drink this brand and it did not smell pleasant to me, so I do not blame her. We used Enfamil.
These wipes are good for sensitive skin but they are way too thin. Especially for large messes, you need to use many wipes which makes them more expensive since you go through them faster than others. I loved the thick version of these which were discontinued so we've switched to Huggies sensitive wipes.
According to skin deep, these are medium level on ingredient natural / toxin / allergen levels.  The prices are great, but you can get other major natural brands for the same price on Amazon.  I've used these forever, until I really looked into the ingredients better and am pretty disappointed, granted, some of the other major natural brands' new formulas are also questionable.  The best ones I've found scores from skin deep are Bum Boosa, Tushies (but these are almost impossible to find except on their own site), and Jackson Reece.  Just switched to the last one I listed because it's the only one with free shipping on Prime membership, so I'll review once we've used them.  If not for the false advertising, these are very sturdy and stay moist but not pleased with the misleading branding strategy as natural...
I started out using Lansinoh wipes, then tried Pampers Sensitive wipes when we ran out, and finally tried these Huggies Natural Care wipes after my husband returned from a diaper run with them.  In comparison to the former two, these feel as though they stick on his skin a bit -- that is, they hang up on his skin rather than gliding over it, and really aggravated his new diaper rash.  Additionally, they dispense inconsistently -- sometimes they dispense properly, but sometimes they come up two at a time, and sometimes just a piece tears off when I go to pull up a wipe.I won't be buying these again.
I had never used Huggies before but I had used parents choice, target, and up and up.so I got theses while there was a coupon code. I used them and they are the exact same thing as parents choice. I rather get parents choice for a better price or better yet use pampers or target brand they seem stronger and better to clean up messes.
I don't know if I received a bad batch or what. These wipes are somewhat dry not moist like the other huggies wipes I purchased. Not very good in the wipe warmer either. I wouldn't buy the Natural Care version again.
***UPDATE***The first jar I received was great. The second one not so much. It is hard and very lumpy and doesnt even smell like the first one. It also doesnt seem to be doing anything or have any healing properties like the first one.  I am beginning to doubt if this is really the original product or a cheap copy. From now on I will only order directly from the Earth mama angel baby siteORIGINAL REVIEWI was a bit confused when I received the jar in the mail because it is tiny! I thought there must surely be some mistake, but once I started using it i realized a little really does go a long way. Unlike other butt creams and pastes you dont have to slather it on.  This bottom balm is also good for rashes on other parts of my baby's body. I plan to stick to this brand for a long time to come
Repaid is just diaper spelled backwards. I think it's appropriate because when we change diapers, we sometimes think of how somebody had to change our diapers once. I feel on some level that I'm re-paying what was done for me.These diapers cost more because they're supposed to absorb more than other diapers. They are good diapers and Amazon is a good place to get the deal.  Two other brands were more absorbent without costing more.
The diapers do seem to work better then the day diapers I use, but my twins pjs still smell of urine every morning.
Decided to try these because my one year old son was waking up with wet pajamas in the morning.  Well, these don't help AT ALL.  He's still waking up just as wet.  We actually started putting a Huggies Overnite on him AND a regular diaper over it, and that has stopped the leaking.  But when we go to change his diaper, the outer diaper (the regular) is damp, which means the overnite is leaking into it.  Will not buy these again!  From now on I will just be putting two regular diapers on him at night.
I don't like Huggies diapers at all. We used newborn huggies for a week when my daughter was born because they seemed to fit better than pampers, but when we switched to size 1 and she started sleeping 4-5 hours a night, they would leak. Such a disappointment because they are cheaper. They also feel thin and cheap and the material is loud and crinkly. I switched back to pampers before we even got through this box. I'd rather pay more and not be changing a small infant's sheets at 4 am.
I have received these as a gift and liked them but when I ordered them again I hated them!! They leak all the time!! I usually change my 3 months old every 2-3 hours, with these I had to change him every hour! They also leave a very strong urine odor! Not buying them again1
Pros:-They are discounted considerably compared to Huggies and Pampers-They don't disintegrate or smell when full-Color coded Night and Day diapers make it easy to distinguish between the twoCons:-They leak out at the thighs when full (mostly with urine)-They don't have stretchy tabs allowing to adjust the waist to the perfect fitMy daughter is in size 4 diapers and weighs about 23 pounds-I don't like Huggies because they tend to leak out easily (especially the Pure and Naturals) and I don't care for Pampers because the fabric-like insides get very heavy when full, so I use LUVS brand.  I was eager to try the Fisher Price brand, as they are in the same price range as LUVS and have a neat idea of including the night diapers that hold more for less leakage.  I was disappointed! They are much more stiff than LUVS and don't seem to conform to my daughter's waist and thighs.  When they get full, they begin to slide down her legs, causing her to walk like she's got a bowling ball between her legs-funny to watch, but it looks terribly uncomfortable.  I have also experienced a few leaks in the daytime diapers-the elastic around the thighs loosened when it got wet and that cause her to leak in that area.The nighttime diapers do hold A LOT, but they are also even bulkier than the daytime diapers! We also have quite a sizable "Poosplosion" in the night time diapers (She sleeps for about 10 hours in this same diaper).  The diaper got so full that her poo ventured out the top, resulting in a VERY messy situation! Not to mention the nighttime to daytime ratio is off a bit for us! I got 18 nighttime diapers, but ran out of the daytime diapers in 12 days, not a big deal, but something to consider!Overall, I'm sticking with LUVS and wouldn't recommend using these diapers on a larger baby-maybe on a baby who is younger and not so mobile, these would work better because they wouldn't be falling down to the baby's knees while they are walking.
Not the best diapers around the only 2 things that keep me buying over and over are the good Amazon Mom price and accumulating Huggies reward points. A cut better than Pampers - kinder on skin, unfragranced, and don't sag as much - Huggies diapers I think are best on newborns till when baby is learning to walk, so they don't sag and they hold a good amount of waste. I love the elasticized back that helps to contain less than solid poop within. However for toddlers, these diapers sag when a quarter full. The leg elastics are so stretchy they just give and give. Thankfully the side velcro tabs aren't that stretchy or the diaper will fall off as what I've experienced with Pampers, these will only stretch so far and then it stops stretching.
I love the idea of these diapers. However, they have leaked over 7 times already and I've only been using them for less than a month. I've never had that problem with previous brands (Seventh Generation and Earths Best - Seventh Generation being my favorite by far). They seem to swell up very fast with just urine. Add poops in it and forget about it. I use nighttime diapers, thank God, otherwise I imagine multiple night wakings. If your little one is a heavy pee-er, I'd skip these. My little one also developed rashes that I can only assume came from these diapers since she has never had them before...
I bought these in great hopes. Yes, they are a bit more &#34;green&#34;, but they are a real hassle. They will not stay closed. They just aren't as dependable as others we've used. We have tried about 9 brands of diapers, and these are the worst. :( With that said, they aren't SO BAD that we threw them out. We just can't wait to finish with them, so that we can go back to Pampers Sensitive- they are pretty awesome. Also - side note- these diapers have a slight odor that is a bit unpleasant.
Ok for day but leaked at nightWe only use Huggins at nightFit well, Easley to put on and remove
The description makes it sound so good.. '810 count', 'pack of 270 each'. Yea, right, maybe 270 empty diapers squashed to the smallest possible size. Each refill does not even come close to housing 270 diapers, and my baby is now only 5 weeks old. It didn't hold 270 from the time I purchased this (when she was a week old), and it sure doesn't hold 270 now. I expect it will hold even fewer when she starts wearing size 1 diapers instead of Newborn. I am very unhappy that I was mislead in this manner. If I knew that it would hold so few diapers, I wouldn't have purchased this and gone for a diaper pail that would use regular bags instead of these expensive refills.Also be careful when you get to the end of the refill. If it doesn't reach all the way to the end of the pail, it falls right out of the refill. I thought I could use the end bit to hold a  bunch of diapers. It was a decent length after all, even if it didn't quite reach the end of the pail. The next thing I know, my diapers are all over the inside of the pail, NOT in a bag. I had to transfer them to another bag with my bare hands. Thanks. I paid all this money to do that.
These refills are ok. The system works pretty well at reducing odors...but I just can't cope with the idea of continuing to spend $7-11+ for four bags (which is what we get from each one of these refills).I decided to try buying kitchen-size trash bags with an odor-block feature. I put the kitchen bag down through the chute and tuck the top around the top of the area that you open to install an official refill. Then when the whole thing is full, instead of tearing the bag and knotting it to start a new one, I just take the old bag out and put a new bag in. Turns out it works fine. When the diaper genie is full it is the equivalent of 1/2 a kitchen trash bag! Since I bought the kitchen bags specifically for the diaper genie, I don't feel like I need to fill the other half of the bag to get my money's worth or something...but, just saying, each of the official refills basically holds less than two kitchen trash bags worth of diapers. For $7-11+.So, with the official refill you're spending $1.75-2.75 per bag, and you have to do the awkward cut and tie with a full bag of diapers, but it looks a little prettier because no portion of the bag is exposed outside the system.WithHefty 45 Count 13 Gallon Cinch Sak Tall Kitchen Bags  E86755you're spending .17 per bag, and it is less awkward, but it is not as pretty because top of the bag shows outside the system.I guess it just depends on what is important to you, but we'd much rather have the top of the bag show and get 10 times as many bags for the same price. This also means that we don't have to remember to buy bags often at all. We just bought a box of 45 bags and it's lasting quite a while.
I have to say, I'm disappointed in the overall Playtex Diaper Genie system.  I really expected these bags to be laced with odor eating/eliminating stuff.... like powdered arm & hammer or something, but no.Cons:- Cost.  Seriously, this is super expensive compared to trash bags.- Odor: Does nothing to eliminate odor other than the lid of the pail.Pros:- When you have a really smelly diaper, you can cut it at the spot and tie it off, taking the bad one outside and having a fresh diaper pail again.  So you don't waste a large bag, you can just cut it on the spot and continue.  This is a con because of hassle at 3am to do such...
The inner cotton may be organic, but what the heck's in the outter portion of the diaper? My daughter had rashes all over the inside of the thighs and along her belly where the diaper touched her. I bought these diapers because she kept getting diaper rashes... well the rashes on her butt stopped, but we traded them in for rashes everywhere else! And ofcourse they don't hold as much liquid and look terrible when they are peed on once (bunchy and lumpy through her clothes). I went back to pampers.
So I'll preface with the fact that these are very well priced for a "natural" diaper, but I don't like it because it's not as pure as it advertises.  On skin deep's website, it's a medium level safe / toxin rating.  I believe between a 3-4.  It is not dioxin free, as you'd hope from a "pure and natural" label.  I think most of us that are buying this diaper is in hopes to keep our babies away from harmful chemicals.  Had it just advertise its use of only the organic cotton, then I'd have rated this a lot higher.  It's a fine diaper otherwise.  I like that the higher sizes (3) still has the wetness indicator, and it really is pretty absorbant considering that it's not an overnight diaper.  Other than the misleading marketing, it's a fine diaper.
In comparison to Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive, regular Huggies newborn, and Honest Co. newborn, these have had FAR more leaks and blowouts. I absolutely will not use them when using the ergo carrier or overnight, or when the baby is wearing anything that doesn't allow for near-constant diaper checking. About the only time I'm turning to these (just to use them up) is a just-before-nursing freshie--when I know she's going to get a change right after nursing as well. I won't use them if any wiggling or time elapsing will occur.I've had the other diapers mentioned contain poops and pees twice the size of the ones that leak with the huggies pure & natural. I'm fitting them the same as with the other diapers. I use a combination of cloth and disposable, check and change diapers frequently, and don't have unrealistic expectations of what a diaper should hold. But I don't feel like I should have to spend my day with one eye focused on a diaper.My partner said he felt the elastic in these didn't bounce back at all versus the other disposables we use. The leaks have occurred both at the top back and at the legs.I leave a couple of stars in place because they would work for maybe the first week, when volume is very low, and they do have a nice umbilical cutout that offers a better fit around the healing stump than the pampers shape.But I'd look elsewhere after that.The other thing that troubled me was the grains of what I'm assuming is silica gel that I'd find on baby at every change. I would expect the absorbent material to say inside the diaper, not all over my baby's skin. That seemed really sketchy. They were sometimes a pain in the neck to remove, not wanting to stick to either cloth of flannel wipes, so I'd end up having to pick them off by hand, a pain in the neck  because they're so tiny.I have a month-old, roughly 8.5# baby girl, if that helps.
We normally use cloth diapers during the day and disposable at night, so I was glad to have found a gentler option for his overnight diapers. However, we started using these during the day as well when he got a rash. By the end of the day, we noticed he was fussy and pointing to near gashes he was getting because of these. We have to cut the sides of these because there is a rough plastic edge on each side of the fastener that hits the baby's skin. He was getting red spots that almost broke the skin in these places. We will continue using them until they run out, but this seems to be a huge design flaw.
So recently, along with the new packaging, it seems there is a new diaper as well. My daughter is extremely sensitive, she has chronic UTIs, so I have to be VERY careful about the diapers I buy. When she was little I used Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive - when the diapers had the mesh lining, before Dry-Max :( . I loved them and the mesh lining actually helped prevent UTIs. Then they switched, so I found these diapers and LOVED them more than the mesh lining Pampers. Recently though I just bought a new package with the new packaging and every single time I change my daughter's diaper, which is after everytime she goes potty litterally, I find that the diapers are leaving those gel ball things that diapers leave after the diaper is completely full. Her diaper never is full and cannot be. I am seriously disappointed. We are potty training and at home she mainly wears the Gerber training panties, but when we are out she wore her diapers. I am curious if anyone else has noticed this as well, or maybe I just got a bad batch of diapers... I don't know, but when I noticed this trend I was totally disappointed. I am going to contact Kimberly - Clark, because I have heard rumors that they have been tweaking the diaper, so we shall see! Anyone please comment and let me know if you have any info or if you have or had not have the same problems with the new diapers! Thanks!I cannot stand when things get fixed that are not broken.
I am a big fan of natural products, especially for my children. I purchased these in a size 4, which is right on track for my little guy, and they leak constantly. I started wearing them on him two days ago and they have leaked 5 times so far. I have used cloth diapers and regular disposable diapers for my six children and these come in very last for preventing leaks, with Luvs a close second. Now, they are all natural and that counts for something, but I might as well cloth diaper if I am going to be doing a bunch of laundry for the sake of diapers. I do not recommend these. I will stick with other products in the future.
I wanted to like these. I like the organic cotton, I like the "pure and natural" but I can't stand the leaking. I don't know why they leak, but they do. I'm going back to Pampers Swaddlers.
My wife and I have been very disappointed in these diapers. Frequently we found grainy, gritty little spots of white diaper lining on our son's skin after changing. This was gross and we hadn't experienced it with other diapers.These diapers may be OK if you change them every three hours or so, but if you let them go any longer the diapers can really start to leak as well as discolor in a way that inspires a lot of doubt about their ability to hold up. They also sag very quickly once they get any significant weight in them.We tried them overnight once and only once -- which was a big mistake as these are not designed for that kind of heavy-duty use. By morning the diaper looked like it was going to explode and there were leaks as well. I am not lowering the diapers' rating because of this, since the diapers do not claim to be for overnight use.Still, the white grit left on our son's skin and the general lack of confidence in these diapers' ability to handle any kind of higher volumes have put these diapers at the bottom of our list of all the diapers we have used for our son in the last 10 months.
Update: I was cleaning my daughter with these wipes and I had a previous injury to my nail bed and when these wipes got some liquid under my nail I was in pain for about three minutes. They tout alcohol free, but there is enough sodium in these wipes to make them about as salty as sea water. And, whereas alcohol stings for only a few seconds because it evaporates quickly, sodium stings for what feels like an eternity because it stays on your skin. So, when my daughter got a few bumps and I went to clean her she shrieked in pain. I had to sit her in a tub of warm water and wash her with a natural baby wash. She didn't have any pain from that. For regular use on normal skin, these wipes are okay and a good deal.I may continue to subscribe and in addition purchase different, more gentle wipes for when my baby's skin becomes irritated.Old review: I was disappointed to see these were noticeably smaller than the Pamper's Sensitive Wipes. They are just as soft, and wetter than the Sensitive wipes, and I guess that's a good thing. I am still on my quest for a good wipe (ha!) that isn't expensive. These and the Sensitive wipes are too thin. I think I've been spoiled using the Huggies Supreme products. You just can't beat them for thickness, softness and ease of use. I don't remember having to ever use four wipes for clean up from a messy baby's diaper until I started using Pampers. The good thing about these is they come with a nice, teal colored tub that is harder for babies to open than the Huggies tubs. Also for the price, you can't beat them, especially using subscribe and save and joining Amazon Mom. They're okay!
I got used to the Baby Fresh smell wipes and don't particularly like the unscented smell yes it has a smell can't wait until these are depleted. I also get the 720 because they come with a wipes container and uses them in multiple rooms
I found with these wipes compared to my usual huggies were a waste of money. They were too thin, you have to use twice as many and they dry out in the warmer really fast.  I have been giving them away so I can order more of my usual.
I usually prefer Pampers products over Huggies, but I definitely prefer Huggies wipes over these.  These wipes work similarly to all other wipes.  However, they come in individual packages that cannot be resealed. Therefore, once a package of wipes is open, the content have to be immediately transferred to a plastic tub.  Also, it is annoying that the contents of the packages are smaller than the contents of a plastic tub for wipes so you have to use about 1 1/2 of these wipes to fill up a tub.
We have three boys in diapers [at some point during the day]. A four year old, a two year old and a 4 month old. We have always been a pampers family. It's been our favorite diapers from swaddlers to cruisers. All the other brands either leak or smell or just don't hold up well through out the day. I am disappointed in this new "dry max".Pros:1. Very soft on the outside and inside2. Velcro's super easy and stays on3. Size variation is convenient [my 2 year old (30 lbs) can wear them as well as my 4 month old, just fastened tighter around the waist]4. Price is greatCons:1. We've had a lot more leaking with this version vs the older plain Crusiers2. Leaking during 3 hr naps & 12 hour sleeps [no leaks during the day though...maybe it's the vertical/horizontal position]Overall, I think I'll just go back to buying the other version because I'm not impressed with this new marketing. The product doesn't match the hype. I want something that will keep me from changing sheets everyday.
I bought a 252 ct box of Swaddlers that took me forever to use up once I realized how awful they were despite everyone touting them as the best thing since sliced bread... I vowed never to buy Pampers diapers again but I already had these Cruisers to review for Vine.Let me start off by saying that these diapers are very cute and soft. They are quilted just like the Swaddlers. I was disappointed yet not too surprised to see that the absorbent lining in Cruisers is just as thin as with Swaddlers. Then of course there is that pesky fragrance emitting from the diapers. That wouldn't bother me so much if the smell stayed like that and didn't morph into the very same chemical smell as with Swaddlers once the diapers gets wet. So every time my baby wets her diaper there is a strange loud chemical smell that seeps out to her clothing. I don't know what Pampers is thinking with that.As far as absorbency, these are the same as Swaddlers, i.e. if baby pees, you can immediately feel the moisture through the clothing. Once again I'm changing at least 12 diapers a day as opposed to 8 with Huggies Snug & Dry (I recommend those-not as soft but very absorbent and a better fit). These fit better that Swaddlers for my baby. The Swaddlers gave my baby a diaper rash a few days after I started using them but Cruisers haven't so far. That, plus the fact that Cruisers fit better than Swaddlers, are the reasons I give Cruisers 2 stars instead of 1. Huggies are far better in my opinion.
My 8month old has eczema and these unfortunately made him break out in his diaper area.  After a very exhaustive diaper trial, we've been usingHuggies Pure & Natural Diapers, Size 3, 70 Count (Pack of 2  Packaging May Vary)without any problems.I received the Pampers as part of the Vine program and since it had been a while since we tried Pampers, I was happy to try them again if it meant switching from the expensive, organic diapers.Overall, the fit is pretty good.  But when I first opened the package, I realized how  STRONG these are scented.  I guess I just got used to the Huggies Pure & Natural that's unscented.Then about 2 hours later, I noticed red bumps all over his diaper area during a diaper change.  I tried them again a few days later and the same thing happened.If you have a child with sensitive skin like I do, I wouldn't recommend these.
I was disappointed to see these don't have the mesh like lining like the pampers swaddlers do. My son also got a severe diaper rash while wearing these. I've switched back to the Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers which are the best out of any I've tried so far.
With all of the advertising that Pampers has put into these Dry Max diapers, you would think there was something extremely unusual (and fantastic) about them.  I was excited to try them and was disappointed by their performance.The packaging states that these are Pamper's driest diapers yet.  Unfortunately for me, that is not worth anything - my daughter wore one to sleep last night and it leaked like crazy!  True to advertising, they are thin, but what good is a thin diaper if it leaks?I am going to stick to other brands for now because it doesn't make sense to pay top dollar for inferior diapers.
We've been pretty much a Huggies household since Day 1, but I had the opportunity to try Pampers once or twice (I am not one to pass up free diapers). We first tried the Size 3 and found they worked pretty well. So when the Size 5 became available on Vine, I grabbed them again. Unfortunately, these completely miss the mark for us. I have had more leaks in the past three days with the Pampers than I've had in the past year with Huggies! And I'm not doing anything differently--I'm changing diapers at the same pace I did with Huggies...so I just think the Pampers cannot hold as much! In addition, I just don't like how stretchy the side tabs are--it always feels like I am stretching the tabs really far and that the diaper ends up too tight. They are also VERY scented--so much so that we couldn't smell a poopy diaper when we were right next to him. I guess that could be good or bad--but I'd much rather smell it to change it right away. So I am going to donate this box and go back to Huggies.
When I had the opportunity to try these new Pampers, I honestly thought only one thing, "FREE DIAPERS!!!" I have two in diapers, so the chance to get some free ones is nothing I take lightly. So I decided to put my Luvs aside for a week or two to try these Pampers. At the very least, I figured I would get some diapers that were at least as good as the Luvs and they would be FREE. Well, I jumped into the challenge with high hopes and with each passing day, it seemed as though the light of hope got dimmer and dimmer. Day one, the Pampers seemed to be up to the challenge of my 7 month old.  During the day he seemed fine in them. They were a little bit thinner than the Luvs, which are thinner than Huggies, (we used to use those but they could not stand up to the nighttime use) I actually only used the Pampers from the hospital and my mother-in-law (musta had a coupon) and then I went to Huggies and now to Luvs which are the only ones that do not leak on me in the night. Well back to the Pampers-they did fine the first night. Did a change at 10 pm and no leaks by 6 am. Score one for Pampers. The second day time use was fine, but I did notice that with the powder smell it was hard to smell poop. I have a breast-fed baby who does eat some baby food now. I had to really put my nose to his diaper and still could not tell if he had gone without going in so-to-speak. Nighttime of day two-well not so good. "We have a leak Houston!" I was still optimistic though. Day three, things seemed to be going fine until, "is that another leak?!?!" I had to change my son during the day for an unexplained leak. Never experienced that with the Luvs and rarely had a daytime leak with the Huggies. Okay day four, in the defense of Pampers, I am not sure if this was a leak out the top (probably was) or some random wetness my son had. How else would he get wet around his mid-section....okay I know, I know, it's the Pampers. I really wanted to like you Pampers, I was pulling for you, but you need to go back to the drawing board with these. They were free to me, so I am not as hot and irate as some of the other reviewers, but lucky for you I did not pay for these, or you would hear a mouthful from me here and on your site. It doesn't take a genius to see these are not an improvement. Back to the drawing board you go!
I do not like the swaddlers. The netting in the diaper does not wick away the moisture & keep baby's bottom dry as their ads state. In fact it is just the opposite; it keeps my daughter's bottom constantly wet. I like Huggies better.
We haven't had any problems with the burns reported by others but the diapers aren't quite as long as other Pampers and the lining sticks to the baby.
****I reviewed BOTH the Cruisers and the Swaddlers since my son could fit both at the time***When I had the opportunity to try these new Pampers, I honestly thought only one thing, "FREE DIAPERS!!!" I have two in diapers, so the chance to get some free ones is nothing I take lightly. So I decided to put my Luvs aside for a week or two to try these Pampers.

It doesn't take a genius to see these are not an improvement. Back to the drawing board you go! The pad that absorbs needs to go ALL THE WAY UP THE FRONT AND ALL THE WAY UP THE BACK OF THE DIAPER. Babies do move at night in their sleep and a baby lying on his/her back may roll to the side and guess what? Pee rolls too! Just a thought Pampers.
Very soft. Liked the inbetween size. But, if you don't change them right away, diaper sticks to baby's bum because it has a sort of a netting going inside.
Other than the free one's given at the hospital when my son was born, I do not buy Pampers.  Typically we use Huggie's, Costco's brand, Earth's Best, or Target (whatever's cheapest).  These diapers were a free trial pack, so I wouldn't normally buy them.  I have recently testedPampers Cruisers Dry Max Diapers, Economy Plus, Size 3 (16-28 Lbs), 160 Diapersas well.Both Pampers Cruisers Dry Max Diapers and Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max Diapers are super thin, really no difference in thickness between them, except okay, *maybe* the Cruisers are a tad thinner.  The Swaddlers have thin soft mesh on the inside, Cruisers do not; I don't find this particularly advantages, as when my son pooped it seemed to make clean up worse because the mesh lining and poop stuck to him.  The Swaddlers have the same stretchy tabs like the Cruisers have, which come in handy when you have a small child and need to synch the diaper tight. Swaddlers are a tad softer on the outside and do not seem to have the same strong perfume smell like the Cruisers.So far no problems with the Swaddlers; they do what they say they're supposed to do, so no leaks to complain about.  We do not use these diapers for night sleeping.The only problems I had are the same ones I had with the Cruisers.  My son is on the small end (he's 17 lbs soaking wet at 10 months old), and he's already walking, which means he falls on his bottom a lot.  With a regular (read: not so thin) diaper, he gets a bit of cushion when he falls.  With these diapers I felt myself cringed every time he fell because he always had a look like, "This didn't used to hurt so much."  There's something to be said about having that little bum-cushion for falls.The second problem is there is no elastic waist band.  Most diapers have a thin elastic about two inches or so from the top of the diaper to keep the mushy pooh from leaking out the back.  I worry without the band poop will leak out if he's in his car seat.Overall I thought the diapers were okay.  But given that my son is walking (and falling) already, it's not really my choice to buy these diapers.  Also, since he's thin to begin with, these diapers made some of his pants difficult to keep up.  If I had to pick between the two Pampers though, I'd go with the Cruisers.  Interestingly, the Swaddlers size 2-3 are for babies 14-22lbs, while the Cruisers size 3 are for 16-28lbs, but honestly they are the exact same size in everyway... am I missing something?*UPDATE* my son got the BIGGEST diaper rash from these diapers.  We were outside playing away from the house and I  couldn't change his diaper right away.  He played for maybe thirty-forty minutes (MAX) in a poo diaper.  When we got in the house and I changed them, he not only had a diaper rash, he had a white blistery rash!  Seriously, I've never seen anything that bad before and I know he's been in other poo diapers longer (hey, it happens).  Since then I haven't been using the rest of the Swaddlers we have left, I really think the problem is the mesh lining rubbing the babies bottom.  Someone was telling me that these diapers are known for diaper rash.  I haven't done any research on it, but I seriously do not recommend these and have changed my star rating.  I'm sure if you're RIGHT on it every time baby poos it's fine.
I really thought this would have been a lil better but unfortunately it wasn't.  I am sure it has to do with the airlines not handling things properly plus where the handle is they might not see it or use it so I'm guessing they might have been throwing it around by the draw string.  It ripped and frayed in various places all over the bag.  I'm sure it also has something to do with sliding around under the plane.  I mean at least it looks better than a black trashbag but still... for the price I don't think I'll be buying a new one for every travel.  Will look into better options.  By the way this bag is HUUUGE!  I have an Orbit Baby stroller and there was plenty of room in there although I just put the base in this bag then bought the Car Seat bag for the car seat... figured by splitting it up it would get less messed up but no.
My little girl's skin is incredibly sensitive, and until now Pampers Sensitive were the only diapers that didn't immediately break out her skin.  We couldn't even use regular Swaddlers, they gave her a rash right away.  The other problem we had with the Swaddlers was a horrible chemical smell that came from the diapers when they were wet; the smell was comparable to really strong shower cleaner, and I could smell it from across the room as soon as she was wet.  I never noticed the chemical smell with the Sensitives before the last two boxes we received, but now I am getting some major whiffs of a strong chemical odor.  She has had some MAJOR diaper rashes in the last few weeks as well.  Pampers managed to ruin a great product, and I am beyond disappointed.  I am going to try Huggies Pure and Natural.UPDATE: We have now used through our second case of Huggies Pure and Natural, and we couldn't be happier.  They don't have the eye-burning chemical smell that the Pamper's had at all.  These diapers are soooo soft, and they fit so much better between her legs - NO MORE DROOPY DIAPER!  And the persistent bleeding and blistering rash?  Not another sign of it!
Beware of the very strong perfumey smell of these diapers. It is overwhelming. I love the fit. I love the wetness strip. I love the absorbency. I hate the smell. I think it's only on the sensitive too. I won't buy these again. I will get the reg swaddlers next time I used the size 3.  They fit very good, true to the weight limit on the package.
I loved these for newborn diapers. I even had a few packs in size 2 and I liked them a lot but for size 3 I am having issues. Yes they are super soft and the fit is great especially for poop but they cannot hold the pee. I don't trust them in the diaper bag or at night. Everytime I use them my babies clothes are wet and his diaper isn't that full. It isn't wet like in one spot where it leaked over it is almost like the diaper is wicking and his whole bottom is just mildly wet, it is so strange. You have to change these diapers more often than washable cloth diapers. I will be using the rest of this box as a second diaper at night over the top of another diaper and I am stopping my subscribe and save subscription. I really wanted to like these diapers because they are so soft and comfy but they don't function like they should.
These diapers are good for absorbing but the tabs and stretchy sides are flimsy. I've had the tabs break off quite a few diapers while going to secure them. Such a waste. I don't think we will buy this brand again.
These are really inexpensive, so if your baby doesn't have terribly sensitive skin, they would probably be fine. My baby had never had a diaper rash before though, and I'm sure we've had 6 or 7 other kinds of diapers before we tried these, and they were the only ones that ever gave her a rash. Took me a few days to figure out what was causing it, but it was these for sure. I would recommend just getting a small pack first in case they don't work out for your little one.
I got these because my son had really sensitive skin. They weren't very moist and for the price I would say not really worth it. I don't think I'd recommend these.
I had high hopes for this being a more wholesome alternative to Aquaphor which we've had to use by the tubful since my son started having eczema issues.  The Aquaphor has always worked well, but I wasn't a fan of rubbing petrolatum and mineral oil all over my kiddo, so this seemed great.  Unfortunately this stuff is STICKY.  It might as well be some kind of temporary adhesive because it does not wipe or wash off the skin easily and it attracts lint and fur to it like a lint roller.  I tried to use it once on my son's eczema flares, but there was no improvement and he ended up with patches of lint and other stuff stuck to the areas where it had been applied.  Since I hate to see a product go to waste, I thought I'd try using it as a barrier for my hairline when dying my hair at home.  The bright side is that it worked well as a barrier for hair dye and my skin was saved from staining - the downside is that it was impossible to scrub off my face and ears even with face wash and a washcloth.  It left a sticky residue that I ended up having to use baby oil to get off.  I can't figure out another use for it - so it looks like this stuff is going to collect dust in my medicine cabinet.
I like the concept, but our baby didn't take to this nipple at all. It kept on collapsing on him and he would get super frustrated.
These are not bad diapers.My daughter did not get any rashes or have any leaks while wearing them, so from that aspect they are great.  The fit is OK, but I prefer Pampers, Huggies or the Costco brand diapers fit over these, although my daughter could care less.  I never had any crazy leak issues, although I could see that being a problem for some kids.  My daughter is pretty thin/tall naturally, so they fit a bit higher on the hips than I think they would on chubbier kiddos.Over all, although they don't have any of the bells and whistles of other name brands, they work well.  If you are wanting to go with something better for the environment, I feel these would be a great option.EDIT: We had a lot of diapers at the time we got these, so we didn't use the whole pack before writing the review. I have now and they have some issues. First, if you are in a position where you cannot immediately change a wet diaper, then you are going to notice a smell. Being "free and clear," they apparently don't have any deoderizer. Also, these diapers simply don't hold up very well. When we first tried them, our daughter wasn't as active as she is now (she is big for her age). Now, these diapers fall apart after a couple of hours. The outer cover is not very durable a will pill up. The straps stretch out and let the diaper the get loose. We've had had a couple come off. They definitely are not usable overnight. I would only use these if you can keep a close eye on your kiddo and change her immediately after the diaper is soiled.
We've primarily been using "green diapers" such asEarth's Best TenderCare Chlorine Free Diapers, Size 4, (22-37 Pounds), 120 Countfor my son since he was born as he has ezcema and very dry skin. My husband has sensitive skin as well, so we were trying to avoid latex, fragrance, and chlorine. This is my 3rd time using a 7th generation diaper, and each time, I've been disappointed in the 7th Generation performance.My son is 25 pounds, so he's on the lower end of the size 4 weight suggested guidelines. However, during our use of one package of diapers, he leaked through 3 times and had one blowout up the back. After the first leakage issue, we assumed it might be him, so we switched back to Earth's Best for about a week, and his pants remained dry. The next week, he leaked through again, twice. Since resuming our normal diaper use, again, we have not had any leakage problems.At $.30 (or more!) a diaper, I certainly expect a diaper that will stand up to normal use, rather than needing to do more laundry.
I got these for my two year old grandson as I am going green on most items when I can.  But these diapers are not that great.If your child has problems with allergies then this product is for you but, if you are looking for a good fit or abosorbency then you better look elsewhere.I found that the diaper is not very absorbent especially at night and often had to change the bedding every morning due to wetness on sheets and blankets and his jammies.  Believe me this is not what I want to do on busy mornings is strip his bed and put on fresh bedding.  But the problem seems to be that if the diaper is wet more than once (and you know little ones will wet more than once, especially at night) the padding or what ever it is they use for absorbency, seems to bunch or bundle up.  I change my grandson as soon as he is wet and do not wait until the diaper is saturated.  It's kind of like buying a cheaply made sleeping pillow and after a few days of sleeping on it, the insides bunch up and lump up.  This is what happens to these diapers.Also the fit around the legs is really bad.  If your child is chubby or has larger legs, you should be fine.  But if you have a child like my grandson, who is very lean and muscular, the elastic around the leg will open up. It is not a snug fit to avoid leaks and accidents.  It is especially bad when he goes big potty and sometimes I have had to change his clothing.Not very happy with this product and will go back to using Pamper's Cruisers.
I didn't know I had an opinion about diaper aesthetics until I opened this box and took one out, "Ew!" was my initial reaction.  Why? Because they are the same color as those cheap, brown paper towels that you use at rest stops or the state fair. Brown chunky looking paper is what you figure I diaper will look like after it is used, but not before.  But please note: I did not take off any stars for appearance because how they work is what matters.  I thought it was a sad looking diaper but was ready to love the dirt color if they worked great.Sadly, these do not work very well at all.  They feel like cheap paper towels and are not very soft on my baby's skin.  The elastic gathers are easy to tear on my very active 11 month old, to the point were I would only put these on him if he were wearing long pants, shorts and onsies get snagged at the leg openings.  When they get a little wet they get bunched and lumpy, the wetness is not distributed very well.  They are very thin which I assume is why their absorbency leaves a lot to be desired.  The price is very high for how many you get, I know that organic products cost more, but it needs to be worth the money to validate their price.Why two stars and not one?  I thought they were true to size, the velcro straps held up well, no rash developed (despite urine not getting well aborbed) and I appreciate a product that is trying to preserve a better world for these baies we are raising.  But to win my dollars a product has to perform as well as the competition.  When you factor in all the extra water and electricity from the extra laundry I have to do when my son leaks on bedding or his clothes, I don't think the eco factor goes very far.  I have to change him very often which uses more resources and wipes.I see from other reviews that this product has gone through a redesign and does not work as well as before.  Why a company would turn in a bad product to save a few dollars is beyond me:Dear Companies,If you render your product useless to save money, that $1 you save per grosswon't matter if no one buys your product anymore.Sincerely, EverybodyWhen this box is done I will not be reordering.
I've used these diapers before. I'm not sure if it's because my little one is more active or if the make of them has changed, but this box was not as successful for us. The back/bottom area seemed to wear more quickly- the material (paper? plastic?) would get rough and appear as though it was ready to shred very quickly; they were pretty saggy and the material inside bunched up making it seem as though they were wet when they weren't yet; and we did have a few leaks. I expect a leak or two on occasion, but the last time I used Seventh Generation we didn't experience the problem as much. While I like being eco-friendly, I feel like the extra washing needed due to the leaks defeats the purpose a bit...
We've been using "earth friendly" disposable diapers for my little guy, so I was excited to have the opportunity to get a free package of diapers via the Vine program. I completely expected to like them and to use them, especially as I had used 7th Generation newborn diapers that I was given via my baby shower (their old formulation) and was happy with them.Wow. I don't like the new version. They felt stiff and cardboardy coming right out of the package. It reminded me of toilet paper in Soviet Russia, which was hard and scratchy. The fit looks good - my son was right in the middle of the weight range for these, and they went on easily. For reference, for his age, he's at 50% weight and 63% length, so he's about average.However, the fit wasn't good. Until these diapers, the only "accident" we had was when he was in a diaper size that was too small. We only used about half the package, and he had 2 leaks and one poop blowout.I'll be sticking with Earth's Best and won't be purchasing these diapers. I do like that they are chlorine free, but they were just not comfortable or reliable as a diaper.
These diapers are great if you're eco-conscious, being made from eco-friendly material.  I think that's the main draw for them.  We primarily are Luv's diaper purchasers, but AmVine makes it easy to try out new things like diapers, so we took the chance.After the first two blowouts in the first two diapers, we really thought about throwing the remaining 28 away.  The issues that these diapers have are quite a long list.  However, the main one is leakage.  No matter how loose or snug you tape these on your child, they only have so much absorbancy.  If your child is a frequent potty user, the diaper saturates quickly and then will not hold any more liquid (or solids after the diaper is wet).Yes, this is typical of diapers in general.  However, we change diapers pretty quickly--Luv's are generally able to last the night, or a couple of potties during the day before a change is needed.  We eventually tried twice to have them on during the night and ended up washing the sheets both times.These are good diapers if you catch your child pottying the first time.  If you change them then, more than likely you won't have leak problems.  Don't risk trying for more, or else you'll have leaked through shorts as well as diapers.The ironic news is that even after saving the planet with eco-friendly diapers, you're doing more laundry because of all the leaks, so it's probably a "wash" (pun intended) on how much eco- you're really saving.
My daughter was born this past September, so I've been living a crash course in the diapers, wipes and ointments needed to protect her from wetness and prevent her from getting rashes and generally just feeling miserable. We've used Huggies (Regular and the Pure & Natural), Pampers and Luvs and had settled into the Luvs, which don't cause her any issues and are generally the best buy for our family. Free diapers are always nice, so when these came across Amazon Vine, I snatched them up.The Seventh Generation Free and Clear diapers (stage 2 in this case) did an adequate job preventing leaks and keeping my daughter closer to dry than not, but to be absolutely honest, whatever they're using to absorb the moisture here just didn't do as good a job as our usual brand. When I would go to change her, I'd unfasten the diaper and noticed just how wet it would look. In fact, there was almost a sheeting effect as moisture seemed to flow freely over the inside surface of the diaper. That's not good and it was making her noticeably less comfortable. While she didn't really break out in a rash, there was definitely some minor irritation (redness) as a result. We change her diapers fairly often and always apply Aquaphor as a protectant, but even so, she was obviously more wet wearing these than she had been with any diaper that we had used previously.Another thing I didn't like about them was that there was an obvious odor, not overpowering, but definitely not something I'd classify as  a good smell. I know all diapers have some smell, and many strive to be perfume free, but I prefer the scented Luvs to these. I know that's not really what most parents who buy these will be going for, but for something called "Free and Clear," the scent was anything but.Overall, I just don't see these diapers as anything special. From some other reviews, it sounds like I'm actually the lucky one, at least my daughter didn't break out badly or have any blowouts. As-is, they get a pass (we used the whole package), but just barely. These may well be a more "green" solution to the disposable diaper, but the assumption with something called "Free and Clear" is that it will be less prone to breaking your baby out in rashes. That doesn't seem to be the case here, and honestly, there are better diapers available at a fraction of the cost. Regardless of whether you're looking for a diaper that's easier on the environment, or just looking for some that will be more gentle on the sensitive skin of your baby, the Seventh Generation Free and Clear diapers are not your best choice.
I don't have years of experience with many types of natural diapers--I only have one child and he is 6 months old. So my review is based on my admittedly limited experience with natural diapers.These diapers stink. I'm not using that as a general adjective, but very specifically. They smell bad. They reek. Not when fresh out of the packaging, but once our son urinates into them, they begin to smell awful, worse even than his admittedly foul #2.I don't need to know all of the details about why this is the case to warn you away from these diapers. There are better alternatives as other reviewers have pointed out. These just smell so bad that I can't believe that Seventh Generation brought them to market.I'll give them two stars because they don't seem to leak, so they do their job at it's most basic level. However, the massive negative of their odor makes them a no-go for me.
This is my 2nd time reviewing this brand, again there is a funky odor. I am all about natural products. Most of my items in my house are natural products. I don't feel like it held much as we had a ton of blow outs. Nap time, morning time... we were changing sheets & clothes. I know that some people may dislike my review and tell me I got the wrong size, no I didn't. I am thankful they were free but that was about the only good thing about this diaper.
Really wish I could have given this a higher rating but I really couldn't. Decided to get these because they are supposedly better for the environment but they stink and they leak. I gave them to my girlfriend who is trying to potty train her daughter and I now regret giving her such a shoddy product. For the price they are charging for these I thought they would have been better but we were sorely disappointed. The sizing is also a bit off. It states that it's good for up to 34lbs but they seem to run a bit small. I'm not joking when I say they leak either. She has complained that she puts them on her daughter at night and it would soak through her bedding. She formerly used Huggies Pull-Ups and they didn't do that. Not sure what the big hype is about these but they get a 2 star rating from me.
We tried these pull ups with our toddler and were unimpressed.  We've used both Huggies and Pampers pull-ups in the past with our older children and the Seventh Generation ones just didn't compare.  They're rough and scratchy feeling and we experienced leaks with these pull ups.  I wouldn't waste my time with these.  I'd rather use cloth training pants than deal with these.
The other reviews were accurate- doesn't hold much fluid at all.  These have really wide stretchy sides which irritate my daughter's skin occasionally.  Problems with leaks when they're used.  I'm disappointed in these as I love their regular diapers.
I REALLY wanted these to work. There aren't many options when looking for a &#34;free and clear&#34; training pants. I am now on my 6th package of these and they just aren't working out. As some reviews mentioned these aren't for beginner potty trainers and I guess the reason behind that is they just don't hold a lot of pee. I do have a toddler that goes a lot, which means if I don't change his diaper every hour then it will leak. Well that gets pretty expensive when these run about $.40 each. Not to mention if we are out running errands having to undress him completely to get a new one on is just a hassle. So unfortunately we will not be ordering any more of these and are going to give The Honest Company training pants a try.
These are currently .10 a piece more than huggies training pants, .14 more than the pampers traning pantsThe first thing I noticed was that these were thin, and I was honestly happy to see that, but a little hesitant, and my concern was on the dot.It's great that this product is free of chemicals and what not but I do not feel like this is a quality made product as we had many problems with leaking.I have purchased a lot of different items that were made from this brand and I have to say that I've just never been very happy with it, ranging anywhere from toilet paper, to disinfectant wipes, to diapers and I'm glad this was free to try, but I won't be purchasing this ever.
These diapers leaked and leaked and leaked.  I bought one of each overnight diaper offered on amazon and they are all disappointing.  I miss Pampers swaddlers and wish they came in larger sizes!
I bought these for my sons to use as night diapers. I found them to be nice, thick, and seemed to do the job of keeping leaks in.My complaint is with the tabs. Much to my frustration they break off easily! It's so irritating, especially when you have a squirmy child who doesn't want to be on the changing table anyway. To have a tab break and have to start over again is adding insult to injury. On top of that, you can't do much with a diaper with no tabs, so that's money wasted. Considering how pricey these diapers are, to loose one because of poor manufacturing is a disappointment.I've since switched toPampers Extra Protection Nighttime Diapers Super Pack Size 3 96 Count; I have yet to break a tab and we've been through two boxes! In one box Huggies, I've broken 4 tabs.
Leak in the daytime, leak in the night time, leak all the time. Definately doesnt hold in BM! Only good feature about these are the easy open sides and the Cars design.
My cousin shared a few of hers with me since our girls are the same age and about the same height/weight.  My little one is barely 30lbs (if that)and wears both 2T and 3T bottoms(.  The 2T/3T Pull-Ups seem very small and shows the bottom of her butt cheeks on both sides.  When I pull them down to to limit her 'exposure', the slim cut still 'shows her off' slightly on each side, and the top is just a smidgen from sporting her butt crack. If I purchase these, I will definitely go up a size and hope for the best.Given the above, they of course, did not hold her.  She wet her clothing twice, after only an hour or two each time of wear so we went back to Huggies size 6 diapers.  She can't ask for the pot verbally, but I take her when I go and try to anticipate her body language for needing to go.  I can't handle constant headaches right now so we went back to the regular, size 6 Huggies diapers.  She can still fit the 5 but I want extra room for air circulation so I moved her up to 6 a week or so ago.  They are actually a little big on her but they don't leak so I'm happy (until she grows out of them).  We will try training pants again when we are further along with potty training since it's not good to switch back and forth.  Most of us were trained in cloth or disposable diapers before training pants and velcro-like diaper closures existed so I'm sure she'll be fine.I'm giving 2 stars because my toddler loves being able to pull them up herself (almost, she still needs my help but she tries) and the designs (she picks them instead when I ask her to 'bring me a diaper').
I've seen a few other reviews saying that the quality has gone downhill and I have to agree. Before they were 'new and improved' with three characters instead of just Cinderella, they were thicker and rarely leaked, so I didn't mind paying more for them than other products.  Now, she wakes up damp at least once a week.  They are no more absorbent that the Pampers Easy-ups we use on her during the day, and I can say this with confidence since we ran out of these and used the Easy-Ups on her during the night for 10 days...no leaks.  My daughter is 29lbs and wearing 3T/4T, so it's not a size issue.
Not as good as he Medela brand.  This one is thicker and stickier.  It caused a couple of clogged pores because its so thick. And it gets everywhere. I finally decided it was better to pump without anything than use this -- that's how bad it was.  Then I found tried the Medela brand. I wouldn't go back if you paid me!
These diapers are scented, they have some sort of powder in them that causes a really bad rash on my little ones bum.Really disappointed in these cuz I really like pampers normally except for the newborn diapers and these, they both suck.
They work, but the smell is just too strong for me. You have to really like the smell of baby powder to use these.
I was able to try these in size 4 via the Vine program. I also had sampled the latest version 7th Generation Diapers through Vine; we consistently use Earth's Best, which is another "environmental friendly" disposable diaper. I didn't love these new formulation (we had a bunch of blow-outs), as the quality felt very different than before. These overnight diapers were more like the older regular diaper used to be.Night time diapers can be handy if you have a young child who hasn't learned urinary control and sleeps through the night. Our child (12 mo) sometimes is in the same diaper for more than 12 hours at night, and that can lead to leakage. For kids with sensitive skin, they can have reactions with some of the other major diaper brands. We had no problems on with leakage with this diaper, and no diaper rash. I thought the size 4 seemed generously sized; my son was at the lower end of the weight range, and they looked big. Still, we didn't have any accidents.My main complaint is that the velcro didn't have enough sticking power - it was easily pulled off by my son, and sometimes would loosen as he toddled around before bed. That's not good for a diaper that needs to be relatively tight to help prevent leaks. However, I will definitely consider these for personal purchase, especially as he gets older.-----ETA 8/2012: After several months of use, the diapers leaked about 30% of the time, from age 14-17 months and 22-28#. I lowered the rating to reflect this and am on a search for something else that is enviro friendly and works.
Our daughter Alyna is two years old and potty trained, but still has some trouble maintaining control overnight, so we still have her sleeping in diapers (for sake of comfort and clean sheets).  Typically, we were using just typical Pampers and they were good enough, only occasionally getting "too full."  These, however, seemed like a better idea if it meant more comfort for Alyna.Unfortunately, they don't work any better than standard diapers.  In fact, they seem to be even less absorbent and store even less liquid than the regular diapers do, which poses a problem if you intend on their being used for 8+ hours at a time.  On multiple occasions with these diapers, they became so full, Alyna woke up and pulled them off out of discomfort, thus soiling the bed.  This basically failed the two purposes it served: They were uncomfortable and didn't save the laundry time.After a few instances, we realized it wasn't a fluke.  We even stopped giving her liquids within 1-2 hours of bedtime, but that still wasn't good enough.  I also can't attest it to her peeing too much, either, since other diapers (regular ones, not overnights) worked better.The only benefits the Seventh Generation Overnights have are that they're cute (ours have a print of the Lorax on them, a movie she serious loves) and seem to be comfortable before they become too full.  Still, these clearly are not good enough to warrant owning these diapers.
I really wanted to like this product. The eco-friendly concept appealed, no stupid designs on the diaper itself... and it looked just as slim yet absorbable as my Costco Kirkland diapers and Huggies products.Essentially, they were as absorbent as my regular diapers. The problem came in with the band/tab design. There simply was not an adequate amount of velcro tab to properly secure the diaper around my child, so inevitably, it would fall off my active 3 year old. I experimented with ways to adjust the tab by placing them here.... no, how about *here*... no... maybe there? On the "sticky" velcro partner on the diaper, but I think the other problem was that the velcro partner stripe simply wasn't wide enough or sticky enough for the job.Other than that, when I was able to get the diaper on and have it *stay* on, it did the job admirably well. I'd give it more stars for that, except for the fact that if one can't keep a diaper on, it defeats the purpose of the diaper, no matter how well made the rest of the diaper is. My son had no complaints with the diaper comfortability level once on.... but he'd often come to me with it hanging from one leg (LOL!)... for repairs, even before he'd ... utilized the diaper.My husband suggested we could wrap duct-tape around his waist but again, one shouldn't have to wrap one's child in tape to keep a diaper on. LOL... Perhaps a larger size *might* have helped, but I just think that the lack of fuzziness for the tabs to adhere to, and the lack of "teeth" on the tabs was the end of this diaper. The other downside of the tabs is that they were short (narrow), and had jagged edging that *I* found uncomfortable, let alone my kid when his thigh would be poked with an edge as the diaper slipped.Can't recommend this product until improvements are made. I went back to my Kirkland's... hopefully all will be a moot point soon for potty training. :-)
We've tried just about every diaper on the market (have written Amazon reviews for over two dozen brands & types). One thing we've learned is formulas change *constantly* - a recommendation from 10 years ago, or even 1 year ago, may mean nothing today.We have always liked 7th Generation, but they changed the tabs & this is the cheapest velro in the world.I don't know if this is for all sizes, or just size 4. And this change is fairly recent - maybe March of 2012. If you look at the tabs, you can see they're a slightly different color than the rest of the diaper, obviously a new batch of velcro. It fails after about an hour.We tried the regular stage 4, and the overnights. We have never had a problem with 7th Generation before. But on both diapers, the velcro fails after about an hour. This even happens while our daughter is sleeping, with almost no movement or activity.(UPDATE JUNE 29, 2012)So Seventh Generation was kind enough to contact us and offer us 2 boxes of replacements. After 3 months of waiting, the replacement diapers finally arrived - with the exact same issue. Velcro fails after an hour. I don't know how other people live with this, it's the cheapest velcro I've ever seen on any diaper, even Walmart brand.This would be a 5-star diaper if they would just fix the velcro.
My almost 7 month old son leaks out of everything.  I thought I would try these, and even bought a size up (he wears size 3 and I bought size 4) but even those don't work for us.  Last night he was so soaked that the diaper was leaking some kind of gel.I love their regular diapers for daytime, they are the best chlorine-free diapers I have found, and definitely the most absorbent.  I was hoping their overnight diapers would be just as good, but the other thing that holds my son for 12 hours is cloth.
We normally used cloth diapers and wipes, but when we were traveling and in certain circumstances we used disposable diapers and wipes. We tried these since they were easy to find in any store, but they caused a terrible rash. We also tried One-and-Done and those also gave our baby a rash. I really wanted to like these since they are less expensive than Pampers Sensitive wipes. For store-bought wipes, we'd end up using Pampers Sensitive.We prefer The Honest Company or Seventh Generation wipes.
I received these as part of a shower gift and put them away until I started running low on the Pampers Sensitive Wipes I stocked in the nursery.Pros:1) No unnecessary fragrances or alcohol to irritate and dry baby's skin.2) These wipes are really thick.Cons:1) The wipes are REALLY DRY so I have to use more wipes and wipe more to clean up the same mess, resulting in irritation of baby's skin. This cancels out point #1 above.2) The thickness of the wipes prohibits them from fully cleaning all of baby's tiny folds and crevices without a lot of extra effort on my part. This cancels out point #2 above.The cons make these a no-go as diaper wipes for me but I might use them as towelettes for sticky hands or to clean up other baby-related messes.
These wipes leave cotton residue on my little ones skin, and i hate that! Pampers Sensitive wipes are much better.
For the price, this definitely has a lot of features and is a good value. You can add more cameras to this set up and have a total of 4 cameras. It can play lullabies, take pictures, talk to the baby with PTT, temperature monitoring, timers, nightlight, etc.Here are the pros and cons I found with it.Pros:- The setup is extremely easy. After charging the handset, I was able to turn it on and be connected to the camera right away.- The night vision is actually pretty good quality and I was able to see my baby in pitch black.- The overall quality of the picture is decent. It is clear enough that I can tell what my baby is doing.- The LED sound bar is a very nice feature. If you have the volume turned way down, the sound bar will still come on and show colors depending on the intensity of the noise. If the baby is crying out loud, the color would be red.- You can expand the system and buy additional cameras.- You can mount the camera to the wall and it was easy to angle it so it will show the baby in the crib at the proper angle.- It can also be a camera and you can take pictures of the baby.- You can play lullabies for the baby. My baby doesn't really care for the feature but it's a nice feature to have.- It comes with a SD card so you don't have to buy one for storing pictures.Cons:- The battery life is horrible. Even with the power saver on that would turn off the screen after 1 minute, we were lucky to get 4 hours. Imagine the first night when we didn't have the handset on charge and waking up to realize that it was dead. If our baby had made any small noises, we wouldn't have heard it.- While the PTT is a nice feature, the quality of the voice coming through the camera is not great. It almost doesn't sound human and the first time I tried it, my baby seriously seemed scared of the voice.- The temperature monitor, while a good idea, seems to be always off. We would have the A/C set to 69 and the temperature would still show as 86 even after the A/C running all night.- There's not really an easy way to take pictures of your baby. You have to go to the menu to turn the camera feature on and then proceed to snapping the picture. This can mean missed moments.- The digital zoom, while a nice feature, takes about 5 seconds before it will zoom in and it can only zoom in so far and zoom back out. Also, in the 5 seconds that it takes to switch views, the sound is off so you can't hear what is going on in the room. This isn't as big of a deal but I like to be able to hear everything while she's sleeping.- Reading the manual, if you do decide to expand the system, you can only talk to baby on camera 1 and none of the other cameras. It would be nice if it gave you an option to choose which camera you would like your voice to come out at.Overall, there are a lot of nifty features in the device and for the price, it is a great deal. However, do realize that some of the great features are fair in quality.EDIT: A little bit after 1 month, the screen on the monitor started to fade and disappear. You could not see the baby anymore. It's pretty much overexposed and we tried to turn it on and off but still, even the logo is white washed out. I had to change the star rating because it is defective. We tried to contact customer service and they are making us pay to return their defective unit to them, wait 2-4 weeks for it to be researched and then we will get the unit back and return postage will only be paid for if they find it to be defective. Unfortunately, we have determined it's not even worth the trouble especially when that means we would be without a baby monitor for almost a month. We will be looking elsewhere.
Compared to other brands (Pampers and Walmart/Target generics), this just doesn't meet expectations. I love Huggies brand diapers but their wipes suck. The material isn't soft enough and the packs dry out much quicker than other brands.
These tear easily and aren't very big. I'm sticking with generic wipes that are larger and sturdier instead. Not a fan
These are rough, and I wouldnt buy them for a newborn. Your baby better have callus' on thier bums to use these. Great for wet sanding wood....
I had high hopes that this cream would work on my toddler eczema. His whole back and arms are covered with red spots, they get dry and itch. i use Aveeno which actually calms the redness and brings relief, and wanted to try something new. I have to say that BabyGanics cream doesn't work as good as Aveeno baby eczema: the red spots are the same color and sometimes (I'm not sure what causes this) my son would repeat ouch, ouch and his body language would indicate that cream bothers him.Aveeno makes red spots light pink and I never heard complaints.The smell is very herbal, nothing offensive but I'm not fond of it. I just wish it would really help with eczema.
My daughter has all types of trouble with eczema and has VERY sensitive skin.  We have tried pretty much every type of cream (over the counter and prescription) and nothing really makes it go away completely. So, I was excited to try something new, but given our history, didn't have very high expectations.I found that this cream isn't much different than others on the market.  It goes on smooth and creates a nice protective barrier on the skin.  One thing I HATED about it was the smell-It smells like an institution-it's harsh and VERY STRONG (kinda reminds me of someone wearing BEN GAY-when they walk by you can TOTALLY smell it on them-that's what this is like).  It did take away a lot of the redness and itching, but even after faithfully using it multiple times a day for 10+ days the break out spots were still visible.Overall, it's not much different than other organic/sensitive products out there, so I won't be switching to this brand.
My two year old has chronic eczema, and I'm always looking for a new product.  Generally, I use aquaphor, as I've never found anything that worked better, regardless of the package claims.Same here.  This is a decent enough lotion, but there's nothing special about it.  It's thin, and disappears into the skin after some rubbing, and that's that.  But with eczema, really, you want the product to sit on top of the skin for awhile, essentially soaking the skin with moisture.  You want the product to feel almost oily.  This does not.Now, if you like Aveeno's line of eczema products, you may like this.  But I'll be sticking with my aquaphor
My daughter has been using Kirkland brand baby wipes for the past 4 years and said that the pampers wipes were just as good. The only differences are: the texture of the pampers is a little softer, there is a faint, but nice scent, and they leave skin softer after using them. She says she will probably continue to use the Kirkland ones since she is used to using them, but these were a nice change.** Update - After using these wipes for a few weeks now, my daughter said that they are not as good as the Kirkland ones. They slip around too much when you are trying to clean up a mess. Even my son-in-law stated that they were difficult to use and did not compare to the Kirkland ones.
These wipes are certainly new, but only count as 'improved' if you like coarse, hard wipes. They hold a lot of moisture, more than the old ones, but they feel more like brown paper bags than anything i'd want to clean my baby's butt with.The only good thing i can say about them is that they're still eco-friendly. Alas, that doesn't make up for the awful texture. I will be switching to a different brand.
Unlike many of the reviewers, I like the thick texture of the new Seventh Generation wet wipes.  I do not like thin wet wipes that feel flimsy.  I have a 2 week old infant, as well as a 2 year old toddler using these wipes, and they work well for both of them.  They are strong, clean well without getting me dirty, and are a nice size and thickness.  *Neither one has had any reactions to the fabric of the wet wipes, or the cleansing ingredients. (*Please see edited note at bottom of review -- this has changed!)However, when I look at the list of ingredients, I can see why some people are complaining about the change.  No, it doesn't list alcohol as an ingredient, as some wet wipes do.  According to the company, it doesn't include fragrances, dyes, parabens or phthalates (whatever those are) -- but it does include chemical-sounding ingredients.**EDITED:  I feel terrible, because several days after I posted this review, I noticed that both my kids DID have sore, red bottoms that required ointment after each diaper change.  I switched wet wipe brands, to test if it was the Seventh Generation wipes or not.  Their skin cleared up.  After several days of clear bottoms, I switched back to the Seventh Generation wet wipes to see if the redness came back. It did come back for both kids!  So we've decided that these wipes work okay for us in the diaper bag for occasional use, but we will not use them in the house where most of their diaper changes occur.  We also will not buy any more Seventh Generation wipes once this box is gone.Changed my four stars to two stars.  Sorry, Seventh Generation!
I have used Seventh Generation products before, some were great (Seventh Generation Liquid Laundry 4x, Baby, 2 Count), and others hit or miss (Seventh Generation Free and Clear Baby Diaper Value Pack, Stage 4, 135 Count).  I have used Seventh Generation wipes before, and liked them, so I was anxious to try these, to see exactly what was "improved" about them.Here's what is "improved." NOTHING!  These wipes are horrible.  They are much thicker than before, it reminds me of soaked cardstock.  I even tried to scrunching them up in my hand in order to soften them up, but it didn't help.  I understand the appeal of a thick, sturdy wipe, but this is ridiculous.  These wipes are also much wetter/soapier than the old kind.  I feel like I need to squeeze some of the liquid out of them before using them on my babies.  After using them my babies' skin seems to be wet and sticky, which seems to be conducive to irritation.  Additionally, after using these wipes for three days, my two year old son has developed a very bad rash on his bottom, with diaper rash being something he hasn't had in over a year.In conclusion, I won't go so far as to say I hate these wipes, I have been using them to wipe my 2 year old twins' hands before and after they eat, but I will not use them on their faces or bottoms; and I don't use them on my 3 month old at all.  Even if the wipes had not caused a rash on my son, I believe they are too thick and rough to use on their bottoms.  I liked the old style of Seventh Generation wipes, but I will not be buying more of these.  Because my babies have been sensitive to scented baby wipes in the past, I have been usingHuggies Natural Care Fragrance Free Baby Wipes Refill, 648 Count (Packaging may vary)for over a year with no problems.  These will continue to be my wipes of choice.
---Update, a few months later: The speaker on the monitor no longer works. Other reviewers can restart sound by restarting the monitor. Not me. Even removing the battery and resetting the settings didn't help. Sound seems to be dead. The camera is still picking it up (you can see from the sound level monitor lights), but you can't hear a peep, which other reviewers have also noted. Obviously, no sound makes the monitor pretty worthless unless you're in the next room. I tested it & the sound on the camera does still work (but I don't use that feature anyway, since my disembodied voice doesn't exactly fill my baby with untold joy). I'm contacting Lorex next week (12/30/13)& I'll update my review accordingly.---For a daytime monitor, or for a very still baby, I'd give it 4 stars. It's packed with lots if extra features (photo capture, intercom, temp sensor, etc), the daytime image is good, and the screen in big! But the night vision, with or without the nightlight, is awful, particularly with any motion. If your baby's in a swing, she'll be nothing more than a big white blur. I'd give it 2 stars for night, one star if you're using it with a swing. The daytime video isn't great with motion, either, but because regular-light video is inherently clearer, it's less of an issue in the day.While the other features are a nice bonus, they're no really important enough to me to sway the rating more one way or another. The price is pretty good, though, so based on that, I'd give it 3 1/2 if I could.Signal is pretty solid (gets a few more dead zones than some others, but with the antenna up, I can find a clear spot in most rooms of our large 16,000 sf reinforced concrete building), but not quite as reliable as the two others I've used.I really love the temp sensor. We're in an old high school building with no central AC, and erratic heat,  and different parts of the building can be more than 10 degrees different. Open a window, and it's even more dramatic--so this is a wonderful feature, which I think would really give you peace of mind with an newborn in any old or poorly insulated building.Interface is fairly intuitive, though I didn't always guess the icons at first try.Battery life is decent, several hours-- certainly not 8 with video, but I trust it for a solid 4.I hope to get some more life out of it when I've weaned her off napping in her swing, because I do like the photo and temp features, but for motion, this monitor's not you best choice, even for the price.
I keep trying Luvs and I keep not liking them. We used them with our three older children in the late 90's and early 00's and loved them. They were our go to diaper. But, since our last three have been born, they must have changed something. They leak and don't seem to fit right. I got this package through the vine program because they were free and I keep thinking that they will improve them. I want so badly to like them because they are cheaper! But, I don't. I was sitting at my son's football game the other night and had just changed the baby's diaper not 20 minutes prior. All of a sudden it felt like someone had turned a faucet on down my leg! Gross! It was pee! The diaper had absorbed a tiny tad and then done a really great job of repelling the rest of the pee right out of the leg hole. This is just one sample of my experience with these diapers. They are really cute and soft - that's about all the nice I can come up with.
I'm not sure how often Pampers is changing the diapers but I have the Pampers Cruisers with the polka dots and I love them vs the Huggies Little Movers. Thankfully I ordered the ebulk case, but now I'm super bummed that I have to look for yet another diaper for my daughter.These aren't thinner, they don't absorb better, and the fit is not right.I just ordered the Cruisers Ultra and am hoping they are more like the Cruisers I have.I am highly curious if these are the same ones that they sell in the stores, I know sometime Amazon gets weird stuff, example: my wipes were different that what I got at Target.
Diapers are fine, but the price has remained the same but instead of 222 diapers there are only like 204 in the box.  Why is amazon no longer carrying the largest size boxes, and hasn't lowered prices either?
We didn't realize these diapers were scented or we wouldn't have ordered them.  Our babies are exposed to enough chemicals and toxins that we aren't in control of; they don't need to literally be sitting in them all day and night as well.That alone would keep us from using Pampers again.Also, the texture of the diapers is odd and has an unpleasant plastic kind of feel (like the cheap grocery bag kind of plastic feeling).  Absorbency is adequate but not great.
I've tried several of the Pampers brand diaper styles since my daughter outgrew the Swaddlers, which we loved for their absorbency, softness, and &#34;pee&#34; indicator. I was disappointed with the Cruisers style and am even more disappointed with these Baby Dry ones. These feel so thin and the outer material is papery and cheap, the quality I'd expect from a store brand diaper, not Pampers. I surprisingly haven't had any leaks with these, which is why it even gets 2 stars, considering the fit is terrible and just like the Cruisers I tried, they are long in the crotch and have to be hiked up pretty high on my daughter's stomach and back or they'll bulge in the back and make gaps for blowouts, making them uncomfortable for her since she tries to pull it down.Pampers has lost a loyal customer because of their low quality diapers with expensive price tags.
I've never cared about brands.  If it soaked up and kept in what it was supposed to, I would use it if the price was right.  I've got nothing against name brands, but with 6 kids, and the oldest being disabled, money is tight and Pampers are expensive.  My sister sent me a box of these for my newest addition.  I was happy to set aside the cloth diapers and the cheapies to give these center stage.  The biggest problem I have with them is that now I don't want to go back to using the cheaper ones.  I honestly think I used less of the Baby Dry version than my cheaper diapers.  Maybe I can justify just one more box... ;)UPDATE: I'm not sure what the difference is in the last box I purchased and this box, but these are not worth an increased price!  The box I got before was great as stated above.  This recent box, however, made me just want to hurry through it.  Nothing stays in.  He leaks all of the time.  I keep reading where the Pampers representatives are commenting that it's increased absorbency, but I'm not seeing it.  It may absorb, but it doesn't lock the moisture in or away from the baby.  Maybe the factory that's making them is making changes w/o the company's knowledge, but these definitely are lesser quality not greater!  I've changed my rating to reflect the changes in the diapers.  Just for the record, my baby gets changed more frequently now than with store brands or cloth diapers due to leakage.
My son (who is about 15.5 lbs) has started using these diapers.  We had issues with leaking with previous Pampers Swaddlers.  For some reason, I find that Huggies just seem to work better for him.  He's currently in Size 2 Huggies, but Size 3 Pampers - even though Pampers are already larger to begin with.  These diapers are thinner than the Huggies and even thinner than the Swaddlers I believe - which is nice for when the baby is moving around and we haven't had any leaks yet - however, they are pretty huge on him as he's still under the minimum suggested weight.I do like that they're a cute pattern and thinner material.  As long as they absorb, I would honestly prefer them to be thinner.  What I don't like is that they do not have the elastic on the back like Huggies brand does and that they have that mesh barrier.  I see the benefit of the mesh insert, but I also believe the mesh is part of the reason we had so many (#2) leaks with the swaddlers.  I examined several of the diapers and sometimes the mesh extends past the area that that elastic is - thus creating an opening for stuff to leak through.  Not sure I am explained that properly - but I'm guessing that might be why we have had so many issues in the past.  For now, I like these diapers - but unfortunately, I will probably not continue to buy them as I keep having to buy a larger size vs. every other brand (including Luvs, which are made by the same company).For me, these are just OK - but every baby is different - and what works for mine, might not work for yours.UPDATE: I knocked another star off.  Once again, Pampers has disappointed me.  Same thing that happened with the swaddlers is now happening with these..... we're having #2 leaks out of the leg holes.  It's ridiculous.  I've just accepted the fact that Pampers do not work for my son.  Pampers' customer service has contacted me regarding my disappointment, but short of coming to my house and doing my laundry and cleaning my furniture, there's really not much they can do to remedy the situation.  I'll just stick to Huggies and other brands.  But hey - they might work great for you - my best friend swears by Pampers!  It's all trial and error!
I've always used Luvs (through three children now) but recently they leak like crazy- this was definitely my last Luvs purchase!
The first time I've used Luvs and on the first diaper of my 3 year old twins, I had blow outs. I haven't any blow outs from Kirkland and Pampers in several years. So it came as a surprise to me when my first time using Luvs, it couldn't absorb like the other 2 brands. It leaked down the legs, and up the back. When the diaper was opened, the puddle of number 1 & 2 was still sitting there.I doubt I would ever purchase Luvs. Maybe others have better luck than I would. If it's simple number 1 and 2 it might hold, but those times with diareah, it's a lost cause. Get ready for massive leakage.
I had never considered using Luvs with my first child until my MIL gifted us with a package.  I was impressed at how well they worked with my son, how economical they were, and of course he loved the Blue's Clues character on the front.  I am not personally concerned about how cute the diaper is I just want them to be absorbent and economical since I am now buying diapers again in 2013.  Sure, I did not mind running around and trying different brands with my first but now I just don't have the time or patience.  I expected Luvs to be at least somewhat like the originals I first used but I just don't feel like I can give a thumbs up to their quality at this point.  The number of leaky diapers seems to have gone up and there did seem to be an increase in irritation to the skin that immediately improved upon switching brands.  I tried to keep an open mind and I don't realistically expect the price to be the same several years later but I would like to be able to expect the same general quality in a product.
We used to use Luv's Leakguards with our first daughter, and they were great diapers. They held a lot, they didn't leak and were inexpensive, especially when you purchased them from Amazon. Sadly, the prices went up and the amount of diapers per box went down, so we eventually switched to a different diaper, but that decision had nothing to do with the diapers, Luvs with Ultra Leakguards were great. Notice that that's in the past tense.We're now the proud parents of twins who just recently made it to size 4, so we're giving the Luvs another go, but something just doesn't seem right. Simply put, the new Luvs are thinner and just don't hold as much as the brand of diapers we were using, or the Luvs of the past. The diapers fill up and get "squishy" in no time (it seriously seems like we've been having to change them an extra 2 or 3 times a day since we started using these) and we've had more leaks than we've had in recent memory (which means even more loads of laundry...yay). On top of all that, less diapers come per box for roughly the same price I used to pay (looking up past orders, size 4 jumbo packs used to contain 204 diapers, then they went to 180, now they're at 160). Luvs used to be a great, inexpensive diaper, two things I just can't say about them now.
Admittedly, I don't use paper diapers often. In fact, we use them very, very rarely due to our children have sensitivities to many of the additives in paper diapers. I tried these out on my 5 month old.The fit is perfect. He is about 17 lbs. and very short and round. The size 3 fit really well.There is some kind of fragrance added to these diapers. They smell even when dry. It was hard to get used to. Not sure why they thought that smell would be better than just nothing, but it really makes the diaper smell worse.The backs of these diapers isn't very snug. It makes poop-splosions very easy and regular. The back comes up higher, but does not keep the forceful ebf poop inside the diaper.These diapers contain dye, as well. They are white (which likely means they were bleached) but this strip turns blue when they pee, which means there must be dye in there.In terms of rash, he was okay in these for a day, then got a rash from them. I was hoping that he'd be fine, but apparently there are too many additives in this diaper for sensitive bums.
Generally, when I purchase an overnight diaper, I want to wake my son up the next day and not find it has soaked through even if he is a super soaker.  However, I find that the Huggies regular diapers do a better job at containing than these Pampers extra protection diapers. I generally have to put my son's pajamas in the wash everyday, and he even woke up in the middle of the night because his diaper was soaked one night. I'm thinking about trying a different brand next time.
I like most Pampers diapers.  This was my first time with the Extra Protection product.  My son has leaked through his pajamas 2 or 3 times this week.  One night, he soaked through his pajamas TWICE in ONE night!  Needless to say, that was quite a night for us.  I don't know if it is the fit or what.  They seem to leak through the leg hole as well as the waist.Maybe you should size down if you buy these.  Long story short, back to Baby Dry for us!
My son will be two years old next month and I can remember what a nightmare it was to get him to sleep in his crib straight through the night.  I am happy to report that this is no longer an issue.  In contrast, my wife and I are on a quest to find a diaper that will keep him, his pajamas and his bed sheets dry throughout the night.  We have used both name brand diapers and brand X diapers, receiving mixed results from both.Then I stumbled across these extra protection diapers by Pampers. The box shows a baby sleeping, so I figured &#8220;alright a diaper that will keep him dry during his slumber&#8221;.  I have use Pamper diapers before and for the most part they are good.  Therefore what could go wrong?The first couple of nights we used these diapers, my son slept about seven to eight hours.  There was no issues, the diaper was full but didn&#8217;t leak.  In addition, his pajamas and bed sheets were dry.  I do believe I should take this opportunity to state that (normally) my son only urinates during the night.  I cannot recall the last time he had a bowel movement overnight.  At the risk of proving too much information or being gross I feel this should be noted, all children are different.I digress, for the next couple of nights we experienced the same thing with these diapers, very full but no leaking.  Then one night my son slept for twelve hours, he had no nap that day and it was also a very busy day, so he was worn out.  When he woke up and I was changing him I noticed that there was this gel like substance all over my son and inside the diaper.  It almost resembled a cross between petrol jelly and the gel contained in packages to keep vitamins fresh.My first thought was there was a medical emergency happening to my son.  After very, very long twenty or thirty seconds I realized that the diaper had exploded.  I so figured that these diapers, or any diaper for that matter aren&#8217;t supposed to last twelve hours, so I considered it a fluke.  I used these diapers for another two weeks, give or take a couple days, and have had six more diapers explode like this.  These diaper &#8220;blow ups&#8221; were happening only after six or seven hours and this gel was everywhere.  In fact, a couple times it was just below my son&#8217;s chest.My son sleeps in a one piece pajama that has a single zipper from foot to neck, so thankfully none of this gel material escaped.  I do not want to think what would have happened if it has escaped his clothing.  My son usually doesn&#8217;t put foreign objects in his mouth, but one never knows.  In addition, every parent dresses their child differently for bedtime, so maybe they might not be as lucky as we were.I am actually upset with myself for using these diapers as long as I did.  I feel after the second or third diaper the use should have been terminated.  Nevertheless, we are no longer using these diapers and I plan on contacting Pampers to let them know about this issue.  When I stop to think about how dangerous this situation could have been, it really freaks me out.
These wipes feel great.  They are super thick and soft.  However, they're not even as good as my basic-level Pampers at actually cleaning the mess!  These would serve better as hand wipes in the car than actual poopy cleaners.Definitely not worth that high price point.
I like that these wipes are chlorine, fragrance, and alcohol free because my daughter has sensitive skin and most wipes with these ingredients irritate her skin. These G Diaper wipes are very soft and didn't irritate her skin at all. I even used them in my wipe warmer and they didn't dry out and stayed moist for diaper changes.While I liked those things, I feel they are way overpriced and I wasn't impressed with a few things. First, for close to $50 (current Amazon price) you get 840 wipes total and I usually buy the BJs brand sensitive wipes in the same amount for $17 and they do a way better job than these. These wipes, maybe because they are made of plant fibers, are flimsy and have pores/holes in them so on a few occasions while changing a poop diaper, some of the poop got on my hand THROUGH the wipe! For this price, that shouldn't happen and I've never had that happen with even the cheapest brand of wipes. Also, you have to use more of these to clean off all the mess than you do with other brands. For me the most irritating thing besides getting poopy hands was that these wipes aren't on a continuous ream like other wipes - when you pull out one wipe, the next wipe doesn't &#34;pop up&#34; through the hole, so you have to go digging in the very little opening to grab another wipe. I used these in my wipe warmer and I have to open the whole top every time to get a new wipe. I'm going to finish the case, but I definitely am going back to the higher quality, yet cheaper BJs wipes. I don't recommend these at all!
Ah baby wipes one of the most paramount items parents can have. However, just like any other product out on the market&#8230;..some are better than others.  My wife and I have used all types of baby wipes, the name brands, the brand X wipes, the high end/specialty sort and of course the green/environmental variety.  And truth be told, mixed results from all.  Which leads me to these baby wipes by gdiapers, which pride themselves by being gentle wipes with not scents, smells, chemicals and completely vegan and have no animal testing or animal by-products.  This is quite the introduction, so how do they work?I have to say that the wipes clean rather nicely, it only takes two or three for a minor mess.  It might take four or five for a large mess.  The reason being for multiple wipes is because the wipes themselves are very, very thin.  I would dare to say very close to paper thin.  Any parent will tell you, some messes &#8220;paper thin&#8221; is not going to cut it.The wipes come in a re-sealable package, which might or might not stay close.  The part that really makes these wipes a deal breaker is the dispensing.  It is next to impossible to take out only one wipe.  When I grab for a wipe I either end up taking out six or seven or half the package becomes a tangled mess.  I am sorry, but grabbing a wipe is a one had job when dealing with a messy baby.  I discovered that this was still an issue if I put the wipes in another container.  I end up with a pile of wipes, which I then have to repackage.  I am sorry but I can&#8217;t be bothered with that. Overall, these wipes clean nicely, albeit they are a bit thin and it is great they are gentle wipes and don&#8217;t test on animals, but ergonomics are a factor.
There's almost nothing to like about these. These types of overpriced products are only for people that appreciate cloth diapers and other 'vegan/organic' items. For real life, these do not work. They are small, feel terrible and not at all 'gentle'. I have to use twice as many for heavy use days and still don't like the end result. Trying to separate them is an annoyance as they stretch, loosing their shape and become flimsy. I can't believe the price on these, when Pampers is a million times better and cheaper. These are flushable which is nice, but completely not worth the hassle or the price.
We got this because our local store doesn't seem to carry the regular diaper cream anymore. I guess i'll have to go further afield to find it, because i did not like this product. I sure hope the company isn't phasing it out.The texture was slimy, and it actually took a few tries to get it to transfer from the wipe to my baby's backside. And it spread thin, like lotion that won't absorb properly. I have no faith that it will prevent diaper rash, though i admit the kid hasn't yet done a middle-of-the-night stealth diaper-fill to test it. And i hope i can get more of the real diaper cream before he does.
