I just gave up and threw out these batteries, after only a couple of months. I had them in rotation (with two other sets of rechargeables-- Duracell and Sanyo) in my digital camera. In the beginning, they were fine and comparable to the other brands. Now they don't even last one day in my camera. Sometimes I get only a handful of pictures in before they die. I don't have that kind of patience... I won't buy Energizer rechargeables again.
While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands, I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience, as it depends what you use them for, but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year, so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand.
Much easier (and much less costly) to just remove the top of the shaver and tap it slightly to empty the whiskers. Rinse under faucet if desired. Shaver does not always charge when sitting on the device. Have to remove it from the stand and hook it up to the charge cord. This is an idea whose time has not arrived. Went back to my Panasonic ES8003 which takes up far less space, is easier to clean and gives a better shave.
I found this bar to be labeled wrong. It should of been SuperSweet Fruit Smoothy. 24g sugar, 42g carb and only 6g protein. The smoothy I make in my blender is quick and healthy using a protein mix with fresh or frozen fruit. Cannot see myself ever purchasing this. Did not like the candy taste and with such little protein, is not a healthy on the go bar. There are many healthier bar choices for a quick energizing snack. Thumbs down.
Strawberry is definately there. There's definately a ton of vitamin flavor in here also. The first taste, well, chalk comes to mind. Then bitter. Then sweet. Then strawberry. A little bit of dairy. Then, well I really needed to clear my mouth with something else.Smoothie flavor.... not a chance. It's stiff, sticky, chewy, and sickeningly sweet.How does it compare to those nasty marzipan bitter vitaminie energy bars? Well this one is just vaguely tolerable compared to those.Sorry, I'm afraid I'd rather go hungry.
I selected this product for my 18 year old daughter to try. She's always on the go running from work to dance to class or to have fun. She burns a ton of calories and was interested in an energy bar with nutritional value.This bar was disappointing. The texture was grainy and the taste wasn't appealing. She ate it with a glass of milk and said that the combination left a feeling that there was a coating in the back of her throat. She did not care for the flavor of the bar and was unable to finish the entire thing -- not because she felt full, but because it just didn't meet expectations as far as taste, texture and satisfaction. Would not buy.
I was disappointed in this bar.  It seemed at first like it would be a good item.  It smelled really good, and I liked the texture.  Kind of reminded me of Airhead candy.Now the fruit taste is pretty good actually.  And it is easy to chew so no complaints there.  But other than that, I have nothing but complaints about the bar.  I mean come on, ultimately what's the most important thing the consumer will care about.  The taste.  And that is a big F on the old report card.The bar is not smooth at all.  It has a very fruity taste which is good.  But soon it is replaced by a gritty, grainy taste that overpowers any tastiness of the bar.  Overall, it comes across as kind of nasty.  I would never spend money on this.  Come on guys.  You can do better..
I only used it a couple of times and then it stopped working. Given this is a really simple device, maybe that's why it's so inexpensive.
I also have the original Swiffer.The one where you can use either a dry cloth or a wet cloth. I love that thing and feel it does a great job.I know that it does require purchasing cloths. I feel its an OK trade off because I only use it to clean during the work week when my time is short. I also only buy the store brand cloths for it.Anyhow, back to my review for the WET JET. This thing is crap. The handle is fragile. It requires batteries ( not included ) and require purchasing a liquid cleaner and wet pads. This thing is a consumables nightmare. It goes through the liquid very quickly.Cleaning wise its a joke it leaves my floor streaky.If you already have a regular swiffer stay with that one this  WET JET is just set up to make you spend.
I took this for three days, but had to stop due to the extreme stomach cramping, gas, bloating, and diarrhea. I think anyone with a sensitive digestive system will have difficulty with Prilosec. Here is what happened to me:Day 1 - no problemsDay 2 - woke up to bloating and extreme urge to move bowels. Later in the day moved bowels more often.Day 3 - diarrhea throughout the day with bloating and crampsDay 4 - did not take medicine, diarrhea during the dayDay 5 - did not take medicine, loose stools throughout the day, bloating, crampsDay 6 - returning to more normal functions, but still some discomfort
After having 7 kids, I think I've used just about every pregnancy test out there and for the most part, they are tests, nothing fancy.  If you get two lines, you get a positive and you KNOW you are pregnant (no matter how faint), and if you get nothing, you may or may not be pregnant.  Right?So when I was offered this digital one for review, I thought it was perfect timing, since I was wondering if I was pregnant with my eighth child... and I have lots of experience with tests... perfect!  The first test worked out okay, was negative but it worked easily enough.  The second test I took a few weeks later was REAL disappointing. I followed the directions to a tee, and then it registered that it was working and then just blanked out.  Yup, welcome to the world of digital technology.  For the overpriced tests... you expect them to WORK!!!  It's ridiculous to have to call in to get a replacement... when you may or may not need another one later!  To make matters worse, it seems they are inaccurate in their POSITIVES.  At least the other tests were a done deal if you came back positive... but these are a question even for that!  I really can't recommend these tests... they are overpriced, don't work accurately, and on top of all that you have errors. What an emotional roller coaster... just toss the things and say forget it!
Please read to bottom for info re psyllium, which I only realized later thanks to another reviewer.(The apricot flavor strikes me as a large, dense, chewy cookie. It doesn't have the exquisite taste of some of the available snack bars, but not bad and feels like fuel for the furnace (the bod, I mean). Plus it is more food for the money than some of them, weighing in at 2.4 ounces. Still a lot for that amount of food but that's the price of convenience. And a healthy snack or road food.The Clif Bar is chewy, as I said, and holds together very well so you don't lose crumbs to waste or trash your vehicle. That's important to me.The one thing I think they could do better is to make Clif Bars specifically gluten-free instead of just saying "may contain traces of dairy, peanuts, wheat and tree nuts". We who must avoid gluten - and those other allergens - need to KNOW that what we put into our bodies is in fact free of what to us is poison. Yeah, sure, Clif Bar is covered legally, but not a smart move in terms of wanting to SELL them to a large percentage of the population. I hope Clif Bar is listening.Addendum: Also tried the Peanut Toffee Buzz, 'way too sweet, didn't like it.)Further addendum: Now tried White Chocolate Macadamia, 'way too sweet nearly disgustingingly sweet, can't be healthy with that much sugar. Also learned there is psyllium in the formulation, don't know how much since it isn't specified and in powdered form it is tiny in volume compared to what it becomes when hydrated. This can create quite a problem because psyllium draws water from your system if you don't take it with enough liquid, and it can become concrete in the digestive system if wrongly handled. It should not be in this kind of food. Also, please note that the ingredients are in print too small to read without magnification and cleverly folded into the packaging seams where they are (intentionally?) likely to be missed. Not good.
Omron disappointed me, this does not work at all.  When you get something new like this you want to test it to see if it worked but this doesn't.I put it on and went about my business cleaning and doing my chores. Wow K walked 2 miles in the short time?  Not likely. So I decided to go for a walk on a trail that has 1/4 mile increments posted.  I am very angry I waited for it to zero out overnight so I had no miles on it.  I held it by the string so no bumping to rack up the miles.  I walked 10 steps to my car and looked down and it said 30 steps.  Really?Oddly it did not add miles while I drove but I stepped out of the car and it added 25 steps.  I walked 10 steps and it added 50 steps.  I am done this doesn't  work and it shows that I walked 2.5 miles and used up only 82 calories.  Not good....
I took the entire pkg of these pearls.  I had high hopes.  I'm 36, have MS, take many prescriptions and have been confined to a wheelchair/scooter for about 4 yrs.  I have problems with being unable to go #2 as my 5 yr old would say.  I usually take a laxative about once a week so I can go and have been trying to find something to help.  This gets great reviews so I was hoping I'd have good results with it, too.  When I started taking it I had no results so I took 2 pearls every day for a week, then tried 3 a day and so on.  Nothing worked.  I guess I'm still on a mission to find something to help me!  I hope this helps you, it's miserable to always be miserable.
I was on this for two weeks, and felt horribly depressed.  I talked with my doctor about it and he immediately had me stop taking it, because it clashed with my anti-depressant medication.  I already knew not to take St. John's Wort with my prescription medication, now I know to add L-Glutamine to my "no no" list.
I tore the muscle in my arm/shoulder, so I took this, hoping it would speed the healing.  Of course, my arm and shoulder was already hurting from the torn muscle, but this made the pain much worse!  I had to stop taking it after a couple days.  It has been a week since I stopped taking the L-Glutamine, and the pain is still worse than before I started taking it.This might help muscle recovery during exercise or workout, but I can't recommend it for healing muscle that is already damaged.
While it's true that the batteries packaging spelled 'Energizer' correctly, I am not convinced that these are not counterfeits. The reason is the battery actually not fitting inside my Harmony remote control - it pops up and out of the socket and the only way to keep it in was to push it hard and then quickly close the remote's battery door. It's probably because the batteries are just a little thicker than they should be.Downgraded from two stars to one star. It only lasted for a couple of weeks in the Harmony. The battery the Harmony came with originally lasted for about 3 months.
I got these because of all the rave reviews about how well it works on hard water. I have a brand new dishwasher and this doesn't work well with how hard the water is in Utah. I end up having to put a cup of vinegar in the washer.
I want to love this product, especially after all I have read about it. But, sadly, it has made no noticeable improvements. I will keep taking it for another month and update if a positive result is noticed.I use many Jarrow Formulas products and love them. It could be that Vinpocetine is not something that works for me--I respect bio-individuality.
I have used 3 different coconut oils, this being one of them, and neither of the other 2 effected me in the way this one does.  I don't know what is different about this oil, but it gives me constant, noxious gas.  I am embarrased to put this in a review, but I have to be honest.  I won't buy this kind again, for obvious reasons.I used a tablespoon in my oatmeal, every morning for a week, and I couldn't figure out what was causing this irritating problem, so I stopped using the oil, and the next day it was gone.  I went and boughtBarlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jarfrom the store, to find out if it was just the Jarrow brand that was causing the issue, or if in fact I have developed an intolerance to coconut oil.  The Barleans doesn't cause this problem.  I have eaten a tablespoon of it in my oatmeal all week, and nothing.  I have also usedDr Bronner's Fresh-pressed Virgin Coconut Oil White Kernel Unrefined 14 Fl Ozin the past with no problems.It makes me wonder just exactly WHAT is added to this oil, that isn't added to the other 2.  Something is clearly different about this oil, and I can't seem to find anything online in regards to what additional additives might or might not be in here.  So, buyer beware.  I don't see mention of this annoyance in any other reviews, so perhaps I am one of the unlucky ones.
Unfortunately, I can't do a great job of reviewing this product.  When I try to give it to him, he just gags and the vitamins come right back out.  They smell awful and I tasted them and they are absolutely horrible.  I tried two different version of infant vitamins and had the same result.  I give up.
I was not aware of the contents of this product when I requested it from the Vine program. I have no doubt that this is a nutritional benefit to those who need help. I personally cannot consume this powder. Forks over Knives is my diet regimen and I avoid Ensure ingredients such as fat, sodium, sugar and especially cholesterol.I give this product one star based solely on my specific inability to consume some of the contents. I not suggesting that it is a bad product just that I can't use it for the reasons stated. However, if you are on a plant based diet which avoids meat, dairy products and eggs then you may want to consider whether this product meets your standards.
I honestly tried this stuff with an open mind. And that's just what I was left with. I didn't notice any difference. No stomach or bowel issues. No mood changes. Nothing! Oh well!
I ordered these from the Vine program because I was under the mistaken assumption that these would normalize blood sugar (meaning it would lower blood sugar in the diabetic/raise it for the hypoglycemic).  I have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) that I have been able to control through healthy diet.  Unfortunately, this lowered my blood sugar to the point that I literally couldn't stand up without getting dizzy and passing out.This would probably be great for the diabetic because it lowers blood sugar, but it will NOT normalize the blood sugar of someone whose blood sugar is normally low.  Luckily, within a week of stopping Holy Basil, the dizziness and other low blood sugar symptoms are gone.
Bought this monitor because it was on sale for $24.95 at Big 5 sporting goods.. It was always a royal pain to use and to get started monitering the heart rate. After 3 months it quit monitering at all, so its now nothing more that a watch.  Dont waste your money.
Love it or hate it.  I hate it.  I read 900 reviews on this HRM before buying it.  After receiving it, I read all the negative reviews again trying to find a clue as to why the darn thing didn't work. I've tried every suggestion posted in the comments of the negative reviews.  Nothing worked. I do not give up easily, however, after two weeks of watching my heart rate go from 135 to 65 in the middle of my routine, after I'm soaking wet, and staying there for the duration of my 1-hour workout, I surrender.Based on comments in the negative reviews, it seems that a number of folks believe that any customer who has a problem with this product is either lying, stupid or both.Rest assured, their day is coming.  What goes around comes around.I've used HRMs for over 20 years and got excited about being able to change my own batteries.My exercise machine is a VitaMaster AirMax II with the shoulder-high, pump action handle bars that work with the pedals to spin an air-resistant front wheel. I have it mounted on a platform with large rubber casters so I can easily move it all over my 90-foot basement.  Location is not the problem.Mounting the receiver on my wrist or handle bars does not help.  Turning off all electrical devices doesn't work.  Working out bare chested is not the answer.  Bathing in conductive gel gets me nowhere.  A new battery was no better then the original.I even mounted a section of a foam pool toy to elevate the receiver directly in front of the transmitter, and at the same time, eliminate vibration from the machine.  SEE UPLOADED IMAGE.  NO JOY.I do know that some mechanical items can emit radio signals.  Years ago, I knew a family who had new floor length curtains installed over their massive windows.  They opened and closed the curtains with a long cord channeled over pulleys.  Every time they opened or closed their curtains, the TV changed channels.My VitaMaster might be emitting interference.  That's too bad.  It's a good machine.  Then again, the 179 customers who posted negative reviews on the Omron HR 100C might be correct after all.  Imagine that.Let's make that 180.
I thought MAXELL button batteries were a great value. The price and shipping on this product seem to change but seem to always work out to be around 20 cents per battery. However there is a reason why they are such a good price! They don't last.I bought these batteries for my old scientific calculator which requires 2 button batteries. The calculator was running on the original set of batteries for about 15 years.I installed two batteries on 7/6/12. Originally, I was pleased with the batteries. However, this review is written 3 month later and I am no longer happy. I use the calculator once a month for 10 minutes or less balancing my check book when I do monthly bills. On 9/30/12 weekend I found that the calculator was dead. I always turn off the calculator, but even if I have forgotten it turns off automatically after 1 minute of non-use. The batteries lasted 3 months, total of 3 uses, under 30 minutes of total active use. Since the previous set of batteries lasted for years, I can only give these batteries 1 star.Ali Julia review
I have an Oral B toothbrush and I ordered the Floss Action 3 pack to replace my old brush head.  These feel significantly harder than my old brush heads. I had been using the new Floss Action head only a few weeks when I went to my dentist. He told me that my toothbrush was too hard and I was going to damage my teeth.TheThe Oral Health Biblealso states that you should always use a soft brush. It says a medium or hard brush can cause immediate damage to the soft tissues surrounding the teeth as well as severe damage to the teeth over time. It says the only thing to use a medium or hard brush on are to clean car parts.So I just threw away a $20 three-pack of brush heads because they the bristles are really hard.
I'm very disappointed in these. They are very expensive and the advertisements tout what a wonderful shave you will get but the blades only last for about 2 shaves and then they are worthless. I've tried several brands and types of razors and I will NOT buy these again. I'm very disgusted and feel ripped off as I could have bought original Gillette blades with my money and gotten so much use out of them!!!
I tried this but it was not working out for me, and had lot of issues. I was getting cuts and burns. The Fusion Proglide Power was ideal for me once I changed. No burns/cuts with Proglide power. (Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge 8 Count
I would worry more about why this product made absolutely no change in knee pain, except that I just read an NPR article on the uselessness of glucosamine condroitin.[...]
When I got my sample of this product I was upset, cause I only got one.I chose the creamy peanut butter with chocolate blanket on it because that is how I roll. I dig the combo.I unwrap it, smells nice...looks velvety and compact. Could it be full of delicious..well let me see. I bite into it, and Its good! chewing , chewing...and wait...what the F is that? I swallow, take another bite. Yes...its good...and ew..ew..ew...there is this underlying taste of...buttered popcorn. I am not lying here. Its the closest I can get to what it tastes like, but not a nice buttered popcorn, a cheap movie theatre fake synthetic nasty ass popcorn.Think Thin? well yes, because you will have this in your hand and want to spit every bite out, hence not eating a damn thing.When I got my sample of this product I was upset, cause I only got one...now I know it was Baby Jesus giving me a blessing in disguise because he only wants me to eat yummy miracles, not this demon bar.
To note, I got the Creamy Peanut Butter barI like protein and energy bars and (when I can afford them) get them as a breakfast item (my favorite is the Snickers Marathon Bar).  I find a protein/energy bar is a great breakfast and gets you ready for the day, also they are usually delicious.  I got this to see how it tasted.  I was already displeased with the nutrition label (although shocked to see all it had was Alcohol Sugar), since the calories, fat, Saturated Fat, and carbs were pretty high for this little bar, I expect energy/protein bars to be high in a few things, but the vitamins and Protein usually make up for that (protein was pretty good but only has a little Iron [4%] and a little calcium [10%], which is far off the other bars).  However, I tried the bar and took a bite out of it, you could taste chocolate, and some bitter inside taste.  I do not know what the inside tasted like (I did not recognize the flavor), but I did not like it!  It was bitter and I could not taste even a hint of Peanuts (honestly, I would never guess their was suppose to be peanuts in this).In the end, for the fat, sat fat, carbs and calories this is high (on par with others energy/protein bars), but falls short in vitamins, and does good in no sugar.  However, the taste of it is not worth giving up 240 calories.  You only taste a small hint of chocolate and a nasty nougat that has a bitter taste with no peanut flavors (at least the other bars actually have peanuts in them and taste like their flavor.  This does not have any hint of peanuts.  I would not recommend this!  Their are other bars out their that offer more vitamins and better flavor.
I was so excited to see a gluten-free bar. I am always looking for quick snacks to keep at home or to take with me on the go. I love peanut butter and so I selected that one.I liked the fact that it had no refined sugar in it because sugar tends to make me tired. It has 0 grams of actual sugar but has some other type of sweetener in it. I was impressed that it had 20 grams of protein. And I liked that it was all natural. Also, there are quite a variety of flavors. Unfortunately, that's where the positive ends and why it only gets one star.I knew it didn't have refined sugar in it, but it had no sweetness to it at all. It tasted like cardboard. It has heavy and dry in your mouth and had a weird texture to it. As one other reviewer stated, I couldn't finish the whole thing at once. The texture was grainy and just coated my tongue. I had to drink a large glass of water. It's hard to describe the texture but it's dense, grainy, dry -- definitely not creamy! It does have an aftertaste as well. It tastes extremely artificial. I share small pieces of healthy foods with my birds and before I even tasted mine, one of my parrots threw it across the room. The other just dropped it on the floor -- and they love protein bars. So that's 3 1-star votes from this family!Even worse, it gave me an IBS attack after eating it! I'm guessing it was the sugar substitute that was in it, but I'm not really sure. I would never purchase them again! I have no desire to even try a different flavor.It aggravates me too because there are some amazing gluten-free products on the market now and this is one of the products that people think of when they think of gluten-free foods, especially healthy ones, and it's just not true of how the majority really taste. Nature Valley makes an amazingly delicious protein bar that is gluten-free and does not taste like it at all. I had to check the box to make sure. It's called Nature Valley Protein Chewy Granola Bars Peanut/Almond/Dark Chocolate, and as of now, the box says "New" on it. I can't find a link here on Amazon. And I also like the Protein Shake Mix,Pure Protein Natural Whey Protein,  Vanilla Cream Shake, 14 Ounce. I buy vanilla and just add ice and either peanut butter; peanut butter and bananas; bananas; strawberries, etc. The key to shakes is thorough blending in a blender and the addition of other flavors (as I mentioned). So if you are looking for healthy gluten-free products with protein, please don't think they all taste like this.Overall, I am extremely disappointed with this product. Gluten-free and even healthy products have come such a long way and this one gives these products a bad name and brings back the old reputation of how they used to taste. Trust me, there are plenty of tastier options out there!
Yes you will loss weight because you wont be able to finish it, a very strangely texture peanut butter bar that taste like saw dust in your mouth and leaves a nasty after taste,so no I did not like it not at all.
While gluten free, 0g of sugar, and everything else allegedly good for you (except for the truckfull of salt) I have to say this is probably one of the most tasteless bars I've ever eaten: it really didn't taste like peanut butter but kind of a glob that took up space.  It also has a strange texture to it that felt like wet cardboard.  It's really that bad.These might be good for an emergency survival kit, but I would have to say it would be the bar of last resort for me.
I tried one of the Think Thin creamy peanut butter gluten free bars. To put it nicely, it wasn't very good. I actually had to spit it out after chewing a few seconds because it was so horrible. This bar is not appetizing at all and tastes nothing like a granola bar. I can't even describe the taste. I would not recommend these at all. To get protein and taste I recommend the Fiber One brand granola bars with protein. They are delicious and taste like a candy bar for 140 calories. 1/5 stars.
It sure looked good. But when I tried a bite I couldn't believe how unpleasant it was. Its taste reminded me of ground-up cardboard and sawdust. The peanut butter didn't have a good nutty taste, but instead was kind of flat. I took a second bite to confirm, but couldn't finish. Really unpleasant.This company'sThink Thin Crunch White Chocolate Mixed Nutsis much, much better.
These bars were anything but "creamy". It was like eating particle board, or sawdust. There was a hint of peanut butter, but I'm guessing since oil and fat are not "thinking thin", they were removed from the ingredients, rendering this bar with a very poor flavor.It did not satiate me in the least, and definitely could not be used as a meal replacement.This bar is not something I would recommend to anyone for any reason. You are better off eating toast with real natural peanut butter. Even for diet foods, there are far better options (like almost anything else that is food, and some things that aren't).No, thank you.
I can easily sum this product up in one word: yuck. If you're new to eating gluten-free, this isn't what it's supposed to taste like. I can't speak about the other think Thin flavors, but one tasted like rancid peanut butter cookies. It's just a chemical concoction enhanced with a peanut-butter-like flavor. Not good, and it won't help you lose weight, nor will it keep you healthy.I can literally make an energy bar (from scratch and a few simple ingredients) that will fill me up longer and taste better than this. And if you hate cooking and like pre-made stuff, skip this and find another brand (better yet, a bakery) that excels at gluten-free cooking. Don't fall for the schtick.This is my own little rant, but it's a bit insulting to equate gluten-free diets with a "weight loss solution". Newsflash: eating gluten-free isn't a low-carb "Atkins Diet" lifestyle like some quacks and celebrity gurus are trying to push. It won't make you healthier, unless you have a serious autoimmune issue (celiac disease), non celiac gluten sensitivity, or a gut issue (like myself). And then, it's not a choice, then, it's a requirement.The truth: individuals end up gaining weight on a gluten-free diet. First, your weight increases because your gut finally heals and can reabsorb nutrients. Second, the gluten-free alternatives are often HIGHER in calories than their gluten alternatives. If a person does lose weight (like I did) on a gluten-free diets, it was because they eliminate sugars, eat lower caloric foods and limit their portion control (like any person trying to lose weight would do.
Immediately my teeth sunk into the bar I could taste the dry powder coating, chocolate and peanut butter. I love chocolate and peanut butter especially together (we've all had the little cups...). But dry tasting chocolate and peanut butter? Seriously, if I were exercising I would need twice as much water after eating one of these.I think I'll stick to my homemade oatmeal and peanut butter with chocolate chip drops. (I still have that taste while I write this review - blech!)
So several members of my family had a taste of this bar with me and we pretty much all had the same reaction.  At first it wasn't too bad: chocolatey, peanut buttery, with a cocoa powdery coating, slightly crunchy outside with a gooey peanut butter middle. Not bad for about three chews.  And then it happened. The flavor --the real flavor-- came through... RICE!?! It tasted like mushy rice mixed with chocolate and peanut butter goo. It was bad, so bad that I very nearly spit it out. I gave my piece to another brave soul to try who then happily abandoned it to let sister try. Overall, we all said "Yuck! Ick!"
This is a meal replacement bar, not a snack bar. At 240 calories and 20 grams of protein, this is best used as a breakfast or lunch meal replacement and not a midday snack. That is, assuming you would want to actually EAT this thing. I ate about a third of the bar before throwing the rest of it out (and I only at that much because I got this product through Vine and needed to review it for the program). This particular flavor was allegedly "chunky peanut butter." Usually, when a product claims to be chunky peanut butter, I expect to actually find pieces of peanut in it. There were no peanut pieces/chunks at all. The "peanut" filling had all the flavor of a stale Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that is about a month passed the expiration date. The supposedly chocolate coating left an artificial taste in my mouth.
I am reviewing this bar not so much as how it compares to other gluten-free bars (which I know little about), but rather as one of the many protein bars available.  I know that those who must eat gluten-free for health reasons might "tolerate" a food in order to have variety and lots of food choices in their diet. So I am looking at this bar as a choice for those who want to simply have a "protein bar."I have to say that this one of the worst-tasting bars I've had to date. You can taste peanut butter after you take a bite, but then chewing quickly turns it all into a big globule of foamy peanut butter that I did not want to swallow.  (I did swallow the 1st bite, so that I could review it fairly and completely, but couldn't swallow the 2nd bite.)  I tasted a few puffed rice grains, but never tasted any peanut bits that you would expect in a "chunky" bar.The only redeeming quality of this product is that it has a really nice package & logo.
I received one thinkThin Protein Gluten Free, 2.1 Ounce Bars thru the Vine program. Thank goodness they only sent one! -At first this disappointed me...but I ended up thankful as I would have either thrown the rest of them away or tried to give them to people I consider friends!I was excited to see the Gluten Free option on these because my daughter is newly diagnosed as allergic to gluten.  So we are always on the lookout for something new for her to try.  The brownie crunch was NOT like any brownie we've tasted! Dry, gritty, YUCK!!Perhaps if you are used to eating protein bars, you MIGHT think this tasted good...but that is hard for me to imagine!  If you really want to try it, get 15-30 friends together who also want to try it so that you can all try one to 1/2 of a bar and cut the cost for those who end up spitting it right back out!No go for this family!-smileycat :-)
This bar to me was nasty tasting... its heavy like a protein bar but the brownie flavor is just disgusting and I don't know what the crunch was but it didn't add anything to the bar... Stay away from these. there are much better tasting ones out there. Now about 45mins after eating it I do not feel well. there is still the horrible after taste in my mouth, my belly hurts and I am kicking myself for not grabbing the banana I wanted!! Thank goodness Vine only sent 1 bar, I hate throwing food away, and wouldn't of given these to my worst enemy!!
I've never had a problem with Amazon, but I've ordered this product TWICE, and BOTH times the bars were almost white because the chocolate was so old, dry, and totally disgusting. When I buy these from Trader Joe's, they're great, but from Amazon - stay away! They've refunded me both times, but apparently still haven't fixed the problem, as more and more people are saying the same thing. What's going on Amazon?
At first, they initially don't taste TOO bad, but they're not what I'd want to eat often.  Wait a few seconds, and you begin tasting something that almost tastes like a chemical of some sort.  Finish the bar, and the long lasting after-taste is not at all pleasant.Note that they don't put the full ingredients in the product description, and market it as if it's a super healthy snack.  Here's what's in it:Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolate, Calcium Casienate, Soy Protein Isolate, Casein)GlycerinMalitolCoating (Malitol, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Sodium Caseinate, Milk Fat, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors, Salt)Alkalized CocoaAlmondsWaterSoy Crisps (Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Salt)Canola OilSoy LecithinChocolateSea SaltNatural Flavors.Contains: Milk, Soy, AlmondsManufactured in a plant that also processes eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts.They tell you about their 0% sugar and gluten free status, but they don't tell the FULL story.  How about 170 mg of sodium?  That exceeds almost all of the common brands of tortilla chips I've seen.  I consider Tostitos to be among the higher (not the highest) tortilla chips, and will not buy them for that reason alone.  And they have 115 mg of sodium, meaning that these bars have almost 50% MORE sodium in them, per serving.  By comparison, a 28 gram serving of Xochitil tortilla chips with sea salt contains 38 mg of sodium.  Upping that serving to match the 60 grams of this snack bar still only works out to about 82 mg of sodium for 60 grams of chips vs. the 170 mg for this bar (less than  the sodium).  It's your choice, I'm just pointing it out.So my 1-star rating (relatively rare for me to rate that low) is a combination of a poor initial taste that gets worse with time, then a very unpleasant after-taste, and the fact that they try to make it look like a really healthy snack bar when in fact it doesn't meet most "health food" aficionados' definition, given all the processed ingredients and high sodium content.  If they were all that healthy, I suspect they'd also be trumpeting non-GMO soy beans, canola oil (the majority of canola oil is genetically modified), and almonds - which they don't.  So one would have to assume you're eating GMO ingredients with these.  Fine, if you want to, but many don't.Amazon Vine members only got one bar to rate - that was all it took.  I would never waste my money on a full box.  And I have no inclination to try any of their other flavors, since they're highly likely to have most of the same ingredients, or at least manufactured with the same level of health benefits (or lack thereof) as this product.  Nothing is "healthy" about 170 mg of sodium in a little bar like this, in my opinion, not to mention the other lack-luster "healthy" ingredients.
All I can say is this tasted like phony cardboard-no taste that was to ones liking, didn't taste anywhere close to a chocolate brownie. Didn't even taste chocolate. Only 1 bite and I had to throw it out. DO NOT BUY!!
I have tried a variety of protein/meal replacement bars in the past. Some have been good and most have been bad. But I am always willing to try something new. When I saw the words brownie crunch I had to try this bar. Well this bar doesn't live up to either word. It tastes nothing like a brownie, barely tastes like chocolate and there is no crunch. This bar tastes awful. It was dry and chalky and very tasteless. I can totally see how someone could lose weight eating these bars because after one bite you lose your appetite for food and all you want is to drink water so you can rinse the bad taste from your mouth.
This product sounded as if it would be tasty.  I was dead wrong.  The "brownie" part of the bar is terribly dry, lacking the appropriate moisture that characterizes Class A brownies.  The chocolate coating is OK, but is so overshadowed by the brownie, it can hardly be tasted.  Though the bar is sugar-free, it contains 230 calories -- no bargain for those trying to stay trim or lose weight.The texture really turned me off -- dry, overly chewy, and ultimately bland.  If you're looking for a product with flavor, skip this one.
The texture and dryness is similar to a brownie that's been sitting out on the counter for a couple months. Nasty and dry, it reminds me of a free Atkins bar I received when I signed up for a kit on the Atkins web site. I'm not sure about this, it's 230 calories so it is almost a meal replacement, not a snack bar. And it contains 12 grams sugar alcohols which would have sent me to the bathroom for tummy issues if I'd finished the bar. I couldn't finish it and I think that was a blessing in disguise.
This item is very cheaply made.  The foil is only held in by four pin head-size "dots" while snapping into the head.  Also, the combs attach in a very similar snap-on and hold with dot concept.  They are difficult to get on/off.  I have only used this maybe ten times, and now the foil starts falling out all the time.  The dots fail to hold it any more.Without the combs, it is too "dangerous" for trimming sensitive areas.  With the combs, it is too clunky/bulky, and you have to go over the area about ten times.  I found an old electric Wahl-type trimmer (with combs) works a lot better and faster.  Finally, the charger base is a stupid waste of space and plastic and often the contacts don't work unless you really pay attention or jiggle it.  A conventional plug would have been a lot better.I also have the Philips Norelco grooming kit and really like that one, but this cost me almost triple, and it is falling apart after much less usage.
Like many of the other reviewers of the BG2020 I am shocked at how many positive reviews this little trimmer has received.I've been using a standard corded Wahl trimmer off and on for a number of years to keep certain areas of body hair in check without hassle. When I saw this Philips-Norelco body hair trimmer as the deal of the day here at Amazon I jumped at the opportunity. For one thing thinking that this trimmer was specifically designed for more coarse body hair I figured it would make grooming easier. Secondly the unit is cordless which is always easier.So a few days after my trimmer arrived I stepped into the shower planning on making a quick trim before heading out with some friends. The first thing I notice is that this trimmer feels cheap. Everything from the trimmer to the attachment heads is made from cheap plastic. The trimmer doesn't feel like it has the weight to cut through hair and once I started trimming my suspicions were spot-on accurate. The BG2020 is more of a hair-puller than trimmer.I ended up having to repeatedly pass the BG2020 over certain areas which inevitably leads to irritation. I thought maybe it works better with shower turned on and wet. Wrong again.So I ended up chucking this thing in a bathroom drawer and I honestly don't plan on ever using it again. What a waste of $30. If you have anything more than peach fuzz I would recommend staying away!
After pushing myself to finish this bar (not an easy chore), I can only report: no, just no.Taste = No discernible taste whatsoever. The one I had was enrobed in white chocolate (or so it reads). But if I were blind-folded I would say it was coated in wax, not chocolate.Texture = Thick, mush with a touch of grit.Aftertaste = very slightly bitter.Results = Like having a waxy, gritty brick in one's stomach.Here is the positive spin: while these thinkThin bars are not good, they do make an excellent product ...thinkThin Crunch White Chocolate Mixed Nuts. In fact, any of the "crunchy" products are in this line are super tasty. (And, one can actually tell what one is eating since it is not a pureed mash, but whole foods!) I highly, emphatically recommend those!
I received one bar of his awful tasting mess. The white chocolate part was mostly melted onto the wrapper leaving a brown bar of unrivaled tastelessness. I took one bite and gagged. However, I felt that I really should give this a fair trial so I took another bite. As I tried to swallow this piece of rotgut I started to sense a feeling of nausea so I had to remove it from my mouth. If I had a sty filled with hogs I would not let them near this putrid mess. Now I know why I received only one of these instead of the ("Pack of 15") as described.
1. Free of most allergens.  Everything is free of "MOST" allergens, even most allergens.  In fact, an allergen only has one allergen in it.  No fish oil has gluten.  None have dairy in them.  But they, including this product, have soy which is an allergen.  Statement is worthless hype.  Oh, by the way, one suggested way to take it is to add it to yogurt.  Whoops, dairy!2. 3x the absorption.  This is based on a study of emulsified fish oil, not this product specifically. All emulsified fish oil have the same characteristics.  The 3x number is based on a specific time of absorption.  In other words, they get absorbed at different rates.  At one point in the absorption is 3x the other, but not overall absorption.  And the study did not prove it made any difference in the desired result such as reduction of triglycerides.3. It says it has the recommended doses of DHA and EPA.  There is no recommended dose by any recognized agency (read disclaimer at bottom of promotional nonsense).  Dose is different depending on your objective.  The hype ad does not state anywhere what the DHA and EPA are.  Their website is similar taking you to hype ad after hype ad rather than just stating the facts you need. Even their FAQ doesn't say. Why?You cannot judge this product without knowing the DHA and EPA content in milligrams.  They are concealing it and implying studies were done based on their specific product which is not the case.  The entire product is based on misleading hype.
This is by far the most disgusting Chocoate Gluten Free bar I have ever eaten.  I would rather have gluten than eating this.  It taste like horse feed.  Some things should not be made.
At first it tastes like a brownie but then you get this aftertaste of what you know is a chemical.  That could be the sugar alcohol I don't know.  I was happy it's gluten free but I'm trying to get back to whole foods and I cannot eat something that resembles varnish.
Oh my, these were the most horrible things I have ever tasted in my entire life! Blech! I was so glad that I only got one because they tasted terrible, and it would have been a shame to have to throw out too much food.
It's hard to write a review on a food product, since taste is a very subjective matter ... what one person finds delicious, others may spit out in disgust.  Unfortunately, I am in the latter camp on this product.  I was not able to take more than one bite of this product.  I found the taste to be very ... there's no delicate way to say this ... very unfoodlike.  Sure, it had a hint of flavor of chocolate, but the overall taste was what I would imagine compacted sawdust to taste like.
We tried the dark chocolate, gluten free and sugar free. I am a diabetic, and have a son who is gluten-intolerant. My husband likes dark chocolate, as do I. We had high hopes as there are many good products out there that suit our needs. This doesn't happen to be one of them.It has a chalky texture, not at all creamy and unsatisfying. We could not really taste the dark chocolate, which might have salvaged one star for this product. We each tried a small piece from the one bar supplied by the Vine program for this review. It was more than enough. I couldn't even finish my piece. In all honesty we cannot recommend this product. There are better nutritional bars out there.
I've been gluten free for the last 7 months, so it was an adjustment to change my diet, especially when it came to convenience foods. I had high hopes for this bar since it is high in protein and gluten free, but to be honest, it just doesn't taste good. It has almost a metal/chemically aftertaste to it. The texture leaves a lot to be desired. It tastes like a really bad protein bar. My four-year-old even tried a bite and said "Oh mom, that chocolate bar is yucky." That pretty much sums it up, lol. I don't really like leaving negative reviews, but this wasn't very good. The best part was the dark chocolate coating, the inside left something to be desired.
Dark chocolate eaten in moderation and eaten as close to pure as possible is a healthy choice for you body.  Thus I am always annoyed when a product claiming to be healthy seems to do everything possible to destroy one of the planet's lovely treats.  That is exactly what this Think Thin bar does -- it takes chocolate and makes it into something tasteless.The scent of this is an odd sweetness and the taste is almost nothing with a very tiny sweetness, definitely nothing chocolate or cocoa at all.  The texture is grainy and even though I can see tiny darker pieces of something in there there is no crunch and no burst of any flavor.  Looking at the ingredients I see cocoa powder twice (why?) and instead of cocoa butter added oils that are completely unnecessary.Sure this bar has a lot of protein but also a lot of sugar alcohols so watch out if you eat these because they might affect your bowels if you eat too much.  While you might think this would help you lose weight I just don't see how because you do not need to sacrifice flavor or chocolate natural goodness to do so.  If you buy these your sacrifice will far out balance your benefits.
I have been trying this TwinLab metabolic accelerator for almost two weeks now and I haven't really noticed any change.  It's supposed to boost my metabolism and give me extra energy.  But so far I haven't felt any difference.  The pills are quite bitter and you better have a giant glass of water to take these because they will get stuck in your throat.  Maybe they work and I haven't noticed yet.  I wouldn't buy these or recommend them.I get more zip from a plain black cup of coffee.
I had an adverse reaction to using this nasal spray which I have never had using Afrin or other sprays. I used once, and my nasal passages dried up. I then got a nose bleed. Unfortunately with this reaction, I will not attempt to use again.
I opened the box from Amazon, and I quickly did a double-take.  This tiny plastic container was really the so-called "Physicians Care Office First Aid Kit For 25 People."  Really, twenty-five people?  Before long I was back on the website looking over a number of similarly bemused, occasionally hilarious reviews from people who, like me, find this little plastic kit to be a little, well, lacking in every regard.In short, this is an overpriced kit that you might find somewhat useful to have in your car or truck, especially if you have little kids who are prone to getting small, easily cleaned boo-boos.  Beyond that, this product offers virtually nothing.  You get a 50-count of little alcohol pads and small bandages, a couple packets of cream, and some gauze pads.  Then, inexplicably, to deal with this mountain of surgical supplies, you get a tiny little tweezer, scissors, and... wait for it... ten pairs of rubber gloves!  I cannot even imagine what sorts of injuries and problems (for 25 people) might have been considered for a kit such as this one.  Be warned.  There are much better first aid kits on the market, and by that I mean actual first aid kits.
For what this is advertised to me, this is a giant disappointment.  Instead of providing the unsuspecting buyer with a first aid kit appropriate for the task it deceives you into believing it can handle, this product is really nothing more than a cheap plastic box of band-aids.  I was expecting something so much more here, especially since they advertise this as something that can handle the load of 25 wounded individuals.  No, that isn't going to happen.  Honestly, for the nicks and scrapes that happen in my house (with wobbly toddlers and accident prone children) this will suffice for the time being.  Mostly, what I need is band-aids.  But, at the end of the day, this is a cheap waste of money.  Who in their right mind would spend $37 for this, let alone the original asking price of $52?  Buyer beware; you are basically paying ten times the price you would normally for a box of band-aids; and that's about all you're getting here.  Sadly, if you purchased all of these pieces individually, you'd spend less money.
By description this product sounds amazing.  A first aid kit for an office or place of employment that would be able to accomodate 25 people and their medical issues.  This kit would not serve an office of 5 let alone a home with a family.  To begin with the tweezers are cheap plastic and don't even work.  The adhesive bandages are merely 50 standard size regular bandaids taken from any generic box.  The cold pack is so tiny it wouldn't even fit on a child's knee cap.  Everything is not just low in quality but small in size.  The elastic bandage would only fit a body part of a small person.  It is so cheap and misadvertising that when it says it includes 10 medical grade latex gloves it is really 5 pairs to make 10 individual gloves.  There are 10 standard gauze pads so how this kit could help 25 people makes no sense.Even the supposed First Aid booklet is merely a 4 page printout.  I almost couldn't find it.  It would honestly be cheaper to purchase all the items in this kit separately.  It in no way has the products necessary to service 25 people yet alone any injury at all serious.  This kit is truly a joke and a gimmick that is very unfair to any legitimate office looking for a quality first aid kit.  Buyers beware.
I've owned a few first aid kits in my day for camping and hiking and I was very excited to get one of these to review. It seemed perfect for having around a house with two growing boys.  And to be honest, it will be helpful, but I was kind of shocked when I opened the kit.  For an item that is retailing above $30 and with an MSRP of over $50, I was pretty disappointed.  It does have an assortment of bandages, gauze and first aid creams, but it is simply tossed into the container with no organization.Pros: The kit does contain first aid items and I'm sure we will burn through much of it.Individually packaged latex gloves will be nice for wood staining.chemical ice pack is nice, but a single use item.Cons: All told there may be $10 of supplies here.no organizationfirst aid instructions are a on a printed double sided 8.5 x 11only one style of band aid - a larger size.and the biggest con -plastic tweezers, to add to the challenge of tiny splinters.All in all, I'm pretty disappointed.  This seems like a great $9.99 bonus buy bin item at a drug store, but definitely not a $30 cover-all-situations first aid kit.
The box says this is a "25 Person" first aid kit but I think that's stretching it. It contains "131 pieces" and 50 of those are alcohol pads, and 50 more are 3/4" x 3" bandages. They include a first aid handbook as a piece. And the registration card counts as a piece! There are 10 latex gloves. A roll of tape, small scissors, plastic tweezers. 10 gauze pads. 1 elastic bandage. 1 "instant cold pack", 2 antibiotic packets, and 2 burn cream packets. For a "131 piece" kit this is lacking many basics like aspirin, neosporin, and a wider variety of bandage sizes. For a first aid kit you can do much better elsewhere. Not recommended.
To market this as a first-aid kit for 25 people is a bit audacious and potentially irresponsible. There is not enough in here to treat 25 people, unless they have nothing worse than a paper cut or a minor scrape.Contents:1 instant cold pack (disposable and non-reusable)50 alcohol prep pads50 adhesive bandages 3/4" x 3" (10 sheets of 5)2 antibiotic packets2 burn cream packets10 latex gloves1 pair of metal scissors1 plastic tweezer10 gauze pads1 elastic bandage1 roll of tapeThis product is marketed by a company in CT called Acme United Corporation (all kit components made in China). Is this the same Acme corporation that sells items to Wile E. Coyote? You know the one.. stuff that backfires with disastrously comical results?The manufacturer even dares to count the "handbook" and registration card as 2 separate items. The handbook is simply a single sheet of printed 8 1/2" x 14" paper folded over twice. The registration card tells you to go to their website to register. The box itself is plastic and of adequate thickness, but the latch is very flimsy. The tape is very poor quality and thin. It's not the fabric kind you might expect. It's thin cheap plastic and rips very easily. All the sports tape I see sold on Amazon is 1 1/2" wide. This one is 1/2" wide. It does not have enough surface area or cling to maintain adhesion to a wound area. It has about the same sticking power as a piece of Post-It notes. The cream packets are less than the size of a pack of restaurant ketchup.The box is not compartmentalized or divided for proper organization of the items, so all the bandages and things just slosh around -- wasting time rummaging through the contents, even if it's just a few extra seconds, is not good when someone is hurt. This kit is probably suitable to give to your child to play hospital with (minus the scissors), but not adequate for real world first aid use. Stay away from this item unless you love wasting money on substandard goods. Order something like this instead:First Aid Kit With Hard Case- 326 pcs- First Aid Complete Care Kit - Exceeds OSHA & ANSI Guidelines - Ideal for the Workplace - Disaster Preparedness (Color Red)or put together your own with common OTC items.I would be more forgiving with the score if the product were just marketed as an ordinary personal first-aid kit, then it would probably be 3 stars instead of 1. But as is, the marketing claims and price versus reality warrant a 1 star review.UPDATE: To say that this product "Meets or exceeds Federal OSHA Regulation 1910.151b" is also disingenuous. All 1910.151b compliance requires is that: "In the absence of an infirmary, clinic, or hospital in near proximity to the workplace which is used for the treatment of all injured employees, a person or persons shall be adequately trained to render first aid. Adequate first aid supplies shall be readily available." It makes no specifications as to quantity of supplies, quality, or what items are necessary. How can you "exceed" a Yes/No test? You can only meet or fail to meet 1910.1510b. You cannot exceed it since it has no degrees of compliance.
I would have given this 2 stars, but the high price knocked it down to 1.  If I had spent almost $40.00 on this kit, I would have returned it.  I think you could actually put together the contents of this kit yourself for less than $20.00.Here is what you get:50 alcohol pads1 instant cold pack2 Antibiotic packets2 Burn Cream packets50 off-brand, low quality bandaids10 off-brand, thin gauze pads1 elastic bandage1 very small First Aid tape roll5 sets of medical gloves1 flimsy pair of scissors1 blue, plastic, flimsy, worthless set of (what is supposed to be) tweezers.If this set was $10.00, I would say it was a good price.  But years ago I bought a far superior, far better set for $40.00 that was worth the money.  You can still buy sets like that, that come in a nice, sturdy case full of more items that are much more useful, and they have METAL tweezers and a first aid treatment book.Keep on searching if you are looking for a quality kit.  This brand "Physicians Care" should be ashamed of themselves for selling this at such a high price.
I don't think I have ever given only 1 star for a review of anything.There is always a first time.  This really falls SO short of what theywant you to think.  I don't know where to start...so lets start withthe "First Aid Book" its actually 1 sheet of paper, non-standard sizejust a little larger than a standard 8.5 x 11" sheet of paper.  Thereare 3 printed sides with short treatment directions for 20 problems,1  being knocked out teeth...to animal bites and all things in between.It might help someone IF they could keep their wits while trying toread this little tiny print, but you better read this and be readyahead of time and your emergency.  The 4th side is directing you tofigure out if you really need medical help or not before calling. Ithink just good old fashioned common sense would go further than this"book".  I do not know where they come up with a 25 person kit, thishas 10 single gloves repacked in little zip bags in pairs, and a fewsingle use medicine packets and 50 alcohol pads w/50 band-aids and asmall handful of other things as the other two reviewers have listed.It just doesn't get any better...I might as well stop now as this willnot become nicer as I go along.  You could either shop more in Amazonfor a better, larger, more complete kit...or make your own...I thinkthe average person set up into housekeeping could come up with all theyneed from what they have in their house now, and make a better and morecomplete kit than this one is.  Wish this review could of been better.
My Wife is a Troop Leader for a large (16 girls) Girl Scout troop, so I was excited to have her field-test this kit. Luckily, field-trip injuries have been few and far between, but after cracking it open a few weeks ago, she could not stop talking about the useless, sparse contents of this kit. The case is just a big, empty box, making categorization of items impossible: They're all jumbled together every time you open it. Tiny packs of cream, band-aids, alcohol wipes, one measly (Non reusable!!!!) cold pack, thin, easily ripped tape, some gauze, and the most laughable pair of tweezers I've ever seen. The box doesn't even latch properly. There are better equipped First Aid kits to be had on Amazon for much less money. this is junk....pure, useless garbage.
This is cheap and ill equipped. It comes with cheap plastic bandaids, dull scissosr, and some gauze pads. The cheap plastic tweezers are a wobbly joke and could probably cause more damage to the wound. The only really useful things were the alcohol wipes, and the 2 packets of ointment. I have to give credit to the very first reviewer on this.... it's only useful if you have 25 people with papercuts. For the cost, you could buy double the supplies from you local superstore or drugstore. I would shop around and check out reviews on other kits before considering this one.
If you aren't looking for a trauma kit and just want something simple for your office to handle the minor stuff, this is one kit you could consider.  BUT, I wouldn't.  Why anyone would put LATEX gloves in a first aid kit for public use is beyond me.  Least ways, under the contents list is says there are "10 Medical grade latex gloves" and claims that "This product contains natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions."  Oddly enough, the ace bandage and adhesive bandages are latex free.Obviously this kit was not compiled by those in the medical field, nor with anyone with even minor experience.  The first aid "handbook" consists of a four page spread of very basic information.  I did like the addition of the cold pack and one pair of scissors.  To be honest with you, this is a scary kit and I'd never hang it in an office and take the chance of sending a workmate into anaphylaxis.  I can't in good conscience recommend this kit at all.
Oh, where to begin?This is truly a figment of someone's overactive imagination.  A first aid kit for 25?  Based on what?  There is almost nothing in this kit, aside from a few sheets of bandaids (all one size, I might add!).  To break it down:-50 bandaids-little box of gauze pads-TINY roll of tape that might secure one gauze pad-box of alcohol wipes-ice pack (one use)-6 pairs of rubber gloves-scissors-big plastic tweezers that look like a toy-2 TINY packs of burn cream (one use) and triple antibioticAnd that's it.  No reason to buy this product, unless you want everyone back in the office to laugh at you.
The manufacturer of this product makes some pretty lofty claims:For 25 people - Just because you have more than 25 adhesive bandages, doesn't make it for 25 people. There is not even enough antibiotic cream for more than 4 people or two uses.Meets Federal OSHA Regulation - HAHAHAHAHAHA, the standard for this is far below the Seal of Approval from Good Housekeeping! In an emergency, my underwear can provide the minimum Fed OSHA guidelines.Weatherproof seal for indoor or outdoor use- the plastic is so cheap and warped, that it doesn't even make contact with the seal at some points.  But I agree that it is weatherproof, if you consider sunshine the weather. And why would I find a weatherproof seal so advantageous for indoors???Wall-mountable - I agree that you can mount it on the wall....on April Fool's Day because when you open it, all the contents will fall out adding to tons of laughs at the office.And....the scissors that come with the kit are not even sharp enough to cut through the bandage!!!Do yourself a favor and just go to the local drugstore, buy a couple of boxes of band-aids, gauze, ointment, etc, put it into your kid's old lunchbox, and voila, you will have the same kit, for 1/3 the price.
I was not expecting a hospital quality first aid kit, but my jaw dropped when I opened this. The components were packed without damage, but that's the highest compliment I can give.  I've uploaded some photos of my kit.The apparent quality of all the items is very poor.  Everything in the kit except the burn cream and antibiotic ointment is made in China.  That's not necessarily bad.  I've bought lots of stuff from Chinese manufacturers, but this kind of put me off because it's well known that there are quality control issues with many Chinese manufacturers.  Don't get me wrong - I do want everyone who wants to work to have a job, but I am frankly afraid to use what's in this kit.  Are those band-aids really sterile?  Do they have lead or some other contaminant in them?  I'm not saying they do, but I am saying I don't know, so I'm not using this kit, and neither should you.The elastic bandage, tweezers and scissors are junk.  Now, the burn cream and antibiotic ointment are made by a company named Water-Jel Technologies, located in New Jersey.  That was no comfort to me, though because the product labels include only the active ingredients.  The base ingredients are not listed.  I will not use first aid ointments unless I have a complete ingredient list.Finally, this kit lacks an antihistamine product.  Insects can get in the office, and do, and I have seen people stung in my workplace.  Therefore, this item is of poor quality and incomplete.  My recommendation is to obtain a different first aid kit.
I knew something was wrong when I picked up the box. It is flimsy with a plasticky feel that screams "Dollar Store" instead of "First Aid" - suitable to pack along for a soccer game or a day in the park, but lacking the heft you'd expect paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto to bring to a real Emergency.Once you get past the marketing pitch (contains over 131 pieces) you find 50 alcohol prep pads and 50 bandages; 10 each of latex gloves and gauze pads; two packets each of antibiotics and burn cream; and one each of the following: tape, tweezers, scissors, and cold pack.Surprise. The kit is made in China.The list price is [choke, choke] more than $50 with a sales price of $36.31. I received my kit for free to review as part of Amazon's Vine program. Had I purchased this kit, I would send it back immediately because of its poor quality and cut-rate contents. There is no price at which I would recommend a family buy and use this kit.In summary, save money elsewhere but buy a first-class First Aid Kit. It pays for itself after just one use.Rating: One star.
This is no bargain; you can find higher quality individual components for less than you will pay for this pre-packaged kit.Granted, my expectations may have been too high based on the first aid kits of my memory. My dad kept a fold up fabric kit in the back of his jeep that was put to use more than a few times when we were camping and fishing. Another, larger kit lived in the hallway linen closet of my parent's home. There's no telling what was originally included in that green box with a big red cross and heavy duty metal latches because my mom restocked it so many times over the years. Ointments, disinfectants, anti-bacterial cream, elastic bandages and band-aids flew out of it in the summer months.This kit is nothing like either of those. Sure it has bandages, ointments, etc., but everything seems less substantial. There are no tubes, the ointments and disinfectants are in little rip off the corner disposable packs. Gauze pads, instead of a gauze bandage roll, require tape, but the tape in the kit is a joke with next to no holding power.The plastic case containing the pieces is worthless. After opening mine for the first time it never really closed again. Sometimes it only takes seconds, other times a full minute, but both of the front latches always pop open. I had to pull out a produce sized rubber band from the junk drawer to secure the case.Look elsewhere for a higher quality kit or build your own for less in a plastic food storage container with a tight fitting lid.
The short version of this review is... and its really short...  is you should only buy this if you feel the price is really cheap.If you are looking for quality, and willing to pay for quality, look elsewhere.I'm a preparedness guy, Eagle scout, bla bla bla.  I have several first aid kits: house, cars, camping gear...  so I know my way around them.So, on the outside of the box it says "Designed in USA, Manufactured in China".  Apple made this a popular phrase with its iPhone, which is made in China of course.  But with this first aid kit its completely unwarranted.  I didn't see any quality to be proud of, or any design skills being showcased.The case may or may not be designed in China, but the design is atrocious.1) It has a rubber bead (grommet) around the edge.  One supposes that this is to keep it airtight or watertight.  Maybe its to keep it dust free.  I'm not really sure.  I put the empty case in the sink, in an inch of water, with some newspaper inside to simulate the first aid stuff.  Anyway the point is that water flowed right in and made the paper wet.  So I guess the rubber bead is just for looks.2) It is held shut by two friction clips, like a cheap childs toy, which threaten to pop loose at any time spilling the contents everywhere.3) There are two matching holes on the top and bottom lip of the case.  I guess this is so you can provide something to keep it from popping open accidentally.  Like a garbage bag tie.  Hopefully you would not get the dim idea of putting a small lock on it.  I really hate this, as it would slow you down in the event of an emergency.  Upgrade the clasps to something better.  Anyway the holes don't line up.4) There are two screw holes to mount the case to the wall.  If you did, and you opened the case, the entire contents could fall to the floor as there is no interior lip to hold them back.5) The sticker on the front has a lot of bubbles underneath it.  The first aid symbol is in a stylized silver tone which is very low contrast on the white paper.  The first aid symbol should be RED, this is the universally acknowledged sign.  Call me a purist if you like, but I don't think that we need to improve the international symbol for first aid.  But I guess this is the thing that was designed in America - the silver cross.So, my first impression on opening the package was REALLY REALLY BAD.  And I hadn't even gotten to the supplies inside!!The quality of the supplies is obviously more important.1) I really doubt the gloves, which are in regular ziplock bags, are sterile.  Sure, anything you pull out will not be sterile in a matter of seconds, but come on... really?2) None of the boxes are shrink-wrapped.  Since the case is not airtight, watertight, or even dust proof (big gaps when closed) it makes you think twice.  The 10 sterile gauze pads are in a wax paper like wrapper.  If there were a true emergency like a hurricane, an earthquake, or whatnot, I think the interior products would be severely compromised.3) Everything is just in a jumble. If you've ever been in a real emergency, you know organization is important.  But everything is unceremoniously dropped in there, with no interior organizer.  Other kits that I have bought at "wholesale clubs" are light years ahead for the same price.4) The selection is really weird.  There are two tiny burn cream packets.  And two tiny antibiotic packets.  All 4 are single use.  I really don't think it would help much with 25 people, as the case advertises.  I would never buy this to aid 25 people ... even office workers.5) The attached first aid leaflet DOES NOT have the toll free number for poison control (1-800-222-1222) and 911 is not mentioned.  Even better, the manufacturer should have had these printed on the inside door of the case.  These are nationwide numbers.I skimmed the rest of the pamphlet and no other omissions caught my eye, but, I didn't look really hard. I'd already lost confidence in the product and didn't want to put any more time in on it.I would stay away from this first aid kit.
If you count one band-aid apiece perhaps. This kit is good for a bunch of boo-boo knees and one sort of serious injury, since there's a tiny amount of gauze and tape. Oddly, there are five pairs of latex gloves? Crappy pair of scissors, two small foil packets each of antibiotic cream and ointment. How in the world do they think this is enough for 25 people? When 0ver 2/3 of the first aid kit is band aids and alcohol swabs, it's hard to justify this as being good for covering 25 injuries.The price is a joke too, not worth the reduced price, let alone the list price.
Where to begin. The Physicians Care Office First Aid Kit For 25 People is not much more use than a box of band-aids, for 20-times the money. What you have here is a few dollars (at the most) worth of of first aid supplies packaged in a very cheap plastic case.The Case......The case is an injection molded plastic box with molded plastic handle and latches. The latches are so poorly made that only one of them will engage and it just barely does. This is not a flaw in manufacturing, it's the way the box is designed. The handle is molded at the bottom of the box with two screw holes to mount on a wall. If you were to mount this on a wall, normal household vibration would eventually knock open the one closed latch and spill the contents.The Contents......The contents of the box consist of four tiny sachets of creams, a tiny roll of tape, five pair of rubber gloves repackaged in ziplock bags, a stack of band-aids, a small box of alcohol wipes, a small elastic bandage, one very small instant cold ice pack, a few squares of gauze, a laughable pair of soft plastic tweezers right out of a toy doctor's kit and an almost equally lame pair of scissors.A nearly identical First Aid kit by the same manufacturer is listed elsewhere on AmazonPhysicians Care 25 Person First Aid Kit, Contains 113 Piecesfor 1/6th the price. What's going on here guys? Floating a trial balloon to see if you can get away with it?Normally, I don't consider price in a product review, but in this case it's necessary. I went through the "shelves" here at Amazon and within a few minutes found from 10 to 50 times the amount of the same items with professional tweezers, bandage scissors and a water tight tub to put it all in for less money. You should do the same
There is a common phrase you get what you pay for. This kit is selling in the mid-thirties right now and If it was selling for ten, I'd think it was over-priced. I can't imagine why this is considered a 25 person first aid kit. Each person can have 2 adhesive bandages and two alcohol pads. Beyond that, there is enough for one person each to have a minor burn, cut, or sprain. There is an instant cold pack and a latex free wrap bandage.  It isn't really even enough for a two person family. The white plastic box has cheap tabs to secure its closure. They look like in time they would break off. 10 gloves is 5 pairs. I can't imagine what the tweezers would be good for. If you need an emergency kit....keep looking or make your own with better quality parts.
PHYSICIANSCARE  131 piece First Aid Kit for 25 People.  Really?  Let's start with a detailed account of the contents.50 standard Size Latex Free Bandaids50 single use alcohol prep pads10 pack of sterile gauze pads 2"x2" and 3"x3"5 rubber gloves (latex or latex free..does not indicate)2 0.9g (tiny) packages of triple antibiotic cream2 0.9g first aid burn cream1 small roll of latex free elastic (ace type) bandage1 teeny tiny roll of bandage tape1 5"x5" instant (1 use) cold pack1 pair 5" gauze scissors1 plastic tweezer/clamp1 four page emergency instruction pamphletThat is IT.  I don't know..I did the math...I don't get 131 pieces nor do I understand how this can handle the minor medical needs of 25 people.  Maybe the manufacturers used the old George W Bush "fuzzy math".  I like the fact that a lot of the supplies are labeled latex free however the fact that the gloves are NOT labeled (so they are probably NOT latex free) is ridiculous.  There is no way I would pay over $35.00 for a kit such as this.  My local Walmart has kits that are more substantiative for a lot less money.  All of this comes in a small cheaply made plastic box that features closing tabs that could break just by looking at them wrong.  I will probably stuff this in my Bug Out Bag but to think I could use it in an emergency neighborhood or office situation to treat more than 5 people is crazy.  Look elsewhere for kits or just make your own for a lot less.  I don't even know if I can give this even one star but I will because I have to.
The very first thing that I noted about the first aid kit upon receiving it was that there are no compartments. It's just one plastic case with everything thrown in together. Then you have the 10 medical grade gloves which take up most of the space and in reality are only 5 pairs of gloves because who only wears one? There are only 2 antibiotic creams and 2 burn creams and for a kit that markets itself as a 25 person kit I find that is not sufficient. About the only things that I would consider sufficient are the 50 band-aids and alcohol pads. I would not recommend this kit as marketed and priced.
OSHA regulation 1910.151 states that there are no minimum requirements for a workplace first aid kit, only references ANSI Z308.1-2003 Minimum Requirements for Workplace First Aid Kits. The following is their workplace recommendation:At least one absorbent compress, 32 sq. in. (81.3 sq. cm.) with no side smaller than 4 in. (10 cm)At least 16 adhesive bandages, 1 in. x 3 in. (2.5 cm x 7.5 cm)One roll of adhesive tape, 5 yd. (457.2 cm) totalAt least ten packets of antiseptic, 0.5g (0.14 fl oz.) applicationsAt least six applications of burn treatments, 0.5 g (0.14 fl. oz.)Two or more pairs of medical exam gloves (latex or non-latex)At least four sterile pads, 3 in. x 3 in. (7.5 x 7.5 cm)One triangular bandage, 40 in. x 40 in. x 56 in. (101 cm x 101 cm x 142 cm)Additional (but optional) items include:Four 2x2 inch bandage compressesTwo 3x3 inch bandage compressesOne 4x4 inch bandage compressesOne eye patchOne ounce of eye washOne chemical cold pack, 4x5 inchTwo roller bandages, two inches wideOne roller bandage, three inches wideCPR barrier deviceFrom another reviewer, here is what is included in the kit:1 instant cold pack (disposable and non-reusable)50 alcohol prep pads50 adhesive bandages 3/4" x 3" (10 sheets of 5)2 antibiotic packets2 burn cream packets10 latex gloves1 pair of metal scissors1 plastic tweezer10 gauze pads1 elastic bandage1 roll of tapeI doubt that anyone is looking at this kit for a workplace kit anyway. I will be keeping this around for emergencies, but not relying on it. If you do intend on keeping it in the car, be advised that the cold compress says to store at room temperature, don't exceed 104 degrees and protect from freezing. So you can keep this in your car for a couple months out of the year in the mid-atlantic region.The tweezers are worthless unless you have a telephone pole sized splinter sticking from your finger.The plastic case has an o-ring, but I wouldn't trust it to keep water out!You could probably put this kit together for $7-$8. Since I received it as part of Amazon Vine, I'll keep the kit, and use it as a base. Adding some of the required items to the case.My current go to choice for low end/soccer mom first aid kits isThe Complete First Aid Kit - Includes Save-A-Tooth, Exceeds ANSI Standards, 100% Made in USA
I agree wholeheartedly with other reviewers who didn't like this first aid kit.  It's very overpriced for the dreadful quality you get, and it doesn't include some things that I think should be in a first aid kit (like antihistamines, Save A Tooth, nosebleed stopper, QuikClot-type clotting sponge).  And the gloves are latex!  They should be nitrile gloves to avoid problems with latex allergies.  This kit is little more than a stack of cheap adhesive bandaids in a flimsy plastic box.I would recommend instead to make your own first aid kit (like I did, stored in a clear Snapware container for safekeeping) or buy a different first aid kit that is better and more complete than this "Physicians Care" kit.
My goodness this is a silly first aid kit!  I thought things were missing when I opened it up, then realized that they counted every bandaid and alcohol wipe as an item.  So you get 50 of each which they count as 100 items and hen you have 31 pieces left.  The tape is about 12 inches long, the scissors are sad and the first aid guide is a folded sheet of paper!  This is not for 25 people unless your plan is to leave them all bleeding and injured, I don't consider this a kit for 12 people!Here is how you make an acceptable first aid kit for $36:Take this item out of your amazon shopping cartGet in your car and go to the DollarTree or other dollar store in townBuy 30+ full-size generic brand first aid items (checking exp. dates as you go)Buy one lidded tupperware casePut everything in the tupperware case and shut lidPut the case in your desk drawer, car trunk or bathroomTADA!I gave one star for the hard case it came it, it will be cool for my toddler to use as a toy when she plays doctor with her dolls.
This Physicians Care Office First Aid Kit is a first aid kit for 25 people? Seriously? It contains 50 3/4" x 3" bandages, 50 little alcohol pads, 10 pairs of latex gloves. a roll of tape and 10 gauze pads, a little pair of scissors, plastic tweezers, 1 elastic bandage. an instant cold pack (not reusable), 2 antibiotic packets, and 2 burn cream packets. For a kit that is supposed to serve an office of 25 people I would expect at least a 6 oz tubes of antibiotic cream, burn ointment and maybe an eye wash. An assortment of different sized bandages rather than one small size would be expected.The 131 pieces that are advertised includes the registration card and "First Aid Manual" which is just a single sheet of paper with instructions for 20 possible conditions printed on three sides. You could easily buy the individual items included in this kit for a lot less money, right here on Amazon. For the price of this kit, you could assemble many more items yourself into a more useful first aid kit.
I was very disappointed in this first aid kit. It seems utterly ridiculous that it would have a list price of $51.90. The box itself is rather dinky and hardly sturdy. It seemed like something you could pick up at your local dollar store. It comes with only one size of "adhesive plastic bandages" and they are loose in the box.Also, claiming that this box has over 131 pieces . . . as other's have pointed out - it doesn't. They count the registration card and the first aid handbook as pieces in this kit. It says that it has 10 medical grade gloves (which technically it does) but it's actually five pairs of gloves that are packaged together. So I think it would have been clearer to state that there are 5 pairs of gloves since that is the way they would actually be used. I have a hard time believing that this would be adequate for 25 people.There is a minuscule amount of burn and antibiotic cream and a rinky dinky pair of plastic blue tweezers that seem highly unlikely to be of any help unless you needed to remove a giant shard of glass from your hand. Seriously, you could make a kit of your own at a FRACTION of the price and end up with something of higher quality. I was quite disappointed in this one. I guess I can let my kids play doctor with it.
I had hoped to take this kit with me on camping trips.  My assessment is it is woefully inadequate for outdoor adventures and also unsuitable as an office first aid kit.  I laughed out loud when I opened it.  The components would not service 25 people and the quality of the pieces is shoddy.  The case barely shuts; you can drop it on the ground and the contents spill out. The tweezers are made of plastic.  Plastic tweezers?  Who uses plastic tweezers?  I tried to pluck an eyebrow hair with them and they would not grip. I can't imagine attempting to remove a splinter. The adhesive bandages are all one size and do not stick; I unwrapped a couple and stuck them on my hand only to see them flutter away when exposed to water.  Even if the quality of the items were better, this kit is missing lots of things.  I would expect the inclusion of finger splints, an emergency blanket, aspirin, cotton swabs, and maybe some anti-itch ointment.  For the advertised price, you could purchase a better rated kit.  Don't bother with this one.The contents of this first aid kit are made in China.
Wile E. Coyote's friends at ACME United mustn't have helped him with all of his first aid needs too much, as this inadequate kit seems to be geared for the most minute and minor injuries.  I suppose if everything had Hello Kitty or some equivalent for boys, it may work for some of the minor nicks kids get, but it doesn't, and there are better choices for that (not sure I trust Chinese band-aids to be sterile).  Even the box doesn't close right, so it's not like I can simply swap out the dollar store quality first aid supplies with good ones.  Basically it's a waste.I'm not sure why Amazon even offers this kit.
This thing is a piece of junk.  It has a bunch of cheap Band-Aids, rubber gloves, a ton of alcohol prep pads, a cheap scissors, a plastic tweezers, and a few ointments.We got a nice first aid kit from a X-mas party years ago and have depleted it.  I was hoping for a nice replacement.  When I saw this was for 25 people I thought it would do.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!This thing is pure garbage, period.
There are times when you receive an item and not only does it not live up to your expectations, but you also feel like you have been cheated.This is one of those times.  The list price of this kit is suppose to be $51.99 (current Amazon price is $36.31). Just checking other first aid kits available on Amazon, this is one of the most expensive kits, especially when you compare what you get.Now I don't expect to be able to perform open heart surgery with the contents of a first aid kit, but the fact that I can do little more than treat people with minor scrapes is silly.  To top it off the case is a mess.  First, the lid does not line up with the base.  I suspect this will get worse as time progresses. Second, they provide a small pinhole sized platic loop, in the lid and base, in order to lock the kick.  I can't imagine the miniature sized lock that could fit that loop.  Then finally, there are no compartments for any of the items.  If you actually have to use this kit in an emergency you will be fumbling around trying to find the item you want.Do yourself a favor and either buy another kit, or put one together yourself.  You can get better quality items, here on Amazon, for a third of the price.
You guys know I don't like to write negative reviews. But this "First aid kit" is inadequate . It would be OK for paper cuts, but not much more. The "kit " is mostly a box of cheap Band-aid clones, a box of alcohol prep pads, and 10 pairs of latex gloves. Why so many pairs of gloves is beyond me.It doesn't have anything to control heavy bleeding, even for the brief time before the paramedics get there. It doesn't have any of those little packets of OTC painkillers.It does have two (count `em 2!) packets of antibiotic cream, which is nowhere near enough.The box is flimsy and not well compartmentalized. The "handbook" is laughable.Now take a look at "Adventure Medical Kits Tactical Field/Trauma with QuikClot ". Sure that's more meant for the field than for the office, but there's a darn good kit. And it's only a buck more than this "kit". Note that it's so bad I have to put the word "kit" in """.
I tried this twice a week apart, and believe me I really didn't want to do it a second time, but in the interest of science...I could not believe how this acted as a diuretic.  For about 6 hours.In all fairness, I'm on some prescription meds, so your experience may be different, but this was an absolutely horrible experience, especially as I had to be out and about the first time I tried it.  That being said, it's hard to tell exactly what might be causing the problem with supplements like this as the ingredients are a bunch of made up names.
I lift regularly.  I am also no newbie to supplements.  I've tried pre-workout supplements in the past.  Some worked, most didn't.  I finally stopped spending precious money on them when I realized I could get the same effects simply from eating the right things before a workout.  When Amazon offered me a sample of Super Charge! Xtreme for review, I figured &#34;Why not&#34;?  I work out five days a week.  Here is what happened this week on the product:Monday:  Had not yet received product.  Worked out as usual.  No problems, no issues, and I completed my full workout.  Monday and Friday are my longest gym days because I do ab work after the targeted muscle group for that day.  I made it through the entire workout.  I felt tired afterward, but it was the good kind of tired .  The kind of tired that reassures you that you gave it a great effort.Tuesday:  Received the product.  Decided to give it a try.  I took one scoop.  I initially felt very energetic and focused.  It was definitely a rush.  When I got to the gym, I did my sets, feeling very energetic in the beginning.  However, about 2/3 through my workout, I hit a wall, hard.  I could barely pump out my reps, even with lighter weight.  I started to feel winded and exhausted.  I  finished my workout but I had to use much lighter weight than usual for the remaining sets.Wednesday:  I took the supplement and again felt an initial rush of energy and more focused.  However, this time the crash came a lot quicker.  I made it through about 12 sets of different exercises before I felt very winded and tired.  I finished, but with a lot of cheating and form so poor, I wonder why I even bothered trying. Even lighter weights required cheating.Thursday (Today): This was my last day trying Super Charge.  Like the previous two days, I only took one scoop with plenty of water.  I was warming up with lightweight deadlifts.  Halfway through my warm-ups I was already winded and exhausted!  My heart was beating very rapidly against my chest.  It felt like it was going to pound right through like in the movie Alien.  By the time I finished warm-ups, I felt like I had just sprinted a mile.  I struggled through the remaining workout, all with lighter weight than usual.  I skipped the last exercise altogether because I was completely spent.  I also have a pounding headache afterward.Needless to say, I will not be using this product anymore. I don't know which ingredient(s) gave me problems but I doubt it's the caffeine or BCAAs.  Prior to trying this, my pre-workout was a cup of Greek yogurt mixed with a half scoop of whey powder, a banana and a 200mg OTC generic brand caffeine pill.  One scoop of this PWO contains 225mg of caffeine.  My generic caffeine pill contains 200mg.  Whatever is causing the problem has pretty much made me swear off trying PWO supplements ever again.  I'll just stick with my original pre-workout.  If it aint broke, don't fix it.As for those wondering about taste and mixing, it mixes okay.  It takes a minute of two of stirring with about 8 ounces of water or more for it to dissolve.  The first two uses, I had to keeping pouring an extra sip of water into the cup to finish the undissolved residue.  By the third day, I finally just kept mixing for about 3-4 minutes until it was just about completely dissolved.  The taste is neither great nor bad.  It tastes more like very diluted grape Kool Aid than Fruit punch, at least to me.  I actually prefer this type taste.  it's not sweet, nor is it bitter.  It's just right.One last thing I think worth mentioning is that the label is designed to rip completely off when you open it.  Instead of a separate safety wrap that keeps the main label intact, the safety wrap and label are one.  This is the first time I've noticed this on a  supplement.  Not sure why some supplement companies do this.  As soon as I noticed the main label begin to tear off along with the safety portion, I immediately stopped and carefully cut away the safety portion with a pair of scissors leaving the main label mostly intact.  I strongly advise making an attempt to leave the main label on the container or, if you rip it off, saving it in an easily accessible location.  Just like with medications, you want this info available and handy if anything serious were to happen after using this product.My one-star rating is due to the health issues I experienced while on this product.  My heart sped up alarmingly fast and my physical strength and endurance diminished greatly.  In other words, it was the exact opposite of the intended purpose.
I have a problem with heavy chemical laden cleaners, so I tend to avoid them.  This product looked like a fantastic answer to my bathroom needs, but boy was I wrong.  My husband has worked in all levels of cleaning from institutional, to home level cleaning so he was especially interested in testing this out.  He is always looking for new cleaning products that are non-toxic.WHAT WE TESTED THIS ONHere is what we tested this product on:Wood with mildew stainsVinyl Siding with mildew and moldFiberglass showerTubAreas around glass doorHOW DID THIS PRODUCT PERFORM?In all cases, this product was so disappointing, I could not even put it above one star.  When leaving this to soak over and over, it still did not work well at all.  Mold, mildew, and any staining were barely dealt with.  After testing this over and over, we finally decided that it was WAY too high maintenance to try to get it to work.  A cleaning product should not take that much effort to make it work.My husband had even considered using it on siding when he power washed if it was good, but it was so bad, he said he would not waste his time.  (he cleans houses too).  Bleach in a very heavily diluted state still works best in that capacity.My husband said that it still has a chemical feel to it, despite the non-toxic label.  We both prefer Whip-It cleaner which is also non-toxic and works ten times better and faster than this one did.I had high hopes for this cleaner, but unfortunately, it disappointed us on all levels when following directions to the letter and even trying to coax it to work..
It doesn't do the job it says it is to do, it doesn't eliminate mold, not in my shower any way. I seem to get some mold in the corners and it gets into the grout and won't come out. I have not found anything yet that will remove the mold. I didn't try it on cement or wood since I don't have any mold on my cement or wood. I saw no evidence of it removing any mold and mildew stains in my shower so I can't recommend it.
I'm not impressed with this at all. We get very bad mold around the tub where it meets the wall. I was really hoping that this would get rid of it, but it didn't do anything at all.
I am not a picky eater but the taste of these lozenges is the pits. I began having all the symptoms  of a cold and especially a sore throat and a cough. I try to avoid sugar in anything I consume so these being sugar free were just the ticket. In addition, I love the taste of cherry. With high expectations I slipped  a lozenge into my mouth and initially I just noticed a somewhat dull and tasteless flavor. As the lozenge continued to melt it also increased in tastelessness. Then my mouth became dry and begged me to spit out  this evil tasting substance. I decided to carry on with the melting process in the hopes that improvement was on the way. Not so. There was no reduction in the amount of coughing that I continued to experience. If anything, my throat felt worse. I hung in there until the horrible object was completely dissolved. It would take a far more accomplished wordsmith than I am to describe the dreadful aftertaste which lasted seemingly forever.No brushing of the teeth, no serial mouthwash applications and no type of food or beverage could mask the awful results of this terrible product.  The remainder of the package contents have been disposed of in the manner that they deserve.
I could not tell you if this product actually serves to help with colds, because it was so nasty that I could only tolerate one.  My entire tongue and mouth felt horrible, just before going completely numb.  I did not have the heart to ask any one else in the family to try it.  One of them did anyway, and spat it out immediately.
I'm willing to try anything that might help shorten a cold. These lozenges, unfortunately, left such a horrible taste in my mouth that I couldn't even finish one. The honey lemon flavor was not enough to overpower whatever else is at work, taste-wise, in these. I can't speak to the efficacy of these lozenges, but perhaps a stronger flavor such as cherry might make these easier to take.
I really like cold-eeze regular lozenges. They have helped me more than prescription medicine when I have had coughs. I looked forward to the sugar free. The regular drops do not have a calorie count, but do list corn syrup and sucrose. This does not have those. Instead it contains, instead Acesulfame K which contains the carcinogen methylene chloride. This is a sweetener that has been approved but there have been objections to its use (granted that has happened to most artificial sweeteners).What my objection to these are the almost chemically taste. It reminds me of when I was younger and I used to spray cheap perfume behind my ears and sometimes got a taste on my lips. There is no smell or odor - just a nasty taste. I wound up spitting the drop out - couldn't even finish it.
What is going on with Marpac?  They used to have the best white noise machines in the country, you never got a clicking sound from the end of the tape and the machines lasted 8 - 15 years before getting a motor problem.  2 years ago I bought their high end white noise machine and on the 3rd day of use noticed a clicking sound every couple of minutes,so it keeps me awake.  3 weeks ago i bought 2 of this model,  I have had this model twice in the past and it worked great for years.  After using this machine for 1 night, the motor makes an intermittent humming noise after a few hours.  Both of the machines that I just bought have the same problem.  I don't notice it at first, but later in the night if I wake up.  I can't get to sleep when this happens.  Guess I'll try using an air purifier for white noise in my room, also, maybe it will help my allergies.  Another thing that works pretty good is a white noise CD, put the repeat function on the cd player. I have one for a fan and one for rain.
Finish has a strong product line of really good products. However, i PASS on this one. Unlike their powdered products, this gel product leaves an off tasteon plastics and silicone. I found that any plastic baking or cooking utensils would get an off taste and pass it on to the food. YUCK!Another thing I did not like was that the little pac comes in one bag. Finish, has a separate compartment box for it's powdered blocs but not this. If your handhas any wetness on it from just having loaded the dishes, the pacs would clumptogether. Therefore be sure to put the pack in the dishwasher first with dry hands.For me this is best used when there is no plastics or silicone products being washed.
I LOVE the smell of these things - they make your dishwasher smell so fresh and clean. That is, if they can dispense in your dishwasher's cycle!  That said, I have a top-of-the-line Kitchenaid dishwasher and since I had a great coupon for these, thought I'd give them a try.  Well, they are so puffy that you can't get the soap compartment closed first of all, and once you do, it won't reopen during the cycle!  Can't tell you how many times I had to go back and rewash the entire load of dishes.  Once, my husband put away all the dishes and they were washed without soap because of this.  Yuck!  They need to redo this product design but until then, just grab a box of their powdered formula- it's fantastic.  Great idea, just needs reworked.
Compared to the other ingredients in this "Reservatrol Synergy" supplement, there is precious little real reservatrol.  Here are the numbers:Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid)...100 mg;Reservatrol...25 mg;Green Tea 5:1 Extract...200 mg;Quercetin...100 mg;Grape Skin Extract...100 mg;Grape Seed Extract...50 mg;Trans-Pterostilbene...5 mg.I got this to enhance my immune system.  Within a day of starting it, I got sick.  I thought I might need to give it a little more time, so I took it for another week.  I kept getting sicker and sicker.  Then I stopped taking it.  I started feeling better the next day.  I'll try another reservatrol supplement, but not Jarrow Formulas.  Pity, because most of their supplements are excellent.  Just not this one.
I should have known when I opened the bottle that something was amiss with this supplement. First of all, it smelled really bad when I first opened the bottle. It had a long shipment to get to me and it was nearly 100 degrees outside. I let them come to room temp over the next day and took one the following evening, thinking, "just because it smells bad, doesn't mean it's gone bad." Within a couple of hours of taking this, I developed a serious gastrointestinal disturbance that went on for the entire next day. I haven't been that sick in YEARS! I had to have my husband come home early with pepto and I lost an entire day of work over it. All of the food I ate that day came from inside my home and I know this illness was caused by this stuff being rancid. I thought about giving it a another shot, but I am too scared and convinced I got sick from this. I just opened the bottle again to smell and it smells even worse than when I took it the first time, a few weeks ago. I really think they should ship perishable supplements with some sort of climate control. I'm sure these had gone bad in the heat. If I could share the smell of these rancid pills with you through the internet, I would.Best advice I can give is to order your supplements in the winter. Not worth getting terribly sick for the sake of a supplement.
I have been taking this for slightly less than a month, so it is very difficult to gauge the effectiveness.  However, I do not feel any different at all.The packaging states that each tablet has 20 mg of Resveratrol.  However, various articles that I read on the web state that you need anywhere from 500 to 1200 mg per day to be effective.  I know very little about Resveratrol, but it appears that this is a very weak version of it.
I usually use the green Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Scrub Sponges and they work good for awhile. I thought I would try these blue Scotch-Brite Non-Scratch Scrub Sponges. They work about as well as a plain sponge. They may be non-scratch but they are also non-cleaning too. If you have something very delicate then these might be useful but if you are trying to clean something then they don't do much. I guess that might be expected since they are labeled "non-scratch". I've used the green Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Scrub Sponges and have never noticed any scratches on anything from using them. But I also never use them on anything with a painted on surface (like my Italian dish set) where I only use a plain sponge. I am not going to waste money on these non-scratch sponges as I just don't see that these are worth the money over plain regular sponges. If you need to clean something then get the green Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Scrub Sponges. If you have delicate dishware then just soak them in warm/hot water using a good dish detergent and then use a nice regular sponge.
The first application went smoothly but we noticed that the bugs were still really bad after about a week. So after fighting with the sprayer, the hubby sprayed the yard a second time. However, after 2 applications our backyard is still over run with spiders, mosquitoes, and ants. So I don't recommend this product.
Connecting Cutter Bug Control to my hose was easy.  I sprayed away for a long time, and noticed how happy the bugs were that were getting a bath.  When I was done, I realized that nothing other than water was coming from the sprayed.  I tried again, holding the bottle upside down, with the same result.  I would only suggest this product if you have a sprayer, but in that case you might find a cheaper bulk repellant anyway.
I have gotten some of it to spray out, but no matter what I do, after spraying my whole 6/10ths acre yard twice over I still have at least half the bottle left.  And although I admit this has been a wet year, two weeks after the first spraying I still have plenty of mosquitoes...  There must be a problem with some of these bottles!
This is my first ever 1 star review, but if you can't get the product to even come out of the bottle what choice does one have. I followed the directions carefully but the sprayer just won't work. Can not recommend.
I find these liners to be completely useless. As soon as I tugged at them to see how strong they were, they ripped into holes. I compared them to my regular 13 gallon Ruffies for strength, and the same test left the Ruffies fine without any holes or rips. These bags are not strong enough for everyday use and I cannot recommend them. They are nice and long, however, and if you needed to store something like socks or clothes, you can easily tie a knot in them at the top.I was only sent 2 bags to review so I can't tell you how they ship, if they withstand the shipping process well or how they're packaged.. When buying heavier products, this is information I wish to know before I purchase.
I liked my old Norelco better!  This new Braun takes me 3-4x as long to shave my face.  Many hairs simply do not get touched and I have to make 5-6 passes...very frustrating.  For being as expensive as it is, this shaver should cut close and do it reasonably fast.  Every shave is an act of frustration.
The first thing I noticed about the massage cushion is it's sour chemical-like smell. The smell filled all the rooms of my apartment for several days. Even now, over two weeks after removing the cushion from its box, I can still smell it. Homedics has a notice in the package that the smell will dissipate in 24 hours. I don't think the smell will ever disappear.My plan was to set the massage cushion up in my favoite chair, plug it in and whenever I wanted a back rub or some heat it would be there to use. This is not possible because the cushion is too large for my chair. It does not leave enough room for me to sit. Even sitting on the edge of the chair the bottom pad is shaped so that i feel like I'm sliding off of what little sitting area is left. The cushion measures about 5" thick, but when placed in the chair it's effective depth is much more. It would not fit in two other chairs I tried it on either. When I tried to set the cushion on a couch, or propped up against the wall on a bed, it tended to flop over.Even if the cushion did fit I would be unable to use the chair. The cushion has 4 rock-hard plastic rollers sticking through the back fabric. It is very uncomfortable having these rollers poking me in the back while sitting. The rollers poking me in the back make any chair unusable for sitting. I'm not a person who would bother to get the cushion out of storage and crawl around on all fours to find a wall socket for the ac plug more than once. The cushion will stay in the closet and never be used.The uncomfortable feeling turned into pain once the cushion was turned on. The rollers are less than an inch thick and the sensation is more like being poked with a broom handle than massaged. The worst part is when the rollers come together in the middle of my back. It feels like someone is using a small hammer on the bones of my spine. This HURTS!
I'm sorry to say I didn't find the Homedic QRM-400H to be pleasant or helpful.  It felt like I was been rubbed with sharp gravel.There are two basic settings:  "Shiatsu" and "Rolling,"  both with or without heat.  The "Shiatsu" massage was simply unbearable; the poking bits felt jagged and way too painful.  "Rolling" was less painful, but still not something I'd choose to use.  It hit the lower back well, but not much of the upper back.  I wish there were a massage machine that could massage the neck and shoulders (but not one that hurts like this one).  The unit was noisy and wouldn't be good to use if people are watching television.  The heat wasn't very warm; certainly not as warm as an old-fashioned heating pad.  I often have lower back pain, but can't imagine using this machine for relief.Bottom line:  This is an expensive gadget that was of no benefit to me.
This product is very sweet, it has glycerin in it. The effect was subtle, it was there, but not enough for me to want to pay about $25 for such a mild effect.The ingredients are fairly hypoallergenic for an herbal supplement, except for the Ethanol and glycerin. I'm going to contact the company to see if it might be useful for pets (?), because I didn't notice much of an effect. In other words, there are less expensive supplements like this on the market. Happy Camper is a good one, Bach Rescue Remedy, Calms Forte and others that are much less pricy. This is an honest review from a licensed Alternative Health Practitioner & Herbalist.BTW, 1 ml (1/2 dropper full) is the recommended dosage, one reviewer here mentioned taking 3-4 dropper-fuls and still had mild effects. The main ingredients are flower extracts (not essences like Bach) rather than herbs, which may account for the mild effect. If you're seriously stressed this product most likely won't cut it.
I've used this product sporadically, and have been disappointed in its utility. Even at doses in excess of double the package's recommendation, there are no discernible effects on anxiety. While the product isn't homeopathic, it contains a variety of 'natural' remedies to address nervousness, irritability, anxiety, etc; but nothing demonstrably useful.The solution tastes all right, kind of sweet and medicinal, but not offensive. For the product's cost, and its negligible (if any) effect, I would avoid it and instead go with more reliable alternatives like kava kava.
Yes, I'm going through menopause, and it's unpleasant. So I saw this product and thought it might help.As with any supplement, I look through the ingredients. The last ingredient listed is ovary. No explanation, just the word ovary.I've been vegetarian for more than thirty years. While I don't know where the ovary came from or who it belongs to, that is enough for me.Even if it worked miracles, there is no way I'm putting this in my body.
I used this product exactly two times and had sharp pains on the left side of my forehead. I did not take today at all...no pain...Given that there really is no way to review this product in a timely fashion, I had assumed that the product would come with an inside pamphlet/statement telling more about it...any potential side effects, etc. There was not. The main ingredients reported was roots... Sure, I could research more about the product, but in my opinion I shouldn't have to. What all the contents are, I have no idea and felt there should be much more provided with a product, which, if I had been buying it, would be fairly expensive, but without any real way to determine effectiveness. My grandmother had osteoporosis, so I had hoped to use this to prevent it...Sorry, but I want to know more about something I'm taking by mouth, preferably with not even water, as directed, and from which I suddenly had some sharp head pains... Whether there was a correlation or not, would you risk continuation? Not me...
The Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush is supposed to be the latest and greatest new technology as far as electric toothbrushes go. However, my experience with this toothbrush leaves a lot to be desired.First off, when opening the package there are several things included. The charging stand, power cord, and a rather nice travel case. There is also a small set of instructions that are included. Before using this they say to charge the toothbrush for a full 24 hours. There are also a variety of other instructions such as not using it like a `normal' toothbrush, don't let the wave guide touch your teeth, and a variety of other things. I only state these so that people know I read the instructions before using it, and I did follow them during my one use.A little bit of a disclaimer here. I only used this toothbrush once (you'll see why in a moment) but another member of my family used it for over a week.During the first use I put a small `pea' size dab of tooth paste (gel) (per the instructions) on the toothbrush head. Turned it and proceeded to try and brush my teeth. I don't believe the wave guide touched my teeth, I didn't push, I followed the directions. Yet, it felt as though I had a jackhammer in my mouth. It was not a pleasant experience at all. In fact, after two minutes of brushing (the brush shuts off after two minutes) I had a headache which I believe was caused by said toothbrush. My teeth did not feel any cleaner than with a normal toothbrush. The only difference was I had a headache.So, another family member decided to try it out. He did not encounter the headache, maybe I am just over sensitive to having a jackhammer in my mouth. However, when asked his overall opinion after a little more than a week of use (twice a day) he said "I'm not impressed. If it was $50 I wouldn't buy one."I will not question other reviewers, but based on my experience with this product I am not impressed at all, it was simply a miserable experience and not one I will be trying again. This toothbrush is now packed away in a drawer for the next time I need to clean the grout in my tile (maybe the jackhammer will be useful then). It does have solid construction, and fits well in my hand. But trying to justify the initial price, as well as the overly expensive replacement heads just can't happen. I'll stick with a $3 `normal' toothbrush and leave the headaches to someone else.
I have a biology background and the good news is that this amount of UV light is going to have the desired effect on the bacteria that live in your toothbrush head.  It will induce many double strand breaks in the bacterial DNA, making it hard or impossible for them to grow.  It will have no lasting harmful effects on the brush because no chemicals/toxins are used.  My understanding is that there is a shut-off to prevent humans from being exposed to the UV light, which is a good thing as UV light will interfere with human DNA in the same way that it damages bacterial DNA.  However, I would like to point out a few things:1, The detergent in your toothpaste (variously called sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, etc) will probably be effective enough at getting rid of bacteria -- that's why we use it.2, The bacteria are already in your mouth anyway!  How do you think your toothbrush head is getting contaminated in the first place?3, People have survived very happily without wasting money on idiotic gadgets like this.4, The bacteria that are NOT killed by this treatment are more likely to be mutated.  It's a biological fact that UV light increases the number of DNA mutations.  While most bacteria will be killed, the 0.01% that survive are more likely to have suffered mutations.  This is not true for cell-disruptive methods of destruction like bleach and detergent (including the detergent in your toothpaste).To summarize, dentists use this sort of gizmo because they're putting the same tools into the mouths of many different people.  They don't want to get sued, especially in light of reports suggesting that certain diseases may be passed through saliva.  However, this gizmo is completely unnecessary if you do not share your brushheads with other people.  In fact, it's not even necessary if you share your brushheads with people you wouldn't mind kissing...Lastly, please bear in mind that not all bacteria are bad and that you actually need some to help you digest food properly.  Also, good bacteria take up space and resources to keep bad bacteria from finding a niche.  So, try NOT to use 'antibacterial' soap, do eat some live active yogurt after a course of antibiotics and always completely finish a course of antibiotics that you've been prescribed by a doctor.
Philips Sonicare sounds like a great idea - keeping your toothbrush free from germs on a daily basis.  However, this can be done by simply dipping your toothbrush in a solution of hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol (however, rubbing alcohol does not taste good).  In addition, this product only works with Sonicare and Oral-B brushes.  Regular toothbrushes and other product names don't work with this machine.  It's a clean looking machine, but for the money and the space on your bathroom counter, I'd don't think this is much more than a cool gadget.  Besides, what do you do when the bulb burns out?
Good intentions, bad product.  After trying two of these for over three months we finally threw them away.  The scent was nice, but very faint.  I think it is the wood they are using.  They are very expensive, and for our family just wasn't worth the money.
Works well for a short time, design looks good, but then like so many here, the piece of junk fails because the battery fails to make proper contact.  I am good at fixing things, but this does not make sense and not much you can do but throw it out.  A shame!  Very disappointed.
This product should no longer be sold.  Mine died within 10 uses.  Obviously, I tried new batteries, and that didn't work.  I see from others here that they had similar experiences.  Utter garbage.
There are tons of protein powders out there and after researching quite a few I chose Jarrow Formulas as it offered a good value IMO.  So, I am comparing this product with Jarrow Formulas 100% Whey Protein.Ingredients Jarrow Formulas:100% Ultrafiltered Whey Protein from milk (rBST free)Crystalline Fructose (better than High Fructose Corn Syrup IMO)French Vanilla Flavor, Lecithin from soy, guar gum, Fibersol-2 (resistant maltodextrin), and Lo Han Guo (momordica grosvenoril)Price:  $21.87 ($0.68 / oz).  Take 15% off with Subscribe & Save ($18.59 or $0.58/oz)Ingredients Bio Synergy Whey Better Protein:Isolated Whey Protein, Flavour, Beetroot Juice Powder, Natural Cream Flavour, Sucralose, Niacinamide, Para Amino Benzoic Acid, Calcium Pantothenate, Pyridoxine Hydorchloride, Thiamin Hydorchloride, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, D-Biotin, Cyanocobalamin preparation.Price for 750g (1.65 lbs): $62.99 ($2.33 / oz)This is a no-brainer people.  I had not done this comparison until writing this review.  It is obscene how much this costs compared to the Jarrow product.  And, in my opinion, the Jarrow product wins on quality for the following reasons:No artificial sweeteners.  It highlights on the front label that it contains No Aspartame.  Well, it contains Sucralose.  Better than Aspartame, but not better than Crystalline Fructose.Serving size is smaller (26g vs 30g for Bio-Synergy)This Bio-Synergy stuff says to take it 3 times daily.  You will have used up the whole tub (750g) in just 8 days!Half of the ingredients in this product are B vitamins.  They are in miniscule quantities.  If you used it 3 times daily as recommended, you would get exactly 100% of the RDA levels of B Vitamins.  That is next to non-existent.For both products, the taste is pretty good.  You have to experiment with what you add it to for your taste preference.  The vanilla Jarrow protein goes great with OJ.  Tastes like an Orange Julius if you've had that before.  Actually, both are good with either milk or OJ.  Each are kind of weak with water only.
The best thing I can say about this is that it was a trial item that I didn't have to pay for and that the packaging is cool.  My husband and I found this product terrible!First of all, the "hers" is freezing cold in a very, very bad way.  You might as well just pour mouthwash down there.  It was a combination of freezing cold and burning hot, like BenGay but not in a good way.The "his" was best described as gritty.  I guess it's not quite the reaction you'd expect from this product.  I was hoping the combination would neutralizing the freezing hot feeling, but it did not put out "the fire".  Not good at all... save your money!
I'll preface this saying I don't have much experience with this type of product... some flavored motion lotion in my early 20's, and my husband and I have some "massage oil" that sometimes comes into play. However I'm a sucker for cute packaging and this looked intriguing so why not.After some laughing at me for getting it my husband warmed up to the idea of trying it out, joking about it during the day while we waited to be alone at night lead up to some sweet anticipation.Then reality hit.Some things to remember (which we didn't think of at the time)1. these vials are safety sealed, so if you think in the heat of the moment you will just get them out and use them... nope you have to take off the tops, peel off the seal, etc. So once you're done fumbling with the lights and getting the seals off...2. They are the same size/shape, when it's dark you have no idea which is which, lights back on.3. You have your respective vials, you apply them... you go to put them down, crap did you close it right? It won't stand up on it's own and you don't need that leaking all over your night stand or bed... lights back on to check.Now if the wanna be strobe light show you've been putting eachother through hasn't killed the mood I personally found the sensation enough to!Warm for him, sure that's nice enough and predictable. Cool for her. Eh? I don't want cold on my you know what at this point (or really ever for that matter). Joining them together didn't do much except give me a bit of a burning sensation (not as in warming, just plain unpleasant). Once that subsided they worked as expected, nothing sensational and frankly I couldn't wait to wash them off... thankfully they easily rinsed off.Give me back the pina colada motion lotion of my past, at least that one tasted good :)
I wanted to like this, I really did, but the product is just not what it should be.  If you like sticky feeling vicks on you during the moment go ahead and try it.  Does it give you the WOW feeling?  Yes, it gives you a suck in your breath feeling but it isn't because it enhances the moment like it advertises.  It does generate a heat of sorts but it's not from your moment but from the weird feeling of vicks on your privates.Also...THIS STUFF LEAKS!!!!!!! I never got the bottles to close correctly after I once opened it.  It leaked all over my nightstand.  As for the plastic thing holding them together????  I can't imagine what the use of it would be except to get them both in the trash at the same time.
This product could have been a lot better if not for the burning sensation. It was felt by both of us. It actually made the whole thing uncomfortable. Wont recommend it.
couldn't wait to get this product and of course TO TRY IT but mine came repackaged and open and worse of all - LEAKING. wasn't about to try it. can't return it as a vine product. VERY disappointed.
I was hoping these would be better than the Amazon Basics Microfiber cleaning cloths that sell for the same price and are also available through the Subscribe and Save Program. They are not any better. We follow the care instructions and our house has soft water; nonetheless, these lose their softness as well as their ability to absorb moisture after one or two washings. If I were to buy these they would be only for the lightest duty cleaning needs around the house and definitely not for automotive purposes. Of course, these are so inexpensive (currently $0.35 to $0.45 per towel) that maybe there's a lot of people that are okay with using them one or twice and disposing of them. It's clear to me that's why they're on the Subscribe and Save Program; because if they're used, they need to be replaced regularly.They may seem fine when they're fresh out of the package but they are, compared to the better automotive brands of microfiber towel (Griot's Garage towels come to mind), dramatically thinner and thus less absorbent. Then again, there's a huge price difference so it really depends on what your needs and uses are.
I drink a lot of coffee so I was a little wary of this green coffee bean extract. I don't really feel the need to turn to supplements for energy, but I figured I would see if this helped me lose weight.I generally had an ok reaction to these pills. There were a few times where I felt uneasy in my stomach a short while after taking these. I wouldn't recommend them for this reason alone. You need to take them twice a day and it's not really worth the trouble.I don't recommend these at all. They're a big waste of money and having to take them twice a day is a nuisance. Those looking for weight loss or added energy should seek alternative methods elsewhere.
I did not feel that this supplement did anything for me.  I was very disappointed because I had heard on Dr. Oz that this stuff helped people to lose weight.  I didn't lose any weight and I didn't feel any different than before I started using the supplement.  I do not believe the FDA regulates this stuff which makes me wonder if we are all getting duped by buying it.
I'd heard that coffee bean extract is the new miracle weight loss product, and I'm looking a little lumpy in the wedding gown that I'll be wearing in three (!) months.Jarrow Formulas Green Coffee Bean Extract, 400 mgwas what I tried.  I took as directed, including watching what I eat.  No loss in appetite.  Furthermore, as a moderate coffee drinker, I was surprised when I found myself falling asleep mid-afternoon.  I didn't find the mental clarity that others discovered.Following the instructed regimen, I noticed absolutely no changes in my weight - I wasn't thinner, nor did the weight even re-distribute.  This was a waste of time.
When I received my Alcis Relief Pain Relief Cream in the mail, I was very excited.  Because of extreme stress which I had been going through and pain from trying to exercise at the same time, I needed a pain relief cream.ALCIS RELIEF PAIN RELIEF CREAM is not greasy at all.  It has a smell reminiscent of the old Bain De Soleil ( I think I spelled that right) Suntan gel from many years ago- I am not sure if they make it still or not.The cream is not colored and it is not greasy at all.  It rubs into the skin pretty quickly and smoothly.I have applied this cream every two hours on sore muscles with no apparent change at all.With pain relief creams I have found that what works beautifully for one person might not work at all for another, so just because it did not work for me does not mean that it will not work for you.There is a lot of herbal and supplemental content in this cream (camellia leaf, Chamomillla Recutita flower extract, Glucosamine Sulfate, Lavender extract, rosemary leaf extract, and grape seed extract are some examples).There are some silicone derivatives in this which make a smooth application.You can call the company direct if you have any questions at 1-800-977-8123Before you buy if you have any allergies, you might want to contact them first.
I had just started playing tennis the day before this product arrived and you guess it - I was sore.  I also had some existing minor lower back pain that was slightly aggravated by playing tennis.I was excited to try this, but wanted to give it the full benefit of the doubt.Longevity?===========1. Does not meet the bar like your typical Sports Creme or "BenGay" menthol based / methyl salicylate creme that *gives the feeling* that it penetrates into your muscle tissue with their "cooling" effect.I tested this by applying it before I showered to one side of my shoulder/trapezius muscle and one side of my lower back.  As advertised on the box, I waited 5 minutes.  I noticed an immediate cooling effect, but more on that...  No discernible effect.After the shower, still no discernible effect.  Repeat this with a menthol based Sports Creme (BenGay) or Vicks vapor rub and you'll still have the cooling relief after the shower.When a product says to apply this 3-4 times a day - if you take a typical 8 hour work day, how convenient is it to apply a creme to your lower back or shoulder ??  Why wouldn't you take a salicylate based pill or anti-inflammatory pill ?Pain Relief?=============1. I re-applied generous amounts after the shower on the same side of my shoulder/trapezius muscle and lower back and went to work.  I had no discernible effect even an hour later.2. The next day I repeated AND I put it on the back of my neck - because I figured that would be a pretty sensitive area - no feeling of numbness beyond a temporary cool feeling.2a. On a hunch, I took regular skin lotion and put it on the other side of my lower back and felt the same cool feeling - so I think it was just the evaporative cooling of a creme on my skin.3. The next day, the 2nd day of tennis was catching up to me and I was so lucky to get a back massage later that evening and I asked my girlfriend to rub in this creme.  Even after 15 minutes or so, she had no numbness in her hands from the massage, and I felt no effect from the creme.Technical Research:====================1. The ONLY active ingredient is trolamine salicylate which is a topical analgesic.  Aspirin is a type of salicylate known for its anti-clotting.  Methyl salicylate is another topical analgesic (BenGay, Mentholatum Deep Heat) and is usually paired with menthol.  Unless a topical analgesic has other active ingredients that really penetrates the skin like menthol, lidocaine, capsaicin (active component for chili peppers) [eat some jalopeno peppers or hot buffalo wings, wash your hands 5 times and then take out your contact lenses - if your eyes are burning, then you'll understand], then I'm not too sure how this creme would have even worked well - especially if the box tells you to apply daily 3-4 times a day.  I think you need to injest a pill or smell like BenGay.Overall:==========1. Very light odor, not greasy, almost a tack feeling2. Did not work for my mild pain3. Tried for 3 days, including a long back massage4. I'd rather take aspirin or naproxen or a Doan's (magnesium salicylate)while at work and accept the smell of a menthol sports creme in the privacy of my own home.
My hands tend to ache from arthritis so I "put on a generous amount" of this lotion several times during the night. It did not seem to make any difference at all. I will save it to see if it works on a muscle strain, but if you have arthritis don't waste your money.
While oral NSAIDs are effective in reducing chronic joint pain, it's not a good idea to take them all the time, so I leapt at the chance to try this cream, which could be applied to the painful area without systemic effects.  It went on easily, and doesn't have the strong smell of traditional rubs.Unfortunately, it didn't help my ankle pain a bit.I, of course, know enough about drug testing to know there is nothing which works for everyone, so if the concept of applying a pain reliever topically is appealing to you, I wouldn't rule out the Alcis Daily Relief Cream just because it didn't work for me.  No one should trust a study with an n of 1.
My husband has arthritis in his lower back, and I have minor lower back pain occasionally, so we were interested to try out Alcis.My husband has multiple prescription options to combat his back pain, but he's always willing to try something new, especially something that doesn't leave him smelling like a medicine cabinet!Alcis smells very nice, with an extremely light almost fruity undertone. The product goes on as a gel, with a tacky feel.  It takes some time to be absorbed.My husband used Alcis in the evening when his back was sore after work.  He tried it for about 6 days straight, with no noticeable alleviation of symptoms.I sometimes wake up in the mornings with an achy back.  I tried Alcis on those mornings, for a total of about 10 applications.  I received no benefit from the product.We'll both be switching back to the Voltaren Gel, which is a prescription product that works in about 15 minutes and lasts for 4 or 5 hours.
Yes it's a prettier cool looking bottle on the sink but the first thing that comes to mind when trying to decide if it's good or bad is simply the question WHY? First of all it doesn't cut grease even close to DAWN and the smell is not all that great. The smell at first reminded me of tea and nothing at all of ginger or pomelo but then it gets heavy and it lingers and you find yourself washing your hands a lot to get rid of this ever lingering not so great smell. Even the glasses and dishes take on this overwhelming smell. If you need aroma therapy in the kitchen buy a glade candle and buy a real dish soap to do the dishes, sorry but this is not it.
When I am trying a new lotion I always start by using it on my hands. I squeezed a little bit into my Palm and worked it into both hands and my nails. The odor was immediate, it is like a  cross between pomegranate and rancid grease. My hands felt a little sticky, but that didn't last long, the lotion was absorbed within a minute or two. I tried to ignore the smell, but within five minutes or so I just had to wash it off. It took a good scrub to get the lotion off, so I think that it must be a better quality lotion, perhaps they could find a  scent for it that people could live with?
first of all, this scent smelled a bit too much like man's cologne. second of all, i didn't like that i was supposed to put this on at night. third of all, it didn't work for me. I will definately go back to using degree brand.
I received this product and being a fan of Dove products was anxious to try it out. However, the stick I received was damaged. The knob used to turn the deodorant up turns but it does not raise the deodorant up high enough to use. Therefore, I really cannot say for sure whether this is a good product or not. And since this was only a sample, I will not receive a replacement.
Tampax changed their whole design a couple years ago. Their product used to be a narrow, very comfortable product. I never had a problem with leakage. No other products were ever nearly as good as theirs.Now with there new design I can't stand the product! It is wide and stubby and very uncomfortable!!! I have more leakage problems and have completely stopped using their products.I thought I would try the Tampax Pearl, hoping it was more like the old style, but to my disappointment it is not. Furthermore, this product has a plastic applicator and is terrible for our environment.I have completely changed products and highly recommend NATRACARE ORGANIC TAMPONS. Did you know the non-organic tampons have terrible compounds (pesticides, etc.) associated with the cotton? Your body will absorb these chemicals which can cause cancers within your body.  Try NatraCare Organic Tampons, they are better for your health and better for our environment.
The one big problem I have with this is that amazon says you will get 2 eighty count boxes but vine members will get 1 eighty count box but I got 1 forty count box so does that mean if you order and pay for the 2 eighty count boxes that you will get 2 forty count boxes....? They need to fix that before anyone orders this item. The problem with the actual item is that it is so very, very thin that I doubt it will block much more than a few drops at a time before you will need to change it so if you want to remain clean and dry you would need to change it many, many times daily making it a very expensive product to use.
I picked up a bottle of this because I had read that 5-HTP could be useful in helping insomnia.  I took them every night, as suggested on the bottle, and they literally did nothing.  I could not notice any appreciable effects.I cannot recommed these at all.  I will stick to melatonin and whiskey.
Whoa!  My blood pressure went shooting waaaay up within a day of starting on this product!  I had to throw mine away.  CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR before you take this supplement!
I've used a few different weight-loss gimmicks over the years including MetaboLife, Plexus Slim, Slim-Fast, etc. and tried numerous gimmicky diets as well.  Toss Jarrow Formula's CLA into the hat now as well.  I've been using this stuff for just over two weeks and all I have to say is this:  If you enjoy having loose bowels for about four days until your body adjusts to this snake oil and then see absolutely no results a week later, Jarrow's CLA is for you!Other than the brief bout with diarrhea, I had no major or noticeable side effects.  I also had no expected effect either.The bottom line is that unless you get off of your duff, retrain your brain to eat right (or at least a bit healthier), and put real effort into losing weight, you're going to remain a fatty.  Even if you do find a gimmicky diet that works, you'll probably only maintain that diet for awhile until you are back to double-fisting Little Debbies and going back for seconds and thirds of mama's home cooking.Exercise and diet, folks.  That is all!  It isn't easy (trust me, I've fought with my weight for my entire life), but it feels really good when I do see results from my hard work.  I fail quite a bit, but I always try to keep at it and overcome my own faults.Ditch the pills and hit the gym!  Do not waste your money on this junk!
I workout regularly -4-5 times a week- and I eat pretty much healthy foods/balanced diet. I am not fat or overweight, I am pretty much active overall. However, despite all that I still have some fat surrounding my mid section that slowly crept up after age 40 and that won't go away. From all the great reviews in here I decided to give Jarrow Formulas Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) a try and see if that would help me lose that extra stubborn fat. Well, it didn't. I'm not sure If I got a different bottle of CLA from everyone else here or what, but this didn't do a thing for me. I took the recommended dosage described on the bottle and again continue a balanced healthy diet and exercise routine and finished the entire bottle and nothing changed at all same weight and same measurements from when I started taking the the CLA. I have also tryed other supplements like Keto-DHA, Carbtame etc., etc. and none of these "snake oils" worked. I'm not sure why so many people in reviews say they do unless it's the placebo effect or maybe it works better on more over weight individuals. Anyway, having said that, I will still keep looking for that "miracle in a pill". Oh well.....
Between a bout with diarrhea and the smell of the product, I didn't continue use of these capsules for an extended time.  The bad results and the noting that many reviewers find the product ineffective decided me against continuing to take it.
I took this product for a week, and had diarrhea for the entire time.  I initially thought I had a stomach virus, and did not relate it to using this supplement.  Finally, a coworker saw me taking one of these pills and asked me what it was.  When I showed her, she replied, "Oh, I took that a few months ago, but it caused awful bathroom problems!"  Thank goodness for my nosy coworker, because I finally realized that my diarrhea was being caused by the CLA supplement.  I stopped taking it immediately, and was back to normal by the next day.
This product is about triple strength of the Joint Support tabs from Trader Joe's.  But it also includes a large amount of potassium chloride, which can have a big effect on electrolytes and might not be suitable for everyone.  The only reason I can guess that it is there is a non-mainstream and unproved hypothesis that rheumatoid arthritis is worsened by low potassium, but that doesn't mean potassium supplement will help the arthritis (maybe the arthritis is causing the potassium deficiency).  And what about those who are interested in this type of supplement because of other types of arthritis, should they be getting this excess potassium?  The front of the label says nothing about the potassium content.  What if someone already using a salt substitute (potassium chloride) takes this as well?Regarding the other ingredients, for me they work well for my arthritis (not rheumatoid).  One time I let a bottle of TJ's Joint Supplement run out, and after a few days, I started getting tiny stabbing pains in my wrist, which went away when I got resupplied.  So I am a big fan of the remaining ingredients, but I am not sure of this formulation.
I've used this and found no significantly-noticeable difference in lightness of my skin.  Initially, I had thought my skin might have been lightening, but it repeatedly turned out to be correlated to unusually cloudy/rainy weather we've had.  It seems each time I went out in the sun, I turn tan/brown just as if I had never taken this product For me, I don't think it made any difference in melanin levels. Considering the price, I don't feel it's worth it.There are interesting scientific articles out there, for example, if you search for "Glutathione Journal of Dermatological Treatment" which, if I might summarize, show glutathione having barely any statistically significant difference (few percent) in skin color or melanin levels as compared to placebo.  Again, it didn't appear to do anything for me.
I am not allergic to Yeast nor do I have sulfite sensitivity, yet there is something in this Jarrow product that caused me to experience very uncomfortable internal & external itchiness.I've taken many different kinds of vitamins & supplements over the years with no side effect equal to the one I experienced with this Jarrow Glutathione product.On day 9, I started experiencing internal & a little external itchiness.  I had no bumps or redness on my skin, yet the itchiness was constant.  I'd never experienced this before & started going over what I'd done to experience this reaction. I ruled out poison ivy because I had not been around it, so then went on to food.  Nothing unusual.  After reading some of the Glutathione reviews, I decided to stop taking the Glutathione.  After 2 days, my symptoms eased up & after 4 days, my symptoms ceased.I have no idea what is in the Glutatione product that caused my itchiness, but I feel that the manufacturer needs to produce more information on this product since multiple people have come up with adverse reactions.
These are large difficult to swallow tablets that are supposed to be taken twice a day with meals. They did not agree with my digestive system. I ordered them because even though I am not diagnosed with blood sugar issues the possibility of developing them are a concern to me.  After trying these tablets I am going to stick with weight control and exercise to hopefully keep healthy blood sugar levels.
These may work really well but I had two problems with them; they are big pills and you are supposed to take 4 of them per day; secondly they gave me indigestion. After a couple of days of trying to see if I would notice beneficial effects, not sure I ever did, I stopped taking them and felt better.
This product did not agree w/ me at all!It gave me a sour/upset stomach and gave me loose stools as well.I won't be taking any of this product again.I cannot recommend this product at all.
It seems to me that supplement manufacturers would realize that most people have no interest in taking a pill that is the size of a USB drive.  While that might be exaggerating slightly (only SLIGHTLY), my point is that these pills are WAY huge.Add to that the stomach upset (nausea to the point of vomiting, intestinal distress) and I can't really say anything positive about them.  The only changes they brought were negative and there are no underlying health conditions or medications that would facilitate such a reaction.  Think twice before taking these pills - maybe the weight loss comes from being so sick to your stomach that you can't eat?  No thanks.
I was diagnosed a few years back with pre-diabetes and was put on the drug, Metformin. I happened to be the 1 in 20 who could not handle it. My blood sugars would bottom out and I would be sick for days.  So I did the natural things, changed eating habits, lost weight, started taking vitamins, etc. to keep from becoming diabetic. So I was excited to try this Jarrow Glucose Optimizer. However, I immediately had a very similar reaction to this vitamin as when I was taking Metformin. My stomach cramped, blood sugars dipped, and I was nauseated. Unfortunately for me, this is not a good product.
I'm sorry to give a poor rating to Jarrow, whom I generally trust, but we cannot try this because when we opened the bottle it smelled rancid, like a wet rag that sat out and got moldy.
I was disappointed for not seeing USP on the label, because this would give me some sense of knowing what is in each supplement. There are too many products that say they are the greatest since slice bread was invented, but they don't have what is listed on the label. I did a test by soaking one softgel in a glass of water for 30 minutes, and I found that the softgel did not dissolve after 30 minutes. I would not recommend this product.
I'd like to write a good review for these vitamins, but the truth is I noticed an increase in headaches once I started taking them. Once I stopped, no more headaches!Something doesn't work for me in these vitamins, but your mileage may vary.
Nutrients and herbs can be quite powerful, so before trying this product, I wanted to know more about it. From prior experience I have no doubt that these kinds of nutrients are helpful for joints.The main concern I have with this particular product is that the kind of glucosamine is the hydrochloride form, which was found not effective according to a meta analysis study (as opposed to the sulfate form, cited in wikipedia). The  associated article suggests that that this may be the reason some glucosamine studies get negative results.Additionally, there are some critical details on the box that are excluded from the Amazon description.  As of this writing, the listing excludes the following cautions:This is not a vegetarian or kosher product. The chondroitin is from beef and pork sources; and the glucosamine is from shellfish, which could be a problem for those with shellfish allergies. (These are the usual sources for these nutrients.)  Sources of other components are not given.  In particular, the maltodextrin (no source given) may or may not be safe for those who must avoid gluten.The tech-y sounding "Uniflex" consists of two antioxidant herbs and maltodextrin: Scutellaria baicalensis root and Acacia catechu bark. I found nothing on the web about any of these components being useful for arthritis, though both herbs have a history of use in China and India for other purposes.And there's 800IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which may be useful, or may be more than you want, especially if you are taking this vitamin already. Recommended dosage is 4 pills a day for two weeks, then a maintenance dose of 2 pills a day.Some other effectiveness info from the web: There are preliminary studies as to the effectiveness of the MSM, which is found naturally in the body and is related to DMSO. And hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan - the "joint fluid") occurs throughout the body and makes joint fluid thicker and more protective, and has been used to treat joints by injection. A animal study shows that supplementation does seem to help, but the amounts in this product are much lower than is used in other experiments. Also the source is not specified, and apparently some sources provide a low quality product.My old dog, who is not subject to the placebo effect, has had good results with these kinds of nutrients, as have I. What about this particular product?  The level of glucosamine & MSM is much greater than the chondroitin so the balance of these components is different than in other supplements I have tried, which might be better or might be worse. But what is the rationale for including ingredients that have no documented effect on joints, and a possibly ineffective form of glucosamine?  I find this very problematical.
>> Nov. 29 Update: &lt;&lt;I wrote the review below after using the clipper once. Sadly, the second time around was not as good.The clipper stopped clipping after a few minutes of use. I cleaned it thoroughly and I restarted and it worked for a few more minutes. Another cleaning followed and... so on. It was a time consuming process.Then, as I was taking a shower, I heard a strange buzzing sound. It turns out it was the clipper that decided to turn itself on, inside a drawer. The on/off switch could not stop it but some vigorous shaking did. A few minutes later, as I was discussing the incident with my wife, I heard the buzzing again. More shaking pacified the clipper again, I don't know for how long.It appears that, the more one uses this device, the harder it is to use. I would not have bought it, had I known that what I just shared with you was going to happen.>> End of Nov. 29 update &lt;&lt;_____________________________________________I must start with a confession: I used to be a Flowbee man well... until last night. I hate hair-cutting/sculpting/design establishments for several reasons but I won't go into that now. The short of it is that I've been cutting my own hair for the past 15 years or so.I ordered this clipper because Amazon had it on sale and I thought I'd give it a try. Somewhat to my surprise, I like it and I will use it to cut my hair. I will also use it to cut my boys' hair because they hate the 'professional' jobs too.This is sold as a 'short cut' device but, as someone famous used to say, it all depends on what the meaning of 'short' is. The manual suggests that the 'longest' setting is at 1/2 inch but, in practice, you can easily do 1-inch and even longer haircuts.The operation is easy: after you charge the device, you turn it on and you begin 'combing' your hair with it. My wife started it but, after a few minutes, I became confident enough to do it myself with her watching and cheerleading me. I works fast but you may have to take it apart and clean it if your hair is too long to begin with. I had to do that. The end-result is something that could easily pass for a $20 salon job.Technical details:- The blade's shape approximates the curvature of the skull, making for a more even cut.- Rechargeable - needs no batteries for its lifetime.- The blade guard can be removed for cleaning.- Can be cleaned with water or a brush.- Comes with 2 combs, one of them allowing for a 'near-bold' length while protecting the skin.My big issue with this device is that you get:- the clipper itself- the regular comb- the bold-cut comb- the brush- the 1/8 ounce oil bottle- the charge adapterIt adds up to SIX discrete, small or very small (the brush, the oil bottle) and easy to misplace items and there is no storage box or bag included. I would have gladly paid a few more dollars if such a necessary convenience was added. Since this is not the case, I am taking away 1 star from what should have been an easy 5-star evaluation.
The tag-line for these clippers is "You can't mess this up!" Well, this company must think I'm pretty darn stupid. Because this really did not work well AT ALL.When the clippers arrived, I plugged it in and charged it up. It looks just like the picture in the product listing, kind of a cross between clippers and a hair brush. It fits easily in your hand and seems like a much less awkward way of using clippers. As anyone who's used traditional clippers can tell you, they can be a pain to use on yourself, as you have to contort yourself in order to run them along the sides and back of your head.When I actually used them though, my goodness! Awful! They didn't cut evenly, as the curved shape of the clippers don't accommodate the less-curved parts of your head, particularly the sides near the ear and the back of your head, where it's harder to see exactly what's going on. For these to work, your head would have to be a perfect sphere!My wife absolutely cracked up when she saw how poorly this haircut turned out. After about ten minutes of amusement, though, it got just plain frustrating. We pulled out the traditional clippers and finished the job up in a few minutes.Overall, these are the second worst clippers I've ever used. (The worst ones caught fire while I was using them. To Remington's credit, the Short Cut Clipper did NOT catch fire.)I've used a number of clippers and hair grooming products over the years and have found a wide range of quality. These are very far on the low end. A great idea in theory, they simply do not live up to their promise. "You can't mess this up" indeed.
As the title says, it's a fantastic idea.  For those of us who prefer to buzz our hair short, this is a very handy item.  Except that it doesn't work after a while.  It works great in the beginning, making the often-time consuming process of evenly buzzing down your hair a fairly simple one because it's curved.  Does it fit my head perfectly?  No, but because it's curved I could rock it back and forth.  It's a lot easier than trying to get a little 1" blade to hit all the high spots.Unfortunately, far less than a year after getting it, it has decided it no longer wants to work consistently or reliably.  Sometimes it runs just fine while other times it will run for a minute and then just cut out.  I've charged it thinking it was the battery only to find that it still behaves this way.  Bang it on the counter and it runs.  And then it doesn't.  So it appears the problem is mechanical, or physical, in some way.Well, tonight was IT for me - midway through a trim it stopped.  I couldn't get it running.  I dropped it straight into the garbage.  Not only won't I buy another one of these, I won't buy any other Remington products - why should I if this is an indication of the product quality?
If you take this and get a stomach ache, you are not alone.I took with my two largest meals, and about 1 hour after finishing my meals, I got a gripping stomach ache.  I tried 2 days in a row with the same result.It would be nice if the instructions indicated that this was a possible side effect and why.
The bottle is sealed, so you are the first one to open it. A giant piece of cotton covers the pills. A "harmless absorbent" with a "do not eat" warning sits among the pills.The tablets are GIANTS. There is no warning of this either on the outside packaging or the bottle. For the many people who have issues with giant pills, this is a deal killer. All pill bottles should include a picture of the actual size on the packaging material, so people who are not comfortable with giant pills can avoid them. This pill is around 2cm wide, over 0.75cm deep, and over 0.5cm tall. This is not a softgel.There is an expiration date on both the outside packaging and on the bottle.
The bottle arrived broken. It's glass and was poorly packed. Maybe a better review on the next round.
Occasionally, I have trouble sleeping. Not enough to want prescription sedatives - but sometimes I need something to help me settle down and sleep through the night. Dream Water has been effective for me in the past, but you have to drink a shot of it. It's not terrible tasting, but it isn't great. I hate the aftertaste of the artificial sweetener they use. A tablet seems like it would be better, so I tried Good Sense Sleep Aid Doxylamine Succinate tablets, 25mg.The pill is small and easy to swallow but I don't think it has helped me sleep much at all. I didn't fall asleep for at least ninety minutes after taking it and then I woke frequently through the night. This pill is supposed to be similar to Unisom, but I've never taken that medication either, so I really can't compare the effectiveness. For now, I'll continue to use Dream Water when I can't sleep.
BPI Pump-HD Lemonade Diet Supplement, Blue Ice - 30 servings, 11.64oz BPI not only has a horrible taste, it made me sick. Not worth the $27 from my experience.
The sales page on Amazon offers a photo of the list of ingredients, and it's full of good electrolytes and energy boosters.  However, the photo does not show you the list of 'Other Ingredients' which include artificial flavors, blue dye #1, and, my all-time 'stay away from it' sweetner, sucroalose.  I have to wonder why the manufacturer would go to the trouble of including so many good ingredients and then foul it with chemicals that are not good for the body.I wish I'd been able to see the 'other ingredients' on the sales page.  I'd have avoided this product before ordering.
I received this BPI Pump-HD Ultimate Pre-Workout Formula through the Amazon Vine Review program.  I only tried it one time.  I mixed a half scoop with cold water, and took it immediately after a light breakfast.  My heart started racing and I felt very nauseated.I am extra sensitive to caffeine, so your results may be different than mine.  Based on my one-time experience though, I will not try this again.
Holy hell, this stuff is dangerous!  Had a very bad reaction combining this with another BPI product, &#34;B4.&#34;  Nausea, disorientation, heartrate through the ceiling, felt awful for days.  Scary stuff.  Plus it is BLUE and doesn't want to dissolve.  I mixed some up on a Friday, was unable to get to my workout, then drank it on Monday and there were still undissolved crunchy chunks in there after 4 days.  Got a little powder in a cut on my finger and the cut was a bright electric blue even after washing repeatedly.  Lots of weird herbal extracts that probably should not be used together . . . along with artificial sweetener and color.  Very DIRTY product that makes me feel ill.  Will give your liver and kidneys a good workout detoxifying your system from this crap.  On the plus side, I felt a lot of energy and zero pain from pushing myself hard through the workout.  Does what it says it will, but at far too harsh a price.  Blue poison drink makes me feel awful.  Cannot recommend this product.
First of all SPF 4 is not enough to help anyone.Second of all, this stick is very, very moist once applied.  It feels like grease on the lips and I couldn't stand it for more than a few minutes.  I wear lipstick all the time, and lip gloss, too (even the thick and sticky stuff) but this was just too slidey.I generally like Nivea products but this is not a repeat item for me.  I recommend lip protection that gets absorbed, like the creamy Blistex, or if you have the funds, Laura Mercier Lip Silk.
I believe that I like most people don't really have an operational emergency plan.  I thought at 355 pieces this was First Aid Kit was a bargain (as of a few weeks ago, I believe the price had lowered to $54.99 or near that).  Now it has been lowered again to $31.99, which in my opinion is still pricey for what is included.  This is something for a camping trip with your Boy Scout Troop not for what many of us envision as a "Emergency".Contents Include:20 Antiseptic Wipes20 Alcohol Pads6 Antibiotic Packets6 Burn Ointment Packets10 Cotton Tip Applicators258 Bandages (in 6 sizes)1 1/2 Tape4 3"x3" Gauze1 Abdominal Compress3 Acetaminophen Packets (with 2 per pack)3 Aspirin Packets (with 2 per pack)3 Antacid Packets (with 2 per pack)2 pr. Latex Medical Exam Gloves (what about a patient, who is allergic to latex??)1 Cold Pack10 Finger Splints5 Disposable Thermometers1 Plastic Tweezer (which looks like it won't be of much use)1 First Aid GuideBut wait!  There's more, the Flimsy Plastic Case!Impressed?  I'm not.I find it quite implausible to expect that you could have up to 50 people provided cared for in an emergency, in fact, this would be of use in a small church, small office or private school, only if those individuals were experiencing large numbers of paper cuts.  Logic would suggest you would want more than 20 antiseptic wipes or 20 alcohol pads and wouldn't include at least 40 cotton applicators?  Or at least 12 rather than 10, since that is the combined number of burn ointment packs and antibotic packs included?  Why provide 5 disposable thermometers, make the thermometers more useful by including the plastic slip covers which would make each reusable (you could decrease some of the cheapo bandages? Or instead, place one thermometer that you use on the head since if you have an unconscious person, the thermometer may not stay in the mouth! This is a waste of a thermometer particularly if there is a flu virus or food poisoning and you may need to evaluate more than 5 people?  What happened to up to 50 as stated?  This is basically a glorified band-aids box. One thing they teach you in marketing books and college courses, if you oversell or overstate your product's performance, you anger the buyer and word gets out causing you to lose future potential sales.  Based on the reviews posted, this proves that theory.Essentially, you are paying for a carrying case for Band-Aids and a few other minor interventions.  By visiting a dollar store, you could make something similar on your own for $20. (reusable thermometers are even a dollar!), so you are paying primarily for a box with various size storage holes.  Additionally, with the Exception of the Ointments and the Pills made in the U.S. all other items are made in China.*I was provided this Kit in exchange for my Honest Review.*
You can definitely do better than this for the price.  I am a prepare for the worst, hope for the best, type of mom/wife.  I got this as a vine product to review.  My first complaint, the case itself is cheaply made and won't last long, or make it through any tough situation.  While 355 items sounds impressive, don't be fooled.  About 200 of those are bandaids (little ones at that), small alcohol wipes, aspirin and antibiotic.  I'd recommend foregoing this and putting your own together; an assortment of bandaids, larger than these, for the most part; a couple tubes of neosporin and maybe one of lidocane, burn cream, anti itch cream, etc., and a couple packs of wrap type bindings for sprains, etc., a quality pain reliever and some alcohol wipes and iodine or betadine wipes.  I'd also purchase quik clot, a product that another reviewer recommended, several packages to keep on hand for more serious injuries.  The tweezers are plastic and won't be of much, if any use.  Get a good metal tweezer instead, along with a couple pair of scissors (small), gauze, paper tape and the like.
I can't believe that this would meet OSHA requirements for a first aid kit. 253 of the 355 pieces are bandaids. Now throw in some pills, a pair of gloves, and you don't have much left. Yes. It has a disposable thermometer, because last time I had a medical emergency, I urgently needed to take someone's temperature. Try throwing in a CPR face guard, some clotting materials, a Save-A-Tooth, emergency space blanket. Make this a truly useable kit. There is some extra space, you could fit all of these items in the kit easily.
Edited to add:  I kind of chuckled when I saw this review has already accrued some "thumbs down".I'm really not that worried about being the world's most popular reviewer, I do the best that I can, and I strive to give an honest opinion when I test and review an item.I don't benefit one way or another if you want to buy this first aid kit or a different one, I just felt that people would be wasting their money if they bought this one. I have been trained as a combat medic and as an EMT, so I do have some experience in first aid. I didn't have a lot of spare time before I wrote this review to search for kits that I would recommend instead of this one, but here is a slightly better one that I found this evening for a couple of dollars less. Keep in mind that a kit labeled as meeting Federal OSHA Regulation 1910.151b is considered the bare minimum, it's not exactly a seal of recommendation like the Good House Keeping Seal.Anyway, for your considerationFirst Aid Kit With Hard Case- 326 pcs- First Aid Complete Care Kit - Exceeds OSHA & ANSI Guidelines - Ideal for the Workplace - Disaster Preparedness (Colors May Vary)That one has some of the items that I felt should have been included in this one, and it actually has scissors, metal tweezers, 10 Antacid Tablets, 10 Aspirin Tablets, 10 Non-aspirin Tablets and 2 Eye Pads. Eye wash is not included with that one, but it has quite a few things that this kit doesn't__________________________________________________________________Does not have some of the items pictured, no acetaminophen, no antacid, no aspirin, and no disposable thermometers. The first aid instructions are almost worse than worthless, I re-certified for my CPR card a couple of months ago, and the CPR information on their first aid instructions are totally incorrect! You would be better off throwing away the tweezers and using the ones from the game "Operation" instead. The case is not very sturdy, and you might need one of the bandages if you catch your finger on one of the sharp edges of the case. The case is not big enough to add any of the items it is missing, and truthfully, I would feel embarrassed to offer this to my workplace as the "official" First Aid Kit. The two pairs of enclosed gloves are latex, but at least the bandages are labeled as latex free. Has one of the most pitiful cold packs I have ever seen, I actually got a better cold pack in the Hello Kitty First Aid Kit that I bought for home as a bit of a personal joke, as I have been a Hello Kitty fan and occasional collector for years.Hello Kitty All Purpose Children's First Aid Kit. If you belong to a warehouse club, you should be able to find a better kit for less money. A quick internet search showed that Sam's club has a much better first aid kit for approx $20.NOT RECOMMENDED, don't waste your money on this.
This is my second Crane.  My first was the Peguin style.  I really liked it and had it for years.  I lost the plug to the tank and they don't make the same style plug anymore.  So I bought this unit especially because of it's pleasant looks.I don't give it 5 stars because I wish it forced the mist higher into the air.Update: 1/5/2010 Revised to one star.  Felt the humidifier could be faulty since it took about 3 to 4 or more days to use up a tank.  Still had some dry throat issues.  Saw a Walgreen's brand humidifier working at their store really putting out the mist high into the air and silently at that, so I bought one luckily on sale.  First night it used up the entire gallon tank and my dry throat was gone.  I no longer recommend the Crane.
We were so happy with this product until we woke up and it wasn't working. We tried everything and unfortunately, after less than a week it just wouldn't turn on.It has a small back light sort of nightlight on in the unit. It does not have a button to shut off. The cool mist will last all day on the low to middle setting and we leave it on for the dogs during the day. At night we kick it up to high in our bedroom and it lasts through the night. Until it stopped working.
I have been hunting for a humidifier for my bedroom for the last month with no luck. I thought the rave reviews on this were enticing and decided to purchase it. 4 days into owning it...I can't deal with it anymore! This is, BY FAR, the messiest humidifier I have ever owned.Filling this thing is a STRUGGLE. Especially if you are trying to fill it up with a big jug of distilled water. It's like juggling a giant slippery watermelon. This thing is just a mess!Getting the cap on this thing has also been a HUGE issue. It doesn't seem to want to twist on easily. It puts up a fight! This is especially cumbersome when the tank is filled with water.Another downside to this is that the mist actually falls right to my floor. It doesn't disperse into the air like I want it to. I can actually see it just floating straight down to my floor. Not good!!Also, biggest deal breaker for me is that when I pull the top off of this to refill it, water actually POURS out of it onto my surrounding area. This thing is just a big, wet, soggy mess!!!!!! I am returning it ASAP! I already shelled out and bought a Sharper Image humidifier that is AMAZING. Works like a dream. Super quiet and easy to fill and clean. WAY better then this nightmare from beyond. NEVER AGAIN!!!! BUYER BEWARE!! If you don't want to deal with a watery mess...don't buy this!!!
Every few years, I am tempted to give electric razors another try.  I keep thinking the technology will somehow improve to make shaving with an electric razor easier, quicker, and more comparable in closeness and comfort to shaving with a razor.  Well, this was my latest attempt.  Verdict: NOPE!  Even with 3 heads, it takes FOREVER to get all the little hairs off your face.  By the time you get them, you could have shaven your face 3 times with a regular razor.  All of the round-and-round motion irritates your face, and the shave is not nearly as close as a traditional razor.  So why use an electric razor?  Good question.  I have not figured out why people use them, but I won't be trying another one for a few more years.
ok.i have used two electric razors in my life (real razors, and not just a beard trimmer device)this was horrible.i actually read the info included inside, followed guidance and began.boy - did it hurt.it kinda pulled some hair, and just burned up other ones.found myself having to go over and over and over the same spots and it STILL didnt get it close. and just gave me a rash and realy irritated my skin.
We were hoping this would be a good inexpensive shaver but in the end, it was not; it is just downright painful to use.  This shaver seems to abrade the skin more than other shavers.  It also seems to tug on whiskers more than other electric shavers.  Maybe the blades aren't as sharp or maybe they are poorly designed.  In addition to being painful, it shaves very unevenly.If you want an electric shaver, look elsewhere.
These 2 models are ALMOST identical in their specs, the R-7130 lists 1 additional feature of teflon coating, but the difference is far more than thar!I got the R-7130 for my older son about a year ago, no problems, does a great job, he is still happy with it. Then my younger son needed an electric shaver/razor so I thought this one would be of similar quality, minus the teflon coating..................boy was I ever WRONG!It seems every  time he goes to use it the top pops off & everything flies everywhere. At first I thought maybe it just wasn't fastened securely but after reattaching it, and starting to use it again, "POP" goes the shaver,........all over again! I don't know why, maybe it's just this one but based on my experience, I would spend a few more dollars & buy the next model up, the Remington R-7130 Flex!
The most important thing: it doesn't shave well. I ran this for a minute on a patch on my face and there was still stubble. Unacceptable.So what if it's cheap? Do you really save money if it doesn't do what it it's supposed to do?I feel bad for people who choose this as their first electric shaver because then they will think all electric shavers are bad.Any Braun or Panasonic will outperform this.
I use my hands a lot for woodworking, yard work, working on mechanical stuff like cars, lawn mowers and similar. Because of that, I get a lot of small cuts and generally use a bandage with neosporin to prevent any kind of infection. I've had slivers that I could not get out so it is really important to put an antiseptic (like neosporin) and a bandage.Right now I have a cut on my thumb similar to a paper cut and it is a little painful and difficult to get healed because I'm washing my hands all the time and that causes the wound to dry up and stay open. So I've been trying lots of different bandages and just tried one of these Nexcare Waterproof clear bandages. I have to wonder if those that designed these bandages and the packaging actually ever tested them on someone with a bleeding wound or cut. First problem was getting the bandage out of the envelope. Nexcare put a tiny split at the end of the envelope but not enough to get a grip on to pull open the envelope. Bandaid used to have the same type of opening but with a significantly larger split that you could grip to pull open the envelope but now Bandaid doesn't even have that and what Nexcare has is not of any use to open the bandage envelope. I cannot believe that someone actually put "Easy one hand application" on the box. I'm not handicapped nor do I suffer from any maladies that render my hands immobile or otherwise but there is absolutely no way to be able to open and apply one of these Nexcare bandages with one hand unless you are perhaps a magician.Finally on the 3rd or 4th bandage I managed to get one out of the envelope without messing up the bandage. Now comes another problem, there is a paper strip around the edge of the bandage that you also must get off without messing up the bandage itself! Finally after another 2-3 tries and throwing the damaged bandages away, I managed to get one intact with the paper strip removed and put it on my finger. It didn't stick very well and basically peeled itself off of my finger. The adhesive is very weak and would definitely not stand up to use or movement or working with your hands.Two thirds of the bandages in the package have such tiny pads that they are of no value at all.Overall, these bandages are totally useless for any cuts or wounds on your hands although they may work on other areas that is not what I needed them for the most.
I was disapointed with this protein drink.It was like drinking sugar cool-aid, and I didn't findit satisfied me.I think it sets you up to eat more surgar.Very disapointing.
Given the proven health benefits of whey, I had high hopes for this product, despite the paucity of details about the product itself. I even checked their web site for additional material, hoping to find good news, but instead found only marketing hype and scientific data about whey in general. Not a good sign.As soon as I read the ingredient list, I knew I would never willingly ingest this stuff. While there may indeed be whey in it, the source and quality of that whey is not completely clear. That alone would not be enough to make me write it off completely, but the rest of the ingredients certainly were. There are two different kinds of sweetener, sucralose and acesulfame potassium, both of them artificial and of questionable safety. There is also sunflower oil, which has a questionable percentage of omega-6, artificial flavor and color (red #40), and oligofructose, also known as FOS.FOS is considered by some to be a healthy item, but many people have digestive problems with it.Whey is indeed a good food when properly produced from high quality milk from healthy cows, but the "factory milk" which fills most of our store shelves hardly qualifies. The historical health information cited is true, but can only apply to this product in a vaguely abstract manner.I cannot speak to the taste or convenience, as I avoid these kinds of artificial ingredients as much as possible. This is not something I would use.If you are comfortable with the kinds of artificial ingredients noted above, then by all means go for this stuff. It seems handy and at least makes some effort at having some ingredients that might have some small health benefit.
HEADACHEs!!  That is what I got every time I took this supplement once a day.  I tried it at night and had a headache all noc, keeping me awake.  Two days later, I tried it in the morning and got a headache less than an hour later.  Then I tried it with a full stomach and the headache was marginal but.... on the 5th try(on a full stomach), I had a headache all night, 20 hours after taking it, and woke up with it really pounding.  If they had stated what ALL the herbs in it really were, I would have known that gingsing, licorice root, ginkgo biloba, and several other herbs cause my head to hurt.  I can not seriously recommend this herbal cocktail.  I am throwing out all my remaining pills.  Good luck if you decide to try it too.  Information is power and that is all I needed to know not to order this supplement.
I am an allergy sufferer year round so I had high hopes of this helping my sinuses.  Unfortunately it didn't do anything to help my special combination of being allergic to everything and it gave me weird headaches whenever I took it.  I don't take a daily allergy pill because they're mostly ineffective and unsurprisingly I will add this to the pile of stuff that doesn't work.  I also found that when taking these my urine turned green which alarms me a little bit.  I took this supplement for two weeks and didn't get any results that were positive.  I also find the picture on the front of the box pretty off-putting and will be looking for a different product in the future.
