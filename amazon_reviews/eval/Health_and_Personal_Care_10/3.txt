I'm surprised to see so many 5 star reviews for this light. A flashights main purpose is to output light. This flashlight does not do that. I own 5 of these that I got over the years but have been one over by the LED lights that throw out tons more light and last much longer on batteries. While this is very well buily and a nice looking light what it lacks in candlepower makes this just an OK light. If you are comparing it to the cheap plastic flashlights then yes, its a 5 star light but what kind of comparison is that? I know the LED lights costs more but they are coming way down in price and worth the extra money if you want a bright light. I can shine all 5 of mine on new batteries onto the wall and they are stil not as bright as my other LED lights, even the cheap ones. I am not talking about the weak run of the mill LED's but the luxeon or cree models. One of those are brighter than all 5 of my maglights put together.
I purchased a new iMac at the of April, and needed to replace my mouse batteries after 5 weeks.  So, someone recommended getting Lithium batteries which I did--and they only lasted 11 weeks!  :(  For the price I paid, it's definitely not worth it.  I'll go back to my AA batteries purchased from C*stc*.
This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things, but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles, so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle,) and for spice bottles, and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned "baby bottle" brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles, glasses, etc, and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!
I used Braun razors for years. I used to think they were the best, but I got tired of their shoddy cleaning bases and pricey solutions. I've since switched to the Norelco 3d and that razor is no joke. Best save ever, by a mile. And their cleaning solution is easier to find locally than Braun's and costs less too.
I LOVE my electric razor... I have a fairly thick beard and dark hair, this is the first electric razor I've ever owned that I could use everyday.  I used to have to blade shave about every other day to look halfway clean shaven.  The self-cleaning function of the razor is one of those things that I just kind of felt like ok...  it's there, but had absolutely no influence on my decision to purchase.  That said... this stuff is just too expensive.  If you use the self cleaning function all the time you are looking at probably $50 to $60 a year just to clean your razor.  I wish, as others who have reviewed this, that they would package up the fluid and let you just refill the plastic cartridges.  It's probably the only negative I see with this razor after a couple years of use.  I will say though that it does do the job nicely.  I've run out of liquid and used the razor for a few days without cleaning and I could feel a difference.  Hence the title of my review, it's the price that prompted me to give 3 stars, not the performance.  It does it's job nicely.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.
I have a feeling that most of the makers of these blades are ripping us off because they do not stay sharp for long. I really hate shaving every other day, but I cannot use that stuff that you spread on and wipe off. Tried it years ago and it smelled and did not work for my soft skin. Also, I cannot use electric shavers because of same reason. I wish I could grow beards like some men.
Received this powerbar and tried it along with my preteen daughter. After her first bite she exclaimed that it tasted like her vitamins. I had to agree with her that it actually did. It also has a funny after taste which if you can stand might make this a good an nutritious meal. I did give my husband a bit to try and he seemed to enjoy it. It does seem to have enough vitamins but has a little too much sodium for my taste. I would have loved to give it a 5 star rating but a 3 will have to suffice.
It wasn't too bad, but was just too sweet for my wife's taste (I ended up not being able to try it, because it turned out to not be gluten free - which I need).
This is basically a hunk of quick carbs with some electrolytes and other additives.  It WAS tasty, but does it really do anyting more for you than an ordinary candy-bar? I'm not convinced on that one.
Well, this bar tastes decent and has lots of nutrients added, but I found it more sugary than I'd like.  I really prefer more natural bars... Luna & Odwalla have healthier bars and I personally like extra-healthy ones like Raw Revolution - getting energy from raw whole foods is better than getting it from a sugar burst.  So this PowerBar is fine if you don't mind getting the high amount of sugar-based carbs.  Anyone sensitive to dairy should be aware this has a small amount of milk component in it.  I give this 3 stars for being a bit better than average but not up to par with what I personally look for in an energy/nutrition bar.
I had one of these not before a fitness workout but before hanging a chandelier. This was a workout, requiring me to go up and down a ladder numerous times and to run back and forth to and from a garage to turn the circuit breaker off and on, and I definitely felt a boost from the PowerBar. I wasn't crazy about the flavor I tried, however -- "Berry Blast" -- and I was disappointed that the texture was kind of like taffy; I expected something closer to a granola bar. The PowerBar was my lunch (210 calories, 3.5 grams of fat). It filled me up for a few hours, and I'm a big guy. I'll try the "Creamy Citrus" sometime and see if I like it better than "Berry Blast." Based on my onetime experience I'd say PowerBar is definitely worth a try for someone who is looking for a substantial snack-plus-energy-boost before a workout of some kind. I sometimes drink a Carnation Instant Breakfast for the same purpose (220 calories and 0 grams of fat with fat free milk for the French Vanilla CIB), and I felt fuller and got more energy from the PowerBar (but I would still prefer the taste of CIB to PowerBar "Berry Blast").
This product tastes great at first but after chewing for a few moments it becomes quite boring especially the part that sticks to all of your mouth.  The flavor was just super; howevere, most of the other features caused the taste to get on your nerves.  Additionally, I noticed no power associated with the bar.  Bottom line for me is I would not buy the bar unless I was in a serious need for power or chewy chewy chewy...  Put another way, I am glad I only tried one of these.  Maybe different flavors would make it better but that is speculative.
I expected this to have a sweet, smooth taste, like the fruit blend drink. Instead I found a sharp, not quite unpleasant aftertaste as the dominating flavor.  This was not something I would choose. The flavor wasn't very good, the texture was a little too grainy, and the aftertaste just bordering on bad.  For people who crave smoothies, this is no substitute.
I don't typically like PowerBars and I can't say that I'd want to eat one of these new PowerBar Energize Berry Blast Fruit Smoothie flavors very often. However, it's certainly better than the originals and the fruit flavor comes through quite nicely. If I needed a quick pick me up or something to fill me up one of these would do if I couldn't get a Clif Bar.
Me, I'm generally a big fan of PowerBars.  I don't look at them as "power bars," but rather snacks that are agreeable, tasty, convenient, portable, and nutritious.PowerBar's Fruit Smoothie ("Berry Blast" flavor) is almost there, with a few big caveats.I shared my PowerBar with 4 others, teens and adults.  All found the flavor better than expected.  One noted that it had a "fruity gum" flavor.  I had a similar reaction; it wasn't unpleasant.  All gave it a thumbs up for flavor.The consistency was soft in 80 degree heat, like soft taffy.  When placed on a plate, it stuck to the plate and you had to literally peel it off.  There was a sticky residue left on your fingers and on the inside of the packaging.  This didn't make it the cleanest snack.There were the 24g of sugar in one serving.  I thought this made it too sweet.My biggest complaint was the lack of dietary fiber in this "fruit smoothie" (less than 1 gram; PowerBar's Harvest Bars have 5g).  The illusion is a package of real fruit.  Well, real fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fibers, essential nutrients.  The fiber tossed out in the manufacturing process here probably ended up as livestock feed, which is ironic when you think about it.So for the consumers who have the illusion that they are 'eating" a real fruit smoothie,  this bar is, obviously, something else.  Just remember, the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie isn't going to replace a banana and a Clementine orange in your diet.FOLLOW-UP:  Two years later, with a much more strenuous workout regime (participated in Wasatch Back RAGNAR relay last month, 29 hours, 189 miles), the thing I like about this bar is that it is easy on the stomach as a recovery bar.  It's not a candy bar or, if you use it as one, it's an expensive piece.  I use it AFTER a run or strenuous workout (defined as a run of at least 5 miles, 8.5 minute miles or better, or a full hour of core workouts).  I like the tanginess.Just throw some in your gym bag.  You're good to go!
Power bars in general are very soft and chewy. They're not my favorite, but they are not bad. This one has a strong fruity flavor, similiar to taffy. The "vitamin flavor" is noticeable, but not horrendously strong. This is a good choice for an occasional snack on the go. Power bars keep well in the car and if they get too mushy due to heat, they recover well when cool again.
(I'd actually give it two and a half stars if I could) I'm always up for trying a new protein/energy bar, so I have a lot of experience with them. PowerBar regular is not the top of my list, but I don't dislike them. So I thought this would be interesting."Interesting" is a good word. Nutritionally it seems pretty sound (though not the best) 10 vitamins plus amino acids. 210 calories, 24g carbs, 6g protein. Flavor-wise it's ok. It's fruity and a bit tart. This makes sense since it has strawberries and cranberries in it as well as four fruit juices. The consistency was a bit on the grainy side.Think: Laffy Taffy or Airheads taffy (+ vitamins and protein) dropped in the sand.
This product served me well for about 9 months and then I dropped it on the bathroom floor.  It still works but is very, very loud.  For something people will use in the bathroom it is too fragile.  If you buy it I would consider it a disposible item.  As others pointed out it really does the job well trimming nose and ear hair.  You really can rinse it under water without it breaking.  Just don't drop it.
The Panasonic ER411NC groomer will give you a very clean trim in a short amount of time, but at the occasional cost of comfort.Its greatest strength is the motor power, which will quickly take care of the most bristly of hairs.  Unfortunately, this power causes the unit to vibrate in a way that seems tickly at best and painful at worst.  After using an older Wahl for years, I had a lengthy adjustment period.  Many mornings I still come away with involuntary tears streaming down my face afterward - ah, the price of vanity.I've found a couple of tips to minimize this discomfort:1.  Wet the blades down before using the groomer.  This seems to minimize the occasional tugs that really cause the pain.2.  Keep up with your grooming regularly.  The ER411NC really penalizes you for letting things get out of hand.  The best defense against discomfort is to use it regularly enough to keep hairs short to begin with.All in all, it's been a worthwhile investment and it does the job, although it isn't recommended for those with sensitive skin or a touchy tear reflex.
I was totally satasfied with this item.  Simple, straight forward and easy to use.  I didnt have any of the "pulling" problems other reviewers had either.  Just a bit of a tickle while it was trimming.I used this about once a week, just to keep everyting under control, for about 4-5 weeks.  Then it just stopped working, wont work no matter what I do.  And yes, I did try new battereies.For the price this is a great item, if it would have lasted more than 4-5 uses.  I think I will buy a nicer one next time and hope it lasts a little longer.
Did not work on freshly spilled coffee, despite coffee being featured as removable. It did however work on a variety of other types of stains including older stains, such as some food stains and oil stains. Products like this are always hit and miss in my experience.  It's much better than nothing.
I have used this on dog urine , and little stains from people eating in my living room, and dropping food on my carpet.I have also used for the same little stains, spray & wash and Oxy clean.I have gotten the same results using all 3, there-fore, I cannot say this would be worth the money!Although I do love my Large Bissell carpet shampooer, and other Bissell shampoo cleaners.I have not used this as a pre-treat before using my large Bissell carpet cleaner.
This replacement head is not the original size. It is quite a bit smaller.  That can be good for getting to the back teeth.  No issue on that factor.  But the plastic cover is very tight, and since I live with cats, I want my toothbrush head protected. The stem of the brush has some pivot capacity, which I never noticed on previous models. So when I push on the cap, I worry about what I am doing to the pivot part.What ever
Amazon no longer provides the best available price on the market for two replacement toothbrush heads for the Elite series of Sonicare electric toothbrush. A refill makes the toothbrush run like new. But you can get refills much cheaper elsewhere.
The expense really adds up but electric toothbrushes are addictive.
It's tough to evaluate a product like this; since I'm male, I'm at risk for prostate cancer.  However, if I get it, it'll likely not happen for another 30 years or more, so it's hard to tell if taking  a supplement for 30 years will either prevent or not prevent cancer.  We do know that certain ingredients in this product have been correlated with prostate health, so that's a decent start.  However, the people who've avoided cancer and utilized these ingredients have most likely done it through other methods--whole foods, healthy living, and have also avoided cancer through a number of other contributing factors--so it's tough to confidently say that these specific substances will work the same when extracted and ingested in pill form.  Part of me recoils at the idea of "just take this pill and you won't get cancer," but I also think that there's plenty of potential for this product to be helpful.  I'm willing to take this supplement as part of a healthy lifestyle, but I won't be placing all my money on it as a surefire cancer prevention method.
Two weeks ago I didn't have any pre-existing prostate conditions, and after taking Prostate 5lx, I still don't.  Is that because Prostate 5lx is working, or would I be fine either way? There's no way to know.  Life is such a mystery.I did some research before putting these pills in my body and learned that there is no hard evidence that Saw Palmetto has any effect on prostate health.  The largest study, conducted in 2006 with 225 men, found no improvement in prostate health for men taking Saw Palmetto over that of men taking the placebo.  What a pity.I do find it curious that the description on this page claims, "Promotes healthy sexual functioning and performance" while the box says nothing about sex.  At any rate, after two weeks my sex life is pretty much the same (amazing, thanks for asking) and really everything is a-ok, all thanks to Prostate 5lx.  Maybe.
A few years back my husband was diagnosed as having a possible enlarged prostate. Instead of going through a battery of tests he decided to find a natural alternative. Researching the Internet, he found a book by Roger Mason which listed a line of supplements and a diet. For the last couple years he has been on this regimen of supplements and trying to stay on the diet.When I saw this product I hoped this would be an added plus to his supplements because a lot of the ingredients he is already taking. Roger Mason does not recommend Saw Palmetto but I thought it couldn't hurt.  He took this supplement for a few days and discovered that he was getting some false urges. Upon stopping taking the pills the false urges went away.  He gave it a couple weeks more and decided to try it again; again the same results. So now he has stopped taking them.The regimen of supplements that Roger Mason recommends can get very expensive, so this product Prostate 5 LX may be a great alternative to what my husband is taking for younger men without any symptoms.  This could be a first line of defense to keep the prostate healthy.  Compared to prescribed medication, natural supplements take a long time to see any results. So only time will tell if this product or any natural product is working, but at least you would be doing something to keep the prostate healthy.
These pills contain a lot of things that are beneficial in theory, but one should be skeptical of supplements, especially at this price. Quite simply, these pills are priced like a miracle drug, and they're not.
Summary:  Nutritional supplements and anything with a health claim are hard to judge or evaluate, but if you are already taking a saw palmetto supplement, this is a good option.This supplement has several key ingredients which are thought to improve prostate health and reduce inflammation in general.  Saw Palmetto berries have been used in several forms of traditional medicine for  Unfortunately, studies have been inconclusive on whether these improve enlarged prostrates so you will notice they word their claims very carefully with phrases like "most researched", "prostrate health" and "inflammation modulating."How good is Saw Palmetto?  from Wikipedia: "Saw palmetto extract is the most popular herbal preparation taken for benign prostatic hyperplasia, a common condition in older men. Early research indicated that the extract is well-tolerated and suggested "mild to moderate improvement in urinary symptoms and flow measures". Later trials of higher methodological quality indicated no difference from placebo. Questions of adequate blinding and delivery of any active ingredients remain."In English: Early studies showed some benefits.  A more thorough and rigorous study showed no benefit.  People are still debating whether the studies were done correctly."I'm a skeptical optimist.  While no conclusive data exists yet, I'd like to think that this will have some benefits to the plumbing.  After two weeks, I haven't noticed any difference.  Of course, a sample of one is very un-scientific.  Your mileage may vary.  Objects in mirror are larger than they appear.  This tag not to be removed except by consumer under penalty of law.Full disclosure: I received this through the Amazon Vine program.
I've had this for over a year now and am only impressed by how little this item impresses.While the Swiffer Starter Kit is reasonably priced, the cost of the pads as well as the different fomulas of cleaners can rack up pretty fast. It does  an o.k. job, but by no means does it clean all the little nooks and crannies. If you are willing to hunker down and use a stick vac or broom before using the Swiffer, the results will be generally better.Depending on the frequency of use and level of tracked in dirt, you may have to change your disposable pad several times during one cleaning. I have a lot of square footage so under even the best of conditions I have to change the pad a cople of times on the same floor surface. Ditto for the amount of cleaner used. Serious dirt requires more solution and more pads.I'm not crazy about the cleaning solution as it seems kind of sticky when wet and some dirt will remain if the pad is dirty.My preferred cleaning tool is a similar stick/base combo which affixes a micro fiber cleaning pad to the base which has a velcro surface. I wet the pad with clean warm water, squeeze it out, and affix it to the base. I clean in the same way you'd use the Swiffer(applying some pressure to dirty areas) and check the cleaning pad to see if it is dirty. When it is dirty, I either wash and squeeze out the pad or use a clean pad. The floor dries quicker without chemicals or any residue. I toss the dirty microfiber pad(s) in the washing machine when I'm through. This method works better; the floors are spotless and there is no need to buy disposable pads/cleaners.
I'm not a huge fan of the smell of this Swiffer solution that comes with the sweeper, but the sheer convenience of this product keeps me coming back to it.It's just so nice to grab it and start swiffering. It's also a plus not having to dip the thing back and forth in the water and squeeze it out. It's just fast and easy. I know that makes me sound terribly lazy, but I mean, who really likes cleaning? It's a pain.I give this three stars because of convenience and because I do feel like it gets my tile clean (I have very limited tile in my apartment -- it's only in the kitchen and the bathroom). It falls short of the final two stars because, as others have said, the solution doesn't smell very good. I miss the smell of my lavender scented cleaner that I normally mop with. In addition, you do have to use their solution and I believe you have to use their pads too, although I'm sure others would work fine.
After several years of using Swiffer mops I am finally moving on. These are a good "in-between" mop - by that I mean they are better and more convenient than a standard mop, but they're not in the same league as something like a steam mop. I found this out after trying a steam mop - the Eureka Enviro Steamer - last week for the first time. I was amazed at how easy it was to use and how great it cleaned -and- sanitized, which is why I'm finally ditching the Swiffer. Between cleaning solution and disposable cleaning pads, neither of which are necessary for the steam mop, I'm looking at saving between $50 - $100 over the course of a year. Kind of makes me wish I had gone this route sooner, but better late than never. Swiffer is good for what it is, but if you can afford to shell out a little more up front, you will end up saving money in the long run.
I have been using this product for the past year, and have found it a practical, convenient cleaning aid. Yes, it doesn't clean 100%, but does make mopping a whole lot easier than lugging around a bucket and mop. Ideally, I would vacuum first around the edges, before using the wetjet to mop the floors. The solution works on all surfaces, and I recently switched over to the anti-bacterial cleaning solution to disinfect the kitchen floor. I like it as its practical, convenient,light and easy to use. I use each cleaning pad to clean at least three areas before discarding them as the replacement pads are not that cheap. BUT, I would still recommend this product, especially for those who have chronic back problems like I do!
Pros:- Easy to use- Fast results (less than 1 Minute)- Digital display of words makes results unmistakableCons:- The test uses a small button battery. Every time somebody uses this test, another battery ends up in a landfill somewhere in this country :(- Since this runs on a battery, the test results disappear after a couple of days. If you're planning on keeping your pregnancy test as a souvenier, I suggest you take a picture of it.Conclusion:Next time I need a pregnancy test, I'll buy one of the standard non-digital tests again.
Home pregnancy test strips work by detecting elevated pregnancy hormone hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotrophin).  &#34;Accuracy is over 99% accurate when used from the day of your expected period&#34;.  Most experienced moms know the early signs of pregnancy: fatigue, nausea, frequent urination, and breast tenderness, etc.  Nevertheless, it's good to have an accurate home pregnancy test before verification with one's OB.  My gal and I gave this Clearblue Digital pregnancy test a try.Likes:*Fairly easy to use.  Follow the instructions precisely.*Easy to read results/word display.  Not indistinct colors or lines that are difficult to read.*Results are displayed within three minutes with the &#34;Smart Countdown&#34;.Concerns:*Test accuracy is highly dependent upon determining the expected day of the missed period;  the more days before the expected day of period, the less accurate the test.*$25.95 for three tests is not cost effective.  There are many inexpensive yet accurate pregnancy test strips when used properly.*Tests manufactured in PRC.  We're wary of medications and personal healthcare products made abroad.*I wouldn't want to wave the test display around to relatives and friends when the results are inconclusive.Did it work?We got a &#34;false negative&#34; when she tested too early before a missed period.  She tested again near her expected period day and got a &#34;positive&#34; result which was confirmed by our OB.
There isn't too much I can say about this product. It did it's duty and informed us quickly we had nothing to worry about.It's the little things like that which really matter -- the reassurances in stressful times.
Ok, so each work day I've been trying a different protein bar in place of breakfast.  Today's was the Black Cherry Almond by Clif.  It definitely filled me up, but I just wasn't too thrilled by this flavor.The bar was sweet, actually the sweetener tasted a little like honey (even though it wasn't).  But in that sweetness I really didn't get a sense of the cherry flavor that was supposed to be in there.  The other predominant flavor was the almond.  I definitely tasted those.  And they tasted very much like blanched almonds.  I almost hesitate to say it since these are supposed to be healthy bars, but I would have liked them to be salted.  I think it would have improved the flavor greatly.Since I did intend this for breakfast I was pleased to find that it filled me up quite well.  In fact, I had half of it for breakfast and half for a mid-morning snack as I couldn't finish the whole thing in one go of it.  And doing it that way lasted me until lunch.  The bar's pretty large though and packs a walloping 240 calories, and that should tell you right there that it should be a meal replacement.  Or it could be a dietary supplement if you are doing a hard workout.  I wouldn't just eat this bar as a snack due to this calorie count.  As far as the other dietary things; there is a large sugar content in this bar.  22 grams actually.  But there's 10 grams of protein and 5 of dietary fiber.  And there's a very long list of other vitamins that are contained in the bar.The ingredients are good.  At least 70% are organic, which even though its not fully organic, at least they put in a good effort while still keeping the bar a reasonable price.  The sweetness is derived from Brown Rice Syrup, which is also the first ingredient listed, meaning that there is quite a bit in the bar.  It also has soybeans, fiber, millet flaxseed, and other grains in it so that is where the fiber comes from.  And there's almonds of course.  And it claims there are dried cherries in here, but they must have been chopped up very finely as I didn't see them.Not the worst of bars but just merely average when it comes to flavoring.  I wouldn't get this flavor again on my own, but I'd probably eat it if someone offered it to me.Review by M. Reynard 2012
This step counter works really well, but I have knocked it off numerous times, and if I lose the step counter it doesn't do me any good.  The clip is too short to lock over a belt (it locks on top, but not very secure grip on a leather belt) and it also sticks out very far due to the design, so it is easy to knock off.  My son has lost his about 5 times, thankfully we have been able to find it each time.  Also when clipped on the center of mass is too high, so if you clip it inside your pocket it wants to flip out and then fall off.  The overall profile is about an inch thick.So my recommendation is that it is a very good step counter, but I would buy one that stayed in my pocket or clipped on better instead.  Feature wise I like the 7 day memory and the aerobic steps (if you walk fast or run for a period of time it will count them as aerobic).  Very simple use.  Great functional counter, I wish they would fix the form factor and clip.
This pedometer is fun and easy to read.  The instructions on callibrating it are helpful.  There is also a category called 'aerobic steps' which is unclear and not addressed in the literature that comes with it.  It doesn't measure steps reliably--if you get a lot of your activity going up and down steps each day, those steps won't measure.  On the other hand, the first time I had it on and brushed my teeth it added 30 steps!  Perhaps I'm an aerobic brusher....To be fair, I walk with an uneven gait and have never had much success with pedometers.  This pedometer seems to work better than any others I have tried or used previously, but it only gives a fair idea of the number of steps I take in a day.  That's a basis for changing fitness habits, at least.
&#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.Taking six of these large-sized capsules each day provides a good blend of vitamins and minerals for supporting bone health.  Along with calcium and vitamin D3, a six-capsule daily serving provides good robust quantities of vitamin C, vitamin K2, magnesium, zinc, copper, and manganese.  Calcium requires an adequate amount of vitamin D in order to be absorbed by the body.  Women, post-menopausal women in particular, are at a higher risk for osteoporosis, along with people who are older than 40 or 45.  A variety of genetic, dietary, and lifestyle factors also affect a person's bone mass and bone health.  For example, a sedentary lifestyle lacking in exercise, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption can speed up bone loss over time.  And many people are not aware that the photochemical effect of sunlight on the skin is a primary source for vitamin D; your body manufactures vitamin D from cholesterol when your skin is exposed to sunlight.  Bone formation usually peaks in the summer and bone breakdown increases during the winter due to the skin being more exposed to more sunlight during summer and less exposed to less sunlight during winter.  So people who avoid sun exposure to prevent skin cancer may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency, particularly if they are elderly.  There are many ways to get your daily supply of calcium and vitamin D in your daily diet.  Leafy green vegetables, dairy products, fish, nuts and seeds, and various foods are also fortified with calcium and/or vitamin D.The recommended daily serving size of six capsules of this Jarrow Bone-Up can be grouped as three capsules taken twice a day.  But even with taking three large capsules twice a day, I find this multi-capsule dosage to be too unnecessarily fussy.  Unlike the water-soluble vitamin C, both fat-soluble vitamin D3 and vitamin K2 are stored by the body in fat cells.  And calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.  If you normally carry a pill dispenser/organizer tray around with you, or if you already take lots of supplements throughout the day, adding another six pills to your daily routine may not be a big deal.  But for me, I would much rather take a single daily pill/capsule of bone-health supplement.Earlier this year, in February, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended that postmenopausal women refrain from taking supplemental calcium and vitamin D.  After reviewing more than 135 studies, the task force said there was little evidence that these supplements prevent bone fractures in healthy women.  Moreover, several studies have linked calcium supplements to an increased risk of heart attacks and death from cardiovascular disease.  Others have found no effect, depending on the population studied and when calcium supplementation was begun.  So you may want to consult with your doctor before taking any calcium supplements (or before taking any supplements in general).Jarrow advertises that their Bone-Up supplement "starts with the finest source of calcium available: New Zealand or Australian bovine bone hydroxyapatite from chemical-free, range-grazed calves less than two years old (bones from veal calves are never used)."  While I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this claim that free-range New Zealand or Australian calves provide the best source of calcium, this does mean that you should seek another calcium/vitamin-D bone supplement if you want a vegetarian/vegan source of calcium.  Previous studies suggest that calcium from whole food sources may produce more favorable effects in bone health than isolated calcium supplements, even if the calcium is artificially enhanced with vitamin D and magnesium.  So I still prefer to get the bulk of my daily calcium and vitamins by eating fresh vegetables along with dairy and soy sources.  Each 120-capsule bottle provides a 20-day supply of supplements, or about $220/year at the current Amazon pricing.
Taking a certain type of hormone supplement for almost 20 years, I have a bone density problem. The FDA even labeled the supplement I was on with a warning about bone density but the Doctors never told me, had to look it up myself. I also do not get enough calcium in my diet and rely heavily on pick me ups like caffeine drinks and such.This seemed like a good idea but I could not really tell you if I felt the benefits of it. The one thing that was hard is you take six of the pills a day, twice with a meal, and to me they were big. I already take daily medication so remember to take these on top was a tad hard for me. I finished the bottle though and again, can't say if it really worked as I don't feel much different but also have not fallen and hurt myself either which I do a lot.For the price I think you should get at least a month or two of supply, not just a few weeks. I can't say I would buy them to be honest.
I wanted to try this Vitamin for two reasons: The first being that I, along with my bones are getting older and the second being that I don't drink milk or eat enough foods with calcium to help support healthy bones.  While Bone-Up has many ingredients that are necessary for strong and healthy bones I can't take this supplement on a daily basis for several reasons.1.  The suggested daily dose is six capsules divided into two or three doses to be taken with meals.  This is just to many pills to have to take every day.2.  Bone-up contains magnesium.  I already take a supplement with magnesium and if one takes to much magnesium it can causes diarrhea an unwanted side effect.3.  Bone-up contains a form of Vitamin K.  Vitamin K should not be taken with blood thinners as it causes clotting.  Jarrow Formulas does include a note on the label warning patients who take warfarin/Coumadin to consult your practitioner before use.As for the actual pills they are on the large side.  I just placed one beside a Tylenol capsule and they are about double the size of the Tylenol.  When I opened the bottle there is a strange smell but when a few are taken out of the bottle they don't have the smell and no after taste.  They are just a little difficult to swallow.Jarrow Formulas is a great brand that I trust completely.  This is just one supplement that for the reasons listed above I can't take.
As a woman who needs calcium supplements I'm always looking for easy to take and easy to absorb options. The jarrow formula bone up capsules are very large, and one is supposed to take 3 at a time, twice a day! That means this 120 count bottle is only a 20 day supply!In addition to elemental calcium the pills have potassium, so be careful if taking other supplements.The good news is by not using calcium carbonate there are no shell fish in the product, a boon for people with allergies.I find the amount of capsules I have to take plus the size of the capsules a deterrent to taking the Jarrow bone up formula.
I have osteoporosis and my doctor tells me to take 1500 mg of calcium a day in divided doses and increase my exercise.  I've been doing this for 10 years and each bone scan continues to show loss.Now the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force is saying that adding calcium supplements to daily diets does not give added protection against fractures and recommends against daily doses greater than 1 gram and D greater than 400IU.I don't know if Jarrow's formulation is different or more effective than taking the chewable calcium supplements but it has more than twice the recommended D.  Vitamin D toxicity, however, is rare and requires a lot higher dosage than that.I will drop my daily intake back to the 1 gram recommended in this Jarrow formula and hope it works better as I have a bone scan in a month.  I'll add an addendum once I have the results.  Unless I believe this product is superior to the chewables, I won't reorder because I don't want to continue taking six pills a day when I can chew two tasty chocolates instead.
These pills look to be very good ones, but be advised that the serving size is six pills a day. In those six pills, in addition to the expected calcium and magnesium, there is 1000 IU of D3. (I refer you to the complete formulation for everything else.) I've been learning about how vitamin D deficiency can contribute to a host of problems, not the least of which are osteoporosis (my problem) and autoimmune illnesses (DH), so I was glad to see more than the usual 400 IU of vitamin D per serving. (Although, if you are truly deficient in vitamin D, 1000 IU is not a lot.)The capsules themselves are about medium-sized. You are instructed to take them twice a day with meals, preferably in a 3/3 split. If you're having to take a lot of other medications and supplements twice a day with meals also, it's a bit much. I don't know why one couldn't take them 2/2/2. The capsules can be opened up to sprinkle the powder in a smoothie, but I don't think I'd want to add the bovine taste. The calcium hydroxyapatite comes "from free-range Australian/New Zealand calves," and I think that probably means what it sounds like it means.
Made with Australian bovine bone hydroxyapatite from chemical-free, range-grazed calves 12 - 24 months old."inorganic calcium lattice of microcrystalline hydroxyapatite (mcha) within an organic protein milieu rich in naturally occurring growth factors"- what?With vitamin d3, vitamin k2 as mk-7 (a form of vitamin k) and Potassium citrate.6 daily (2 three times a day).It does seem like a fabulously designed pill, although I wonder why the "vitamin k as k2 as mk7" isn't mk4 which when I read up is the preferred supplement.I took for the 20 days - I think I will ask my physician about a pill that will time release that I can take once a day and give me the same or better benefit for the same price (this is a very reasonably priced).
Since my "youth" I have gone from 6'1" to 5'9".  I am now shrunk.  My bone scan shows thinning bones.  These pills do not make you feel different or youthen your skin.  Their action, if any is invisible without x-ray.  The literature on the chemical herein reports good effect.  I believe I shall continue to take them.  Where is the pill to make me six one again???
Jarrow's products are high quality. Their formulas are very good about have all the needed nutrients and cofactors to help absorption. Bone Up is no different. It has every thing you need for strong healthy bones.But I just cannot take 6 pills a day. And at 6 pills a day, this ends up being a pretty expensive supplement. On the days I did remember to take all 6 my tummy thought that was too many. But on the days I didn't remember to take all 6 I wasn't getting a full serving of calcium. This is a great formulation if you are someone who can stick with it. For me, fewer pills will work better.
I like many of Jarrow formulas but this Bone up is one of those I don't like so much, 2 capsules a day, 3 times a day. They are also big 1-inch long capsules. While the ingredients are optimal, the schedule for me is not.  I can only say there ok, I doubt I get them again.
Jarrow normally makes some good supplements.  I'm not impressed by "Bone-Up" though.  The usage of cheap magnesium oxide is not a good sign.  Generally I prefer to have individual supplements and this product has quite a few nutrients and thus it may be difficult to get the balance you wish to achieve.Nutrients (per capsule):Vitamin C - 33 mgVitamin D - 167 IUVitamin K2 - 7.5 mcgElemental Calcium - 167 mgMagnesium Oxide - 83 mgZinc - 1.6 mgCopper - 0.16 mgManganese - 0.16 mgPotassium - 16.5 mgBoron - 0.5 mgThis has the standard 2:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium but this really should be 1:1 so it is providing too much calcium in relationship to magnesium (and magnesium oxide is very poorly absorbed).Kudos to them for including the maximum amount of Potassium permitted.  Also very good is the inclusion of Vitamin K2.It's not a great product but if you are looking for something to address many of the nutrients known to be important for bone health then this is a reasonable choice.  It is neither comprehensive nor high potency (but certainly better than taking nothing).
This is a good quality calcium supplement, but be aware that it takes 6 pills to hit the quoted milligrams. And at that quantity, it's fair to question if this supplement is all that good to begin with.  As it is, this bottle is only a 20 day supply, which to me, renders it pretty useless.  Keep in mind, using a bottle here and there is pointless.  You really need to commit to using this indefinitely, and consistently, if you expect it to have any meaningful benefit on your bones.  So taking that into account, this is just far too many pills to be added to my daily intake; I take enough pills, and adding 6 more for just 1 supplement is just downright stupid.  Not to mention, it's a tad over priced for only 20 days.  Is it a good supplement? Yes. Is it practical, or even convenient?  That's a resounding No for me.  Simply not enough bang for the buck, and far too many pills for the bang its got.
I understand that this type of calcium is a good one (hydroxyapatite), but I just can't do 6 of these pills every day.  Most of us also take other supplements and that handful of pills we look at each morning just keeps getting bigger.I'm definitely fearful of getting osteoarthritis and have been taking various calcium supplements more or less regularly over the years, but I try to keep my calcium pills down to no more than 2 per day.  I feel these are good calcium pills as they contain other needed elements essential to good bone absorption, but I just keep getting stuck at the 6 per day requirement.Women, (especially women post-menopausal), need to stay ahead of deteriorating bone loss through diet, exercise and good, quality supplements.  If you can tolerate 6 pills per day of this supplement, then by all means purchase it and consume it.  You will be doing yourself a great service as the Jarrow brand is known to be top-notch.
My body and pocketbook do better with a supplement that combines supplements that work well together to produce stronger bones and overall health.  Osteoporosis runs in my family as do weird reactions to the medications prescribed for it.  This formulation contains a batch of supplements that work well together for bone health in a daily 6 capsule dose spread across two meals.The 6 capsules contain some of the SAME supplements in my multi-vitamins, this is a bit scary to me. The supplement overlap requires more research BEFORE you add this to your existing daily vitamin/supplement regimen to avoid toxicity or other negatives.Do your research and contact your health care professional to be sure this is a good thing for you.
These pills will do it.  You need to choke down six of these oversized boluses to get the recommended dosage. I usually have no problem taking pills, but these would not go down without a fight.  My doctor just suggested that I take a calcium supplement. I have taken them on and off, mostly off, for several years, without knowing what I was taking or why.  Now that I've reached the age where bone loss can be a problem, I decided to do a little research.Turns out, calcium has any number of other uses. Too little and you get muscle cramps, numbing of fingers and toes, and irregular heart rhythms, in addition to the osteoporosis and dowager's hump we all know about. And those diet cokes that I love so much are pulling the calcium right out of my bones. Yikes!  But too much and you up your risk for kidney stones, stroke and heart attack.  Plus there is a tremendous amount of controversy concerning calcium supplements.  Do you take them with Vitamin C? What about calcium versus magnesium?  What kind of calcium and from what source?  Enough already. I decided to check out natural sources and it seems much simpler just to tweak your diet a tiny bit to ensure you are getting your 1000 mgs a day.There are so many calcium rich foods, it's almost hard to avoid them. One cup of milk gives you about 1/3 of the daily requirement.  Dried herbs are loaded with it. But remember, it's only the dried varieties that have the calcium blast.  Dried savory has more than 2,000 mgs of calcium per 100 grams. Sure you aren't going to dump 100 grams of it onto your omelet, but try adding a pinch to your salad, your breakfast eggs, and that pot of soup simmering on the stove. Other dried herbs that are calcium rich include dill, basil, marjoram, thyme, oregano, poppy seed, mint, celery seed, sage, parsley and rosemary. Use them every day in whatever you are eating. Your food will taste better and your bones will be stronger.I found this chart on the internet...it shows how easy it is to find calcium rich foods. Dairy products have the biggest payload, but if you are a vegan or just don't like dairy, there are lots of other choices:Sesame Seeds--1/4 cup, 351 mg calcium.Spinach--1 cup, 245 mg.Collard Greens--1 cup, 266 mg.Tahini--two tbsps, 126 mg.Broccoli--1 cup 66 mg.Swiss Chard--1 cup 102 mg.Kale--1 cup 94 mg.Brazil Nuts--12 nuts, 90 mg.Celery--1 cup 40 mg.Almonds--23 nuts,75 mg.Papaya--One medium,73 mg.Flax Seeds--Two tablespoons,52 mg.Oranges---One medium  mg.Nonfat Yogurt--1 cup, 490 mg calciumSwiss cheese--1 oz., 270 mg calciumNavy Beans--1 cup, 130 mg calciumFortified Cereal--1 cup, 300 mg calciumFortified Orange Juice--1 cup, 300 mg calciumCanned Salmon w/bones--3 oz, 180 mgFortified Cereal--1 cup, 300 mgWaffle, fortified 1, 150 mgAnd don't forget fish: sardines, salmon, trout and herring have big doses calcium.Although Jarrow is known for excellent products and reasonable prices, I cannot recommend this product beyond 3 stars because the pills are almost painful to swallow and it's just too easy to get enough calcium from natural sources.
If you're like me and take other supplements, this is just to many to take in a day. I have a old fractured back that I need to take calcium for as I don't drink milk and I don't like to worry about how much calcium I'm eating everyday. You have to take 3 pills 2 times a day with a meal. That is another inconvenience for me as sometimes I'm not eating at home and I don't want to carry these around in my purse. I take many supplements so having to add 6 more in a day is to much for me.
I have been taking this product for a couple weeks now. The capsules are average-sized, but unfortunately 6 capsules are a single serving of 100% calcium. That means that this bottle is a mere 20-day supply.Many calcium pills are very big, like horse pills, and my current calcium tab is scored for this reason. The capsules are smaller and are not chalky tablets. However, you take many more pills.I am already getting many of the additional vitamins and minerals in my daily routine. I prefer simply taking half of a calcium tablet as an add-on to my multi-vitamin, so I won't repurchase.YMMV.
I only took this for a month. Used it instead of my regular calcium which is the cheap stuff at the grocery store.  This seemed to work fine. I didn't die or anything.  Pretty big capsules but that's normal for calcium supplements.  I think they worked just fine.  I'd take them again if the price is right- compared to whatever is on sale.
This product is OK, not fantastic, not awful.  It is about what you might expect.  It comes in a gel form and can be rubbed on.  It feels cold coming out of the tube and remains cool for perhaps a minute on your skin.  After that, there is the sensation you get from menthol, similar to if you applied a Vick's VapoRub type product.This product has that familiar "Ben Gay" scent.  It fades quickly and is nowhere as overwhelming as the standard Ben Gay line, but its there.As far as performance, it didn't seem to provide any relief to me that I noticed.  I applied it to my lower leg for muscle aches.  The cold sensation distracts you a bit, but I don't think it provides any relief or benefit.  I don't think that is unique to this product though, most topicals of this type would probably fall into that same class.Ingredients:ACTIVE:  Menthol 5%INACTIVE:  Alcohol, aminomethyl propanol, camphor, carbomer, disteareth-75 IPDI, ethylhexyl isononanoate, FD&C; blue no. 1, glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, PEG-7 caprylic/capric glycerides, polysorbate 60, and water.So it is not over-priced, and not bad, but I would not anticipate it relieving all your aches and pains either.  Personally, I'm sticking with the VapoRub.  While it has about half the menthol, it also contains camphor, which is believed to increase blood flow when used as a topical, which can reduce pain from swelling.
Bengay Cold Therapy is cool and refreshing as could be expected from a menthol based product.  I've used it several times over a week or so on hands, fingers, joints and hips.  As for pain, I find that it mitigates the pain somewhat as opposed to eliminating it.  I prefer the Bengay heat products more for actual pain relief, but no question that the Cold Therapy is cool and refreshing, and that feeling lasts; it's not just immediate upon application.
what I am really looking for is a pain relieving cream or gel that works, and that does not smell like what it is.  Bengay is the granddaddy of topical pain relief.  Which is why when I have to use a product like this I don't want my husband or anybody else to ask "what smells like Bengay?"  Because I don't want to have to answer, "me."  I am only in my mid 40s, so I don't want to advertise the fact that I am falling apart faster than I can patch things up.  I was hoping this gel would be the one, but it still has a pretty strong smell when applied.  If it really does vanish, I can't say, because I believe that nobody can smell their own stink.  I wouldn't wear this out of the house because I don't want to be that lady that walks by you in the store and you get a whiff of my Bengay and know what my deal is.As far as pain relief, yes, the cooling does take your mind off of your achy joints.  I have only used it for mild aches, so I can't vouch for anything more than that.  If I had anything more than a little stiffness in say, my back, I would back it up with some ibuprofen.
Hubby uses Bengay quite often so I gave this to him to try out.  He always puts it on in our master bathroom and I always smell the scent after he leaves the room.  This one didn't leave a lingering smell.He says it works quickly and works well.  His one complaint is that it loses effectiveness faster than the regular Bengay.
It looks and works the same as Icy Hot, which only marginally works. The tingle of menthol on your skin mentally distracts you from the pain. But the tube is a better delivery system for this than the Icy Hot tub.
This product was just ok..I have used better products that were more efficient.For a minute I couldnt really tell wether it was working or not,It takes a while to fully kick in the way you want.I thought it was going to have a light scent but the strong odor surprised me to say the least.I wouldnt say this is a bad product but I do believe that there are better products that would get the job done than this.
If your aches and pains are relieved with regular BenGay, well, this is the same. A combo BenGay/Aspercreme would be a better product.
I use a lot of topical analgesics after a car accident and a knee injury increased my pain level substantially. I tend to use "Icy Hot" which is the market leader. I was interested in trying BenGay, but quite frankly just found it did not relieve the pain as effectively as either the product made by Tylenol or the Icy Hot product. This is the primary reason to use a topical analgesic.The packaging is nice, and the scent is okay, but I likely would not buy this product again.
This product basically does the same thing for muscle soreness and joint pain ect as a cough drop does for a sore throat. It isn't prescription-level pain-killer. If you have arthritis, back pain, work-out soreness, ect, this is good for temporary relief of pain. Used it for some morning back pain and it did the job. It didn't COMPLETELY eliminate the pain, but then again, I would see a doctor for that kind of relief.The only downside is that I'm not fond of artificial colors...being absorbed into my skin.
This product gives you the relief you need, but so does the Vanishing Scent BENGAY Menthol Pain Relieving Gel.  The only major difference between Bengay Zero Degrees and the latter is that the initial application is pleasantly cold because the product is stored in the freezer.  This would be a great feature if the cooling sensation lasted.  However, in my experience, the cooling feeling disappeared almost immediately. I will be sticking with the "Vanishing Scent BENGAY Menthol Pain Relieving Gel"  I can achieve the same results and pay a lower price. The 30 seconds of "cooling" is not worth the extra money.
I haven't used either heat or cold pain relief products in the past, so I am evaluating Bengay Cold Therapy based on a couple of uses.  Happily, I am not plagued with ongoing muscle soreness or muscle aches.  I used this product twice.The first time was on a sprained finger.  I woke up one morning, and for some unknown reason, my right hand index finger was giving me pain.  That never happened before.  I applied some of the Cold Therapy to the finger and, within maybe a minute, the finger felt the effects of the cream.  So for providing immediate relief, it worked well.  The effect didn't last long, but that period of non-pain allowed me to get on with my regular activities and distract me from the finger.  Eventually, in a few days, the pain disappeared, but I attribute that more to time than to the Cold Therapy formula.The second time I used the product was for a shoulder ache.  I had been lifting some heavy boxes while clearing out the basement, and my left shoulder took a hit.  I tried the Cold Therapy once again, this time applying it all around the shoulder.  Again, within a minute or so, the shoulder began to feel better.  The soothing menthol effect lasted approximately 15 minutes, but the shoulder ache returned.  I put some more of the Cold Therapy on, and again it offered relief.  The shoulder ache, too, cleared up in a few days.Like other users who have written here about the product, I was pleased that applying it didn't leave me reeking.  There is a scent, but it disappears pretty quickly, unlike former Bengay products.  With my shoulder ache, after applying the Cold Therapy, I let it "breathe" before putting on a shirt.  When I did put on a shirt, the cream had worked its way into the skin and did not stain the shirt.My conclusion:  Bengay Cold Therapy is handy to have in the house for minor aches and pains.  It feels good, but doesn't relieve the ache much longer than 15 minutes.
This item is good for minor sore muscles.  It can't penetrate that deeply, so it's not going to help too much for deeper tissue pain.  It does have a strong menthol odor that kind of reminds me of VICKS vapor rub.  I rubbed this stuff on my shoulders and neck and it definitely hit my nostrils like vapor rub.  It was refreshing though, and not bad.  The cooling effects and smell lasts for about 30 minutes and then it all goes away.  No residue, no greasy feeling, no lingering smell - I really like that.  It provides a fast-acting blast of cold and then it's gone.  I guess in a way that's a good and bad thing.  I do wish it would last longer.  All in all, this product works for minor soft tissue aches.
My husband and I decided to try Jarrow Formulas L-Glutamine together. After a long work week we got up on a Saturday feeling rested and ready to enjoy our day. I asked if we could start the Jarrow supplement that morning and he agreed.We took the supplement on an empty stomach as the bottle recommends. We got ready for the day and a couple hours later had a simple breakfast of French toast and coffee.  (I felt the sluggishness within 45 mins of taking the supplement. But I figured with coffee and French toast I would be fine.) I felt worse after eating;  I had to lay down. I mentioned this to my husband and he said he felt the same but not as sluggish/weak as me. He reacts less to supplements and medication than I do.  For me it took most the day for the sluggishness to wear off and when it was gone, it was gone!  My husband feels if the supplement helps he can work through the sluggishness (he works outdoors all day). I decided it wasn't worth taking the supplement if I had to fight for energy when taking it.
It's hard to tell what this is doing for me. I work out 3x a week if I can and occasionally have stiffness the next day in my legs whenever I run on the treadmill.I remember that before I started taking glutamine that I felt really stiff and sore the next day. Now I don't. I'm not sure if it's these supplements or if I'm just getting stronger, or both.
I usually say as much positive as I can about supplements but this particular product, while perfectly fine for persons without bi-polar disorder, should be avoided by those individuals or anyone diagnosed with such as it may create mania.That said, Glutamine is produced in ample quantities within the body under normal circumstances; however, in situations of stress (as in dieters, sportsaholics, and anyone battling alcoholism), Jarrow's L-Glutamine capsules taken in the correct dosage can supplement and aid the formation of skeletal muscles, intestinal health, and health of the alimentary system as a whole. It is an amino acid that is especially helpful for those involved in intense exercise programs.
Jarrow Formulas L-Glutamine is packaged in the same standard capsules as several of its other products, so if you are taking more than one supplement, you'll have to keep track of which clear capsules full of white powder just got dropped on the floor or mixed up in some other way. The capsules are as easy to take as any medium-sized capsules, and they don't seem to have any side effects associated with them. If l-glutamine is something that you and your doctor think you could benefit from, this is one way to get it.
I was interested in try glutmine to enhance my immune system. I have tried lots of Jarrow's products and have been very impressed with the quality, the formulations, and the price.These are not horse pills. Some amin acid capsulse and tablets are big enough to be a meal. These are easy to take comfortably. The coating is smooth and does not stick. I had no negative side effects or stomach upset. Unfortunately, I also did not see much of a benefit. Of course it is very hard to prove that this did or did not help my immune system. I got serioulsy ill while taking these. Perhaps it would have worse without the glutamine. But this is probably one that I will not stick with.
It is always difficult to evaluate supplements, especially if you are taking several at the same time. I exercise about 5 days a week and was hoping L-Glutamine might help, either in recovery or in some other helpful way. I used it for a couple of weeks and haven't noticed any difference... either positive or negative.  I have noticed a difference with a few supplements.Jarrow Formulas L-Arginine 1000mg, 100 Tablets, for example seemed to help get the blood flowing and I noticed that on my workouts.Natures Way Standardized Horse Chestnut Extract 90 Capsulesdoes a good job of keeping blood from pooling behind my knees and in my lower legs. I can feel the difference.On a positive note, I had no negative effects from the L-Glutamine and I have generally found Jarrow products to be good, high quality. I'm viewing 3 stars as neutral. It may work for you. I'll finish out the bottle and edit this review if anything changes.
I think the jury is still out on the use of glutamine for working out. Some research says that it helps with clearing the ammonia that is generated during a workout, and thus helps to overcome muscle fatigue sooner. But that seems dependent on long term supplementation, not just an acute dose. It also seems to make more of a difference in endurance events, lasting over an hour. But a lot of research also show the lack of any observable effect due to glutamine supplementation, whether it's measuring recovery from exercise, power levels, or effect on the immune system. Having taking this L-Glutamine supplement for about 3 weeks, I honestly don't feel much difference in workout recovery or any other aspect of my life.Some references:Clin Sports Med. 1999 Jul;18(3):633-49.Facts and fallacies of purported ergogenic amino acid supplements.Williams MH.Department of Exercise Science, Physical Education, and Recreation, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, USA. mwilliam@odu.eduAlthough current research suggests that individuals involved in either high-intensity resistance or endurance exercise may have an increased need for dietary protein, the available research is either equivocal or negative relative to the ergogenic effects of supplementation with individual amino acids. Although some research suggests that the induction of hyperaminoacidemia via intravenous infusion of a balanced amino acid mixture may induce an increased muscle protein synthesis after exercise, no data support the finding that oral supplementation with amino acids, in contrast to dietary protein, as the source of amino acids is more effective. Some well-controlled studies suggest that aspartate salt supplementation may enhance endurance performance, but other studies do not, meriting additional research. Current data, including results for several well-controlled studies, indicated that supplementation with arginine, ornithine, or lysine, either separately or in combination, does not enhance the effect of exercise stimulation on either hGH or various measures of muscular strength or power in experienced weightlifters. Plasma levels of BCAA and tryptophan may play important roles in the cause of central fatigue during exercise, but the effects of BCAA or tryptophan supplementation do not seem to be effective ergogenics for endurance exercise performance, particularly when compared with carbohydrate supplementation, a more natural choice. Although glutamine supplementation may increase plasma glutamine levels, its effect on enhancement of the immune system and prevention of adverse effects of the overtraining syndrome are equivocal. Glycine, a precursor for creatine, does not seem to possess the ergogenic potential of creatine supplementation. Research with metabolic by-products of amino acid metabolism is in its infancy, and current research findings are equivocal relative to ergogenic applications. In general, physically active individuals are advised to obtain necessary amino acids through consumption of natural, high-quality protein foods.--------------------------------------------------------J Nutr. 2008 Oct;138(10):2045S-2049S.Dosing and efficacy of glutamine supplementation in human exercise and sport training.Gleeson M.School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough LE11 3TU England. m.gleeson@lboro.ac.ukSome athletes can have high intakes of l-glutamine because of their high energy and protein intakes and also because they consume protein supplements, protein hydrolysates, and free amino acids. Prolonged exercise and periods of heavy training are associated with a decrease in the plasma glutamine concentration and this has been suggested to be a potential cause of the exercise-induced immune impairment and increased susceptibility to infection in athletes. However, several recent glutamine feeding intervention studies indicate that although the plasma glutamine concentration can be kept constant during and after prolonged strenuous exercise, the glutamine supplementation does not prevent the postexercise changes in several aspects of immune function. Although glutamine is essential for lymphocyte proliferation, the plasma glutamine concentration does not fall sufficiently low after exercise to compromise the rate of proliferation. Acute intakes of glutamine of approximately 20-30 g seem to be without ill effect in healthy adult humans and no harm was reported in 1 study in which athletes consumed 28 g glutamine every day for 14 d. Doses of up to 0.65 g/kg body mass of glutamine (in solution or as a suspension) have been reported to be tolerated by patients and did not result in abnormal plasma ammonia levels. However, the suggested reasons for taking glutamine supplements (support for immune system, increased glycogen synthesis, anticatabolic effect) have received little support from well-controlled scientific studies in healthy, well-nourished humans.
I've been taking them after soccer and basketball to help with muscle recovery. I'm getting over a shoulder sprain and wanted some extra help.Lets start with the basics attritibutes:Pros:- pills are easy to swallow (not too big, capsules hold pretty well)- clearly labled (you don't have to guess like you do with some generic packaging)Cons:- they stuffed way too much cotton in there, and even after judiciously removing the cotton, some pills still have cotton attached to it.Neutral:- still haven't noticed any diffence on the days I take it versus those that I don't.
I am a big believer in vitamins, but I also happen to believe in the placebo effect and power of suggestion.  I am not going to say that these are magical vitamins.  I am also going to tell you that I am in no way biased towards Jarrow, I just happen to have received these products at a considerable discount.Over the past 4 weeks, I have been taking daily cocktails that contain the following:Jarrow - MSM 1000 1000mg - 120 TabsJarrow FORMULAS Phosphomega-3 Softgels, 60 CountJarrow Formulas L - Carnitine Tartrate 500mg, 180 CapsulesJarrow Formulas L-Glutamine 750mg, 120 CapsulesJarrow Formulas - Vinpocetine, 5 mg , 100 capsulesJarrow Formulas Pomguard 425mg, 60 TabletsAlong with my 3x week workout regimen and post-workoutEAS Myoplex Lite Nutrition Shake, Vanilla Cream, 1.9 oz. packets, Pack of 20, I've managed to feel healthier and more focused.  The vitamin cocktail has helped with my chronic knee pain due to arthritis, it helps me focus more, and has improved my memory and recovery period post-workouts (and also sped up healing processes from cuts and/or sickness).  I typically have a fairly bad memory and tend to get distracted easily.  That doesn't happen much anymore.Is all of this due to the fact that I am routinely ingesting unfamiliar, new chemicals into my body?  Or is it just the fact that I told myself I would live a better, healthier life, and this transformation happened to occur at the same time I started on this vitamin plan?  I don't know, but I will keep on doing it since it appears to be working.
This product is okie in general. Just like other supplements, it will probably take a while to have an effect. However, taking this product seems to help somehow with muscle ache. The capsules look great and taste pretty yummy. There are still rooms for improvement though.
Good jar of vitamins, this contains the amino acid, Glutamine, which can help with gastrointestinal issues and is one of the key building blocks.  I try my best to do low gluten or no gluten, as food intolerances create a lot of inflammation in the body, and Glutamine helps with gastrointestinal healing...would recommend.
With these Jarrow products I've tried out, the one thing I regularly notice is that I CAN'T notice if anything's getting any better from taking the supplement.They need to do testing to see the average time a person needs to have taken the various products for the body to begin to use it optimally.Anyways, this stuff's supposed to be great for your vision, so, being pre-diabetic, I figured it would be worth a shot, to help keep my vision in tip-top shape. Well... I haven't noticed anything to write home about.Who knows if these supplements work or if they're herb combinations that might be good for you, but aren't exactly "medicine"?
The pill is slightly on the large side (7/8 inch long), but still easy to take with a smooth streamlined shape, and didn't upset my stomach.There was no immediate improvement to my arthritis, but I won't be able to test it for a longer period of time because it has made my tinnitus worse (that is probably an idiosyncratic reaction, because on the web MSM is recommended for tinnitus).
I work out and sometimes feel stiffness in my joints, so I ordered a bottle of Jarrow's MSM. It's too early to tell if this is helping me alleviate my problems, but I think it's working.These pills are large and bitter tasting though. Take 1 a day.
In the past I've found that adding MSM to my daily supplements greatly decreased arthritis discomfort, but then couldn't find the brand I liked anymore.  I was eager to try this brand because each tablet has a high dose.  I took one tab a day for a week, but then noticed I was very bloated as though I'd eaten too much salty food.  I also didn't notice any decrease in pain which I had almost immediately before.  This was a very short trial and not very scientific, but I decided to quit the product until the swelling subsided.  It could possibly have been caused by something else.I plan to try the product again in a more controlled situation while I also keep my sodium intake from other sources low.  I'll update if I get different results.  It is worth saying though that the other brand seemed to make a difference in how I felt within a day or two and this one didn't.  It may be metabolized differently and one needs a longer period to notice any change.  Since I know MSM does help how my knees feel from my past experience, it seems worth a trial to see if it helps you.
This is a new product to me. I take several Jarrow Formulas brand of minerals and vitamins, have been pleased with them and the prices. I decided I wanted to try this to see if in fact it does help my arthritis and joint pain. I have read that it is also supposed to be beneficial in helping with allergies, skin, hair and nails, plus gastro-health. That would be great if it does all that its touted to do, but we all know that generally this is not the case. I want to take these and  see if I DO feel any better in regards to arthritis/joint pain and report back if I feel there has been a marked difference.
I took MSM for a few weeks and did not notice any benefit. However, supplements can take longer than that to be effective. While taking it I experienced some unpleasant symptoms that may or may not have been caused by the product. They improved after I stopped taking it, but that could be a coincidence.WebMD lists the following side-effects for MSM: "Upset stomach, headache, or worsening of allergy symptoms may occur." This seems odd because some people swear by MSM to lessen their allergy symptoms.The product description here on Amazon states that MSM is "an organic source of bioavailable sulfur." It's likely that I am not lacking in sulfur so that's why I did not notice a benefit.
Generally MSM is included in a 'trifecta' of supplements targeted at joint health/pain relief -- the other two supplements being glucosamine and condritin.  For me it doesn't seem like MSM does much for my joint health, with a more noticeable effect coming from glucosamine it seems.  It probably doesn't hurt to use it in the 'trifecta' combinations, but adding it on it's own here probably isn't worth it.That said since MSM's supposed use is to target mucousy membrame inflamations, it can potentially help with a whole host of issues, including snoring.  So maybe these will benefit you (or more likely, your spouse!).
This is another of the supplements from Jarrow, that helps to support a healty joint system. I am sure it works for some people to relieve joint inflamation / pain, but for me I saw no difference. *this is mainly Sulfur, so not for those who have sulfur drug allergies.
Trying this MSM for back pain and joint stiffness.  so far have not noticed any difference but only been taking a week and it will probably take longer to make a difference.  The reason I gave it a 3, is because it has calcium carbonate as an ingredient, and I'm not sure why.  I know that that type of calcium is fairly much not absorbable, and I'm wondering why they would put it in the MSM tablet.  At least there's no titanium dioxide in it, which is a plus!  It's fairly easy to take (not too huge) which is a plus.
On the positive side, it's a bottle of 120 pills to be taken 1-2 a day, so you do get a supply for many months. Unfortunately for me, these pills are to big for me to want to swallow, almost a full inch in length. i get stomach upset taking them.I was looking for relief for my wrist and knee pain but have read you can get MSM in a cream form, so that is what I will try.
I was pretty sold on MSM before I got these tablets. I have the book "The Miracle of MSM" and I've been taking MSM, starting back when I was doing a juice feast about a year ago, nearly every day and I feel it helps with inflamation in my body, it helps keep plantar fascitis at bay and helps me recover from tough workouts faster. Your results, of course, may vary.Normally, I get a one pound jar of the powder. I like it because ALL it contains is Methylsulphonylmethane (MSM) nothing else, no fillers or binders. What I usually do every day is put between 2 teaspoons to a tablespoon of the powder in a quart mason jar with a packet of Emergen-C, a dropper of liquid stevia (either plain or a flavor like valencia orange), the juice of two limes, some ice, then I fill it with water to 3/4 full, put the lid on and shake it until the MSM is disolved. This works very well for me. The powder is bitter but the sweetness of the stevia mostly counteracts that and the bitterness that is left I actually like.So I was wondering, if I were to take these capsules, other than taking not just MSM but also ingesting cellulose, calcium carbonate, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide and food grade coating, how would it compare?The capsules are big but not as big as some and they have a slippery coating, which is helpful. 1 tablet offers 1000mg of MSM. For the loose powder (I use NOW brand) 1/2 teaspoon is 1800mg. So I guess taking nine of these pills would be the same as my normal daily dose of MSM. NINE??? For some people the bitterness of the powder may cause them to choose the pill form, but nine pills? I'm not a great pill taker. So a little math here - of course prices are always in flux on Amazon but if my calculations are correct, the tablets per mg cost almost exactly twice as much. That's a little hard for me to swallow.
There are few clinical studies establishing the benefits of MSM for any of the variety of ailments for which this supplement has been recommended, primarily based on its sulfur content. However, there is some scientific and anecdotal evidence that it can be helpful to relieve knee arthritic pain and stiffness.  I personally have not been very impressed by it, but as you can see, some other reviewers have seen benefits.  My research has turned up no interactions or side effects and I experienced none myself.  My experience with Jarrow products generally has been good, so if you're inclined to try MSM, this is at least as good a brand as any.
First, these do have a very nice scent and feel and are easy on your hands, so that's a nice pro.  However, when it comes to cleaning these seem pretty average to me.  No better than other wipes I've tried.  They are a reasonable size, though I've used larger ones at a similar price. In my cleaning, they did fine on some things (sink faucets, hardware) and just OK/average on others (porcelain, walls, glass, wood, etc.).I think they might be good for tasks where you really need to dispose of the &#34;rag&#34; after use. But for other things, I still prefer a micro-fiber cloth which I can rinse and reuse.
On the upside, these things have a really nice lemony smell and they are very &#34;wet&#34;. But that's about it for me. I was surprised by all the positive reviews until I noticed that many of them are people who are posting their first and only review, which almost always suggests a biased reviewer.What don't I like?1) They're not very large and they seem fairly delicate to me, as this type of product goes.2) In an effort to make them pleasant it seems to me that they aren't very powerful, chemically speaking. They work well enough for things that aren't very tough, but I found myself using sprays on the surface to increase their strength.3) At $10 for 90, they're relatively expensive.One thing that was neither a negative or a positive for me, but you might want to be aware of, is that they are slightly &#34;soapy&#34; and I felt that after using them I needed to use wet rag or paper towel to get the slightly soapiness off.
These really are heavy duty and &#34;tub&#34; is the perfect name for them, but they leave a residue on some surfaces that I dislike. They're great for cleaning the shower and other outdoor stuff, but I don't like to use them on tables or counters because of this. I think it's just the lotion/moisturizer on them, but it makes my surfaces feel dirty.
I find I am always disappointed in these, despite finding they work pretty well.  They just don't last long enough.  They break in half, deteriorate, and otherwise fall apart way before they should, for the price.  Can't they make these stronger?
I used one of these to clean out my heavily scuffed kitchen sink. It worked well. The magic eraser, some water, and a lot of scrubbing brought out the sink's original white finish. However, by the time the sink was clean the magic eraser was pretty much completely destroyed. I wore holes through it in the places where my fingers were in contact with it. It shriveled up and disintegrated.I tried another one on our grungy bathtub. Same story. The magic eraser got the tub much cleaner, but didn't survive to be of any use again. Based on my experience with the pad wearing out while cleaning the sink, I tried cutting it in half with a pair of scissors beforehand to try and maximize the amount of scrubbing I got out of one pad. I think this might have helped a bit, but it's hard to tell for sure.These seem to work pretty well for hard-to-clean marks on hard surfaces. However, given how expensive they are and how quickly they wear out, they probably will never be the first thing I try.
After enough reviewers convinced me that this was the next best thing since sliced bread, I went out to purchase a box of these.  I followed direction, only wetting the eraser, and immediately went to work on the mold in my shower and on the shower curtain.  Lo' and behold, it worked like "magic" on the curtain.  Not so much on the tile.  I tried another spot in the bathroom, this came a bit cleaner.  Then on to the kitchen (and a new eraser, of course) and I tried to degrease the top of the range.  This is where I was totally disappointed.  I normally would use 409 spray cleaner or straight water and amonia solution with a Handi-Wipe on this hard-to-clean surface, but I gave Mr. Clean Magic Eraser a try and would never try it again on this kitchen appliance.  Not only did the grease NOT come off at all, but the eraser broke apart like it was made of sand.  I had to ditch the entire eraser.  I didn't give up, figuring that all these stellar reviews had to have come from real-life house cleaners like myself, but even after going through the Extra Strength package along with this original pack, nothing really knocked my socks off.  There were a few places where the grime came right off, like crayon on our kids' bedroom wall, scuff marks on the sides of living room play spaces, and corner crud on the sink top.  However, in the past, I've easily cleaned those surfaces with a quick spray of amonia and water along with my trusted Handi-Wipe.  At least those can be tossed in the washing machine and used a while longer than the Mr. Clean Magic Erasers.  Once they are dirty and start to disintegrate, they cannot be cleaned but have to be tossed out.  This is a great idea but needs to be perfected a bit more to really be worth the cost since they really do not last long nor do they clean everything they claim to clean.
Died in a couple of days in a wristwatch. Another reviewer had similar experience. I trust Energizer, but not sure what's up with these batteries...
So this was the first time I had a Builder's Bar.  Since I normally use stuff as a meal replacement, and this one had a lot of protein, I figured I'd be ok.  But then my strenuous morning run just convinced me I could eat this bar and get away with it.So I did.  And I thought it tasted pretty good.  It didn't really taste like Cookies and Cream to me.  I got the cream, and some sweet, but I just didn't recognize any cookie in it.  At least in the taste, the texture was more like a cookie.  Looking at it it had layers, and I'm supposing that's where all the flavors came into play, but if you bite down into all three layers at the same time, that's when you got the predominant sweet cream flavor.  And it was a big bar, so there was quite a bit of it to enjoy.The ingredients were great.  It was sweetened with beet juice and brown rice syrup.  Which aren't bad sweeteners to be in a nutrition bar.  A lot of the ingredients were organic, and pretty much everything, with the exception of some vitamins, were pronounceable.  Which is always a big thing for me as it makes me feel like I'm being healthy if I can pronounce all the ingredients.  There is 20 grams of protein in this bar, which is a lot.  It's meant to supplement an exercise diet and not be used as a snack bar.  As stated before, I think using it as a meal replacement is ok too.  Sugars were also 20 grams, which is a lot, and I wasn't as fond of that.  And there are a total of 270 calories in the bar, making it pretty high up there.I would probably eat a Builder's Bar again, but maybe only after a big run or bike ride.  It did fill me up in place of a meal, but almost too much as I didn't want lunch after having it for breakfast, which brought on being starving by supper time.  As for this flavor, I think I'd try another flavor before coming back to this one.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't what was promised either.Review  by M. Reynard 2012
[Good]Strong: This is a very strong powdered detergent.Portion Control: It's very easy to figure out how much detergent you have left compared to using anything in a bottle or full box of powdered detergent.[Bad]Strong: This detergent is very harsh for anything metallic, even stainless steel. It will tarnish your cookware, and even your silverware if you don't dry them fast enough. Depending on your dishwasher, heated dry may not be enough. I've thrown away several spoons and knives because of this issue.
This detergent cleans as well as any I have used. It leaves copper shiny, does not dull, and leaves no residue. It does not cause etching, which is a problem I had with some formulations of Cascade. The problem I have is flexibility. They claim it's cost effective compared to powders, but that's assuming you follow recommendations. But recommendations are based on typical circumstances. People with soft water (especially with water softeners) need much less detergent. These tabs are not designed to be broken into smaller pieces. So I end up using at least three times as much detergent as what I need. Although it works well, it leaves my dishes smelling like detergent. Running the dishwasher a second time with no detergent, on a rinse and dry cycle, will clear up the problem.The bottom line is that it works well, but effectively costs me three times as much as it should and makes me run the machine twice. A level teaspoon of just about any detergent will work well in my dishwasher with my water, and the only reason I've been using this one is that it prevents etching better than others. But I'm looking for something that's a better fit for my circumstances.Keep in mind that star ratings reflect how well reviewers like a product, not necessarily how good they would be in different situations. This will probably warrant five stars for many users, and if you have hard water or stubborn cleaning problems, this might be the best product for you.UPDATE: After continued use, some of my glassware is showing strong signs of etching. It's possibly unrelated to the detergent since it first became noticeable when I usedFinish Jet Dry Turbo Dry Drying Agent, which I no longer use. I'd hate to impugn the wrong product here, lest the manufacturer be blamed for the faults of another, but both products are from the same company. The only way I could be reasonably sure which may have been the culprit is to replace my glassware.
I have been taking this Jarrow supplement for more than a month.  I was primarily hoping for an improvement at work.  I work at a job that requires focus, reasoning and analytical thinking amongst other things.  Ideally these supplements would have increased my efficiency or at least sharpen my focus. We are thoroughly tracked and audited so any performance increase would be easy to spot.  However, there was no marked improvement.  So much for mental acumen/focus. It may work better on improving memory and focus on those who are experience memory loss due to aging?  But it didn't give me a boost.I will say that within 20 minutes of taking a supplement my mood does improve, but this boost wears off just as quickly.  I will continue to take in the case that these supplements take longer to kick in, after this bottles is gone, I will not purchase going forward.
Vinpocetine is used for brain health. Showing promise in treatment of stroke,vascular dementia , alzheimers and tinnitus, it is available by prescription in Europe and Japan. Caution should be used in taking this product.  If you take anything with blood thinning properties,avoid this product.  This includes prescriptions, OTCS such as aspirin and herbs including ginko, garlic or vitamin E.These capsules are eass to take and I have experienced no side effects.  On the flip side, I can't say I have noticed any benefit either.  Jarrow is a good company and produces high quality supplements you can take with confidence. However, the warnings on the bottle are insufficient. While people tend to use caution with their prescriptions, I don't think most appreciate the potential interaction of herbs, vitamins and OTCS. Altough the generic warning does caution use with "medications espeially blood thinning medications), it does not mention the blood thinning properties of vitamins,herbs and tonics.
I started this and didn't notice any difference - then I got the runs and stopped it.  Now I'm fine and I am planning to start it again but I have to send in this review now.  Sorry.  I'll update it when I've taken it for longer.  I am hoping it will help me be less absent minded and better at bridge.
Vinpocetine is a fascinating supplement that may hold promise for people with age related mental declines. But, from both a scientific perspective and my personal anecdotal perspective, there's little evidence of its efficacy.The consensus view on supplements is that there are two essential supplements and then a wide variety of situational or optional supplements. The two essential supplements are a multi-vitamin and fish oils. I do not have a multivitamin recommendation, but when it comes to fish oils, I highly recommendNordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, 1,000 mg Fish Oil, 180 Soft Gels. High quality and no fishy aftertaste. If you are vegetarian, these algae based omega three oils are quite good:Ovega - 3 Non fish Omega DHA and EPA 500mg. Fish oils are also associated with improved cognitive health.One study stated: "Although the basic science is interesting, the evidence for beneficial effect of vinpocetine on patients with dementia is inconclusive and does not support clinical use. The drug seems to have few adverse effects at the doses used in the studies."Any effect that vinpocetine had on me was not noticeable either positive or negative. Note that taking blood thinners is a counterindication.I would suggest starting with a good multivitamin and fish oils, and making sure you are exercising and eating a sensible diet. If all that is in place, then experimenting with this supplement may be appropriate. Given that it acts as a blood thinner, you might want to consult with your doctor.
I have yet to notice any effect of this product. I got it to help with tinnitus but haven't noticed any diminution of the ringing. I will continue to take the product until the bottle runs out and will update my experience then. Some have noticed improved mental acuity which I have not noticed. I give it three stars because I haven't had any negative effects and the pill is easy to swallow.
This is supposed to improve memory and focus, but I am unable to detect any difference. I work in a job that requires keeping track of many technical issues on our website. I was hoping that this would help me focus and improve mental performance. I have not seen any.There's only 5mg of vinpocetine in each capsule (take 1 a day).
I have only been using this for a month. I have had no side effects at all, nor have I yet noticed any improvements in memory function or concentration. I am not an older person so may not be the target audience for this supplement. Because this is not approved by the FDA, there is a certain uneasiness I have and I will not repurchase. The bottle I received had a very different looking label than the blue one pictured here. My memory is a little lax but I am healthy and feel I will consult with my doctor if I want to take anything similar in the future.
After taking this for a few weeks, I can't say it's totally worked for me but I can't say it hasn't either. But, I can say, at under 10 bucks a bottle (as of this writing) - I think it's a reasonable price for a person to try and see if it will work for them. There are times I do feel more clear headed (I often have so many ideas I can't concentrate on just one) and days I feel more energetic, but it doesn't seem to be consistent. So, I can't rave about this product, but I can't quite complain either!
It's tricky rating products such as this. Jarrow is a trusted brand. But consumers must research and decide for themselves if the evidence is sufficient that a supplement is safe.But I am confused about the source of this product.  Vinpocetine, according to Examine dot com: "is a compound derived via the Vincamine compound from Periwinkle plants, which have been used since medieval times for the treatment of headaches.""The active compound, vinpocetine, is known as a neurological protecting agent. It is able to increase blood flow to the brain while simultaneously decreasing blood viscosity. When in the brain it; increases brain activity, provides anti-oxidant protection, protects against stroke, and increases glucose consumption by neurons."It also inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 1, which leads to some systemic benefits such as increased energy, urinary tract protection, and increased learning (in the neurologically compromised)."Yet the manufacturer's product description above says:"Voacanga africana is a small tropical tree with yellow or white flowers. The bark and seeds of the tree contain iboga alkaloids and have been used in Western Africa as a poison, stimulant, aphrodisiac and psychedelic."Perhaps the chemical is the same, just derived from different plant sources.I can't vouch for this source, but you can read more about it inVinpocetine: Revitalize Your Brain With Periwinkle Extract (Health Learning Handbook).
I've been taking this Jarrow Vinpocetine for about a month and I can't tell if this has any effects on me.  What I do know is that it doesn't make me feel any worse when I take it, I can't tell if it has any positive effects though nobody has made any comments to me about what a dynamo I've been lately.  I've tried following the recommended dosage and also I've tried taking half the recommended dosage.So, unless I run my own official controlled clinical trial to see the benefits for me - I probably won't purchase this again.  I do consider Jarrow to be a high quality brand and at $9 per bottle this is certainly worth a try - different things work for different people.  For my personal situation I rate 3-stars overall in consideration of price/value.
I ordered this product and then found out that I am unable to use it. So this review is not a bad one for the manufacturer or the product. After ordering it I found out that I cannot take it because I have had kidney cancer and only have one kidney. Any asprin products or blood thinners or NSAIDs are not allowed if you have any kind of kidney failure. I was disappointed however because I really wanted to try the product as I like the fact that it has no wheat,gluten,soy,dairy,egg,fish or shellfish,and no nut products of any kind in it. It is purely natural with just vinpocetine as the main active ingredient in a gel cap with cellulose and magnesium stearate as a vegetable source. I was looking for something to improve my memory and mood and I hoped this would be good for me. I am SURE it works well for others but if you have any kind of renal problems you cannot take Vinpocetine as it will interfere with you kidney function. As always consult your doctor before using any supplements or consult well known websites for product information on supplements.
Perhaps it is there, but after taking Jarrow's easy-to-swallow Vinpocetine capsules for a few weeks, I've not noticed any difference in cognitive function and &#34;mental energy&#34;. It may be working, but not to a level where it is noticeable. I'm certainly not impaired by taking it, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt. For those with specific issues that Vinpocetine is supposed to address, it may be worth taking it. For others though, I suggest you save your money.~ Kort
I am in college (at 45) and need every last brain cell to be working at its peak.I take Straterra for ADD, and it works really well.  I don't take it every day--just on school days and studying days.When I took this on the Straterra days, I got the most RAGING headache.  I thought it was just this product, but when I took it on non-Straterra days, I had no headache.  I actually (for the good of the Amazon consumers) took it repeatedly to be sure it wasn't other factors--coffee, food, water intake--but the one constant factor was the combination of Straterra and the Vinpocetine (I take my job as a Vine reviewer seriously...triggered headaches on purpose LOL)Did it clear my thinking?  Make my brain work faster?  Nope.  Maybe it was because it can't compete with the Straterra (maybe I'm getting all benefit I can get already).  But even on the non-Straterra days I didn't notice any improvement.  I took this for 3 weeks before I finally gave it up...So, maybe if you're not already taking something that affects your brain, it will work better for you--but if you're already taking something like Straterra, you might not find that you care for the combination.
Reviewing a pill from a non-science background is like a non-gearhead reviewing a fuel additive for a sports car in that you wouldn't know if the increased fuel efficiency is due to the additive or your driving habits, or maybe you lost weight, or maybe you didn't have a strong headwind on the days you tried the additive.  Either way, quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of a pill designed to increase mental capacity isn't as easy as "take pill, observe results."As a person with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) I thought trying Jarrow's vinpocetine was worth trying as I have trouble staying focused at work due to stress both professional and personal.  To attempt to be scientific about it, I took the pill twice a day over the course of two months and record my moods during those times and then analyze the feedback at the end of the two-month trial.To be honest, I do not notice a difference worth talking about.  Day 1 I noticed a difference in that I was calmer but I also had a minimally stressful day at work whereas Day 2 I was in a "homicidal" mood due to unique conditions at work.  This trend seem to become exactly that as I was more prone to a different mindset by the conditions of the work day rather than taking a pill.  If the pill was taking effect, it wasn't noticeable.  The placebo effect is very prominent whether we acknowledge it or not so I have to air on the side of skepticism on just how effective this pill is, especially since this chemical formula has been around since the 1970s.All in all, if you wanna try it go for it, but it didn't seem to work for me. I will continue trying it for a few more weeks to see if there are any changes but I doubt there will be.
Each time I took a capsule with dinner I went to sleep without tossing and turning but had bad dreams that I remembered. Most times I do not remember my dreams good or bad. At first I thought it was due to upsetting current events, but childhood issues that kept popping up. So I'll say it does activate the brain cells and neural transmitters and may be great for some people. After the effects of a 5 mg/day dose, I'm not about to progress to the 30 mg/day and 40 mg/day dosages studied for maximal beneficial results OR continue taking these!Vinopocetine is used in Europe, Japan, Korea, China, and elsewhere. The research studies have shown improved memory/alertness, age-related hearing, visual and heart conditions, reducing metal toxicity. Starting dosage with meals at 10 mg/day then working up to 30 mg/day over a couple of weeks or more will minimize tummy upset or diarrhea. This is something you must be sure NOT be on any blood thinners or aspirin, be sure to consult your medical professional.For me this is a psycho-active supplement, I prefer to do without...TWO STARSUPDATE: Taking this with lunch does keep the afternoon slump at bay. With breakfast you do get a burst of alertness. I've bumped the rating up to THREE STARS but will not take this with dinner again and risk the bad dreams saga.
Jarrow Formulas Vinpocetine, 100 Capsulesis a quality supplement from Jarrow.  It is supposed to aid brain metabolism by increasing the synthesis of ATP and improving oxygen utilization.  It is relatively economical compared to other supplements.  Like many Jarrow products, this one comes in gelatin capsules, though they are smaller than average in size.The RDA is one capsule at a time up to 2 times per day to be taken with a meal.  With 100 capsules in the bottle, that's a 1 and 1/2 to 3 months supply.  I am in my 3rd week of using the product at one capsule per day.I did not experience stomach discomfort while taking these alone after meals as directed.  But I did experience some bad stomach problems when mixing this with several other supplements I generally take after meals, namely the Jarrow MagMind and the Citicoline.  After that, I have taken this one separately.  I also noticed that I did tend to experience more headaches than usual over the past few weeks.  But because they always came several hours after taking this product, I can't be sure this was the cause.My personal experience taking this product seems inconclusive.  I have experienced no noticeable benefit from taking this.  I cannot refute the advertised benefits of taking this product.  But my results do not directly support the claims.CONCLUSIONThis is a quality product.  I can't verify the positive effects that have been advertised, but your mileage may vary.  If you are looking for an affordable way to incorporate this supplement into your diet, this is still worth trying.Enjoy.
Pros:- easy to swallow- capsules as opposed to tabletsCons- I've been paying close attention this month to see if it was working, but I haven't noticed any improvements.As with all types of &#34;vitamins&#34; your mileage may vary. It might work better for those older (I'm in my 30s) but I'll continue taking this and will update if I notice anything.
Ok, I am forking out wads of cash to our local 4 year institution & want the most bang for my buck as far as I'm able to help my kids get the most out of their classes. As i think they are half asleep in most of them I want the little that actually "registers" in their brains to "stick"!So when I read this in their description (see below) when researching it, I just had to give it a try:"Of special interest, not only to the elderly but also to students, is that vinpocetine increases neurotransmitter concentrations critical for learning/memory formation, recall, focus and mood.* Vinpocetine selectively improves blood flow in arteries and capillaries in the head and neck areas.* Blood flow, glucose availability and oxygen utilization are also improved in the eyes and the structures important for hearing.*"I am again perplexed at the need to add fillers like cellulose & magnesium stearate to all the supplements! I couldn't find anyone that didn't do this!So far so good, the dose is only 1 a day so I can make sure they take it before they leave for classes. I'll update if I see any improvements, but it's only been a little while & nothing to note one way or another yet..
If I saw all the warnings on the label I would never have ordered it.  This is something only use if your doctor recommends it.That said, the problem with evaluating most supplements is that they have no noticable effects.  This is one of those.  What it claims to do is very difficult to measure.  Therefore, I once again say that only use this if your doctor recommends it.  I have tried other Jarrow supplements and the ones that have a measurable effect have all worked well.  So if your doctor recommends this Jarrow is a good brand for supplements.Safety WarningNOTE: If you have a medical condition, are pregnant, lactating, trying to conceive, under the age of 18, or taking medications (especially blood-thinning medications), consult your health care practitioner before using this product
I've been taking this product for 4 weeks, and I cannot tell a difference yet.  My mood and attention level are the same as they were before.  On the flip side, I haven't had any negative side effects from the product either.  I'll finish taking the rest of the bottle until it's empty, but unless something dramatically changes between then and now, I won't be buying it in the future.
My three stars are only indicative of the fact that I did not notice personal benefits.  This might be a 5 star supplement to someone else.I wonder if it matters where the source of mental decline comes from.  For example, in myself, I am in menopause and that is causing memory issues, brain fog, etc.  But it is related to hormones.  It would make sense in that case that it wouldn't help me.  But other people may be having a mental decline due to other issues and it may help them.I did not notice any negative effects.
these are pretty spongy and not very good.  they taste like coffee and not like caramel.  they have a grainy texture and do not break down well as you chew them so they do not really taste like food, more like taffy.  the brownies are divine and these are a disappointment.
First, I have to admit this is the first coconut oil product I've tried.  I expected a more creamy texture that could be easily scooped from the jar.  Instead it's very thick and hard, and trying to scoop it just breaks off chunks rather than spoonfuls.  This is even worse if it's refrigerated.Despite that, I do enjoy the very mild coconut flavor.  My favorite way of using it is to replace butter on toasted bread or bagels.  It melts quickly on hot toast, though if I fail to get the toast out fast enough, I can also zap it for a few seconds in the microwave to finish melting the chunks sitting on my toast.  My husband has enjoyed it on his toast, as well, though he doesn't eat toast as often as I do.The price is much better than some brands, so I will buy more of the Jarrow Formulas Coconut Oil when this tub is gone.
I intended to use this product as a moisturizer after reading how it works wonders.  From flip flops & walking barefoot, my feet were in need of some serious help.  I've been using it for about a week - putting it on at night under socks - and am impressed.  The rough skin is already noticeably softer.  I've heard some people use it as a full body moisturizer, but I'm not sure how that would work since it's still an oil even though it's in solid form.  It leaves my skin feeling the same as if I had just applied baby oil and doesn't fully absorb into the skin, so I'm worried about it getting on clothes, sheets, furniture...I also used it to make popcorn. It has a strong coconut smell when you open the lid.  I used about a tablespoon of oil and 1/2 cup of popcorn, which made a giant bowl of popped popcorn. I could taste the coconut flavor, it was subtle, but still noticeable. That's fine for popcorn or recipes that are supposed to taste like coconut, but I wouldn't use it as a replacement for other types of oil in recipes.The packaging says to refrigerate after opening, which I did, but it hardened the oil - I couldn't take out spoonfuls, just sort of scraped the top.  The color also changed.
As a general practice I believe supplements for infants are not the best idea...That being said if your pediatrician has recommended supplement I strongly recommend researching before buying.  While this product is &#34; Gluten-free, lactose-free and free of artificial sweeteners&#34; there still are things that I'm unsure about.  My granddaughter seems to not mind the taste of this product (though to me it smell &#34;off&#34;).
My baby wouldn't take these even mixed in formula so I tried and gross. I've since spoken to my pediatrician who told me if the baby is drinking formula as recommended that he is already getting all the vitamins he needs and the extra is simply unnecessary.I'd advise taking to your child's doctor before giving any vitamins because mine says they are usually just not needed.
My wife doesn't like giving my baby any sort of supplements, however, as our baby is weight is under the 5 percentile. We are pretty worried about her growth and the pediatrician recommended having supplements to go with her diet.We were glad that our baby did not make too much fuss taking in the mix of supplement with her food and will continue using till she gains more weight and starts taking more whole foods.
I immediately found the taste to be worse than the popular candy bars.  And no wonder after I looked at the ingredients: corn syrup, corn maltodextrin, sugar, corn oil, sodium and calcium caseinates, soy protein isolate, artificial flavor, etc.  Those are the first ingredients.It may be possible to get one's nutrition this way, but the taste isn't for me.
This product is OK I guess, but it doesn't really work well for me.It provides a decent amount and balance of good things for the body. I would prefer something with higher protein content though myself.Taste is OK, but not great. I've tried similar products that taste better - and they look more visually appealing too.The amazon price of about $14 for 14 oz if you buy one or $22 for two 14 oz containers is a little high if you ask me. You have to use a lot of it when mixing up a recommended serving.I don't plan on becoming a regular user of this product, but it might be worth it for older people (like 70+) who need some help getting proper nutrition.
I want to like this product more, however, to give some sort of flavor (more than blended cardboard) I had to add more than the recommend scoops per serving, which has me thinking it is more like 4-5 servings per can versus the 7 that it says.  So for the price it feels expensive because you have to use so much each time.  However, it does fill me up and has been a great energy boost when I have replaced for a meal.
I drink Ensure occasionally as I'm always nauseous and cannot eat.  This powdered shake has the same great taste as the bottles.  However I will stick with the bottles.  I found it difficult to mix the powder even thought I followed the directions.  Also, it takes so much powder to make an 8oz drink, that there are only a few servings per canister.  Overall the cost is about the same as the bottles when it is on sale.
This shake mix would probably be just the thing for someone who follows a gluten-free diet or is lactose intolerant. I'm not sure how many other nutrition shakes are available for folks with those special diet needs, but this one fits that bill precisely. As for my family, which has neither of those needs, we find that the pre-made shakes that come in the six-packs taste much better. I used Ensure shakes for extra nutrition when I felt exhausted and weak after the births of my kids, and I found them yummy and convenient as well as a great source of nutrients I believe my body was crying out for. I also have used them as between-meal snacks for my super-skinny kids when they were going through periods of not wanting to sit still long enough to eat a decent meal. For those purposes as well as a quick meal replacement when time is short, I will still buy the pre-made Ensure shakes (in the deliciously rich chocolate flavor!) This mix dilutes in water, which gave me pause as soon as I read it. It has a wonderful vanilla smell and taste, but since it's mixed with water, it has a watery taste and texture. Plus, I have to filter it to get undiluted lumps of the powder out of the shake before I drink it. It's best if the water is very cold, and it might be better if made in a blender with crushed ice, but I haven't gotten around to trying that yet. So, in sum, I will say that this is an option for those seeking a gluten- and lactose-free nutritional supplement shake, but, at least as far as flavor goes, the pre-made shakes that come in cans taste much, much better.
My mother in law recently had tongue surgery because of tongue cancer.  Because of the surgery, she cannot eat solid food and has to rely on heavily pureed and liquid nutrition.  We got her Ensure as the hospital recommended it.  She was able to drink this without problems, and enjoyed the sweet flavor.  This helped her get the nutrition she needed and the necessarily calories as she was losing weight rapidly due to the diet change.While she enjoyed Ensure, she didn't like how the primary ingredients are corn syrup, corn maltodextrin, and sugar.  Later ingredients include corn oil, sodium & calcium caseinates, soy protein isolate, and artificial flavoring.  The canned form isn't much better.  With sugar as it's primary ingredient, she isn't terribly thrilled to know that she was essentially switching to a &#34;hummingbird diet&#34; to maintain weight.That aside, that's personal preference based on her knowledge about corn syrup.  The nutrition shake really helps her get all those calories and vitamins she needs while she's recovering.  She prefers the cans over the powder because they're ready to go and because the powder doesn't yield as much as it seems.  This again is preference - so if you're looking to have a quick meal substitute that's lightweight and easy to mix, this would be for you.
This has is a great nutritional supplemental drink. I did not love the taste nor did I hate it others in the house did love it. Beyond individual taste preferences we agree it is really helpful in getting our recommended vitamins and minerals a great balanced nutritional drink and its filling great for those mornings on the go as well.
I wasn't overly impressed with this product. I didn't find it satisfied my hunger. While the taste wasn't horrible by any means, it also wasn't something I looked forward to drinking. I think one or two other reviewers commented that it was difficult to mix. I found this to be true as well. If I were to use this product, I'd find it easier to just buy the liquid version. But I don't like it enough to spend the money on it.I did like it better when I mixed it in a blender with milk and some bananas or peanut butter to make something of a protein shake. However, if I am going to go through the trouble of doing this, the taste better be excellent and not just &#34;okay&#34;. Also, it already has 250 calories, so if you add milk or other ingredients, the calorie count becomes a bit high. I have found others that I think taste better and mix better.So I don't like the way it tastes just mixed with milk, but if I make a shake out of it in a blender with milk and/or other ingredients, the calorie count is too high. If I am going to use it in this way (in a blender with other ingredients), there are protein powders that not only taste better, but provide fewer calories and more nutrients, and much better flavor. So for me, this product just doesn't meet my needs.Overall, I guess it is a matter of personal taste and preference. I found the taste just &#34;okay&#34; and found it difficult to mix. Personally, I won't use this product again, but there is nothing wrong with it where I would tell someone not to buy it. If you want to try it, I'd recommend getting a small package to see how you like it. I have not tried other flavors. Again, this product is just &#34;okay&#34; and does not meet my needs for satisfying hunger, tasting good, and being easy to make.
As other reviewers will attest, the powder form of ensure is no where near as palatable as the bottled.  However, I have found that if you use a blender to mix, and add the powder slowly, it does improve on the taste and consistency.  Better still if mixed with skim or 2 percent milk in place of water.  If you want to keep this on hand for a just in case type of situation, it's more than serviceable.  If you want the taste and smoothness of the original bottled, pass this by.  We will keep it on hand for emergency use, but stick with liquid for daily, regular consumption.
Although not the scorned High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), this item does contain corn syrup products. If you are avoiding them, this product isn't for you. I like this product because this one can if dry ingredients is easier than carrying the 7 cans of Ensure it makes. This is a great alternative for a snack especially when stuck at my desk meeting deadlines. I'd keep this in my desk or in my pantry for those times when I'm in a pinch.
Ensure has honestly been the most well-known supplement drink on the market. But when I had tried to find that that they had a drink mix without already prepared where you have to mix it yourself, I was skeptical to see if it was just as good as the ones you get already mixed. The answer is absolutely no. The Enure Powder Nutrition Shake is easy to prep, but it doesn't come up as liquified as is the already prepped bottles. Not only that but the drink mix will clump up and not taste right with water. It is a fine idea, but sadly the feeling doesn't work for its money. Not to mention there could've been more servings per package than just 7. I would definitely go for the prepared shakes from Ensure than trying to make it on your own.Price: C-Taste: C+Overall: C
This is a fairly good product overall, providing several vitamins and minerals in addition to 9 grams of protein per serving. The label suggests this vanilla flavored powder be mixed with water, but it also lets you know you can add some chocolate syrup to boost the flavor. Without added syrup, the taste is rather bland; with the chocolate, it tastes better (assuming you are a chocolate fan) but isn't as good as chocolate milk. You can use milk, although it is not mentioned on the label, but the powder doesn't dissolve as well.The main problem I have with this product is that it this 14 oz. container only gives you 7 servings (1/2 cup per serving), so it is only a week's worth of product. I personally don't feel the price is reasonable for only one week's worth of product.
How do you review a herb. You just take it and hope its doing some good.
I have to smile while reviewing this as to the name "Holy" clearly due to it's revered nature, and long history in alternative medicine. I just wondered if it would sell as readily had it been called "Pagan" Basil or "Satanic" Basil, but I digress.This is a clearly subjective review, for me I noticed little or no effect from this homeopathic supplement, except some occasional "flowery" reflux.That's not to say for one second that I discount "alternate" supplements, or remedies (don't we all take vitamins?)I did however read recently that the much fancied Ginko Biloba has now been proven to have zero benefit to mental ability or warding off dementia in the elderly as was once thought to be a benefit, so I always remain a little skeptical about natural remedies.However, there is a lot to be said for natural products, although one must realize that what works in nature, may not always benefit 21st century lifestyles.I'm also a firm believer in the subjective belief in these products. How many times have we heard stories about people who have given up on recognized modern medicine only to be cured, or comforted by alternate and homeopathic treatments?Over simplifying maybe, but if you BELIEVE it's working, chances are it probably will, in some way or other.Be mindful of allergic reactions (always a necessity with plant based supplements) but by all means give it a try.I only gave it 3 stars as for me it did nothing really, maybe I'm too skeptical, I don't know.At a little of 35cents a tablet, it seems a little pricey, but then again, prescription medication is not exactly cheap.
According the box Holy Basil is supposed to 'uplift, calm and balance'. Sounded good to me, but I also noted the caution "As with any dietary or herbal supplement, you should advise your health care practitioner of the use of this product."OK, so I didn't ask my doctor, I just took two capsules (as suggested on the package) in the middle of my evening meal. Within 15 minutes I felt 'spacey' or some might say 'high'. I currently do not take any other prescription drugs and/or supplements, nor had I had any alcohol. The sensation lasted for a few hours, accompanied by a burning sensation in my stomach. I felt tired too, but it was evening time so that may or may not have been associated with the Holy Basil.My take on this supplement is that it does act as a mood elevator, but if combined with alcohol (a depressant), you may get a different effect, as you may if already taking anti-depressants or anti-anxiety drugs by prescription.  There are no warnings about this on the box.  There is only the 'caution' and recommendation to advise your health care professional.NOTE: If you are taking other mood altering prescription drugs be sure to call your doctor first and ask if it's OK.  I think you could have big problems mixing some prescriptions with this supplement.I'd suggest if you are trying Holy Basil for the first time, take 1... NOT 2... and see how it goes. You may find that over time 1 is enough to gain the desired affect. I have found that my system is fairly sensitive to any medications and/or supplements that affect mood, and often feel 'altered' by them in a way that would impair my driving. Again, no warning to that effect on this product, but something to consider.This supplement should not be given to kids! I know there are those who would dispute this, but please, if you're considering it, contact a pediatrician and ask them about if it's good for YOUR child. Age, weight, overall health (mental and physical) issues all should be considered when taking any supplements.In all honesty I will probably not continue taking Holy Basil. New Chapter makes excellent products and this is no exception, but I did not find the sensation 'uplifting or calming' in the least, so I'll keep looking for what works for me.
After taking this product for a week, I'm not sure I can tell what, if anything it is doing for me.  Hence, my neutral review.
Never really noticed a difference in my stress levels or increased feelings of relaxation. Tried doubling the dose near the end and still noticed no effects.
I'm a huge fan of New Chapter's health supplements and take their vitamins every day, as well as the zyflamend for inflamed joints.I followed the instructions and took two pills in the middle of a meal, and have bee doing so for two weeks now. I can't tell for sure that this supplement is causing it, but I feel slightly jittery, yet more tired than usual, and I have had heartburn for the last week which is very unusual for me.I'm going to try this stuff for one more week and see if there's any positive benefit, but I'm thinking this supplement is just probably not agreeing with me. It could be something else, but my diet and lifestyle have been fairly static otherwise.I'm giving this a neutral review because I can't tell for sure that my odd symptoms are caused by this, nor can I feel any positive benefit. I'm usually pretty responsive to supplements, but I'm just not feeling anything different with this one, sadly. I'll update the review if another week changes my mind.
I believe supplements work. I take a number of other supplements regularly, and try to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, and was looking forward to trying out this Holy Basil. Unfortunately, after taking them as directed on the package for 30 days, I noticed no effects -good or bad- at all. Sometimes that happens. I have yet to find something that works the same for everybody, and they seem to work well for others here, but I can only comment on my own experience. For what it's worth, as I mentioned above I also did not experience any negative effects either, such as bad taste or indigestion from the capsules and found them easy to swallow. Herbal supplements can sometimes be hit and miss, and though these didn't work for me, I am hesitant to rate this product at anything less than neutral, because I do believe they do work for others.
I have noticed time and time again that the herbal remedies and homeopathics that calm many people and help them relax; do not work very well on all people.Although, I think that Bach Flower Essences (especially Rescue Remedy) work on everyone who tries them (with no side effects) ... Calm Drops, for example, and other homeopathics work great on me, but don't work at all on some people.It is important to point out that all of these work best on people with no serious pre-existing conditions.  Most herbals and homeopathics tend to calm the average person very well when they are experiencing stress, but they are not a cure for bi-polar or serious depression, etc... Although, I really think that Rescue Remedy may calm anyone to some degree because of the way it works.I wish I could say that Holy Basil worked really well on me but I can't.  I have been taking two at once at different times, as needed for a few weeks, and only once did I notice a calming.  So I cannot give them more than 2 stars.  At least they don't have any negative side effects at all.  As you look for something that works for you, remember that the natural remedies generally do not have harmful side effects.  You do need to watch out not to take them at the same time as other mood altering medications, but generally will not harm the average person in any way.[December 2013 Update:I notice from the new comments on this review that people who take Holy Basil daily notice more improvement.  If I ever try Holy Basil again, I will try that.]Back to the Original Review:When I gave my dad haloperidol (a pharmaceutical), he experienced excessive drooling for weeks.  And I mean EXCESSIVE.  It was disgusting.  And haloperidol (as strong as it was) did NOT calm my dad down!!  Only Natural Remedies worked on my dad with Alzheimer's.IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFO FOR YOUWhatever brand of supplements you get, always remember that any company that makes anything with dL-alpha Tocpheryl Vitamin E could be making all their vitamins synthetically, and the human body does not utilize synthetic vitamins. They don't help anything. Just remember that supplements sold by Health Food Stores are probably made from actual food sources, and supplements sold in Pharmacies and Drug Stores and by questionable websites are probably made synthetically.  The Vitamin Shoppe (stores and site) is my favorite because of their rewards program.  Every January I get around $50 to $100 worth of free stuff, after saving tons of money on quality products all year.Also remember:  Large companies that make products from chemicals have a lot to lose if people start using products made from food sources that are IN-expensive have NO Harmful Side Effects and Really Work Very Well!!  So, reps from those companies often post reviews with a lot of untrue information. When you see a radically negative review on a Natural Remedy made by a Good company, always check that reviewers' other reviews to see if they write reviews regularly. You can usually tell if they had an actual experience with the product or not.I have been studying natural remedies since I was about 19 in 1979, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that nearly any health condition can be totally improved with a simple change of diet and/or natural supplements, herbs, and other natural remedies.  And these natural remedies have absolutely no harmful side effects 99% of the time.  I have had several successes with it myself, seen dramatic improvements for others, and have heard many reliable stories over the past few decades.In up to 8 years of medical school, doctors get only 25 hours of nutritional education.  This is still true today, even though nutrition is vitally important to preventing some serious health issues, and alleviating others. For example the ONLY cure for Candida is entirely diet and natural remedies. And the only Real cure for diabetes is the same.In addition to their lack of education in these matters, doctors are sometimes bombarded by pharmaceutical representatives to sell their pills (no matter how many negative side effects they may have). They even offer doctors big vacations if they meet a certain quota.  And then nutritional remedies, which absolutely do work (with no harmful side effects) are put down by the media, while pharmaceutical pills get free advertising. This is getting better, but still occurs.Do a Google search for...doctors get 25 hours of nutritional educationanddoctors get vacations for selling pills
I was drinking Organic Holy Basil tea & loved it.  I haven't had it in a while & thought I would try this out.  I know Holy Basil is supposed to be very good for ones health.  This claims it helps to calm.  I haven't noticed myself feeling any calmer & I have trouble remembering to take 3 a day.  One with each meal.  I really enjoyed drinking the tea & I think it might be more beneficial than the soft gels & a more natural way to enjoy the benefits of Holy Basil.I love that NewChapter has Organic supplements & find that they have superior products on the market.  I'm just not sure that this had any benefit for me personally & I will not take it in the future only because it seems wasted on me.I think it is worth trying & seeing if it works for you.  If it doesn't, you might want to try the tea!  I love Tulsi Green Tea with Holy Basil.  It's a great blend.  They also make straight Holy Basil tea.Lastly, if you don't care for the Holy Basil by NewChapter, don't give up on them for your supplement needs.  They are very good & worth considering for other supplements such as multi's, woman's & men's formulas, prenatal - etc. & Organic!
I've been taking these Holy Basil softgels for a while now and I'd be hard pressed to say that I've noticed any difference. Certainly not enough for me to warrant buying them again or recommending them. But everyone reacts differently and what may be effective for you might not be so for me.I even stopped taking them after two weeks and did not notice any drop in mood or other issues that might indicate they were working for me or not. I started taking them again several days ago and again noticed no change. To be fair, I'm normally light spirited anyway, and reached spiritual enlightenment years ago. ;) Seriously, I don't have any of the "aliments" Holy Basil is said to effect, at least not ones that are easily measured.This herbal supplement comes well packaged and appears to be a quality product no matter what it's final effect is or isn't. The softgels smell nice and feel good in the mouth, easily swallowed. I did notice slightly more indigestion during the time I was taking it, but can't pin that on the supplement. But other reviewers mentioned it too so it is worth mentioning.These pills are a bit pricey, so with no noticeable benefit, I will not be getting a re-fill.
How do you review a herb or vitamin? You just take it and hope it does some good.
New Chapter Supercritical Antioxidants claim to increase cell-productive activity by a factor of 800%.  They also claim to dramatically elevate human detoxification enzyme systems.  Do they?  I really don't know.  All that I do know is that just a little bit of research on the Internet shows that antioxidant supplements, while potentially helpful, can be just as potentially harmful.I personally have no problem with people who take supplements.  In fact, I've taken vitamins for a very long time and have felt their effects on my body.I have yet to feel anything from these antioxidants.  That doesn't mean that they do not work, but the work that they do is not very obvious in my eyes.In the end, it's all up to the individual.  If these softgels make you feel better or you believe that they do, go ahead and take them.  Otherwise, stick to the Flintstones vitamins.
I first want to say that I am very cautious about the supplements that I take, and prefer to know that they are safe and likely to perform as stated. I check the ratings on everything at Consumer Labs and look for the CL seal whenever possible. Unfortunately, they do not review all available supplements on the market and this was one of those not included. However, New Chapter has a good reputation, therefore I thought I would give these a try.Does this group of antioxidants perform? Based on my own use, I can only say that I did not physically notice any significant advantage to taking them over a period of a few weeks. I recently had my cholesterol checked and it is still as high as ever, so that was certainly not effected. It's very hard to determine whether or not a product truly changes anything for the positive without testing various levels in the blood, so I'm not sure that I would find out any true "evidence" without going further to test for other medical conditions. Therefore, I can only go by my perception of it's effectiveness. Based on this alone, I did not see (or feel) anything miraculous.The combination of ingredients New Chapter has used seems like an excellent choice.  I have read articles about each ingredient and they are all reported to have positive effects. Unfortunately, I can't say that I felt any better while taking them. That said, what I feel and what might actually be happening to prevent disease are two different things. It's possible that they are performing "behind the scenes" to make me healthier but since I don't notice a big difference from day to day, I probably will not continue them unless I eventually experience something noticeable before I finish the bottle.If you have a medical condition that is reported to be helped by one of the listed ingredients I would suggest some blood work, then repeat after giving them a try to see if there has been any improvement. You may not feel any different, as I have experienced, so having a baseline would be helpful.
So far my experience with these supplements has been fine. I will have to continue to take them for a longer amount of time, but so far everything has been pretty good.
I've been taking this everyday, I'm not really sure what this is suppose to do but buyer beware this is the most foul smelling capsule. When I first opened the bottle I thought I was going to faint and the taste of it is not better. It's a nice gel capsule so easy to swallow. I know the brand is great, just not sure about this particular antioxidant is for me.
Well 1st off I bought this item used but it was completely like new the box was still shiny even but the sensor had to be adjusted alot to pick up the signal.  Sometimes u have to wet the sensors with either your sweat or lick your fingers and rub it on the sensor to pick it up better so that s pretty ghetto.
I used this brush for a few days, but it feels like torture. I'm sure some people love them, my son likes them. I gave them a go because he likes them, but I do not. I like the really really soft bristles on the Oral B...or a hand held one I just got from Vine by oral B for "mature mouths" or something to that effect. I now use that handheld one in place of my electric Oral B - with or without floss action. Anyway, you can go with my review and avoid this brush if you have sensitive gums (and I'm a flosser) or go with my son, who has always preferred this style of brush over the others. That's why I gave it in the middle stars...it's going to be a matter of preference on these.
These brush heads come in a three count package and each one is individually sealed. I have tried several different Oral-B brush heads and I like these the least. They make my teeth feel clean but they hurt. I think it's the floss action part of the brush head that is too rough. It can't be good for your teeth and it even makes my gums sore. Each brush head seems to last a couple of months for me. I wouldn't get them again.
I bought this for my car.  Because I sometimes eat in my car and without a table, accidents happen. It works better than nothing. It can't get all stains out, but it does lessen the appearance (the drip from a taco comes to mind).I did once use stain wipes which worked better, but this is easier to not lose. I've kept it in the car forever. With the heat getting up past 120 degrees in there, I was sure it would dry out; but when I needed it, it was still there and ready.
When I first used the Fusion, I thought this was the greatest shave I've ever had.  It actually felt like the blades had taken off a layer of skin.  Not to the point of pain, but a feeling I've never had before.  Clearly the 5 blade system offers something others don't.Then came the realization that the shave went downhill after the 3rd use.  The lube strip was virtually gone and I didn't get the great shave I had the first time I used it.3 shaves and I can tell a difference.  Are you kidding me?  No my beard isn't rough or super thick.  But I'm not going to swap blades out every 3 or 5 days just for that great feeling of the 1st and 2nd shave.  I've tried all the tricks to keep the blades in good condition and can not keep them sharp past a week.
I'm always amazed at how helpful the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin is on my severe osteo arthritis and Move Free is no exception.  It works great.  The problem is it always gives me at least a mild case of diarrhea.  I've tried many different formulations with the same result so it must be the glucosamine and/or the chondroitin itself rather than the binders. Per the package the Chondroitin Sulfate in this product is derived from bovine and porcine sources and it also contains shellfish.  I took two pills per day with a meal as they suggest (alternately they prescribe one tablet twice a day also with a meal).  To sum up this product works but, at least for some, there are side effects.
I've taken Glucosamne and Condroitin supplements for years with good success.  (Generally with MSN)This didn't really help me and pain returned to a variety of levels.However, my understanding of this type of product it that it takes up to 12-weeks to make a difference... SO I'm not sure this 20 day trial (40 count/2x daily) was enough to genuinely measure the impact.  So I'm giving the product 3-stars.Still I wouldn't have predicted a noticeable drop-off in relief.  That's my experience but hopefully your's will be different.  Back to the old stuff for me...
I have tried glucosamine & chondroitin in the past and it didn't help me.A few years ago, I found a supplement that actually worked for me; its ingredients, glucosamine, chondroitin,  hyaluronic acid, plus a few others, are similar to the Move Free Advanced Triple Strength formulation. Trigosamine has been difficult to find on store shelves for about 1 1/2 years now. So I've been looking for a replacement. I don't think this formulation of Move Free will replace Trigosamine for me. So far, Move Free Adv. Triple Strength has not  relieved my knee stiffness & discomfort.Move Free Advanced claims to  "start  comforting sore joints in less than 7 days".  My knee stiffness has not improved in that time, but the chronic swelling in my pointer finger has gone down. I recall that Trigosamine claimed to be effective in a month or less, but I didn't see improvement in my knee for 5 months after I began using it. So it's possible that if I use  Move Free Advanced for a few more months, I might see improvement.By the way, it's  inconclusive as to whether hyaluronic acid can be absorbed orally. It is effective when injected. Trigosamine Max contains 30 mg of hyaluronic acid compared to Move Free Advanced which has 3.3 mg. I  don't know what ingredient in Trigosamine Max helped me...maybe the combination worked. If I decide to continue using Move Free Advanced, I'll update my review with the results.For best results take 2 tablets at once with a meal, or one tablet twice a day with meals.I want to add that I'm glad that Vitamin D  has not been added to this formulation. I feel that too many supplements are adding Vit. D which could possibly cause someone to ingest way too much & cause serious problems.
I'm a firm believer that when it comes to products like Glucosamine and Chondroitin that you have to try them yourself to see if they work.I mean that we are all different.  Our bodies metabolize and utilize chemicals different, plus those of us with joint pain don't all have it for the same reasons.  So keep that in mind when I report that after a month I could not say that there was any improvement.  I had good days. I had bad days. There weren't fewer bad days towards the end of my experiment, so I can't report improvement.As for the tablets, they are a little large.  I don't have problems swallowing large tabs, but I know some people do.  I had no problem with their dissolving in my mouth so they are pressed hard enough and have enough of a coating that that isn't a problem.What I did have trouble with was stomach upset.  I took MOVE FREE in the past and never noted this problem before.  It was decided now however, even when taken with meals.  (note: I do have problems with acid reflux. So your experience may be totally different)CONCLUSIONThese are large white tabs that should be easy to take.  I'm not going to continue taking them because I saw no effects.
I used to teach English in Japan and one of my students worked for a nutritional supplement company. She told me that they had done research into Glucosamine and chondroitin and that the former does not help with joint health, but the latter does. That could mean that only the Chondroitin in this product is helpful or that the research her company conducted was wrong. That being said, there have been numerous studies saying Glucosamine is unlikely to help with joint problems. My guess is that it will continue to be marketed as long as the buying public is familiar with its reputation as a potential supplement for those who suffer with joint pain.My problems are mainly with my knees, but I know that you can't expect instant results from supplements even if they are effective. They work like exercise works on muscles - slowly and over time, they will improve. And since my knee pain is variable based on weather, activity levels, and probably the moon phases (that's my way of saying it's very unpredictable), I cannot reasonably comment on the efficacy of this product for assisting with joint issues. Taking any supplement is a matter of faith on the part of the user. Obviously, I do believe the Chondroitin will help as will the Hyaluronic Acid.I can speak to the value and usability of these. Though the package says these are some of the smallest supplements of this type available, I still had problems swallowing them. I may have a narrow windpipe, but it is worth noting that this may be an issue for some people. I do like that you can take both tablets at once rather than have to take them at two separate times, particularly because they have to be taken with meals and I tend to forget to take them with lunch and dislike taking any supplements in the morning.In terms of value, you're best off buying an 80-count bottle since they are 21 cents a tablet and the cheapest way to get them. That being said, Costco's Kirkland brand of the same general type of supplement is only about 12 cents per supplement. However, the Kirkland supplement does not appear to include Hyaluronic Acid (which acts a a cushion and lubricant in joints). You can get a cheaper supplement, though it would not include all of the components of this one.
As a Vine product, I have a limited amount of time to review this product. One thing I do not like is that it has to be taken with food for best assimilation. That's not the company's fault...just how the ingredients work. Otherwise, I cannot tell yet whether or not the product works. I will revisit this in a month.
My wife and I take Glucosamine and Chondroitin for joint health as we use to do competitive sports.We have no issues with this product that has the additional Hyadluronic acid which is also supposed to help in joint health,  but are not totally convinced that it is any different from the regular joint supplements.Overall, its quite an ok product but is not very easy to swallow due to its fairly large size and recommended dosage of 2 tablets daily.
I know glucosamine and chondroitin works for many. It has not done so for me in the past. I was hoping with this advanced triple strength Move Free, it would make a difference and it does not.These capsules are relatively easy to take. The dosage is 2 a day, all at once or separately. There are 40 tablets in the bottle, so this is a 20 day supply. Most of the bottles that are more expensive have more tablets in them.This bottle does continue what is one of my complaints regarding the pharmaceutical industry - their over packaging. The pills in this bottle would only need a bottle half this size. Hopefully the purpose is not to deceive the consumer that they are getting more than they are. It is a waste of packaging though.
Despite its name, this ThinkThin peanut butter bar not the healthiest snack. It's 240 calories, and it contains a good chunk of the recommended daily value for fat (9g), as well as sodium (300mg). It also doesn't have a lot of fiber (only 1g). On the plus side, it does have 20g of protein, a decent amount.The taste of the bar is somewhat mild, but it definitely has that delicious creamy peanut butter smell. It has a thin coating of chocolate and a dense (but chewy) peanut butter center. Overall, it is very dense, filling, and satisfying. I definitely enjoyed eating it.If you're looking for a decent (or gluten-free) candy bar, then this ThinkThin bar is worth a try. If you're looking for a healthy snack, you may want to look elsewhere.
This is a decent protein product but, to my taste, pretty standard.  The pluses are that it is filling and provides great protein.  It does not have the cardboard taste that some of these bars have but I would get it strictly for the nutritional value.
I have eaten many protein bars.Trying to lose weight over the years. My favorite are Cliff bars. This bar had very little taste. So it didn't taste bad or good. I ate half the bar and let my sister have a piece and my daughter. They all ate it and said the same thing no taste. The bars are very smooth and soft. You could eat this if you had no teeth:} There is a slight taste of powdery peanut butter, but it really wasn't bad or good.
I don't know if this product delivers the essential amounts of protein it promises since I only was given one to try. But I can attest to its flavor. It was waxy and bordering on unpleasant and I would not buy these based on taste. When I ate it I was starving so if I was to be biased in any direction it would have been in favor yet even hunger could only do so much to aid it, plus I love peanut butter and I am not picky about how I get it. Of course usually the worse these things taste then usually the more efficient protein delivery vehicles they are. But again I only ate one so this is mere speculation.
When it comes to high protein snack bars for me the most important thing is the texture and mouth feel.  I'm willing to give up some of the taste for the sake of it being healthy for me, but I have to be able to stomach it to begin with. With thethinkThin Creamy Peanut Butter BarsI was hopeful that I would like them because it didn't look like the usual bar; but then I tried a bite. Many of the bars I've had are firm and chewy which is fine with me, but this bar was very soft and crumbly. I suppose to have it be "creamy" peanut butter making it firm wouldn't be right, but the minute I bit into this bar and began to chew it literally crumbled into this grainy peanut flavored mush. I actually had a hard time swallowing the bite, but not to give up I took three more and with each it was the same result. If the texture hadn't turned me off so much I might have enjoyed the flavor more, but after finishing it there was also the prominent soy aftertaste that is common in these bars.  Since I had close to half a bar left I asked a few other family members to give it a taste and the results were mixed.  One liked the flavor and texture, while the other didn't care for the flavor, but was okay with the texture.Overall I've found in trial and error that these protein snack bars are definitely an acquired taste and that can be different from person to person. So although this bar wasn't something that I would purchase, it may be the right bar for you.  What I would recommend is to get an assortment of single bars at your local grocer or health store and try them out before investing in a whole box.
This product is not one I would purchase again.  There are too many other peanut Butter bars on the market that I enjoy much more.  This one is rather flat and not a good chew....so I will not be thinking "thinkthin Creamy Peanut Butter Gluten Free' when I want a quick snack or on the go meal.  My bar came from Amazon and no fault to Amazon the bar is not one I like....you can purchase at Amazon if you really want to try it after this review.thinkThin Creamy Peanut Butter, Gluten Free, 2.1-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)
I'm a big fan of peanut butter. One of my favorite flavors. I was a bit disappointed in this bar. The peanut flavor is a bit weak. To be honest, I ate the bar without looking at the package and didn't realize it was supposed to be peanut flavored. I know I've had other energy/protein bars in the past with a stronger peanut flavor. Overall, the taste and texture aren't bad, but I was expecting more from a bar that advertised itself as "creamy peanut."
I like that Think Thin makes many flavors for their gluten free high protein bars. This bar tastes okay. I was hoping for a peanut butter cup taste as other people had described. I didn't get that taste. The one thing I do not like is the chemical aftertaste I get. But, I know this is what all bars of this type taste like. The bars are also really sweet. It takes me about 45 minutes to finish eating one. I have to wash it down with coffee or water. But all the bars are really sweet. I wish they were more natural in ingredients.  I probably won't buy them again unless they are on sale. I will stick to more natural protein snacks (nuts, meat, etc.) even if they are not as convenient.
I'm always on the go and looking for a quick snack that I can take with me.  I love Larabar's Uberbars and 22Days Bars, but I just recently tried the thinkThin Creamy Peanut Butter bar and thought it was okay.  I found it a bit bland compared to other bars I've tried.  Although I love that this has 0sugar, is gluten free, and has 20g protein, I do think the other bars have a better taste to them.However, if you're looking for another bar to give your on-the-go snacks a bit of variety, I would recommend this one by thinkThin. Just not my favorite.
The best way to summarize this product is going through the ingredient list. You'll see:- Protein blend (why, soy and others combined, including casein)- coating (malitol and a bit of cocoa and many others)- glycerin- maltitol again (sugar alcohol, look it up in wikipedia for more info)- peanuts- water- cocoa butterWhat my point? In ingredient lists they appear in order of quantity present. This bar has barely any peanuts, it's mostly the protein isolate with some alcohol based sweeteners and some peanuts at some point way down the list. Basically it tastes very similar to a lot of chewy protein bars, regardless of flavor. I was expecting a peanut butter flavor, and while it does have a hint of peanut butter, it is mostly other stuff so the flavor is barely there.I am giving it 3 stars, because it doesn't use high fructose corn syrup and is gluten free for those who are allergic or prefer not to eat it. It also has 20g of protein and does fill you up, but overall I am disappointed with the generic flavor of the bar.In short:Pros:- no high fructose corn syrup (or other similar ones)- gluten free- 20g protein- fillingCons:- Barely any peanut butter flavor.- Barely any peanuts in it (not just flavor but actual peanuts are not used much compared to other ingredients)- enough "natural flavors" that make you wonder what exactly is being added to it.
We've tried lots of protein bars over the years. I'm not crazy about them but they're good in a pinch to have in the office drawer or backpack when you need something or have to delay a meal. But most are universally just ok and this one was no exception. No sugar. 20g of protein. But also has that sandy texture (perhaps more than most) and a funny aftertaste (must be the no sugar). There are better options. My ultimate test is whether I would buy this flavor/product again and I have to say that I wouldn't. Other products may not have as much protein, but they are certainly more pleasurable to eat.
The thinkThin Creamy Peanut Butter and the thinkThin Chunky Peanut Butter bars are very similar.  To their credit, they have no sugar, but they do have a high calorie count, 240 for each bar.  One third of the calories are from fat. The 240 calories does qualify them as an energy bar, but not as a snack bar.  If you are engaged in vigorous exercise, the 240 calories is ok.  However, I think that this is too much for a snack.The bars include a paste-like center covered with a layer of chocolate.  Virtually all the flavor comes from the chocolate.  I confirmed this by cutting off the coating to try the inside alone.  The chunky version has some small nut inclusions, but is otherwise identical. The bars are edible but not really appealing.
The initial taste of the creamy peanut butter Think Thin is very peanut buttery is very tasty but the aftertaste ruins it a little bit, tasting a bit artificial and very unnatural and not a taste I really wanted to stick with me after eating.  I did eat a bar in the morning in lieu of breakfast and it did keep me full until lunch on a day I even mowed the lawn in between meals.  I just wished the initial taste lasted longer than what I was left with.
ThinkThin Creamy peanut butter bar has zero sugar and 20 grams of protein.  It is also good that it is gluten free.  However, it tastes very bland and has funny after taste.  (Kind of like a diet soda.) The outer coating of thin dark chocolate is tasty but the rest of the bar was not.  The texture is also strange it is a cross between a dense cake and a dry shortcake but without the flavor.It may be healthy but it also tastes that way -bland, strange (but not unpleasant) texture and lack of flavor make it a little hard to get down.
For a gluten free protein bar, this is decent.  It's not too sweet and is very filling.  I'm not nuts about this particular flavor since it's really not very peanut buttery and what 'crunch' there was came from soy crisps not actual peanuts--which one would expect from a bar labeled 'chunky' peanut butter. Also there was a slightly bitter protein powdery aftertaste.Still, I'll probably try another flavor since it's hard to beat 20g of protein in an 80 calories gluten free bar.
I was really excited to try this. I am trying to move to being Gluten Free.  Having a snack to be able to turn to that is easy and tasty would be a great help. This bar isn't it.  The inside of the bar looks a lot like nuget but without much taste at all.  I get that the point of the bar is to just fill you up without zero sugar and lots of protein but it just isn't very filling.Im going to pass on this one in the future. Im glad I got a free sample to try because I would be truly disappointed if I had bought this.
If one is interested in meal replacement and wants a good balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates with no sugar--this may be the bar for you.  I have to ask does the human body really need a densely packed protein bar with 20g of protein?  That aside, my husband and I both tried the bar.  At first it tasted okay but the longer we worked on it, the worse it tasted. It was a like a soggy granola bar.  I know their intentions are good for this protein bar, but the taste would have to improve before I purchase them.
As a new Type II Diabetic, I wanted to find a good nutrition bar so I decided to try the Chunky Peanut Butter, Gluten Free bar. Using a knife, I cut off 1 1/2 inches of the bar to try. I liked the flavor, it was subtle and did taste like a peanut butter bar coated with chocolate. A lot of nutrition bars require water to drink because they are so dry but this one didn't.There are 20 grams of fiber in the bar which is excellent but the sodium level of 240 grams is very high for nutrition bar and not good for people watching sodium of course.On front of the package, it says that it is sugar free. If you turn the package over it says that it has 11 grams of sugar alcohol! That alarmed me so I searched for information on sugar alcohol. One source which tells what diabetics can eat regularly, sometimes and rarely declared that sugar alcohol is ok as long as you don't have more than 5 grams at a time, then you have to be careful. Then I went to another source, a well-respected medical site and it said diabetics should try to avoid sugar alcohol. So this bar is not for me. My husband is not a diabetic so it would be OK for him occasionally.  I will still be hunting for a better bar for myself.
I often rely on eating protein bars as a meal.  I'm not a big, fancy breakfast eater, I just need to eat something.  One of my usual faves are Zone bars, but I eat many others.  I've seen these think thin bars, but never tried it.  It is one of the more pricey bars.  It is gluten-free, and has 0% sugars, which is the only reason to have to eat these bars.  The taste for this chunky peanut butter left a lot to be desired.  It was very dry, and had a chalky texture inside.  It does have 11g of sugar alcohol, so it's not 100% sugar-free.  It does have 20g of protein, which if you want that high protein count, maybe you would want to eat it.  It also has 240 calories, which is a bit high, I would prefer something at 200 calories or a bit under.  If you do have to eat this bar, have some milk or similar with it to get it down.
I guess I'm one of those mutants... you know, the ones who don't hate the flavor and texture of the thinkThin Chunky Peanut Butter Bar Protein Bars.The texture is like a a drier, denser Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, but with a lot less chocolate.  Reminds me of Carnation's Breakfast bars before they made them chewy and gross.  And the flavor is peanuty, just dialed back.  As I stated at the start, I don't hate 'em.My gripe isn't with the flavor nor the texture, my gripe is with the calories.  While a Payday candy bar might have just half the protein of this thinkThin bar, it has the SAME amount of calories, less sodium, more dietary fiber... and way more flavor.Hey, I don't HATE the flavor, I didn't say I loved it!With 240 calories, I could see half of one of these bars as a snack.  But, I'd rather have half of a Payday.
thinkThin Chunky Peanut Butter bar is a handy tasty way to grab a snack without compromising your nutrition.  It is not a bad size, easy to toss in your pocket or gym bag, and fills you up.  There are hundreds of "protein bars" out there to choose from, so why choose this one?  For starters, its gluten free.  And it contains no sugars or artificial sweeteners.  And it tastes OK.  The bigger question might be why choose a bar at all, when there is plenty of "real" food out there?  The reality is that it is time consuming to shop for, prepare, and eat nutritious snacks on the run.  And if you work out, you need more protein than if you are sedentary.  To gain perspective, think of other ways you could get 20 grams of protein:  80 grams tuna, 5 egg whites, 184 grams of yogurt, 105 grams lean beef, 179 grams cottage cheese, 313 grams chick peas, 2 tbsp peanut butter.  Fish, chicken, beef, dairy, and tofu are all high in protein.  Unfortunately, most of these do not come conveniently wrapped in a little foil packet to eat on the go.Is it necessary to eat your protein on the run?  Must it be eaten immediately after working out?  Probably not.  It would be best if your routine meals contained all the protein you need and no little quickie bars or snacks were even needed.  These types of bars should be considered "last resort".  For busy people, there isn't always the 3-meal-a-day option.  If you are watching your weight, or are attempting to build muscle, a bar such as this one would be preferable to a big spoonful of peanut butter because of the fat and calorie content.  Assuming a person needs to fill in their diet with a bar once or twice a week, the thinkThin bars will give you what you need without giving you what you don't.But how do they taste?  Well, they do lose a star here.  Not bad, but no cravings will be inspired by these.  The texture is a bit chalky, and the flavor, while peanut-butter-like, is a bit bitter.  Best eaten with a large glass of water to wash it down.  Not too different from most protein bars, you gotta get it off your tongue.  There are lots of gluten free options on the market, and this one is in the middle taste wise.If used appropriately, the thinkThin bar is not a bad little snack.  If you are looking for a weight loss program and think these bars will fill in for a meal and help you, do more research first.  According to the company, "thinkThin supports a broad premise of weight wellness - the optimal weight range where people feel at their most healthy and joyful. Weight wellness is the positive emotional outcome of living a healthy, balanced life with a strong belief in good energy, long life and warm laughter. " They do highlight weight management in the promotional material.  And while they talk about being happy and not obsessing over our weight, they put the word "THIN" right in the name.  The name and promotion of this product is where they lost another star.  It appears to be a lot of talk about health and wellness, and actually pretty well backed up with the content of the product.  Right idea, wrong sideways step in promotion.  The bars are worth a try, there's a good chance you will like the taste, just don't be fooled by all that talk of "thin".
I am reviewing two flavors; White Chocolate 4, and Crunchy Peanut Butter 2.5 - Hence the split the difference 3 which, if I could would be a 3.5.I was delighted to see ThinkThin bars as a Vine offering. This is a woman-owned company, and, in the protein bar market, a pretty healthy option - 20 grams of protein, gluten and sugar free, Kosher, and the bars contain no GMO ingredients. Last year I bought several 15 bar boxes of Chocolate Espresso flavor ThinkThin Protein Bars at our local Grocery Outlet store because I liked them so much.The White Chocolate is very nice. I prefer Chocolate Espresso but the white chocolate coating is decadent and the dark colored filling is nice. The soy crisps are cocoa flavored and look like chocolate chips. It has a moist cakey texture. Quite nice, although there is a slight aftertaste of soya it does not detract too much from the flavor. These bars are surprisingly filling and leave me with energy to go on for hours. I rate this flavor a 4.The ingredients as listed on the White Chocolate ThinkThin Protein Bar are: Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolate, Soy Protein Isolate, Calcium Caseinate, Casein), Coating (Maltitol, Cocoa Butter, Milk Fat, Sodium Caseinate, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors, Tocopherols), Glycerin, Maltitol, Almonds, Water, Cocoa Soy Crisps (Soy Protein Isolate, Alkakized Cocoa, Tapioca Starch), Canola Oil, Alkalized Cocoa, Soy Lecithin, Chocolate, Sea Salt, Natural Flavors, Chicory Fiber.The Crunchy Peanut Butter, however, is not to my taste. It is filling and it does not taste bad, but I detected an aftertaste, soy-y maybe - and the texture is too dry and crumbly, so that the mouth-feel does nothing for me. I would avoid this flavor in the future. I rate it a 2.5Ingredients listed on the Crunchy Peanut Butter package are:Protein Blend(Whey Protein Isolate, Soy Protein Isolate, Calcium Caseinate, Casein) Glycern, Coating (Maltitol, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Sodium Caseinate, Milkfat, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors, Salt) Maltitol, Peanuts, Soy Crisps, (Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Salt) Water, Peanut Oil, Canola Oil,Natural Flavors, Soy Lecithin, Sea Salt.http://thinkproducts.com/products/faq/#questionFour
This starts off delicious...it tastes very much like a famous chocolate covered peanut butter cup candy...then it goes downhill very quickly. The texture and consistency are all good, initial flavor quite yummy...but the harsh after taste ruined it. Now, having said that, I gave the other half to the spouse who didn't notice so it may be an individual type thing which is why I gave it three starts. He thought it still tasted like that famous cup of candy...me, not so much after the first bite.
I have tried many protein bars and whilt thinkThin tastes better than many in comparison it was still bland with that whey/protein shake aftertaste.  It's not pleasant, none really are.  I was hungry after I ate it so I wish it had fewer calories, it's not going to work as a meal replacement for me.
Chocolate and peanut butter make a great combination, and there is nothing wrong with this bar, but it's unclear why it's named "thinkThin" and why the product page calls it "a guilt-free treat", because with 240 calories and almost no fiber, it is hardly a diet food.For a meal replacer, one would expect more than one gram of fiber.  Yes, there are 20 grams of protein, but that's matched byClif Bar Builder's Bar, Chocolate Peanut Butter, 2.4-Ounce Bars, 12 Count, which has only thirty more calories and 4 grams of fiber, and probably other products, too.Finally, it is dairy, which makes it a rule-out for vegans and may be a concern, even though it is marked kosher, for anyone who keeps kosher.
I thought that this bar was just ok. I have to say that it reallys looks like something wonderful and smells really really good, but for me the taste was not there. I did not think it had the flavor I wanter out of this bar. I thought there would be a lot of peanut butter in this bar since it says chunky I was wrong. It was not great and it was not bad thats why only three stars. It just was not for me.
I took this protein bar along with me as a substitute dinner meal when I went golfing. I don't think it tasted too bad, especially when compared to some other bars of the same caliber. The only problem I had was that the bar is covered with milk chocolate, so this didn't sit well in my pocket because of the heat. As you might expect, it was kind of messy to eat, even though I unwrapped and ate it indoors. Don't buy these if you plan on carrying then outdoors.The bar did me well keeping me from having hunger pangs during my round, although it didn't help my golf game any.  8-) There was not a very strong peanut butter taste, which was somewhat of a disappointment, as I'm a big peanut butter fan.Bottom line: This protein bar is just okay. I won't go out of my way to purchase them, but will stick with a snack that won't melt before I open it.
Nice crunchy flavor, good protein content, and it does have sugar alcohol in it to benefit diabetics.It does have a chalky taste that coats the tongue that tends to last well after the bar is finished. The chocolate taste is a bit waxy but not to the point of taxing horrible.  Certainly not The best flavor out there but if its the only bar on the shelf I guess it's better than nothing.
These are not the tastiest convenience bars, but I don't think they need to be. I keep a stash at work, just in case I can't get out of the office to eat or if the hunger pains come calling. They do satisfy the hunger, and I like that I am not trading that off for junk food.That said, not every one is going to like this. My husband won't touch them, and I just barely tolerate them - maybe 3.5 stars rather than 3 stars - but it is still better than going hungry or eating out of the vending machine.The peanut butter ones (crunchy or smooth) and the creamsiscle (orange with white coating) are the only ones that I purchases, although I've tried many others, all of which were utterly forgettable.
I believe that butterness may not actually be a word... you guys get my drift.  Where do I begin?  I guess at the very beginning when I requested this item be shipped to my home for a review.  I was expecting 15  bars but instead I received 1 lonely bar.  This did not affect my review in any way but it did hinder my posting a more thorough one because I could not see the long term effects.I stupidly tore through the wrapper and dumped it.  I say stupidly because I realized 15 minutes later that I would need that wrapper for not only my review but also to attempt to identify why I had heartburn.  Yes,  I had one of the worst cases of painful heartburn.  I have great tummy tolerance.  Eating extremely hot and spicy foods is of no consequence.  Heartburn has never been a reality for me; until the day that I ingested half of this bar.Once I tore through the wrapper, there was melted chocolate all over my fingers.  It wasn't an overly warm day.  I can only imagine delivery to warm locations throughout the country.  The plan for these bars  was for the purpose of meal replacement.  Trying to eat right and eventually introduce exercise was the plan.  The chocolate tasted great, as did the bar as a whole.  By my third bite, the peanut butter felt chalky and very grainy on my tongue.  Weird, like sandy peanut butter... or Butterfingers candy bar.  I don't particularly enjoy the Simpson's candy bar.  It was then that I realized that I felt full; sickly full...  I handed the rest to the Hubby.  He felt full with the half as well!  I felt it was great for only the first bite then began the heartburn.Flavor wise I would recommend the peanut butter if you understand that it is of a chalky and grainy quality.  For me the bar filled me half way through, so under this premise then I believe you can achieve success with your diet goals.  There are no guarantees though, as I only received one bar and I will not order any more because of the painful heartburn and finger/feet swelling because of the sodium.  Not bad just not worth it for me.
